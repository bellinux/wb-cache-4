5000|$|Lissodelphis peronii (Bernard Germain de Lacépède, 1804) - <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Delphinidae) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> has a {{circumpolar}} distribution {{running from}} about 40° to 55°. They are sighted in the Tasman Sea in particular.|$|E
50|$|III. Mealy-mouthed {{porpoise}} (Lissodelphis peronii, the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin).</b> Melville {{also calls}} this the right-whale porpoise, {{since it is}} often found {{in the vicinity of}} the right whale. According to Melville, it is found only in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|No strandings {{have been}} {{recorded}} for the northern species. There has been one recorded instance of 77 <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> stranding on Chatham Island.|$|R
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are very}} graceful and often move by leaping {{out of the}} water continuously. When they swim slowly, they expose only a small area of the head and back when they surface to breathe. Breaching, belly-flopping, side-slapping, and lob-tailing (slapping the flukes on the water surface) have been witnessed. They {{typically}} live in groups of two to 100. Some groups are more nervous than others, and swim away from boats, whereas others approach and possibly bow-ride. This tendency to bow-ride worked against them in the 19th century, as it allowed whalers to harpoon them from the bow and use them as food. <b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> are often seen in the company of hourglass dolphins.|$|R
5000|$|They share feeding grounds {{with other}} {{cetaceans}} such as sei, pilot, bottlenose and minke <b>whales</b> and <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins.</b> They are regularly seen with fin whales. Whalers who were hunting these much larger animals used hourglass dolphins as [...] "look-outs" [...] to aid {{them in their}} hunt. Hourglass dolphins are keen bow-wave riders.|$|R
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lissodelphis peronii) is a {{small and}} slender species of mammal found in cool waters of the Southern Hemisphere. The dolphin {{is one of two}} species of right whale dolphin; Lissodelphis, the other, the {{northern}} right whale dolphin, is found in deep oceans of the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> is {{included}} in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).|$|E
50|$|In {{its usual}} range the dolphin is easily identifiable. Only the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> is of {{comparable}} size and lives as far south. The right whale dolphin {{does not have}} a dorsal fin, so the two species are easily distinguished. The fin considerably varies across individuals. It is generally tall and curved, and the curve may be particularly pronounced in older animals.|$|E
25|$|Many other oceanic {{species such}} as Sperm whales, pilot whales, and several species of beaked whales {{including}} the first sightings of Shepherd's beaked whales within the nation and <b>dolphins</b> such as <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> can be found further offshore around the rich, deep sea canyon about 20km off the peninsula coast which maybe as significant as Kaikoura and rarely strand.|$|R
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> are presumably {{eaten by}} sharks and killer whales. L. peronii itself preys on an {{undetermined}} range of fish, but {{is known to}} eat crustaceans, squid, and species of myctophids. Their diet could possibly include euphausiids (krill). Little is known of their particular habits, {{and it is not}} known whether they search for their food near the surface or at greater depths.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} diet of light-mantled albatrosses {{consists of}} squid and krill, though other crustaceans and fish are taken {{as well as}} seal, penguin and petrel carrion. They sometimes feed in association with pilot <b>whales</b> and <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and occasionally follow ships. Food is usually taken on or {{close to the surface}} of the ocean, within a depth of 5 m, though there is a record of a 12 m dive.|$|R
50|$|Dusky {{dolphins}} from Argentina {{and southwest}} Africa separated 2000 generations ago from an ancestral Atlantic population and subsequently diverged without much gene flow. Most populations have low genetic diversity, with the Peruvian population being an exception. Possible hybrids of dusky dolphins {{have been described}} with a long-beaked common dolphin and a <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin.</b> There are four subspecies classified; (Lagenorhynchus obscurus obscurus), (L. o. fitroyi), (L. o. posidonia) and (L. o. superciliosis).|$|E
50|$|Many species inhabit {{specific}} latitudes, {{often in}} tropical or subtropical waters, such as Bryde's whale or Risso's dolphin. Others are {{found only in}} a specific body of water. The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> and the hourglass dolphin live only in the Southern Ocean. The narwhal and the beluga live only in the Arctic Ocean. Sowerby's beaked whale and the Clymene dolphin exist only in the Atlantic and the Pacific white-sided dolphin and the northern straight dolphin live only in the North Pacific.|$|E
50|$|Right whale {{dolphins}} are cetaceans {{belonging to}} the genus Lissodelphis. It contains the northern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis) and the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lissodelphis peronii). These cetaceans are predominantly black, white beneath, {{and one of the}} few without a dorsal fin or ridge. They are smaller members of the delphinid family, oceanic dolphins, and very slender. Despite scientists being long acquainted with the species (the Northern species was identified by Peale in 1848 and the Southern by La Cépède in 1804), little is known about them in terms of life history and behaviour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>{{dolphins}}</b> are {{the only}} dolphins without dorsal fins in the Southern Hemisphere. They are smaller than northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> and have more white on their heads and sides. They have slim, graceful bodies which are black on the upper side and white underneath. Their flippers are mainly white and are small and curved. Their flukes are small with a notch {{in the middle and}} concave trailing edges. Their beaks are small but distinct. They have between 43 and 49 teeth in each row of both jaws.|$|R
50|$|Dusky {{dolphins}} prefer cool, upwelling waters, {{as well as}} cold currents. They largely live in {{inshore waters}} {{and can be found}} up to the outer continental shelf and in similar zones in offshore islands. They can move over great distances (around 780 km), but have no well-defined seasonal migrations. However, dolphins off Argentina and New Zealand make inshore and offshore seasonal and diurnal movements. In Argentina, dusky dolphins associate closely with <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and South American sea lions. They have been found around bottlenose dolphins, but apparently do not interact with them, and may share feeding areas with Risso's dolphins. They also associate with various seabirds, such as kelp gulls, cormorants, terns, shearwaters, petrels, and albatrosses. In New Zealand, dusky dolphins mingle with common dolphins. Dusky dolphins have also been observed with <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> and pilot <b>whales</b> off southwestern Africa.|$|R
50|$|Species of {{conservation}} significance known to inhabit {{or visit the}} area include hooded plovers, fairy terns, white-bellied sea eagles, great white sharks, <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and bottlenose <b>dolphins.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} {{range of}} the species is subtropical to subantarctic oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. The range and total population have not been estimated or closely studied. Large populations are recorded off the western coasts of South America, where they are targeted by whaling operations; it is described as abundant in this region and {{off the coast of}} New Zealand. The range is associated with cold currents up the western and southern coasts of Africa, with a concentration recorded near Namibia.The species is recorded with other cetaceans such as Lagenorhynchus obscurus, the dusky dolphin, and the pilot whale Globicephala macrorhynchus.The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> travels in groups of up to 1000 individuals, 52 being the average group size. The mass stranding of L. peronii on beaches, as many as 77, have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} {{sleeper shark}} or Whitley's sleeper shark (Somniosus antarcticus) is a deepwater benthopelagic sleeper shark {{of the family}} Somniosidae found in the southern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. It is known from depths of 400 to 1,100 m. Its length is up to 4.4 m. It feeds primarily on cephalopods, especially the colossal squid, and fish; its stomach contents also less commonly contain remains of marine mammals and birds. Based on its generally sluggish nature and the speed of its prey, it {{is thought to be}} an ambush predator. A 3.6-m-long female caught off the coast of Chile had a whole <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> in its stomach. This dogfish is sometimes taken as bycatch in the orange roughy and Patagonian toothfish fisheries; whether this poses a threat to the species is currently unknown.|$|E
40|$|Order Cetacea, Suborder Odontoceti, Family Delphinidae. The {{subfamily}} Lissodelphinae {{has been}} proposed for this genus (Fraser and Purves, 1960), {{but it has not}} been universally accepted (Kasuya, 1973). There are two species in the genus: Lissodelphis peronii (<b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin)</b> and L. borealis (northern right whale dolphin). Lissodelphis peronii currently contains no subspecies...|$|E
50|$|Hanson Bay {{is a large}} bay which {{comprises}} {{almost the}} entire east coast of Chatham Island/Rekohu, the largest island in New Zealand's Chatham Islands archipelago. It is 35 km in extent, stretching from Okawa Point in the island's northeast to Manukau Point in the southeast. The bay may formerly {{have been used as}} a resting ground by <b>Southern</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Whales</b> and <b>dolphins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The area is remoted {{from any}} big towns or districts, and this led Port Craig to keep {{surrounding}} natural environment at its beauty. <b>Southern</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Whales</b> and Hector's <b>Dolphins</b> sometimes {{can be seen}} cavorting close to shores.|$|R
50|$|A {{system of}} trails allows {{visitors}} to the national park to enjoy views of the coastline and adjoining waters and to observe flora and fauna including species such as <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and <b>dolphins</b> and features such as lighthouses and heritage sites. As of 2014, there are three major walking trails - the Thomson Pfitzner Plaster Trail Hike that connects Stenhouse Bay and Inneston, the Royston Head Hike from Dolphin Beach to Royston Head and the Gym Beach Hike which connects Browns Beach and Gym Beach. A number of minor trails connect the road system to locations such as Cape Spencer, Ethel Beach, West Cape and Pondalowie Bay.|$|R
50|$|Ilhabela is {{a popular}} sailing point. Several {{regattas}} {{take place at the}} city's coast. Also, it is popular for many other watersports, including scuba and free diving. The waters around the archipelago are filled with more than 50 shipwrecks, six of them being opened for visiting via diving. Cetacean diversity is rich in the areas, and whale watchings targeting such as humpback whales, bryde's <b>whales,</b> minke <b>whales,</b> <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> orcas, and <b>dolphins</b> are also available.|$|R
5000|$|Dusky {{dolphins}} {{are popular}} attractions for whale-watching tours. Since 1997, dolphin-watching activities {{have increased in}} Patagonia, with dusky dolphins (along with Commerson's dolphins) as the target species. [...] Tourists interested in seeing dusky dolphins grew from 1,393 in 1997 to 1,840 in 2000. Encounters with dolphins increased from 25% during 1999 to 90% in 2001. Dolphin watching in this areas started {{as an alternative to}} whale watching, which was mostly based on that of the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> Dusky <b>dolphin</b> watching is also popular in New Zealand, whose dolphin-watching industry begin in the late 1980s, as a side attraction to sperm whale watching. <b>Whale</b> and <b>dolphin</b> watching tours have grown with around 75 permitted dolphin tour operators. New Zealand has several locations to view and swim with dusky dolphins, notably in Kaikoura and Marlborough Sounds.|$|R
40|$|Social {{organization}} of dolphins in extensive societies {{has not been}} well studied. Off Kaikoura, New Zealand, thousands of dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) gather, feeding nocturnally on deep scattering layer prey, resting and socializing diurnally. During 1997 - 2003, interval sampling was used to monitor large assemblages numbering hundreds (n= 169), smaller mating groups (mean+s. e. = 7 + 1. 6 adults, n= 42), mother-calf nurseries (mean+s. e. = 13 + 1. 6 adults, 1 + 0. 5 juveniles, 4 + 0. 7 calves and 1 + 0. 4 neonates, n= 41), and non-mating adult groups (mean+s. e. = 9 + 1. 3 adults, 1 + 0. 2 juvenile, n= 37). Group size, distance from shore (east), ranging along shore (north), traveling, inter-individual distance, and noisy leaping peaked in winter (n= 39), with dolphins maintaining closer proximity {{to each other in}} smaller, more restful groups, closer to shore during the spring-summer-autumn (n= 234) reproductive seasons. Dolphin groups were found closest to shore (west) during early morning, spread out and leaping often. Resting peaked at midday in tight groups. Late in the day, dolphins spread out, moving eastward (offshore) in preparation for feeding. Large groups exhibited coordinated travel, with noisy leaps as a directional signal. "Mating of the quickest" occurred in groups of (median) 6 males chasing 1 female. Leaping rarely occurred in restful nurseries, which at times associated with Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori). Other mixed-species groups included common <b>dolphins</b> (Delphinus delphis), <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lissodelphis peronii), long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala malaena), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Killer whales (Orcinus orca) elicited predator assessment and evasion. Whale riding occurred with larger whales. Residence was seasonal, with 1, 969 + 814. 9 from a population of 12, 626 dolphins spending 103 + 38. 0 days in Kaikoura (mean+s. e., mark-recapture mortality, single-season lagged-ID emigration models, n= 153 weeks). Dolphins (n= 39) summering in Kaikoura migrated to the Marlborough Sounds in winter, where small, coordinated groups foraged diurnally on schooling fishes in shallow bays, often associated with sea birds and New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri). Aquaculture may threaten dusky dolphin foraging habitat in Admiralty Bay, where an estimated 220 dolphins gathered to feed each winter. Photo-identification research, enhanced by digital techniques, demonstrated a structured fission-fusion society. Dusky dolphins associated with preferred long-term (> 1, 000 days) hunting companions in Admiralty Bay and non-random casual acquaintances (200 days) in Kaikoura (lagged-association models) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lissodelphis borealis) is a {{small and}} slender species of marine mammal found in the North Pacific Ocean. It travels in groups of up to 2000, often with other cetaceans, in deep waters of the North Pacific. The dolphin {{is one of two}} species of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin,</b> the other being found in cooler oceans of the Southern Hemisphere.|$|R
50|$|Attempts to keep <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> in aquaria {{have all}} ended in failure and death. In all cases but one, they have died within three weeks.|$|R
25|$|Many <b>whale</b> and <b>dolphin</b> {{species can}} be found in Moreton Bay {{including}} humpback <b>whales,</b> killer <b>whales,</b> <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> sperm whales, melon-headed whales, blue whales, Bryde's whales, minke <b>whales,</b> common <b>dolphins,</b> spinner dolphins and Risso's dolphins. Under Australia's EPBC Act the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is listed as endangered and the humpback whale is listed as vulnerable. Commercial tour operators offer whale watching cruises between June and September each year. Most of larger cetaceans observed in the bay are humpbacks, and several smaller dolphins live or regularly visit the bay.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{specimens}} {{and environmental}} {{data collected by}} observers monitoring Japanese squid driftnet fishing operations during the summers of 1990 and 1991 in the central North Pacific (37 °N- 46 °N, and 170 °E- 150 °W) were used to explore habitat use patterns among three small cetacean species common to that area: the Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) and northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lissodelphis borealis). Sex and maturity status were determined for 805 northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins,</b> 421 Pacific white-sided dolphins and 206 Dall’s porpoises incidentally taken in 800 observed gillnet sets, allowing sub-taxon comparisons of habitat use patterns. Habitat variables were based on observer records of sea surface temperature (SST), wind velocity and direction, and swell height. Current velocity and direction and SST gradients were also derived. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to relate the species categories to the habitat conditions recorded for the gillnet operations in which entanglements occurred. The samples collected from the southern, middle and northern latitudes within the overall study area were examined separately to account for northward movement of the fishing fleets across the summer months. SST was the most dominant and consistent feature; northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> occupied the warmest waters, Dall’s porpoises the coldest; Pacific white-sided dolphins were found in-between, but more similar to the latter. Wind velocity and swell height also reflected potentially important habitat features. Young-of-the-year northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphin</b> showed a preference for the warmest waters observed in the middle latitude band, coincident with that species summer calving mode...|$|R
5000|$|The bay {{was once}} a resting area for {{migrating}} <b>whales</b> and <b>dolphins</b> such as <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and humpback whales, and pygmy blue whales may be observed off the bay as well.|$|R
500|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{has made}} Hermanus, South Africa {{one of the}} world centers for whale watching. During the winter months (July–October), <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> come so close to the shoreline, {{visitors}} can watch whales from strategically placed hotels. The town employs a [...] "whale crier" [...] (cf. town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen. <b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> can also be watched at other winter breeding grounds.|$|R
50|$|Northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or in groups {{as large as}} 2000. The group's average number is 110 in the eastern North Pacific and 200 individuals in the western North Pacific. They often associate with Pacific white-sided dolphins.|$|R
50|$|Bryde's whales, Orcas and Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live in {{the waters}} around the island. Blue <b>whale</b> and <b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> rest in this area during migration. In 2012, {{there were reports that}} a <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> may have calved near the island.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>whale</b> and <b>dolphin</b> {{species can}} be found in Moreton Bay {{including}} humpback <b>whales,</b> killer <b>whales,</b> <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> sperm whales, melon-headed whales, blue whales, Bryde's whales, minke <b>whales,</b> common <b>dolphins,</b> spinner dolphins and Risso's dolphins. Under Australia's EPBC Act the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is listed as endangered and the humpback whale is listed as vulnerable. Commercial tour operators offer whale watching cruises between June and September each year. Most of larger cetaceans observed in the bay are humpbacks, and several smaller dolphins live or regularly visit the bay. The Moreton Bay bug (Thenus orientalis) is a species of slipper lobster found throughout the waters of Australia's north coast. The bug is a relatively expensive delicacy served in many restaurants in Queensland.|$|R
