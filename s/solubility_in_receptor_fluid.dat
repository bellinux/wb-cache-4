40|$|The {{potential}} EU {{ban on the}} use {{of animals}} in the testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients from 2009 together with the ethical reasons for avoiding tests on human beings have recently prompted the development of guidelines on in vitro alternative methods and an extensive search for novel validated in vitro permeation models. The prediction of the percutaneous absorption by means of in vitro methodologies requires good in vitro-in vivo correlation. Moreover, due to differences in the type of vehicle (conventional vehicles or particulate carriers) and in the physicochemical properties of the substance, such as its solubility, the selection of appropriate in vitro conditions is crucial. In particular, the validation of an in vitro skin penetration model appears quite difficult for highly lipophilic substances, because of their limited rate of transfer between stratum corneum and the viable epidermis, due to their low <b>solubility</b> <b>in</b> most physiological <b>receptor</b> <b>fluids.</b> This chapter focuses on comparative in vitro-in vivo skin permeation of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, a highly lipophilic UV-A absorber (log Po/w = 5. 6), methylbenzylidene camphor (log Po/w = 4. 8) a less lipophilic sunscreen agent, and glycolic acid, a hydrophilic active substance (log Po/w < 0).

40|$|The {{use of a}} prodrug, a {{conjugate}} of {{an active}} drug with a lipophilic substituent, {{is a good way}} of increasing the cutaneous absorption of a drug. However, the activity of dermal hydrolases has rarely been investigated in humans, or experimental animals. In the present study, we focused on the identification of rat dermal esterases and the hydrolysis of a prodrug during permeation across rat skin. We found that carboxylesterase (CES), especially the rat CES 1 isozyme, Hydrolase A, is expressed in rat skin and that the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acyl derivatives and caproyl-propranolol (PL) was 20 -fold lower in the 9000 g supernatant fraction of skin homogenate than in liver microsomes. A permeation study of caproyl-PL was performed in rat full-thickness and stripped skin using a flow-through diffusion cell. Caproyl-PL was easily partitioned into the stratum corneum and retained, not only in the stratum corneum, but also in viable epidermis and dermis.

PL, derived from caproyl-PL, was, however, detected <b>in</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> after extensive hydrolysis of caproyl-PL in viable skin.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{gallic acid}} (GA) has {{been incorporated into}} cotton (CO) and polyamide (PA) through two different vehicles, that is, liposomes and mixed micelles, and their respective absorption/desorption processes have been studied. Moreover, in vitro percutaneous absorption tests of different cosmetotextiles have been performed to demonstrate antioxidant penetration within the layers of the skin. When GA was embedded into the cosmetotextiles, it always promoted a reservoir effect that was much more marked than that observed for polyamide. Similar penetration was observed in the textiles treated with GA in mixed micelles or liposomes in such compartments of the skin as the stratum corneum, epidermis, and even the dermis.

40|$|Background: Topical {{antimicrobial}} preparations are {{of utmost}} importance in treating suspected and confirmed meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) infections due to the increasing incidence of widespread resistance to systemic antimicrobials. Lasalocid is active against MRSP in vitro and this may become an important topical antimicrobial {{for the treatment of}} canine pyoderma. Hypothesis/Objectives: To determine effects of various formulation types on penetration and retention of lasalocid applied to canine skin in vitro. Animals: Normal canine skin was collected from the thorax of five dogs that had been euthanized on the basis of health and/or intractable behavioural issues. Methods: Solution, lotion and ointment containing 2 % lasalocid were applied to ex vivo canine skin. Transdermal penetration was assessed for a 24 h period and retention of lasalocid was assessed {{at the conclusion of the}} study. Results: The solution had significantly higher skin retention of lasalocid and proportion of applied dose retained in skin than lotion and ointment (Tukey–Kramer Honest Significant Difference test, P < 0. 01). Lasalocid could not be detected <b>in</b> the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> of any Franz cell at any time point. Conclusions and clinical importance: Lasalocid was not identified <b>in</b> the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> of any sample, indicating that systemic absorption of the active ingredient in vivo is unlikely.

30|$|In {{comparison}} to mammal skin data, {{the skin of}} X. laevis was shown to be considerably more permeable to caffeine and testosterone. On average, 71.4  % (dorsal) to 87.5  % (ventral) of the applied dose of caffeine was found <b>in</b> the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> after 4  h. In an inter-laboratory data collection of human skin in vitro, mean measured percentages <b>in</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>fluids</b> ranged from 10.9 to 46.5  % of the applied dose after 24  h [28]. Although exposure time was 6 times higher, clearly less was absorbed through human skin compared to the skin of X. laevis. For testosterone, it was shown that on average 69.0  % (dorsal) to 84.8  % (ventral) of the applied dose was permeated across the skin of X. laevis after 8  h. The corresponding data shown by van de Sandt et al. [28] again demonstrate that after 24  h only 3.9 – 38.9  % of the applied dose of testosterone is permeated across human skin on average. For pig skin (dermatomed skin, 500 – 900  µm thick), data were found from static diffusion cell experiments, measured under conditions which are {{comparable to those of}} this study (the applied dose of caffeine and testosterone was 40  µg/cm 2, test compound vehicles were water for caffeine and ethanol for testosterone, and the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> was composed of a Ringer’s solution including 4.5  % BSA for testosterone) [29]. Mean permeability coefficients of pig skin derived from this study were 0.25  ×  10 − 4 cm/h and 0.20  ×  10 − 4 cm/h for caffeine and testosterone, respectively. Average maximum permeability coefficients of amphibian dorsal and ventral skin measured in our study were 37  ×  10 − 4 cm/h and 19  ×  10 − 4 cm/h for caffeine and testosterone, respectively. Thus, compared to pig skin, permeability of amphibian skin (X. laevis) is 148 - and 95 -fold greater to caffeine and testosterone, respectively. The magnitude of these differences between amphibian and pig skin corresponds to the results reported by Quaranta et al. [16], who directly compared amphibian (Rana esculenta) and pig skin by a similar method in vitro. Compared to pig skin permeability, they found amphibian skin permeability being 26 -, 29 -, 66 -, 120 -, and 302 -fold increased to glyphosate, paraquat, mannitol, antipyrine, and atrazine, respectively.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to the {{assessment}} of methods used in in vitro analysis of dermal permeation and absorption of caffeine. Guarantee of standard processes during an experiment {{is essential for the}} rightness of results evaluation and interpretation. First part is focused on alternatives and different transport ways of substances through the skin barrier. As transdermal drug delivery offers an increasing number of advantages, the number of studies performing transdermal experiments with drug delivery grows up. On the other hand we are also able to observe or predict the risk of intoxication of individuals after exposure to different kinds of chemicals. The standard methods assessment is of great importance to obtain reproducible results. In this thesis, caffeine was chosen as a model hydrophilic compound. Skin barrier was simulated by dermatomed pig skin of two different thicknesses from ear and abdomen.

40|$|Abstract Background The transdermal {{application}} of substances represents an elegant approach to overcome side effects related to injections or oral treatment. Due to benefits like a constant plasma level, no pain during application {{and a simple}} therapeutic regime, the optimization of formulations for transdermal drug delivery has gained interest in the last decades. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound which is nowadays often used transdermally. The objective of this work was to conduct {{a study on the}} effect of different 5 % ibuprofen containing formulations (Ibutop ® cream, Ibutop ® gel, and ibuprofen solution in phosphate buffered saline) on the in vitro -percutaneous permeation of ibuprofen through skin to emphasise the importance of the formulation on percutaneous permeation and skin reservoir. Methods The permeation experiments were conducted in Franz-type diffusion cells according to OECD guideline 428 with 2 mg/cm 2 ibuprofen formulation on each skin sample. Ibuprofen was analysed <b>in</b> the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> and extracted skin samples by UV-VIS high-performance liquid-chromatography at 238 nm. The plot of the cumulative amount of ibuprofen permeated versus time was employed to calculate the apparent permeability coefficient, the maximum flux and the lagtime, all of which were statistically analysed by One-way ANOVA. Results Although ibuprofen permeation out of the gel increases rapidly within the first four hours, the cream produced the highest ibuprofen delivery through the skin within 28 hours, followed by the solution and the gel. A significant shorter lagtime was found after gel treatment compared with the cream and the solution. After 28 hours 59 % of the applied ibuprofen was found <b>in</b> the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> of the cream treated samples, 26 % in the solution treated samples and 21 % in the samples treated with the gel. Fourfold higher ibuprofen reservoirs were found in the solution and gel treated skin samples compared to the cream treated skin samples. Conclusion The present study demonstrates the importance of the formulation on transdermal drug delivery of ibuprofen and emphasises the differences of drug storage within the skin due to the formulation. Thus, it is a mistaken assumption that formulations comprising the same drug amount are equivalent regarding skin permeability. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of topical allergy screening systems {{relies on the}} ability of test agents to effectively penetrate the stratum corneum from applied vehicles and reach the viable cells involved in the cutaneous immune response system. There is very little evidence in the dermatologic literature to justify the choice and suitability of vehicles used in many allergy test systems and the effectiveness of occlusion, reported to have variable effects on solute penetration, often employed in combination with these systems. In this study we evaluated the in vitro human epidermal penetration of a mixture of paraben ester preservatives from a commercially available test ointment and two commonly employed solvent vehicles (acetone and ethanol), together with the effect of occlusion on the rate of delivery from these systems. Parabens were applied as finite doses (5 [*]mg per cm 2) to epidermal membranes mounted in horizontal Franz-type diffusion cells. At intervals of 2 [*]h for a total of 10 [*]h the receptor phase (20 % ethanol in distilled water) was completely removed and replaced. Occlusion was effected by the placement of a piece of high density polyethylene (20 [*]μm) over the application site immediately after dosing. Concen- trations of parabens <b>in</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> and remaining <b>in</b> the epidermis {{at the end of the}} study were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There was a significant change in the epidermal flux of parabens from each of the vehicles following occlusion. Whereas increases were observed for the acetone and ethanol vehicles a decrease was seen following occlusion of the ointment formulation. Changes in flux appeared to result from a significant decrease in the epidermal partitioning of the esters following occlusion of the ointment and primarily by an increase in paraben epidermal diffusivity (estimated from changes in flux/retention) following occlusion of the solvent vehicles. These studies show that the effects of occlusion are strongly vehicle dependent, having wide implications for optimization of this technique with a range of topically applied solutes...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of toluene, trichloroethylene (TCE) and phenol on the dermal bioavailability of nickel, All four compounds are prevalent in the environment, at industrial facilities, and at hazardous waste sites. An in vitro approach was employed which utilized radiotracer methodology and a modified Teflon flow-through diffusion cell system to measure the amount of chemical which penetrated through or became bound to dermatomed male or female pig skin. In males, there was almost a 2 -fold increase in the total cumulative percentage of radioactivity <b>in</b> the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> after treatment with the mixture compared to nickel alone. In females, significantly more radioactivity (2 -fold) penetrated into <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> when skin was treated with the chemical mixture of nickel versus nickel alone. The chemical mixture produced a significant increase in the total penetration and the amount of nickel that became bound to skin relative to nickel alone in both sexes. Also, more radioactivity remained loosely adsorbed to skin and could be easily washed off of the skin surface when nickel was applied alone rather than in combination to male or female skin. However, the total penetration and the radioactivity in the skin matrix was significantly higher in females than in males treated with the nickel mixture. This study revealed that the bioavailability of nickel to skin is significantly higher when administered in the chemical mixture compared to nickel alone.

In vitro skin/membrane {{permeation}} profiling of topical pharmaceuticals is {{an important}} overall quality attribute {{in the evaluation of}} product consistency and it is also used for IVIVR (in vitro- in vivo relationship) purposes in product development and change control. Franz diffusion cell (FDC) experiments are emerging as a generally accepted methodology in this field, where the choice of operational conditions requires a data-supported justification towards the discriminating power of the test. A response function is therefore proposed to objectively quantify the discriminating power. METHODS. We evaluated the usefulness of the proposed response function by studying one of the operational conditions, i. e. the influence of receptor medium composition, on the FDC in vitro penetration behaviour of the model compound testosterone formulated in four different topical preparations, using both artificial membranes and dermatomed human skin.

The aim of the dissertation thesis was employment and validation of appropriate testing method of transdermal absorption of substances in vitro and the use of this method to obtain new findings on the influence of concentration, dissolvent and form of application, on the measure of dermal absorption {{of selected}} PAH representatives. For the testing of transdermal absorption of substances in vitro, the method using static Franz vertical diffusion cell was chosen. As an absorption membrane, full leather of rear surface of the auricle of a domestic pig was used. Content of analytes <b>in</b> samples of <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> was analyzed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC), for which a new methods was developed and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Soil cleanup {{standards}} {{and assessment of}} human health risks at contaminated sites are {{based in part on}} predicted human exposure to soil contaminants, including from direct skin contact. Available investigations of dermal absorption from soil are relatively sparse and have been conducted with a variety of different methods, many of which fail to account for important physical and chemical drivers of skin permeation. To improve understanding of the soil-dermal exposure pathway, in vitro assessments of radiolabeled benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) absorption through human epidermis were conducted. Experiments employed four test soils, which were artificially weathered and applied to epidermis at multiple BaP concentrations and exposure durations. Experiments were also conducted with unweathered soils and BaP deposited onto skin from acetone. For weathered soils, absorption was independent of soil type, the mass <b>in</b> the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> was proportional to exposure duration but independent of concentration, and the mass recovered in the skin after washing was proportional to concentration and independent of exposure time. Results from the weathered and unweathered soils were essentially similar. The findings are consistent with concentrations that exceeded the BaP sorption capacity of all soils tested, and with BaP mass in the wash skin dominated by particles that were not removed by washing. Flux into and through skin from soils were lower by an order of magnitude from acetone-deposited BaP. Potential barriers and opportunities for improving guidance for the assessment of dermal exposure from contaminated soils were also examined, as the current method is relatively simplistic and based on an experimentally-determined parameter that is susceptible to distortion by common methodological pitfalls. A practical recommendation is described that is easily implemented, empirically and theoretically supported, and represents a more health protective approach until further methodological improvements are feasible...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare extracts from two different plant sources regarding their suitability as antioxidant cosmetic ingredients. Both, Garcinia mangostana pericarp, in Europe being widely considered as the non-edible part of a 'superfruit', and Riesling grape pomace accruing from vinification, represent important by-products from food processing. Mixtures of ethanol and water in different ratios were used for the preparation of polyphenol containing extracts. Antioxidant properties of the extracts were determined using well-established in vitro assays (Folin-Ciocalteu, ORAC, DPPH, and ABTS), and skin penetration was investigated by Franz-type diffusion experiments with porcine skin. Extraction of polyphenols was most effective using an equimolar ratio of ethanol and water for both raw materials. Absolute polyphenol contents of mangosteen pericarp extract (65360. 71 +/- 1168. 51 mg/kg DM) were higher than for grape pomace extract (18085. 70 +/- 411. 50 mg/kg DM). However, Folin-Ciocalteu reducing capacities as well as in vitro antiradical activities did not adequately correspond to quantitative polyphenol estimations, as grape pomace extract showed relatively high antiradical capacities. When applied to pig skin, polyphenols from grape pomace extract were detected in low concentrations in the dermis as well as <b>in</b> the transdermal <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, mangosteen pericarp xanthones were almost completely recovered with highest amounts detected in the dermis. In conclusion, both raw materials revealed potential as antioxidant ingredients for cosmetic formulations...|$|R
40|$|Salivary glands express {{multiple}} isoforms of P 2 X and P 2 Y nucleotide <b>receptors,</b> {{but their}} <b>in</b> vivo physiological roles are unclear. P 2 receptor agonists induced salivation in an ex vivo submandibular gland preparation. The nucleotide selectivity {{sequence of the}} secretion response was BzATP ≫ ATP > ADP ≫ UTP, and removal of external Ca 2 + dramatically suppressed the initial ATP-induced fluid secretion (∼ 85 %). Together, these results suggested that P 2 X receptors are the major purinergic <b>receptor</b> subfamily involved <b>in</b> the fluid secretion process. Mice with targeted disruption of the P 2 X 7 gene were {{used to evaluate the}} role of the P 2 X 7 <b>receptor</b> <b>in</b> nucleotide-evoked <b>fluid</b> secretion. P 2 X 7 receptor protein and BzATP-activated inward cation currents were absent, and importantly, purinergic receptor agonist-stimulated salivation was suppressed by more than 70 % in submandibular glands from P 2 X 7 -null mice. Consistent with these observations, the ATP-induced increases in [Ca 2 +]i were nearly abolished in P 2 X 7 –/– submandibular acinar and duct cells. ATP appeared to also act through the P 2 X 7 receptor to inhibit muscarinic-induced fluid secretion. These results demonstrate that the ATP-sensitive P 2 X 7 <b>receptor</b> regulates <b>fluid</b> secretion <b>in</b> the mouse submandibular gland...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} leptin system in human oocyte maturation and its prognostic value for IVF outcome. The protein concentrations of leptin and soluble leptin <b>receptor</b> <b>in</b> follicular <b>fluid</b> were determined and the free leptin index (FLI) were established. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of different leptin receptor (ObR) isoforms and of PTX 3 and HAS 2 in cumulus cells were quantified, mutually compared and analysed relative to FLI, body mass index, age and number of retrieved oocytes. Expression of all target genes was detected in the cumulus cells, with relatively low concentrations of ObR-Long. Strong mutual correlations were found between mRNA expression levels of leptin receptor isoforms (P 0. 5 ng/mg protein (P< 0. 05). It is concluded that the leptin system appears {{to play a role in}} the IVF protocol, whereby signal transduction in cumulus cells occurs predominantly via the short isoforms of ObR. <br/...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} uptake of {{the model}} therapeutic agent, minoxidil, into appendages, stratum corneum (SC), and through human skin, {{under the influence of}} different vehicles. Quantitative estimation of therapeutic drug deposition into all three areas has not previously been reported. Finite doses of minoxidil (2 %, w/v) in formulations containing varying amounts of ethanol, propylene glycol (PG), and water (60 : 20 : 20, 80 : 20 : 0, and 0 : 80 : 20 by volume, respectively) were used. Minoxidil in SC (by tape stripping), appendages (by cyanoacrylate casting), and <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> was determined by liquid scintillation counting. At early times (30 [*]min, 2 [*]h), ethanol-containing formulations (60 : 20 : 20 and 80 : 20 : 0) caused significantly greater minoxidil retention in SC and appendages, compared to the formulation lacking ethanol (0 : 80 : 20). A significant increase <b>in</b> minoxidil <b>receptor</b> penetration occurred with the PG-rich 0 : 80 : 20 formulation after 12 [*]h. We showed that deposition of minoxidil into appendages, SC, and skin penetration into <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> were similar <b>in</b> magnitude. Transport by the appendageal route {{is likely to be a}} key determinant of hair growth promotion by minoxidil. ...|$|R
