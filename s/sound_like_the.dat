5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, {{and a much}} less frequent <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls {{are very similar to}} those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E

The dancer dons wooden legs which <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> hooves of the horse. The dancer brandishes either a sword or a whip. This folk dance needs much training and skill.

25|$|Jeff Tweedy {{was invited}} to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, {{and was told that}} he could {{collaborate}} with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O'Rourke based on his fascination with O'Rourke's Bad Timing album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche. Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments about how the album should sound between songs. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form. Tweedy also fired Jay Bennett around this time, believing (according to Jay Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Jay Bennett was a collective decision.|$|E

500|$|One of Bethe's {{most famous}} papers is one he never wrote: the 1948 Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper. George Gamow added Bethe's name (in absentia) without {{consulting}} him, knowing that Bethe would not mind, and against Ralph Alpher's wishes. This was apparently {{a reflection of}} Gamow's sense of humor, wanting to have a paper title that would <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first three letters of the Greek alphabet.

500|$|For the single's B-side, Lomax {{recorded}} his composition [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You". Produced by Harrison, {{the song was}} also recorded between 24 and 26 June. According to Apple Records historian Andy Davis, the musicians on the track comprised an [...] "ad hoc power trio" [...] of Lomax on bass and rhythm guitar, Harrison on lead guitar and [...] "a couple of overdubs", and drummer Tony Newman from Sounds Incorporated. Lomax recalled that he and Harrison overdubbed a cornet part (played by a studio cleaner) and then manipulated the recording to make it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> call of an elephant.|$|E

[...] Gary Smith, {{who at the time}} was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he [...] "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record."

500|$|The Bama Boyz almost {{intentionally}} {{left the}} instrumental for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] out, since {{they thought that}} the song did not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tracks Beyoncé was recording for her upcoming album, at that particular time. However, Jesse Rankins explained that they later decided to put the instrumental for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] in the email because they knew that Solange likes weird records, but, they made sure to send it last. Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned [...] "Why Don't You Love Me".

500|$|... "Electric Chapel" [...] {{has been}} {{compared}} to the work of Madonna, with NMEs Dan Martin saying that [...] "if you'd ever wondered what that Madonna doing the soundtrack to Blade Runner might have sounded like... then wonder no more."

Gaga recorded the chorus a number of times, channeling the vocals of bands like Duran Duran, and singers Cher and Billy Idol. Inspired by 1980s music, the track incorporates a spoken word section, which Gaga wanted to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> B-52's song [...] "Rock Lobster" [...] (1978).
