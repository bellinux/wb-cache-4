5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating <b>sweetgrass,</b> usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E

25|$|From the enslaved Africans, {{plantation}} owners {{learned how}} to dyke the marshes and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in <b>sweetgrass</b> baskets (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the rice mill increased profitability of the crop, {{and the addition of}} water power for the mills in 1787 by millwright Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.|$|E
25|$|The River Hull valley {{dominates the}} western {{landscape}} of Holderness. The river {{and its associated}} wetland habitats support a diverse range of plants and animals. The upper tributaries of the river originate {{on the edge of}} the Yorkshire Wolds before entering the area of glacial and alluvial deposits of Holderness. The river bed varies in composition reflecting the underlying geology. In the upper reaches of the river water crowfoot, lesser water parsnip, mares tail and spiked water milfoil may be found in the main channel whilst the marginal vegetation is composed of branched bur-reed, common reed and reed <b>sweetgrass.</b>|$|E

Charcoal, a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood, {{has a long history}} as a metal-smelting fuel, as a filter material and adsorbent and as an artist's material {{and is one of the}} three ingredients of gunpowder. Cellulose, the world's most abundant organic polymer, can be converted into energy, fuels, materials and chemical feedstock. Products made from cellulose include rayon and cellophane, wallpaper paste, biobutanol and gun cotton. Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biodiesel.

These bug repelling properties of <b>sweetgrass</b> were later found by the American Chemical Society in the molecules phytol and coumarin.|$|E
500|$|Central Marsh and Pool is {{a diverse}} {{area where the}} main flora is common reed, reed <b>sweetgrass,</b> sedges, bulrushes and teasel. Willow trees are {{particularly}} important in this habitat as they have over 250 species of insect associated with them. [...] Alder trees support birds such as redpoll, siskin and various tit species. [...] Beyond Central Marsh lies West Marsh Pool, a small area of water surrounded by reedbed, where a number of dragonfly pools have been dug. [...] Plants which thrive in damp areas, such as marsh marigold and meadowsweet, flourish here.|$|E

2500|$|Wanting to be {{an artist}} since childhood, Bascom filled the pages of his school books in the one-room school house he {{attended}} with cowboy scenes. His desire to be a cowboy artist was greatly enhanced after seeing art works of the two great icons of Old West art, Charles M. Russell and Frederic S. Remington - both cousins to his father, John W. Bascom (Remington and Russell were both related to Bascom through their mothers, Clarissa [...] "Clara" [...] Bascom Sackrider Remington and Mary Elizabeth Mead Russell, respectively). Both Remington and Russell were artists that spent time in Canada producing art. In the late 1920s, Earl worked on a ranch south of the <b>Sweetgrass</b> Hills in Montana that was once owned by the artist Charlie Russell and only a few months after Russell's death.|$|E
2500|$|Geologically, the Milk River Natural Area {{is part of}} the Oldman and Foremost Formations, {{consisting}} of sandstone, siltstone, and carbonaceous shale, with isolated occurrences of igneous <b>Sweetgrass</b> Hills intrusives. The most prominent feature of the natural area is the Milk River Canyon. At up to 1,500 meters wide and 150 meters deep, it is the deepest in the Canadian plains. One of only five exposed igneous dikes in the Canadian plains, nicknamed the [...] "Rooster Comb" [...] for its distinctive size and shape, lies in the natural area. The Milk River itself is the only river in Alberta that flows to the Gulf of Mexico, joining the Missouri River near Nashua, Montana. Throughout the region lie a multitude of Cretaceous-era dinosaur fossils, as well as many archaeological sites, a legacy of the Blackfoot indigenous people who hunted, gathered, and camped in the area prior to European contact. Findings of projectile points indicate the area has likely been sporadically inhabited {{since the end of the}} last glaciation.|$|E

As time passed the uses for <b>Sweetgrass</b> baskets pivoted from field use to a variety of other uses such as picnics, sewing baskets, church collection, laundry, and many more. <b>Sweetgrass</b> baskets often vary in design but regularly use materials such as bulrush, oak, hickory, and palmetto.|$|E
