5000|$|Preconsolidation {{pressure}} {{cannot be}} measured directly, {{but can be}} estimated using {{a number of different}} strategies. Samples taken from the field are subjected to a variety of tests, like the constant rate of <b>strain</b> <b>test</b> (CRS) or the incremental loading test (IL). These tests can be costly due to expensive equipment and the long period of time they require. Each sample must be undisturbed and can only undergo one test with satisfactory results. [...] It is important to execute these tests precisely to ensure an accurate resulting plot. There are various methods for determining the preconsolidation pressure from lab data. The data is usually arranged on a semilog plot of the effective stress (frequently represented as σ'vc) versus the void ratio. This graph is commonly called the e log p curve or the consolidation curve.|$|E

40|$|Background: Various {{techniques}} {{are used in}} diagnosing cardiac diseases. The electrocardiogram {{is one of these}} tools in common use. In this study vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals are used as a tool for detection of cardiac ischemia. Methods: VCG signals used in this study were obtained form 60 patients suspected to have ischemia disease and 10 normal candidates. Verification of the ischemia had done by the cardiologist during <b>strain</b> <b>test</b> by the evaluation of electrocardiogram (ECG) records and patient′s clinical history. The recorder device was Cardiax digital recorder system. The VCG signals were recorded in Frank lead configuration system. Results: Extracted ischemia VCG signals have been configured with 22 features. Feature dimensionalities were reduced by the use of Independent Components Analysis and Principal Component Analysis tools. Results obtained from <b>strain</b> <b>test</b> indicated that among 60 subjects, 50 had negative results and 10 had positive results. Ischemia detection of neural network using VCG parameters indicates 86 % accuracy. Classification result on neural network using ECG ischemia detection parameters is 73 % accurate. Accumulative evaluation including VCG analysis and <b>strain</b> <b>test</b> indicates 90 % consistency. Conclusions: Regarding the obtained results in this study, VCG has higher accuracy than ECG, so that in cases which ECG signal cannot provide certain diagnosis of existence or non-existence of ischemia, VCG signal can help in a wider range. We suggest the use of VCG as an auxiliary low cost tool in ischemia detection...|$|E
