25|$|The Torah {{lists the}} places where the Israelites rested. A few of the names {{at the start of the}} itinerary, {{including}} Ra'amses, Pithom and <b>Succoth,</b> are reasonably well identified with archaeological sites on the eastern edge of the Nile Delta, as is Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites spend 38 years after turning back from Canaan; other than these, very little is certain. The crossing of the Red Sea has been variously placed at the Pelusic branch of the Nile, anywhere along the network of Bitter Lakes and smaller canals that formed a barrier toward eastward escape, the Gulf of Suez (south-southeast of <b>Succoth),</b> and the Gulf of Aqaba (south of Ezion-Geber), or even on a lagoon on the Mediterranean coast. The Biblical Mount Sinai is identified in Christian tradition with Jebel Musa in the south of the Sinai Peninsula, but this association dates only from the 3rd century CE and no evidence of the Exodus has been found there.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Bible's {{internal}} dating of the Exodus to the 2nd millennium BCE, details {{point to}} a 1st millennium date for {{the composition of the}} Book of Exodus: Ezion-Geber (one of the Stations of the Exodus), for example, dates to a period between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE with possible further occupation into the 4th century BCE, and those place-names on the Exodus route which have been identified – Goshen, Pithom, <b>Succoth,</b> Ramesses and Kadesh Barnea – point to the geography of the 1st millennium rather than the 2nd.|$|E

2500|$|Esau {{offered to}} {{accompany}} {{them on their}} way back to Israel, but Jacob protested that his children were still young and tender (born 6 to 13 years prior in the narrative); Jacob suggested eventually catching up with Esau at Mount Seir. According to the Sages, this was a prophetic reference to the End of Days, when Jacob's descendants will come to Mount Seir, the home of Edom, to deliver judgment against Esau's descendants for persecuting them throughout the millennia (see [...] ). Jacob actually diverted himself to <b>Succoth</b> and was not recorded as rejoining Esau until, at Machpelah, the two bury their father Isaac, who lived to be 180, and was 60 years older than they were.|$|E
2500|$|Sukkot (סוכות or סֻכּוֹת, sukkōt) or <b>Succoth</b> is {{a seven-day}} festival, {{also known as}} the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles, or just Tabernacles. It is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (shalosh regalim) {{mentioned}} in the Bible. Sukkot commemorates the years that the Jews spent in the desert {{on their way to the}} Promised Land, and celebrates the way in which God protected them under difficult desert conditions. The word sukkot is the plural of the Hebrew word sukkah, meaning booth. Jews are commanded to [...] "dwell" [...] in booths during the holiday. This generally means taking meals, but some sleep in the sukkah as well, particularly in Israel. There are specific rules for constructing a sukkah.|$|E
