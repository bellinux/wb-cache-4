Virginia Tech co-defensive coordinator Rod Sharpless resigned to become the defensive coordinator at Rutgers University. Tech defensive line coach Todd Grantham was replaced by Charley Wiles after Grantham resigned to take the <b>same</b> <b>job</b> at Michigan State. To prevent Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer from likewise seeking a different position, the school signed him to a new five-year contract at a salary of more than $148,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|When {{the camp}} opened, Butlin {{realised}} that his guests were not engaging with {{activities in the}} way he had envisioned, as most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was at the very heart of Butlin's and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. That night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the <b>same</b> <b>job</b> as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was formed.|$|E

5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve).

An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored.

25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that, in the United States, several {{minority}} groups, including black men and women, Hispanic men and women, and white women, suffer from decreased wage earning for the <b>same</b> <b>job</b> with the same performance levels and responsibilities as white males.

25|$|In 1989, {{according}} to Variety, women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry. In 2013, Gary Carr (the {{creative director of}} Lionhead Studios) predicted that within the next 5 to 10 years, the games development workforce would be 50% female. According to Gamasutra's Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made. Game designing woman had the closest equity, making 96 cents for every dollar men made in the <b>same</b> <b>job,</b> while audio professional women had the largest gap, making 68% of what men {{in the same position}} made.|$|E
25|$|The Albatrosses {{improved}} the sweeping capacity and introduced news technology such as sonar, radar and magnetic anomaly detector. Norway {{did not have}} capacity to sweep its waters and instead focused on the surveillance. This allowed both British and American forces to carry out such tasks. Despite the leap in technology, the Albatrosses were soon declared obsolete. Allied Forces Northern Europe determined that they needed full anti-submarine capabilities and opted to replace the flying boats with the Lockheed P-3 Orion. Five Orions were capable of the <b>same</b> <b>job</b> as eighteen Albatrosses, {{and the number of}} squadrons was cut to one. The 330 Sqn was therefore deactivated on 1 October 1968.|$|E
25|$|The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 {{requires}} {{employers to}} provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain {{family and medical}} reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, and care for an ill family member. However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the <b>same</b> <b>job.</b> Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.|$|E

50|$|The gender {{wage gap}} is the {{difference}} between average earnings for men and women.

25|$|The Allied victory owed much to Monash's {{detailed}} {{planning and}} to the briefing of all the troops on their objectives. The battle was his first as commander of the Australian Corps. The Allies made novel use {{of a number of}} tactics, such as parachute drops of medical supplies and rifle ammunition in cases, and resupply by tank rather than by troops carrying supplies forward. The supply tanks and aircraft brought stores quickly to the troops as they advanced. The carrying power of the tanks equated to about 1,200 troops doing the <b>same</b> <b>job.</b> Signals were sent largely by cable and telephone, but new methods of signalling were also trialled, including the use of rockets which were used by some battalion headquarters to pass urgent messages to the rear, although this proved largely ineffective. Other techniques were more effective {{such as the use of}} pigeons, Lucas lamps, and for the first time, wirelesses were used by officers to send messages from captured objectives.|$|E
25|$|Even if agency {{workers had}} {{any of the}} {{entitlements}} under the Employment Rights Act 1996, there would still exist no requirement of equal pay for agency workers who do {{work of equal value}} compared to a permanent employer. An agency worker can be treated less favourably in his or her pay and conditions than someone doing exactly the <b>same</b> <b>job,</b> simply because they come through an agency. A proposed Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill sought to adjust this position, joining another ten pieces of employment discrimination law in the UK (on gender, race, disability, religion, sexuality, age, part-time work, fixed time work and trade union membership). After the Bill's second reading, the proposal was dropped and an older draft of a European Union Directive, the Temporary and Agency Workers Directive was revived, and passed by the European Parliament. This was possible {{for the first time in}} 2008 because the United Kingdom government dropped its opposition. In fact, the directive and the Bill are almost identical. It is understood that the law will be passed, but with a 12-week wait before agency workers will be eligible for equal pay and hours.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 offseason, the Bucs re-signed {{head coach}} Gruden {{and general manager}} Allen through the 2011 season. They also {{acquired}} former players Warrick Dunn, who {{had spent the last}} 6 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, and Brian Griese, who was the starting quarterback for the team in 2005 until a knee injury sidelined him {{for the remainder of the}} year. Chris Simms was finally released, having not played in a game since his injury in 2006. The Bucs got off to a great start in 2008, with a 9–3 record going into the final month of the season, tied for first place in the division, with a chance at the top seed in the conference. On December 2, it was announced that defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin would be leaving the team after the season's end, for the <b>same</b> <b>job</b> at the University of Tennessee, serving under his son Lane Kiffin, who had just been named the new head coach at the school. After the announcement, the Buccaneers would lose their final four games of the season to finish 9–7 for the second consecutive season. Unlike 2007, it was not enough to secure the division championship, nor a playoff appearance.|$|E
50|$|The 1968 {{agreement}} between the AWPPW and west coast pulp and paper mills was historic according to Clifford Alexander, Jr., Chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC).
