40|$|The {{effects of}} {{landscape}} pattern on forest ecosystems {{have been a}} recent focus in forest <b>science.</b> <b>Forest</b> managers are increasingly considering landscape level processes in their management. Natural disturbance patterns provide one baseline for such management. What has been largely ignored is the pattern of human habitation patterns (i. e., housing), on landscapes. The objective {{of this study is}} to discuss landscape level management options for the northwest Wisconsin Pine Barrens based on both landscape ecology and the human demographics of the region. Using the 1990 U. S. Decennial Census we examined current housing density, seasonal housing unit concentration, historic housing density change and projected future housing densities. These data were related to land cover and land ownership data using a GIS. Housing density increase was particularly pronounced in the central Pine Barrens, an area where seasonal housing units are common. Lakes and streams were more abundant in areas that exhibited highest growth. Within national forest lands, 80 % of the area contained no housing units. In contrast, only 12 % of the area in small private land ownership contained no housing. These results are integrated with previous studies of presettlement vegetation and landscape change to discuss landscape level management suggestions for the Pine Barrens...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of scientific journals, especially over the last 20 years, created the need for methodologies based on simple metrics, to accurately capture the quality of those journals {{and their impact on}} the scientific community. Especially in the case of journals from the field of forestry, relatively little work has been conducted on providing valid journal classifications. In this paper we attempt {{to assess the impact of}} journals from this field in terms of bibliometric data. In addition to the already proposed metrics (complementary to the journal h-index), we also apply a new measure to rank journals, that provides a more balanced evaluation of the journal performance, by adjusting for various biases affecting the h-index. We examined the relationships between various bibliometric indicators proposed for assessing the journal impact and wo found high correlations between most indices, with only few exceptions. According to citation analysis, Canadian Journal of Forest Research, Journal of Vegetation <b>Science,</b> <b>Forest</b> Science, Tree Physiology, International Journal of Wildland Fire, Holzforschung, Trees-Structure and Function, Silva Fennica, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology and Wood and Fiber Science are the top forestry journals. These publish articles related to all the domains of forestry science.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Forests are an {{integral}} component of the landscape, and maintaining their functional integrity is fundamental for the sustainability of ecosystems and societies alike. Tools, innovations, and practices, analogous to those developed to improve agricultural production and quantify environmental impacts, are needed to ensure the sustainability of these forested landscapes {{as well as the}} ecosystem goods and services they produce. This article introduces ten technical articles on critical ecohydrologic processes, protection and restoration, and the effects of management practices on the hydrology and water quality of forests and forested wetlands, using both monitoring and modeling approaches. Prepared by experts in forest <b>science,</b> <b>forest</b> and agricultural hydrology, and water management, the studies reported in this special collection are concentrated in the Atlantic Coastal plain and focus on forests with shallow water tables. Experimental studies describe the effects of riparian vegetation harvest, human disturbance, and future climatic change on groundwater, the significance of emergent vegetation after harvest, and long‐term hydrologic water balance of a managed pine forest. Modeling studies use the SWAT model to predict streamflow dynamics of a less disturbed, coastal forested watershed, and DRAINMOD to determine the impacts of minor silvicultural drainage on wetland hydrology and to improve wetland restoration. Finally, a study describes potential uncertainties associated with infrequent water sampling of nutrient loads from drained forested watersheds. This introductory article summarizes these studies of shallow water table forests and relates them to the broader field of forest hydrology, including its challenges and opportunities, while identifying pressing issues of land use and climat...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{certification}} can {{be conceived}} {{as one of}} many rapidly growing non-state market driven (NSMD) modes of governance. The environmental effectiveness of forest certification is oftentimes evaluated by indicators such as stringency of standards, degree of participation by key stakeholders, certified area, etc. In political <b>science,</b> <b>forest</b> certification as an NSMD governance arrangement is usually evaluated {{in terms of the}} quality of the decision-making procedures (input legitimacy) rather than for its problem solving capacity, i. e. its environmental performance or effectiveness. We conceptualize environmental effectiveness as a function of a standard's environmental stringency and the area covered by the standard, the latter dependent on the degree of social acceptance. Accordingly, the environmental effectiveness of different certification schemes ought to be evaluated taking both the standard stringency and the area certified into account. The forest certification process in Sweden illustrates how forestry history and regional differences affect the development, acceptance and adoption of different certification schemes. Industrial and Northern forestry owners favour the NGO led Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards whereas Southern small-scale private forest owners preferred to develop an alternative scheme the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). We demonstrate that there is a bifurcated geographical coverage of the two certification schemes along a north-south divide coupled with a similarity in standard stringency and a high degree of acceptance in their different areas of dominance. Both forest certification schemes display a similar degree of environmental effectiveness - but in different parts of the country and for different types of ownership. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The University of Guelph is a mid-sized {{university}} in southern Ontario that has many historical underpinnings {{with respect to}} both undergraduate and graduate education in forestry and forest-related subjects. Some of the earliest forward-thinking forest policies found in Ontario came from early faculty associated with the predecessor of the University, the Ontario School of Agriculture. Today, the University has numerous faculty in Colleges across campus {{that are involved in}} a multitude of teaching and research aspects associ-ated with forested environments. The research-teaching link with respect to forestry is strong and the undergraduate population appears appreciative of this. Undergraduate courses and course segments at both undergraduate and graduate levels exist, and a minor in for-est science, housed in the Department of Environmental Biology but drawing on resources from across multiple disciplines, is also available. The University of Guelph is currently evaluating its options with respect to undergraduate education in the forest sciences. Building on past and present strengths, the University is considering offering a non-accredited B. Sc. program that embraces the sci-ence and management of forests and the environmental impact and community benefits associated with interventions in the forest.

40|$|The Center for Biological Diversity respectfully submits the {{following}} comments regarding the Forest Practice Rules {{in regard to}} the “Regulation and Priorities Review ” on the November Board agenda. We note that we have raised the below issues before, beginning in 2009. Specifically, we have described the problems associated with protection of late-seral forest and large, old trees; retention of hardwoods; and the widespread use of even-aged management (and its associated fragmentation of forest habitat and loss of forest complexity). These issues have not yet been addressed by the Board. We also note that “ecologically based standards ” to conserve wildlife and its associated habitat have been sought for many years now, not just by us. As the Department of Fish and Wildlife noted in its 2007 “Wildlife Action Plan ” 1 : “Using the best-available <b>science,</b> <b>forest</b> and wildlife managers should determine the extent, pattern, and pace for timber-harvest in a forest watershed or cluster of watersheds. Ecologically based standards or limits should be set for timber-harvest. ” Areas where questions exist on interpretation of the regulatory standards, including potential solutions � Definition of “Late Succession Forest Stands ” (Rule 895. 1) o Some foresters continue to take the position that they need not pay attention to late-seral forest less than 20 acres in size, or individual large, old trees, because, according to them, the definition of “Late Succession Forest Stands ” only requires anyone to acknowledge “stands [...] . at least 20 acres in size. ” This has created a situation, where in some circumstances, late-seral forest less than 20 acres in size is not even divulged, and is only discovered (if at all) if the Department of Fis...|$|E
40|$|The {{current state}} of land use {{is the result of}} a variety of factors, caused by both biophysical and {{socio-economic}} conditions, and their interactions. Land-use features prominently in many disciplines such as geography, economics, civil engineering, architecture, city and rural planning, soil <b>science,</b> <b>forest</b> management, and so on. But the study of land-use is often limited to only one discipline. There are only a few studies where the influence of both natural and socio-economic factors on land-use is simultaneously investigated. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the relations among land use, socio-economic variables and geophysical factors in the case study area of Kansai district, Japan. This region contains the second largest urbanized area in Japan (after the Tokyo metropolitan area), while maintaining significant paddy rice cultivation in the suburban surroundings. Here we seek to extract the crucial relationships between land use in the Kansai district and the associated factors with statistical techniques. In general, land-use change can be separated into two levels. "Minor land-use change" is land-use change within the same economic sector. "Major land-use change" means land-use conversion from one major industry to another [Black, 1931; Wada, 1980]. For example, according to this classification, a crop change in agriculture is a minor land-use change, and land-use conversion from farmland to residential land is a major land-use change. In this study, we focus mainly on major land-use change. A first reason is that land-use conversion usually brings about permanent change. Conversion to residential land from any other land-use, and even conversion from farmland to forest land are actually irreversible processes. The second reason is a practical one, since it is difficult to obtain the detailed land-use data that are prerequisites for within category land-use analysis. In this paper, we first present some basic information on the case study area, describe the characteristics of the local agriculture and briefly discuss the statistical data used in the case study. The subsequent analysis consists of two parts: an analysis of the distribution of land uses and an analysis of the driving forces of land-use change. The distribution of land use is represented by percentage of total area. We calculate the static relationships between the distribution of land uses and socio-economic and geophysical factors. We then try to elucidate whether the static relations are temporally stable, i. e. how these relationships have changed during the study period from 1970 to 1990. For farmland and residential land we investigate what kind of socio-economic factors as well as natural conditions explain the temporal changes of these major land-use categories during the study period. Through these analyses, we extract some driving forces of land-use change in the study area. The data set for this study was originally developed in the project "Land-use and Global Environment Change" (LU/GEC, 1995) sponsored by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan...|$|E
