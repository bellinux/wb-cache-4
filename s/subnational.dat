5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to <b>subnational</b> entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or <b>subnational</b> entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E
5|$|The sub{{division}}s of England {{consist of}} up to four levels of <b>subnational</b> division controlled {{through a variety of}} types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government. The highest tier of local government were the nine regions of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East, South East, South West, and London. These were created in 1994 as Government Offices, used by the UK government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional government offices were abolished. The same boundaries remain in use for electing Members of the European Parliament on a regional basis.|$|E

25|$|A warlord is {{a leader}} able to {{exercise}} military, economic, and political control over a <b>subnational</b> territory within a sovereign state due {{to their ability to}} mobilize loyal armed forces. These armed forces, usually considered militias, are loyal to the warlord rather than to the state regime.

25|$|Due to {{the history}} of Germany, the {{principle}} of federalism is strong. Only the state of Hitler (1933–1945) and the state of the communists (East Germany, 1949–1990) were centralist states. As a result, the words Reich and Bund used more frequently than in other countries, in order to distinguish between imperial or federal institutions and those at a <b>subnational</b> level. For example, a modern federal German minister is called Bundesminister, in contrast to a Landesminister who holds office in a state such as Rhineland-Palatinate or Lower Saxony.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{feudal system}} of Europe, nobility--whether feudal lords, knights, princes or barons--were warlords {{in that they}} served as {{regional}} leaders who exercised military, economic and political control over <b>subnational</b> territories and maintained private armies to maintain that status. While their political power to exercise social order, welfare and regional defense within their territory was derived from hereditary rights or edicts from the monarch, their military strength afforded them independence and strength to negotiate for privileges. Should the feudal lord or other noble withdraw his support from the king, either in rebellion or to form an alliance with a rival kingdom, that feudal lord or noble was now ascribing to the political order of Ungoverned Warlordism.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{legitimacy}} bestowed on Muhammad by the Djibouti conference, he was subsequently {{recognized by the}} international community as the new President of Somalia. Djibouti, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Italy were among the countries that officially extended recognition to Muhammad's administration. He was not able to exert his authority beyond parts of the capital. Power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of Somalia and with autonomous <b>subnational</b> entities in the north. The Djibouti conference was followed by two abortive agreements for national reconciliation and disarmament, which were signed by 15 political stakeholders: an agreement to hold an Informal Preparatory Meeting on National Reconciliation, and the 1993 Addis Ababa Agreement made at the Conference on National Reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{considered}} by the IMF {{to be a model}} country in its compliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to have been caused by IMF-induced budget restrictions—which undercut the government's ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health, education, and security—and privatisation of strategically vital national resources. Others attribute the crisis to Argentina's misdesigned fiscal federalism, which caused <b>subnational</b> spending to increase rapidly. The crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic problems. The current—as of early 2006—trend toward moderate left-wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic policy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this crisis.|$|E

500|$|The Age of Enlightenment {{and various}} {{revolutions}} {{of the last}} three centuries all helped to further this trend. Hence, many monarchies—especially in Europe—have dispensed with coronations altogether, or transformed them into simpler inauguration or benediction rites. Majority of contemporary European monarchies today have either long abandoned coronations ceremonies (e.g. Spain, last practiced in 1494) or have never practiced coronations (e.g. Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg). Of all European monarchies today, only the United Kingdom still retains its coronation rite. Other nations still crowning their rulers include Bhutan, [...] Brunei, Cambodia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Thailand, and Tonga, as well as several <b>subnational</b> entities such as the Toro Kingdom. The Papacy retains the option of a coronation, but no pope has used it since 1963 after Pope John Paul I opted for an Inauguration in 1978.|$|E
500|$|Worcestershire County Council or the {{administrative}} county of Worcestershire {{came into existence}} following the Local Government Act 1888 and was a level of <b>subnational</b> division of England used {{for the purposes of}} local government from 1889. This new structure replaced many of {{the administrative}} functions carried out by the quarter sessions of Worcestershire. The administrative county covered the historic shire of Worcestershire, except for two newly designated county boroughs at Dudley and Worcester. A 'county borough' was a 'single tier' authority and regarded within the Local Government Act 1888 as independent of county council jurisdiction or an [...] "administrative county of itself". This was due {{to the size of the}} general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'. The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as [...] "non-administrative purposes" [...] would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases). The non-administrative purposes were stated to be [...] "sheriff, lieutenant (custos rotulorum), justices, militia, coroner, or other".
