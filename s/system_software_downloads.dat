40|$|The {{impetus for}} this work was the need to analyse {{nucleotide}} diversity in a viral mix taken from honeybees. The paper has two findings. First, a method for correction of next generation sequencing error {{in the distribution of}} nucleotides at a site is developed. Second, a package of methods for assessment of nucleotide diversity is assembled. The error correction method is statistically based and works {{at the level of the}} nucleotide distribution rather than the level of individual nucleotides. The method relies on an error model and a sample of known viral genotypes that is used for model calibration. A compendium of existing and new diversity analysis tools is also presented, allowing hypotheses about diversity and mean diversity to be tested and associated confidence intervals to be calculated. The methods are illustrated using honeybee viral samples.

Online play is a main pillar for the PlayStation 4, but a PlayStation Plus subscription will be required to play the majority of PS4 titles online, unlike PlayStation 3 titles. According to Sony, they are developing many new ways to play and connect for PS4 which requires a large investment of resources. As a result, they cannot keep such a service free and maintain its quality at the same time considering the cost, and they thus decided {{that it would be better}} to charge a fee in order to continue to offer a good service.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{high-density}} oligonucleotide microarray (GeneChip) is {{an important}} tool for molecular biological research aiming at large-scale detection of small nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA and genome-wide analysis of mRNA concentrations. Local array data management solutions are instrumental for efficient processing of the results and for subsequent uploading of data and annotations to a global certified data repository at the EBI (ArrayExpress) or the NCBI (GeneOmnibus). DESCRIPTION: To facilitate and accelerate annotation of high-throughput expression profiling experiments, the Microarray Information Management and Annotation System (MIMAS) was developed. The system is fully compliant with the Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) convention. MIMAS provides life scientists with a highly flexible and focused GeneChip data storage and annotation platform essential for subsequent analysis and interpretation of experimental results with clustering and mining tools. The <b>system</b> <b>software</b> can be <b>downloaded</b> for academic use upon request. CONCLUSION: MIMAS implements a novel concept for nation-wide GeneChip data management whereby a network of facilities is centered on one data node directly connected to the European certified public microarray data repository located at the EBI.
