40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} retinal directional selectivity. We show intracellular (whole-cell patch) recordings in turtle retina which indicate that this computation occurs prior to the ganglion cell, and we describe a pre-ganglionic circuit model to account for this and other findings which places the non-linear spatio-temporal filter at individual, oriented amacrine cell dendrites. The key non-linearity is provided by interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto the dendrites, and their distal tips provide directionally <b>selective</b> excitatory <b>outputs</b> onto ganglion cells. Detailed simulations of putative cells support this model, given reasonable parameter constraints. The performance of the model also suggests that this computational substructure may be relevant within the dendritic trees of CNS neurons in general...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The CMOS {{image sensor}} computes {{two-dimensional}} convolution of video frames with a programmable digital kernel {{of up to}} 8 8 pixels in parallel directly on the focal plane. Three operations, a temporal difference, a multiplication and an accumu-lation are performed for each pixel readout. A dual-memory pixel stores two video frames. <b>Selective</b> pixel <b>output</b> sampling controlled by binary kernel coefficients implements binary-analog multiplica-tion. Cross-pixel column-parallel bit-level accumulation and frame differencing are implemented by switched-capacitor integrators. Binary-weighted summation and concurrent quantization is per-formed by a bank of column-parallel multiplying analog-to-digital converters (MADCs). A simple digital adder performs row-wise ac-cumulation during ADC readout. A 128 128 active pixel array integrated with a bank of 128 MADCs was fabricated in a 0. 35 m standard CMOS technology.

40|$|SummaryThe recoding {{of diverse}} sensory and motor signals by granule cells (GCs) is {{probably}} {{critical for the}} function of cerebellar circuits, yet {{the nature of these}} transformations and their significance for cerebellar information processing remain poorly understood. In cerebellum-like structures in fish, anti-Hebbian plasticity at parallel fiber synapses generates “negative images” that act to cancel predictable patterns of electrosensory input. Here I test the hypothesis that GCs enhance the capacity of Purkinje-like cells to generate specific negative images by selectively encoding combinations of sensory and motor signals. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings, I show (1) that a subset of GCs integrate sensory and motor signals conveyed by distinct mossy fiber classes and (2) that Purkinje-like cells exhibit plastic changes specific to the combinations of signals that individual GCs encode. Consistent with influential theories of cerebellar function, these findings suggest that <b>selective</b> GC <b>output</b> enhances the capacity of Purkinje-like cells to acquire selectivity through associative plasticity...|$|R
40|$|A {{single case}} study of a patient with 'visual form agnosia ' is presented. A severe visual {{recognition}} deficit was accompanied by impairments in discriminating shape, reflectance, and orientation, although visual acuity and colour vision, along with tactile recognition and intelligence, were largely preserved. Neuropsychological and behavioural investigations have indicated that the patient is able to utilize visual pattern information surprisingly well for the control of hand movements during reaching, and can even read many whole words, despite being unable to make simple discriminative judgements of shape or orientation. She {{seems to have no}} awareness of shape primitives through Gestalt grouping by similarity, continuity or symmetry. It is proposed that many of these perceptual disorders might be the combined result of (1) a selective loss of the cortical elaboration of the magnocellular visual processing stream, and (2) a <b>selective</b> <b>output</b> disconnection from a central processor of visual boundaries and shape primitives in the occipital cortex...|$|E
40|$|Building {{upon the}} {{universal}} {{characteristics of the}} social democratic welfare regime, public housing in Sweden has traditionally been a central instrument in contributing to socially inclusive cities; however, changes in policy have gradually changed the landscape. This paper presents concerns for public housing’s endeavour for social inclusion and suggests that the universal approach, of which Swedish public housing is a standing role model, is diminishing in favour of an ambiguous model of universal discourse and <b>selective</b> <b>output.</b> A ‘New Public Housing’ is emerging with higher thresholds, {{making it harder for}} economically disadvantaged groups to gain access to housing; at the same time, this is compensated by the increase of ‘social contracts’, which provides the financially vulnerable with an entrance to the housing market, however on very uncertain conditions.

40|$|The {{neuronal}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} emergence of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex of mammals are still elusive. In rodents, visual neurons show highly selective responses to oriented stimuli, but neighboring neurons do not necessarily have similar preferences. Instead of a smooth map, one observes a salt-and-pepper organization of orientation selectivity. Modeling studies have recently confirmed that balanced random networks are indeed capable of amplifying weakly tuned inputs and generating highly <b>selective</b> <b>output</b> responses, even in absence of feature-selective recurrent connectivity. Here we seek to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon by resorting to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, which are amenable to analytic treatment. Specifically, in networks of perfect integrate-and-fire neurons, we observe that highly selective and contrast invariant output responses emerge, very similar to networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We then demonstrate that a theory based on mean firing rates and the detailed network topology predicts the output responses, and explains the mechanisms underlying {{the suppression of the}} common-mode, amplification of modulation, and contrast invariance. Increasing inhibition dominance in our networks makes the rectifying nonlinearity more prominent, which in turn adds some distortions to the otherwise essentially linear prediction. An extension of the linear theory can account for all the distortions, enabling us to compute the exact shape of every individual tuning curve in our networks. We show that this simple form of nonlinearity adds two important properties to orientatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{homogenous}} matrix polynomials provides {{a clear and}} powerful framework for the characterization of frequency <b>selective</b> multiple-input multiple <b>output</b> (MIMO) channels. The concept, proposed in this paper, is a natural unification of methods, known from flat fading MIMO channels and frequency selective single-input single-output (SISO) channels. From the Kronecker canonical form of the channel equation, several subchannels can be identified. They each are related to an elementary divisor or minimal indice of the channel. The elementary divisors are equivalent {{to the roots of}} the characteristic polynomial for SISO channels whereas the minimal indices characterise the possible transmit or receive diversity in such channels. The knowledge of these values allows us to determine the necessary filter length and redundancy such that a finite impulse response filter can cancel all intersymbol and interchannel interference completely...|$|R

40|$|Dopamine and {{noradrenaline}} in the {{prefrontal cortex}} modulate superior cognitive functions and are {{implicated in the}} aetiology of depressive and psychotic symptoms. Experimental evidence reveals parallel variations in extracellular concentration of both catecholamines in the cerebral cortex. In this review, data are presented suggesting that extracellular dopamine in the cerebral cortex originates not only from dopaminergic terminals but also from noradrenergic ones, where it acts both as precursor for noradrenaline and as co-transmitter. Since there lease of noradrenaline is controlled by alpha 2 -autoreceptors, it follows that release and extracellular concentration of both dopamine and noradrenaline in the cerebral cortex are controlled by alpha 2 -autoreceptors and noradrenaline transporter, whereas dopamine receptors and dopamine transporter {{do not seem to}} be involved in these processes. Atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, and antidepressants such as mirtazapine, increase noradrenaline and dopamine release throughout the cerebral cortex, but not, or to a lesser extent, in subcortical areas. On the other hand, D 2 selective drugs such as haloperidol, are potent in increasing dopamine levels in subcortical dopaminergic areas but are ineffective on dopamine and noradrenaline levels in the prefrontal cortex. Local stimulation or inhibition of locus coeruleus neurons by means of drug perfusion or electrical stimulation gives rise to parallel variations of noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the cerebral cortex, but not in prevalently dopaminergic subcortical areas. Extracellular dopamine of noradrenergic origin might represent the major portion of total extracellular dopamine not only in cortices with scarce dopaminergic innervation, such as the parietal and occipital cortex, but also in the densely innervated medial prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, drugs acting on the co-release mechanism of noradrenaline and dopamine may represent a tool with which to increase the <b>selective</b> <b>output</b> of dopamine in the cerebral cortex...|$|E

40|$|Norepinephrine is {{released}} in the amygdala following negatively arousing learning conditions. This event initiates a cascade of changes including the transcription of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression, an early-immediate gene associated with memory encoding. Recent {{evidence suggests that the}} valence of emotionally laden encounters may generate lateralized, as opposed to symmetric release of this transmitter in the right or left amygdala. It is currently not clear if valence-induced patterns of <b>selective</b> norepinephrine <b>output</b> across hemispheres are also reproduced in downstream pathways of cellular signaling necessary for memory formation. This question was addressed by determining if Arc expression is differentially distributed across the right and left amygdala following exposure to positively or negatively valenced learning conditions respectively. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to groups exposed to the Homecage only, 5 auditory tones only, or 5 auditory tones paired with footshock (0. 35 mA) during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Western blot analysis revealed that Arc expression in the right amygdala was elevated significantly above that observed in the left amygdala 60 and 90 minutes following fear conditioning. Similarly, subjects exposed to a a negatively valenced outcome consisting of an unexpected reduction in food rewards showed a greater level of Arc expression in only the right, but not left basolateral amygdala. Presenting a positively valenced event involving an unexpected increase in food reward magnitude following bar pressing, resulted in significantly greater Arc expression in the left, but not right basolateral amygdala (...|$|R
40|$|The retina {{processes}} {{visual images}} to compute {{features such as}} the direction of image motion. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs), axonless feed-forward interneurons, are essential components of the retinal direction-selective circuitry. Recent work has highlighted that SAC-mediated dendro-dendritic inhibition controls the action potential output of direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) by vetoing dendritic spike initiation. However, SACs co-release GABA and the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine at dendritic sites. Here we use direct dendritic recordings to show that preferred direction light stimuli evoke SAC-mediated acetylcholine release, which powerfully controls the stimulus sensitivity, receptive field size and action potential output of ON-DSGCs by acting as an excitatory drive for the initiation of dendritic spikes. Consistent with this, paired recordings reveal that the activation of single ON-SACs drove dendritic spike generation, because of predominate cholinergic excitation received on the preferred side of ON-DSGCs. Thus, dendro-dendritic release of neurotransmitters from SACs bi-directionally gate dendritic spike initiation to control the directionally <b>selective</b> action potential <b>output</b> of retinal ganglion cells...|$|R

40|$|The channel {{matched filter}} (CMF) is the optimum {{receiver}} providing the maximum {{signal to noise}} ratio (SNR) for the frequency <b>selective</b> channels. The <b>output</b> intersymbol interference (ISI) profile of the CMF convolved by the channel can be blindly obtained by using the autocorrelation of the received signal. Therefore, the inverse of the autocorrelation function can be used to equalize the channel passed through its own CMF. The only missing part to complete the proposed blind operation is the CMF coefficients. Therefore, in this work, the best training algorithm investigation is subjected for blind estimation of the CMF coefficients. The proposed method allows using more effective training algorithms for blind equalizations. However, the expected high performance training is obtained when the swarm intelligence is used. Unlike the stochastic gradient algorithms, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is known to have fast convergence because its performance is independent of the characteristics of the systems used.

40|$|Abstract. All recent {{implementations}} of two-party secure computation protocols require specific complexity assumptions {{for their}} correctness and/or efficiency (e. g., DDH, homomorphic encryption, Sigma protocols for specific languages). We propose {{and implement a}} Yao-based protocol for secure two-party computation against malicious adversaries that enjoys the following benefits: 1. it assumes the minimal hardness assumption, that is, oblivious transfers; 2. it has constant round complexity; 3. its overhead is linear times (in terms of security parameter) of the Yao protocol’s, {{which is the best}} one could hope for by using the circuit-level cut-and-choose technique to achieve malicious security; and 4. it is embarrassingly parallelizable in that its depth complexity is roughly the same as the Yao protocol. To achieve these properties, we use the cut-and-choose paradigm, but solve the main three problems for achieving malicious security (input consistency, <b>selective</b> failure, and <b>output</b> authentication) in a novel and efficient manner. In particular, we propose an efficient witness-indistinguishable proof for output authentication; we suggest the use of an auxiliary 2 -universal circuit to ensure the generator’s input consistency; and we advance the performance of the state-of-the-art approach defending the selective failure attack. Not only does our protocol require weaker complexity assumptions, but our implementation of this protocol also demonstrates a several factor improvement over the best prior two-party secure computation protocol which rely on specific number theoretic assumptions...|$|R

The main sources for this energy production comes from the combustion of non-renewable fuels as natural gas or coal; this way presents a relevant impact on the environment at different levels. Solar energy could allow reducing the building's impact on the global primary energy consumption and consequently on the environment, but generally the solar systems are <b>selective</b> about their <b>output</b> or only thermal or only electricity. In this contest, the low concentrated solar technology could be an interesting way to combine the two outputs with easy integration in the building with low impact on the architecture. The paper describes the analysis performed on a low concentration solar system; this unit has four linear semi-parabolic concentrators and the sun tracking is on only one rotational axes. The work starts from an analysis of influence of the sun angle on focus's position on the receiver by a rays trace code. This is important because the concentrator is only alienated with one sun angle thus the sun's rays are not perpendicular with the input surface. A performance analysis, using the previous out coming, are performed on a complete system with the using of the sun position during the years for a reference location. The study compares two direction for the tracking: Est-West and South-North, some different distances between the concentrators and different tilt angles...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2007. Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) separations {{are highly}} beneficial in {{the characterization of}} complex samples. The research presented in this dissertation involves {{the analysis of the}} small polar molecules comprising the yeast metabolome using commercially available GCxGC-TOFMS instrumentation. The studies described herein are some of the first on metabolomic data using GCxGC-TOFMS and the analysis required a tremendous amount of procedural and software method development. A proof of principle experiment was performed using fermenting and respiring yeast cells. Initially, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on three selective mass channels (m/z) to identify the metabolite locations exhibiting changes between sample types. Twenty-six metabolite peaks were reported. Following proof that the GCxGCTOFMS is applicable to the study of yeast metabolite data, an extensive study was performed to determine the ability of GCxGC-TOFMS to detect metabolites and ultimately be utilized to distinguish classes. In this study, a newly developed in-house Fisher ratio method was applied, using the entire 3 D data cube (i. e., column 1 retention time, column 2 retention time, m/z), more than doubling the number of quantified metabolite peaks, relative to the PCA study. To obtain the confident identification and accurate metabolite quantification, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was applied. The statistical significance of the results was determined by applying a Student's t-test to the deconvoluted peak volumes. It was determined that 54 identified metabolite peaks were statistically different at the 95 % confidence level. Some cell strains exhibit robust oscillations in gene expression and molecular oxygen. A study with metabolites collected from cells showing periodicity in molecular dissolved oxygen was also performed to ascertain the changes in the metabolome. A new software method was developed to calculate the severity of the periodic pattern without signal bias or limiting the cycling frequency. This method is based on the raw signal intensities and, although it searches all m/z, only information from the three most <b>selective</b> m/z is <b>output.</b> Peak volumes were determined by PARAFAC and objective grouping of the metabolites with similar patterns was obtained with PCA.
