500|$|Before {{the film}} was released, rumors and {{allegations}} began to circulate that Battlefield Earth contained subliminal messages promoting Scientology. Former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim, in a press release issued by his group Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, said that the Church of Scientology [...] "has placed highly advanced subliminal messages in the Battlefield Earth film master to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience {{and to get the}} audience to develop a revulsion for psychiatry and current mental health organizations and practices". Other critics said that the film [...] "is a veiled attempt to gain converts and influence", and that writers were gagged from making connections between Scientology and the film with threats of lawsuits. Warner Bros. dismissed the claims as [...] "silly nonsense", the Church of Scientology denounced them as [...] "hogwash" [...] and the media reacted with skepticism; as the Scottish journalist Duncan Campbell put it, [...] "the only subliminal voice I could detect came about 10minutes into this 121-minute film and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> Leeeaaave thisssss cinemmmaaa nooow". When asked about the similarities between the film and Scientology beliefs in intergalactic travel and aliens, church spokesman Aron Mason stated, [...] "That's a pretty crude parallel… You'd have to make some serious leaps of logic to make that comparison." [...] John Travolta also stated that {{the film was}} not inspired by Scientology tenets.|$|E
2500|$|Shindo {{continued}} his exploration {{of human sexuality}} with Akuto in 1965 and Lost Sex in 1966. In Lost Sex, a middle aged man who has become temporarily impotent after the Hiroshima bombing in 1945, once again loses his virility due to nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll. In the end, he is cured by his housekeeper. Impotence was again the theme of Shindo's next film, Libido, released in 1967. Gender politics and strong female characters played a strong role {{in both of these}} films. Tadao Sato said [...] "By contrasting the comical weakness of the male with the unbridled strength of the female, Shindo <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> in the 1960s that women had wrought their revenge. This could have been a reflection of postwar society, since it is commonly said in Japan women have become stronger because men have lost all confidence in their masculinity due to Japan's defeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a bout of}} activity, he {{left for}} America in December 1879 with John Dillon {{to raise funds for}} famine relief and secure support for Home Rule. Timothy Healy {{followed}} to cope with the press and they collected £70,000 for distress in Ireland. During Parnell's highly successful tour, he had an audience with American President Rutherford B. Hayes, on 2 February 1880 he addressed the House of Representatives on the state of Ireland and spoke in 62 cities including in Canada, where he was so well received in Toronto that Healy dubbed him [...] "the uncrowned king of Ireland". (The same term was applied 30 years earlier to Daniel O'Connell.) He strove to retain Fenian support but insisted when asked by a reporter that he personally could not join a secret society. Central to his whole approach to politics was ambiguity in that he allowed his hearers to remain uncertain. During his tour, he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that there were virtually no limits. To abolish landlordism, he asserted, would be to undermine English misgovernment, and he is alleged to have added: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something," [...] the {{daughter}} suggested in general terms. [...] "What is she saying?" [...] {{she asked the}} colored girl.|$|R
5000|$|... 蜜 means nectar - sweet liquid - {{which may}} mean the sweet bliss that you reach after untangling the mess of your mind.haramitsu <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{that if you}} free your mind from life's clutter you will reach enlightenment.|$|R
5000|$|A second, incomplete, {{block of}} four lines appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{addressed}} <b>to</b> Lycoris. So {{long as she}} likes his verses, Gallus <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> he can ignore any 'peer reviews' they might attract from critics such as Publius Valerius Cato and Viscus: ...|$|R
6000|$|Soames smiled. 'Do {{you really}} think I shall admit that I'm not their equal'; he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> 'or that I've got to give up anything, {{especially}} life?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where have I {{heard that}} song before?" [...] he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> to himself, [...] "the old {{familiar}} language {{they used to}} talk to me when I was young?" ...|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{approached}} us presently with outstretched hand. His manner {{was half}} apologetic, half triumphant. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{to himself that}} Isobel's reception of him must surely have opened our eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+, {{focusing}} on the episode's social commentary. Handlen remarked, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something, only it isn’t really, but you still kind of care a little. And also there are robots." ...|$|R
5000|$|Manson also {{hears the}} Beatles whispering: [...] "Charlie, Charlie, {{send us a}} telegram." [...] (See Honey Pie, above.) At {{approximately}} 3:45 of the recording, a voice that could be that of George Harrison does, in fact, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something about a telegram.|$|R
5000|$|Biographer Brian Hinton {{comments}} [...] "'Enlightenment' {{is actually}} {{the opposite of what}} it sounds: it is full of doubt, not affirmation. 'I'm meditating and still I'm suffering.' He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> everything <b>is</b> a state of mind, you can choose to live in heaven or hell." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{physical}} power all dribbled and gone, {{the sick}} man replied not by voice or by gesture; but, with feeble dumb-show of his face, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Pray leave me; who was ever cured by talk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Milt was stooping, looking under; <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something. When he came back, {{he did not}} speak. He {{wiped his}} forehead. [...] "Come. We'll climb back up. Nothing to do, now. Guess you better not try to help, anyway. You might not sleep well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{going to}} be a credit to your mother," [...] she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "you're a nice comfort to any one's old age, you are, making a row like that. And look at your ears {{flopping}} all over your face. I don't know where you pick up such ways." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{also saw}} {{the message of the}} film as self-contradictory, writing: [...] "I'm also {{somewhat}} disturbed by the central theme of the movie. 'Billy Jack' <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> the same thing as 'Born Losers,' that a gun is better than a constitution in the enforcement of justice." ...|$|R

Gary Truman <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> as his Coolidge second grade teacher, Miss Ruby Lee Mallory, thanks him for his gift. She marries a California school teacher June 23, so Gary, Annette Ingraham, left, and classmates and {{homeroom}} mothers gave a kitchen shower. ...|$|R

'I don't want <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{anything}} that might be interpreted as in the least derogatory to your father in any way whatever, but without prejudice, surely he is just a plain, ordinary brigand? I mean it's only a question of a ransom? And I don't in the least object--' ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl went to {{the rail}} and gazed earnestly at the shore. There was an anxious {{expression}} on her face. She had the air of one who was {{waiting for someone to}} appear. Her demeanour was that of Mariana at the Moated Grange. [...] "He cometh not!" [...] she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> She glanced at her wrist-watch, then scanned the dock once more.|$|E
6000|$|The pug-dog sat up, as a precautionary measure, as I passed; but, as I took {{no notice}} of the {{treasure}} he was guarding, he let me go by without even one remonstrant bark. [...] "He that takes my life," [...] he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> wheezily, to himself, [...] "takes trash: But he that takes the Daily Telegraph--!" [...] But this awful contingency I did not face.|$|E
60|$|And {{everybody}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> {{the same}} thing at the same time. The name of Sidney Wilton was in everybody's mouth. It was unfortunate that he {{had been a member of}} a defunct ministry, but then it had always been understood that he had always disapproved of all their measures. There was not the slightest evidence of this, but everybody chose to believe it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} she's like the women we know. She doesn't say witty things, and she hasn't their {{responsive}} quickness; but her ideas are her own, {{no matter how}} old they are; and what she <b>says</b> she <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> for the first time, and as if it had never been thought out before." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} then arises {{of the possibility}} of reconciling externalism with holism. The one <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that meanings <b>are</b> determined by the external relations (with society or the world), while the other suggests that meaning is determined by the relation of words (or beliefs) to all the other words (or beliefs). Frederik Stjernfelt identifies at least three possible ways to reconcile them and then points out some objections.|$|R
5000|$|Elaborating on {{the themes}} within the play Amitava Kumar {{writes in his}} review for The Guardian: [...] "Akhtar doesn't hold back {{when it comes to}} exposing the {{gathering}} greed of the jihadists as the pair and Bashir accumulate money, but...it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> humanize them. Look they're not dogmatic hotheads, the play <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> They're just like us. Which, depending on your viewpoint improves your opinion of the jihadists or lowers it of the whole of humanity." ...|$|R
6000|$|The old man muttered {{under his}} breath [...] "If only my sister were here!" [...] and looked helplessly at his son. His son looked at the five natives. The five natives looked at the Captain. The Captain looked at nobody: his eyes were cast down, and he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> softly to himself [...] "Contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure. I {{contemplate}} Myself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Was {{there ever}} such unconsciousness? He {{did not seem}} to think that he at all {{deserved}} a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> to himself--"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians." ...|$|E
6000|$|I crept {{away more}} {{cautiously}} than I had come, and, standing carelessly in my tent door, whistled the call I always used in feeding the birds. Like a flash Killooleet {{appeared on the}} edge of the cracker box, looking very much surprised. [...] "I thought you were away; why, I thought you were away," [...] he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> Then he clucked, and the tunk-a-tunk ceased instantly. Another cluck, and Mrs. Killooleet appeared, looking frightened; then, one after another, the five little Killooleets bobbed up; and there they sat in a solemn row {{on the edge of}} the cracker box, turning their heads sidewise to see me better.|$|E
50|$|Another {{theme of}} the novel, though not {{unrelated}} <b>to</b> the first, <b>is</b> 'the issue of resistance versus collaboration'. Beauvoir <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that <b>to</b> not actively resist the German occupation <b>is</b> in effect <b>to</b> accept it. This, argues David E. Cooper, is an illustration of an existentialist view {{of the nature of}} freedom, according to which an individual is just as responsible for not refusing something as for choosing it. Any distinction between choosing and not refusing is elided.|$|R
500|$|His message {{late in life}} <b>is</b> {{contrary}} <b>to</b> the humanistic view of man {{as essentially}} good but easily corrupted. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that violence <b>is</b> innate in man, [...] "forged in the substance of what, since Freud, we have called the id." [...] Hughes believed {{that in the end}} there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of Goya's dog, [...] "whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya." ...|$|R
5000|$|Swift also {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} playing to stadiums, stating that [...] "the challenge with a stadium show is making those people in the very top row feel like they got an intimate, personal experience." [...] The following month {{in an interview with}} KIIS-FM, she revealed that she knew what the stage would look like, as well as knowing that [...] "all the fans <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that they really don't want any song 1989 left off the setlist".|$|R
6000|$|A very old, rotten, dingy {{strip of}} black silk, with thin lilac lines, all blurred and deadened with dirt, running across {{and across the}} stuff {{in a sort of}} trellis-work pattern. The small end of the cravat was hemmed in the usual way, but the other end was all jagged, as if the morsel then in my hands had been torn off violently {{from the rest of the}} stuff. A chill ran all over me as I looked at it; for that poor, stained, {{crumpled}} end of a cravat <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> to me, as though it had been in plain words: [...] "If she dies, she has come to her death by foul means, and I am the witness of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{hall was}} empty. Its {{appearance}} had changed very greatly {{since his first}} sight of it. It had suffered serious injury in the violent struggle of the first outbreak. On the right hand side of the great figure {{the upper half of}} the wall had been torn away for nearly two hundred feet of its length, and a sheet of the same glassy film that had enclosed Graham at his awakening had been drawn across the gap. This deadened, but did not altogether exclude the roar of the people outside. [...] "Wards! Wards! Wards!" [...] they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> Through it there were visible the beams and supports of metal scaffoldings that rose and fell according to the requirements of a great crowd of workmen. An idle building machine, with lank arms of red painted metal stretched gauntly across this green tinted picture. On it were still a number of workmen staring at the crowd below. For a moment he stood regarding these things, and Asano overtook him.|$|E
6000|$|But {{let us be}} just; it is not all pretence; the {{inability}} of Mr. Austen Chamberlain to grasp the simple facts before him was undoubtedly genuine. He followed Mr. Burdett Coutts, in support of Mr. Burdett Coutts, with the most Christian disregard of the nasty things Mr. Burdett Coutts had <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> about the Birmingham caucus from which he sprang. He had a childish story to tell of how voters would not give their first votes to their real preferences, because they would assume he [...] "would get in in any case"--God knows why. Of course {{on the assumption that}} the voter behaves like an idiot, anything is possible. And never apparently having heard of fractions, this great Birmingham leader was unable to understand that a voter who puts 1 against a candidate's name votes for that candidate anyhow. He could not imagine any feeling on the part of the voter that No. 1 was his man. A vote is a vote to this simple rather than lucid mind, a thing one and indivisible. Read this-- ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{response}} <b>to</b> Intimacy Remixed <b>was</b> generally negative. Emily Tartanella of PopMatters {{explained that}} the remixers' efforts ultimately make Bloc Party's work [...] "less engaging, less meaningful". Ben Patashnik of NME stated that the album is largely monotonous and includes too many pedestrian experiments in dance music. Drowned in Sound's Chris Power indicated that [...] "in putting their names to the album Bloc Party <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> they either don't care about what they ask fans to spend their money on or they don't know much about electronic music".|$|R
50|$|Bimal K. Matilal (1990) {{has tried}} to unify these views - he feels that for Bhartṛhari the very process of {{thinking}} involves vibrations, so that thought has some sound-like properties. Thought operates by śabdanaor 'speaking', - so that the mechanisms of thought {{are the same as}} that of language. Indeed, Bhartṛhari <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that thought <b>is</b> not possible without language. This leads to a somewhat whorfian position on the relationship between language and thought. The sphoṭa then is the carrier of this thought, as a primordial vibration.|$|R
5000|$|The Christian Science Monitors {{film critic}} Peter Rainer said that {{director}} [...] "André Téchiné makes movies about {{people whose lives}} are perpetually in flux - the more fluctuations the better. In the human comedy, Téchiné <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>to</b> his delight, nothing stays the same. Here is something exasperating and yet marvelous about Téchinés approach, and this dichotomy is no more apparent than in his latest film, Unforgivable, {{which is about a}} best-selling crime novelist whose personal life is as messy as his books are carefully plotted." ...|$|R
