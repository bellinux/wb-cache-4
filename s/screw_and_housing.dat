40|$|Background: Although {{stimulus}} evoked electromyography (EMG) {{is commonly}} used to confirm the accuracy of pedicle screw placement. There are no studies to differentiate between solid <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> hollow <b>screws</b> to the electrical resistance of pedicle screws. We speculate that the electrical resistance of the solid <b>and</b> hollow pedicle <b>screws</b> may be different and then a potential source of error with stimulus-evoked EMG may happen. Materials and Methods: Resistance measurements were obtained from 12 pedicle screw varieties (6 screws of each manufacturer) across the screw shank based on known constant current and measured voltage. The voltage was measured 5 times at each site. Results: Resistance of all solid screws ranged from 0. 084 Omega to 0. 151 Omega (mean = 0. 118 +/- 0. 024 Omega) <b>and</b> hollow <b>screws</b> ranged from 0. 148 Omega to 0. 402 Omega (mean = 0. 285 +/- 0. 081 Omega). There {{was a significant difference}} of resistance between the solid <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> hollow <b>screws</b> (P < 0. 05). The screw with the largest diameter no matter solid screws or hollow screws had lower resistance than screws with other diameters. No matter in solid screws group or hollow screws group, there were significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the 5. 0 mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> 6. 0 mm screws, 6. 0 mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> 7. 0 mm screws, 5. 0 mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> 7. 0 mm screws, 4. 5 mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> 5. 5 mm screws, 5. 5 mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> 6. 5 mm screws, 4. 5 mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> 6. 5 mm screws. The resistance of hollow screws was much larger than the solid screws in the same diameter group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Hollow pedicle screws have the potential for high electrical resistance compared to the solid pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> therefore may affect the EMG response during stimulus-evoked EMG testing in pedicle screw fixation especially in minimally invasive percutaneous pedical screw fixation surgery.

30|$|There are {{different}} sizes of plate available to fix metacarpal fractures (1.5 -mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> titanium mini plates, 2.0 -mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> stainless-steel AO mini plates, <b>and</b> 2.7 -mm <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> stainless-steel AO mini plates). Ultralow-profile plates are also available. We used 2.0 -mm stainless-steel AO mini plates with 2.0 -mm screws. Souer et al. describe {{the use of}} “escape” screws, i.e., a 2.4 -mm screw through a 2.0 -mm plate, in metaphyseal bone if satisfactory purchase is not obtained with a 2.0 -mm screw [9]. However, in our cases {{we were able to}} get satisfactory purchase with 2.0 -mm screws.|$|R
