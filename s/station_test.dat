50|$|The {{many steps}} and careful {{evaluations}} of Hanoverian breeding stock are {{organized by the}} verband and district breeders' clubs (bezirkverband). The district clubs are primarily responsible for local mare and foal shows. Foals of that year are presented, usually at their dam's side, to a panel of licensed breed judges. Foals of acceptable quality are branded, their papers are signed, and they are entered into the foal registry. Judges also use this venue to recommend exceptional foals for stallion candidacy or auction participation. Mares return to the mare shows as three-year-olds to be evaluated for entry into the studbook; only such mares can have registered Hanoverian foals. The young mares are evaluated on their conformation and gaits {{to ensure that they}} are of sufficient quality. Another component of the mare shows is the field test, in which young mares are evaluated for their suitability for and age-appropriate competency in dressage and show jumping. The majority of young mares participate in the field test or <b>station</b> <b>test</b> for mares, as proof of performance is required for the mother of any stallion candidate, {{as well as for the}} State's Premium. The best mares are awarded the State's Premium (Staatspraemie), a monetary prize provided by the government of Lower Saxony aimed at keeping the finest mares in the local breeding population. Every other year, one of the seven district breeders' clubs hosts the Louis Wiegels show. The best three- and four-year-old mares from each district attend, and to win is a great honor. Alternating years with the Louis Wiegels Mare show, the verband hosts the Herwert von der Decken mare show in Verden.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} was conducted on Hungarian pig seed stocks. The breeds, which {{were used in the}} investigation, were Hungarian Large White, Hungarian Landrace, Duroc, and Pietrain respectively. Regarding the field test (own performance test) 40391; 54523; 4318; 3501; different animals were recorded in the above mentioned breeds. Meanwhile in the <b>station</b> <b>test</b> 3911; 2457; 695; 568 records were used concerning the same breeds. Genetic parameters were estimated using the software VCE 4 developed by Groeneveld (1998). Variance components were obtained by running a joint model (field and <b>station</b> <b>test).</b> During the analysis special attention was given to the received genetic correlation coefficients in order to compare the results of the field and station tests respectively. Genetic correlation coefficients of 0. 52; 0. 36; 0, 43; 0. 80 were found between the age {{at the time of the}} test (field test) and days of fattening (<b>station</b> <b>test)</b> having the same order of the breeds as previously. The moderately high genetic correlation coefficients between these previously mentioned traits (representing the growing intensity) justify that these methods are based upon each other and make the efficient selection possible. Among the traits representing meat quality genetic correlation coefficients of – 0. 13; - 0. 41; - 0. 63; + 0. 13 were found between the average backfat depth (field test) and valuable cuts (<b>station</b> <b>test)</b> respectively. The high variability of the coefficients suggests the need for further investigation of this area and also the importance of precise measurement of the average backfat depth since a possible imprecise measurement of this trait might be the reason for the received variability. ...|$|E

The analysis was based on the national database (1997 – 2003) using univariate and bivariate animal models. Estimated heritabilities for <b>station</b> <b>test</b> traits ranged between 0. 34 – 0. 69 (except for meat quality score, where the heritability was low (0. 10, 0. 15 for HLW and HL, respectively) and exceeded that of the field test traits (0. 18 – 0. 23).
