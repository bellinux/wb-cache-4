40|$|With the {{regulatory}} requirements for risk management, Value at Risk (VaR) {{has become an}} essential tool in determining capital reserves to protect the risk induced by adverse market movements. The fact that VaR is not coherent has motivated the industry to explore alternative risk measures such as expected <b>shortfall.</b> The first objective {{of this paper is}} to propose statistical methods for estimating multiple-period expected <b>shortfall</b> under GARCH models. In addition to the expected <b>shortfall,</b> we investigate a new tool called median <b>shortfall</b> to measure risk. The second objective {{of this paper is to}} develop backtesting methods for assessing the performance of expected <b>shortfall</b> and median <b>shortfall</b> estimators from statistical and financial perspectives. By applying our expected <b>shortfall</b> estimators and other existing approaches to seven international markets, we demonstrate the superiority of our methods with respect to statistical and practical evaluations. Our expected <b>shortfall</b> estimators likely provide an unbiased reference for setting the minimum capital required for safeguarding against expected loss...|$|R

We show that minimizing <b>shortfall</b> generally improves performance over minimizing variance, especially during down-markets, {{over the period}} 1985 - 2010. The outperformance of <b>shortfall</b> is due to intuitive tilts towards protective factors like Value, and away from aggressive factors like Growth and Momentum. The outperformance is largest for the <b>shortfall</b> that measures overall asymmetry rather than the extreme losses. ...|$|R

40|$|A key {{challenge}} for retired investors is determining the stock-bond asset allocation that, {{for a given}} spending rate, minimizes the probability of shortfall—having real wealth drop below a specified floor during the investor’s lifetime. Standard portfolio analysis yields the well-known tradeoff between risk and return described by the Markowitz frontier. For retirement planning, we reconceptualize this as a tradeoff between <b>shortfall</b> probability (risk) and the median value of terminal wealth (return). For specified assumptions, there is a stock-bond asset allocation that minimizes <b>shortfall</b> risk. Portfolios with more stocks increase the median values of terminal wealth, but {{at the expense of}} higher <b>shortfall</b> risk. Portfolios with less stocks are inferior in that they decrease the median value of terminal wealth and increase <b>shortfall</b> risk. We find that a 50 / 50 stock-bond mix is a remarkably robust rule for (approximately) minimizing <b>shortfall</b> risk for a variety of plausible assumptions about asset returns, investment strategies, and what constitutes a <b>shortfall.</b> 1 <b>Shortfall</b> Risk Bobby Layne, a hall-of-fame football quarterback, once said, “My idea of a full life is to ru...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} value-at-risk (VaR) and {{expected}} <b>shortfall</b> under market stress. Assuming that the multivariate extreme value distribution represents asset returns under market stress, we simulate asset returns with this distribution. With these simulated asset returns, we examine whether market stress affects {{the properties of}} VaR and expected <b>shortfall.</b> Our findings are as follows. First, VaR and expected <b>shortfall</b> may underestimate the risk of securities with fat- tailed properties and a high potential for large losses. Second, VaR and expected <b>shortfall</b> may both disregard the tail dependence of asset returns. Third, expected <b>shortfall</b> has {{less of a problem}} in disregarding the fat tails and the tail dependence than VaR does. ...|$|R

Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version.

5|$|In July 2010, RA {{organizers}} {{announced that}} the film festival would move from October 2010 to April 2011 because of funding <b>shortfalls.</b> One news source reported that RA organizers had intended to hold an October film festival, but a community fundraiser brought in only $5,000—far less than hoped, and not enough to allow an October festival to occur. The move to April was prompted, in part, by the hope that a $75,000 D.C. government grant would allow the festival to occur. However, on March 8, 2011, RA officials cancelled the April event because of continuing heavy debt and because several grants had not been awarded to the organization.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{practical}} and effective extension of portfolio risk management and construction best practices {{to account for}} extreme events. The central element of the extension is (expected) <b>shortfall,</b> which is the expected loss given that a value-at-risk limit is breached. <b>Shortfall</b> is the most basic measure of extreme risk, and unlike volatility and value at risk, it probes the tails of portfolio return and profit/loss distributions. Consequently, <b>shortfall</b> is (in principle) a guide to allocating reserve capital. Since it is a convex measure, <b>shortfall</b> can (again, in principle) {{be used as an}} optimization constraint either alone or in combination with volatility. “In principle ” becomes “in practice ” only if <b>shortfall</b> can be forecast accurately. A recent body of research uses factor models to generate robust, empirically accurate <b>shortfall</b> forecasts that can be analyzed with standard risk management tools such as betas, risk budgets and factor correlations. An important insight is that a long history of returns to risk factors can inform short-horizon <b>shortfall</b> forecasts in a meaningful way.

Expected <b>shortfall</b> is consistent with expected utility maximization and is free of tail risk, under more lenient conditions than VaR. ...|$|R

5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet <b>shortfalls.</b> Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E

Large numbers of reserve personnel have also been deployed as part of ADF operations in Australia's region; this has included the deployment of Army Reserve rifle companies to East Timor and the Solomon Islands.

5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be {{crucial for the}} success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply <b>shortfalls</b> hampered their preparations.

Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days after the operation began.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-financing}} trading strategy that minimizes the expected <b>shortfall</b> locally when hedging a European contingent claim. A positive <b>shortfall</b> occurs if the hedger {{is not willing}} to follow a perfect hedging or a superhedging strategy. In contrast to the classical variance criterion, the expected <b>shortfall</b> criterion depends only on undesirable outcomes where the terminal value of the written option exceeds the terminal value of the hedge portfolio. Searching a strategy which minimizes the expected <b>shortfall</b> is equivalent to the iterative solution of linear programs whose number increases exponentially with respect to the number of trading dates. Therefore, we partition this complex overall problem into several one-period problems and minimize the expected <b>shortfall</b> only locally, i. e., only over the next trading period. This approximation is quite accurate and the number of linear programs to be solved increases only linearly with respect to the number of trading dates...|$|R

In this paper, we report four experiments measuring the eye movements of participants while they read short passages of text.
