25|$|It was {{the second}} time {{in less than a week}} that a Cirque show on the Strip was halted for an {{accident}} involving one of its artists; a performer in one of the final preview performances of Michael Jackson One at Mandalay Bay suffered a mild concussion after slipping through the <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> in the show’s “Stranger in Moscow” scene, missing the protective pad below the act and landing hard upon the stage. The performer was expected to return to the show.|$|E
25|$|Slacklining {{refers to}} the act of walking or {{balancing}} along a suspended length of flat webbing that is tensioned between two anchors. Slacklining is similar to <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> walking and tightrope walking. Slacklines differ from tightwires and tightropes {{in the type of}} material used and the amount of tension applied during use. Slacklines are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or tightwires {{in order to create a}} dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long and narrow trampoline. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various circumstances. Slacklining is popular because of its simplicity and versatility; it can be used in various environments with few components.|$|E
50|$|UCCS has a {{large number}} of club sports {{including}} a dance team and a cheerleading club, cycling, baseball, billiards, fencing, hockey, karate, kendo, kung fu, lacrosse, paintball, racquetball, rugby, tai chi, tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, women's soccer, and an active intramural program. The intramural sports include flag football, ultimate frisbee, outdoor soccer, table tennis, root beer pong, volleyball, basketball, billiards, and a 3-point shooting contest. Snowboarding, skiing, rock climbing, bouldering, hiking, mountain biking, trail running, and lesser common <b>slack</b> <b>roping</b> and 4-wheeling are popular student activities at UCCS due to the proximity to Pikes Peak, Garden of the Gods, and the surrounding mountainous terrain.|$|R
50|$|The belayer {{should keep}} the rope locked {{off in the}} belay device {{whenever}} the climber is not moving. As the climber moves on the climb, the belayer must {{make sure that the}} climber has the right amount of rope by paying out or pulling in excess rope. If the climber falls, the free-fall the distance of the <b>slack</b> or unprotected <b>rope</b> before the friction applied by the belayer starts to slow their descent. Too much <b>slack</b> on the <b>rope</b> increases the distance of a possible fall, but too little <b>slack</b> on the <b>rope</b> may prevent the climber from moving up the rock. It is important for the belayer to closely monitor the climber's situation, as the belayer's role is crucial to the climber's safety.|$|R
60|$|Efforts {{had been}} made, by <b>slacking</b> the <b>ropes</b> and {{altering}} {{the set of}} the sails, to give the brig as slovenly an appearance as possible. The guns had been run in and the portholes closed and, as the Spaniard approached, the crew--with the exception of five or six men--were ordered to keep below the bulwarks.|$|R
6000|$|... [37] This {{piece was}} called in, and {{destroyed}} by the noble author; but Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, when opposing Lord Grimestone at an election, maliciously printed and dispersed a large impression of his smothered performance, with a frontispiece representing an elephant dancing on the <b>slack</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jones evidently {{had that}} in mind. When {{he reached the}} middle fork of the cedar, he stood erect and {{extended}} the noose of his lasso {{on the point of}} his pole. Tom, with a hiss and snap, struck at it savagely. The second trial tempted the lion to saw the rope with his teeth. In a flash Jones withdrew the pole, and lifted a loop of the <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> over the lion's ears.|$|E
60|$|So I {{walked up}} to Cubby with a manner more bold than sincere. He had not eaten anything, but he had drunk the water we had left for him. To my {{surprise}} he made no fuss when I untied the rope; on the other hand, he seemed to look pleased, and I thought I detected a cunning gleam in his little eyes. He paddled away down the canyon, and, as {{this was in the}} direction we wanted to go, I gave him <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> and followed.|$|E
60|$|In another second I {{had fallen}} on the deck as they <b>slacked</b> the <b>rope.</b> Near me stood two black men whose office it was to cast us poor wretches into the sea, and behind them, seated in a chair, his face haggard from recent illness, sat de Garcia fanning himself with his sombrero, for the night was very hot.|$|R
60|$|The {{clothes were}} soon unwound from the rope, {{and put on}} again. Captain Holland cut off all the <b>slack</b> of the <b>rope,</b> and made it into a coil.|$|R

60|$|The other looked doubtful, but Festing {{took off}} his heavy boots, and picking up {{the end of the}} rope they had used to move the pulley, walked {{to the edge of the}} island. He was now a short {{distance}} above the skip, and hoped the eddies would help him to reach the ledge it rested on before he was swept past; but he must avoid being drawn into the main stream, since there was not much chance of landing on the foam-swept rocks lower down. Making sure he had enough <b>slack</b> <b>rope,</b> he plunged in.|$|E
60|$|I {{set off for}} London, therefore, full of new hopes. I {{was to be the}} restorer of Shakespeare and nature, and the {{legitimate}} drama; my very swagger was to be heroic, and my cracked voice the standard of elocution. Alas, sir! my usual luck attended me. Before I arrived in the metropolis, a rival wonder had appeared. A woman who could dance the <b>slack</b> <b>rope,</b> and run up a cord from the stage to the gallery with fire-works all round her. She was seized on by the management with avidity; she was the saving of the great national theatre for the season. Nothing was talked of but Madame Saqui's fire-works and flame-colored pantaloons; and nature, Shakespeare, {{the legitimate}} drama, and poor Pillgarlick were completely left in the lurch.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{straining}} tug {{and long}} wet line of working raft drew ahead, while the sloop crawled on, close-hauled, towards the south. Late that night, however, the mists melted away, and a keen rushing breeze {{that came out}} of the north crisped the water. She sprang forward when the ripples reached her; the flapping canvas went to sleep, and while each <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> tightened a musical tinkle broke out at the bows. It grew steadily louder, and when the sun swung up red above the eastern hills, she had piled the white froth to her channels and was driving forward merrily, with little sparkling seas tumbling, foam-tipped, after her. The wind fell light as the sun rose higher, but she ran on all day, and the western sky was still blazing with a wondrous green when she stole into Vancouver harbour.|$|E
6000|$|... “In with her,” shouted Kirby, exerting {{himself in}} a manner that left nothing for those in his rear to do, but to gather up the <b>slack</b> of the <b>rope</b> which passed through his hands.|$|R

60|$|<b>Slacking</b> off the <b>rope</b> {{they let}} the boat drift astern again to its full extent. Then, without a word, without even a look, father and son lay down {{together}} in the stern-sheets, and were instantly buried in a profound deathlike slumber.|$|R

60|$|The {{truth of}} that was very soon in evidence. Cubby would not let well enough alone, {{and he would not}} have a <b>slack</b> <b>rope.</b> I think he wanted to choke himself or pull my arms out. When I {{realized}} that Cubby was three times as strong as I was I began to see that my work was cut out for me. The more, however, that he jerked me and hauled me along, the more I determined to hang on. I thought I had a genuine love for him up to the time he had almost knocked my head off, but it was funny how easily he roused my anger after that. What would have happened had he taken a notion to go through the brush? Luckily he kept to the trail, which certainly was rough enough. So, with watching the cub and keeping my feet free of roots and rocks, I had no chance to look ahead. Still I had no concern about this, for the old hunter was at my heels, and I knew he would keep a sharp lookout.|$|E
60|$|But as {{the supreme}} power can {{certainly}} do ten thousand things more than it ought, so there are several things which some people may think it can do, although it really cannot. For, it unfortunately happens, that edicts which cannot be executed, will not alter the nature of things. So, if a king and parliament should please to enact, that a woman who hath been a month married, is virgo intacta, would that actually restore her to her primitive state? If the supreme power should resolve a corporal of dragoons {{to be a doctor}} of divinity, law or physic, few, I believe, would trust their souls, fortunes, or bodies to his direction; because that power is neither fit to judge or teach those qualifications which are absolutely necessary to the several professions. Put the case that walking on the <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> were the only talent required by act of parliament for making a man a bishop; no doubt, when a man had done his feat of activity in form, he might sit in the House of Lords, put on his robes and his rochet, go down to his palace, receive and spend his rents; but it requireth very little Christianity to believe this tumbler to be one whit more a bishop than he was before; because the law of God hath otherwise decreed; which law, although a nation may refuse to receive it, cannot alter in its own nature.|$|E
60|$|But no {{one would}} obey, so, uttering a curse upon his comrades, he passed the rope round a stanchion, and {{with his right hand}} {{partially}} hoisted the sail, while with his left he hauled in the <b>slack</b> of the <b>rope.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That is enough. Come back a little, {{but keep}} {{a firm grip}} of it. That is right!" [...] he shouted, as he twisted the <b>slack</b> of the <b>rope</b> over the cleet. [...] "Now, lads, down with the tack; down with it! Belay!" ...|$|R
50|$|Self-belay {{is the use}} of {{belaying}} equipment by {{a single}} person while rock climbing or mountaineering. Typically, belaying involves a two person team: a climber ascends, while a belayer takes in their <b>rope</b> <b>slack,</b> ready to catch and arrest their fall; when self-belaying, the climber plays both roles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Having {{completed}} my preparations, I imparted to the avuncular pendulum {{a gentle}} oscillation, and retiring to cover behind a contiguous rock, lifted up my voice {{in a long}} rasping cry whose diminishing final note was drowned in a noise {{like that of a}} swearing cat, which emanated from the sack. Instantly that formidable sheep was upon its feet and had taken in the military situation at a glance. In a few moments it had approached, stamping, to within fifty yards of the swinging foeman, who, now retreating and anon advancing, seemed to invite the fray. Suddenly I saw the beast's head drop earthward as if depressed by the weight of its enormous horns; then a dim, white, wavy streak of sheep prolonged itself from that spot in a generally horizontal direction to within about four yards of a point immediately beneath the enemy. There it struck sharply upward, and before it had faded from my gaze at the place whence it had set out I heard a horrid thump and a piercing scream, and my poor uncle shot forward, with a <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> higher than the limb to which he was attached. Here the rope tautened with a jerk, arresting his flight, and back he swung in a breathless curve {{to the other end of}} his arc. The ram had fallen, a heap of indistinguishable legs, wool and horns, but pulling itself together and dodging as its antagonist swept downward it retired at random, alternately shaking its head and stamping its fore-feet. When it had backed about the same distance as that from which it had delivered the assault it paused again, bowed its head as if in prayer for victory and again shot forward, dimly visible as before--a prolonging white streak with monstrous undulations, ending with a sharp ascension. Its course this time was at a right angle to its former one, and its impatience so great that it struck the enemy before he had nearly reached the lowest point of his arc. In consequence he went flying round and round in a horizontal circle whose radius was about equal to half the length of the rope, which I forgot to say was nearly twenty feet long. His shrieks, crescendo in approach and diminuendo in recession, made the rapidity of his revolution more obvious to the ear than to the eye. He had evidently not yet been struck in a vital spot. His posture in the sack and the distance from the ground at which he hung compelled the ram to operate upon his lower extremities and the end of his back. Like a plant that has struck its root into some poisonous mineral, my poor uncle was dying slowly upward.|$|E

5000|$|When the <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> {{is taken}} in by the belayer and it becomes tight and {{therefore}} the belayer doesn't {{need to take the}} rope in any more the climber says [...] "That's me" ...|$|E
5000|$|Whippers {{can be very}} {{dramatic}} falls, often for quite a distance. The distance of a whipper is determined {{by a number of}} factors, including <b>rope</b> stretch, any <b>slack</b> in the <b>rope</b> before the climber is ejected, and discrepancies in the relative weights between the climber and the belayer.|$|R
60|$|A deathlike stillness prevailed, {{while the}} {{subordinates}} adjusted the rope, {{and placed the}} condemned man on the grating. Then the <b>slack</b> of the <b>rope</b> was drawn in by hand, and the men were ordered to lay hold of the instrument of death, and to stretch it along the deck.|$|R
60|$|They <b>slacked</b> another <b>rope,</b> {{making the}} gaff sink farther down, {{after which they}} tied up about a yard of the inner bottom corner of the sail {{to the foot of}} the mast. This was {{comparatively}} easy, but it was different when, standing in the water on the lee deck, they grabbed the tackle beneath the boom and endeavored to pull the leach, or outer edge, of the mainsail down. It would not come, and the heavy spar struck them as it jerked in board, flinging Frank off into the well.|$|R
50|$|Tightrope walking, {{also called}} funambulism, is {{the skill of}} walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long {{tradition}} in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> walking and slacklining.|$|E
50|$|The {{corporate}} entertain industry, {{as well as}} festival, fetes and gala events saw him perform various street theatre and circus skill performances including juggling, uni-cycling, fire-eating, ladder walking, global {{walking and}} of course mime. He also performed feats such as walking on glass, robotics, lying {{on a bed of}} nails and walking on a <b>slack</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E

60|$|All seemed {{perfectly}} still on this side, {{and he was}} gradually and steadily lowered down. Presently those above felt the <b>rope</b> <b>slack.</b> Another minute and it swung loosely.

60|$|With great efforts {{they managed}} to rid {{themselves}} of their armour, and then held on with ease to the rope.

Putting their feet in this, they were able to stand with their heads above the surface without difficulty.|$|R
