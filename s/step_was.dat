5|$|The Canary Islands were colonised in two waves. The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the {{occupation}} of Tenerife and La Gomera 1.9–2.3 million years ago, followed by a separate invasion of El Hierro and La Palma 1.3–1.8 mya.|$|E
5|$|An {{outline of}} the origins of the {{parasitic}} life style has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary <b>step</b> <b>was</b> a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{enormously}} {{popular with the}} American public. Streets, public works, and children were named after him. Even a dance <b>step</b> <b>was</b> named after him. In 1955, his promotion to General of the Armies was proposed in Congress, but the proposal was shelved.|$|E

50|$|Lippincott Mercer {{has come}} up with four {{principles}} of experience design. The beginning <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to identify key customer data and feedback. The next <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to figure out your target audience and figure out what will have the greatest impact on consumers. The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to turn the findings into project priorities. The final <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to apply the strategy and monitor the purchases.|$|R

5|$|The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{a precise}} {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, {{as well as by}} analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of skilled}} craftspeople in Northumberland made the {{construction}} of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates that the main staircase was assembled from a kit. It is one step too short for the Northumberland hallway, but no extra <b>step</b> <b>was</b> added to finish off the symmetry of the stairwell, suggesting a dearth of skilled labor.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
30|$|Problems 3 and 4 are {{unconstrained}} {{integer programming}} problems. To solve Problems 3 and 4, we {{will develop a}} three-step algorithm. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> the selection of an initial point, the second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> a local search, while the third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> a global approach.|$|R
40|$|Mammography is used {{to detect}} breast cancer in women. This paper {{provides}} methodology for breast mass detection and classification. It consists of four <b>steps.</b> First <b>step</b> <b>is</b> enhancement of mammogram image using homomorphic filtering. Second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> segment the enhanced image using local seed region growing algorithm. Third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> feature extraction using shearlet transform.

5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this <b>step</b> <b>was</b> supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; the next logical <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to build a telescope that could look at {{all parts of the}} sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
50|$|Three <b>steps</b> <b>are</b> {{taken to}} be water positive: The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to measure 100% of the water {{consumption}} throughout the value chain, the second is to reduce to a minimum the water usage needed and the third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to compensate more water than the process has used.|$|R
30|$|It {{is noted}} that the first two <b>steps</b> <b>are</b> the normal {{operations}} in the system using pilot signals. The last <b>step</b> <b>is</b> needed for any PU detection scheme. Only the third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> additionally required for implementing the proposed scheme, of which complexity is low {{as described in the}} next section.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> termolecular {{because it}} {{involves}} three reactant molecules, while the second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> bimolecular {{because it involves}} two reactant molecules.|$|R
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another <b>step</b> <b>was</b> needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to obtain a}} high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although {{there was also a}} special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Rubinstein's first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to found}} the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were {{to educate people}} in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to {{a considerable amount of}} Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E

30|$|The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> {{transitioning}} {{state of}} butadiene to ethylene molecules. The sixth <b>step</b> <b>is</b> transitioning state of ethylene to CO 2. Dipole moments for all <b>steps</b> <b>are</b> calculated and {{are shown in}} Tables  1, 2, and 3, most changes {{of which are in}} the transition state of intermediates (third and sixth steps).|$|R
5|$|The Mendelian and biometrician {{models were}} {{eventually}} reconciled {{with the development}} of population genetics. A key <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths, and showed that natural selection worked at an even faster rate than Fisher assumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Fort Mohave {{began the process}} of military subjugation of the Mohave, and the next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the establishment of reservations. In 1863, Charles Debrille Poston, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the US against the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed {{an important step in}} establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave.|$|E
5|$|The new route turned {{west from}} Muong May, at the {{southern}} end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually, this network extended past Siem Prang and reached the Mekong River near Stung Treng. The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the seizure of the town of Kratie, in east central Cambodia, on 5 May. The 470th cleared the population out of the Mekong River town and turned it into its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains and then east again to cross the border.|$|E

5|$|The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to broach}} {{the matter with}} the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir John Anderson, as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who {{had been involved in}} Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
5|$|The next <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to take an}} oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, {{at the age of}} 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E

The second <b>step</b> <b>is</b> weathering and erosion that enlarges the fractures, producing fins. The third <b>step</b> <b>is</b> erosion attacking fins from below, causing windows and arches. The fourth <b>step</b> <b>is</b> continuing weathering that enlarges holes, causing arches and holes to collapse, creating spires or hoodoos.|$|R
