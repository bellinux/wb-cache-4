40|$|Soma-germline {{interactions}} control fertility at many levels, including {{stem cell}} proliferation, meiosis and gametogenesis, yet {{the nature of}} these fundamental signaling mechanisms and their potential evolutionary conservation are incompletely understood. In C. elegans, a sperm-sensing mechanism regulates oocyte meiotic maturation and ovulation, tightly coordinating sperm availability and fertilization. Sperm release the major sperm protein (MSP) signal to trigger meiotic resumption (meiotic maturation) and to promote contraction of the follicle-like gonadal <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> that surround oocytes. Using genetic mosaic analysis, we show that all known MSP-dependent meiotic maturation events in the germline require Gαs-adenylate cyclase signaling in the gonadal <b>sheath</b> <b>cells.</b> We show that the MSP hormone promotes the sustained actomyosin-dependent cytoplasmic streaming that drives oocyte growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that efficient oocyte production and cytoplasmic streaming require Gαs-adenylate cyclase signaling in the gonadal <b>sheath</b> <b>cells,</b> thereby providing a somatic mechanism that coordinates oocyte growth and meiotic maturation with sperm availability. We present genetic evidence that MSP and Gαs-adenylate cyclase signaling regulate oocyte growth and meiotic maturation in part by antagonizing gap-junctional communication between <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> and oocytes. In the absence of MSP or Gαs-adenylate cyclase signaling, MSP binding sites are enriched and appear clustered on <b>sheath</b> <b>cells.</b> We discuss these results {{in the context of a}} model in which the <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> function as the major initial sensor of MSP, potentially via multiple classes of G-protein-coupled receptors.

50|$|The Drosophila {{external}} sensory organ is a sensory {{structure in}} the peripheral nervous system that consists of four cells; a neuron, a <b>sheath</b> <b>cell</b> that surrounds the dendrite, and hair and socket cells, which are considered the “outer” support cells. All four cell fates are descendants of the sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell. In response to the proper cues, SOPs first divide into two secondary precursor cells. The posterior daughter cell is called the pIIa cell and the anterior daughter cell is called the pIIb. The pIIa cell divides to produce a bristle cell and a socket cell, while the pIIb cell divides to produce a neuron and a glial cell. The asymmetric division of the SOP into daughter cells with distinct fates is dependent upon the distribution of Numb. Numb is distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm until mitotic division, when it is selectively localized to the anterior pole of the cell. Thus, Numb is selectively segregated into the pIIb daughter cell upon division of the SOP.|$|E

Previously we found that mutations in theceh- 18 gene, which encodes a POU-class homeoprotein expressed in sheath cells, result in oocyte defects. To determine the basis for these oocyte defects, we have used time-lapse video Nomarski microscopy to observe meiotic maturation, ovulation, and early embryogenesis inceh- 18 mutants. Inceh- 18 mutants <b>sheath</b> <b>cell</b> contractions are weaker, less frequent, and uncoordinated throughout the sequence of ovulation events, and ovulation is defective.

Analysis of <b>sheath</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation inceh- 18 mutants using antibodies to proteins of the contractile apparatus reveals that although contractile proteins are expressed, the sheath cells appear disorganized.

Efforts are under-way to engineer improved varieties of the C 3 cereal crop rice by introducing NADP-malic enzyme C 4 photosynthesis using maize as a model system. However, several modifications to the rice leaf vasculature are potentially necessary, including the introduction of suberin lamellae into the bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cell</b> walls. Suberized cell walls are ubiquitous in the root endodermis of all grasses, and developmental similarities are apparent between endodermis and bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cell</b> walls. Nonetheless, there is considerable heterogeneity in <b>sheath</b> <b>cell</b> development and suberin composi-tion both within and between grass taxa. The effect of this variation on physiological function remains ambiguous over forty years after suberin lamellae were initially proposed to regulate solute and photoassimilate fluxes and C 4 gas exchange. Interspecies variation has confounded efforts to ascribe physiological differences specifically to the pres-ence or absence of suberin lamellae. Thus, specific perturbation of suberization within a uniform genetic background is needed, but, until recently, the genetic resources to manipulate suberin composition in the grasses were largely unavailable. The recent dissection of the suberin biosynthesis pathway in model dicots and the identification of sev-eral promising candidate genes in model grasses will facilitate the characterization of the first suberin biosynthesis genes in a monocot.

The results accord with the notion that a deficiency of carbonic anhydrase in bundle sheath cells is vital for the efficient operation of the C 4 pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the leaf blade of P. ecklonii Nees {{collected}} in the eastern Cape was investigated with light and transmission electron microscopes. The leaf blades of this material contain three orders of closely spaced vascular bundles, {{each of which is}} surrounded by a radiating mesophyll, and an underlying bundle sheath, which consists of relatively thick-walled, chlorenchymatous <b>cells.</b> Bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> contain large, centrifugally arranged, agranal chloroplasts. The longitudinal bundles are separated by one layer of achlorophyllous mesophyll. The outer tangential and radial walls of the bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> contain a suberized compound middle lamella. Few mitochondria occur in bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> and are usually closely associated with plasmodesmatal pits in the outer tangential walls of the bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells.</b> Large bundles are subtended by ad- as well as abaxial hypodermal sclerenchyma strands. Intermediate bundles are connected to the adaxial hypodermal sclerenchyma strands by a single-layered bundle sheath extension, and the bundle sheath is in direct contact with hypodermal sclerenchyma strands abaxially. Small bundles are embedded in mesophyll tissue. Specimens of P. ecklonii from the eastern Cape thus display typical C 4 NADP anatomy...|$|R
40|$|The present studies {{provide the}} first {{measurements}} of the resistance to diffusive flux of metabolites between mesophyll and bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> of C 4 plants. Species examined were Panicum miliaceum, Urochloa panicoides, Atriplex spongiosa, and Zea mays. Diffusive flux of metabolites into isolated bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> was monitored by following their metabolic transformation. Evidence was obtained that the observed rapid fluxes occurred via functional plasmodesmata. Diffusion constants were determined from the rate of transformation of limiting concentrations of metabolites via cytosolic enzymes with high potential velocities and favorable equilibrium constants. Values on a leaf chlorophyll basis ranged between 1 and 5 micromoles per minute per milligram of chlorophyll per millimolar gradient depending on the molecular weight of the metabolite {{and the source of}} bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells.</b> Diffusion of metabolites into these cells was unaffected by a wide variety of compounds including respiratory inhibitors, monovalent and divalent cations, and plant hormones, but it was interrupted by treatments inducing cell plasmolysis. The molecular weight exclusion limit for permeation of compounds into bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> was in the range of 850 to 900. These cells provide an ideal system for the quantitative study of plasmodesmatal function...|$|R
40|$|Ultrastructural {{changes were}} {{correlated}} with leaf water potential, relative water content, and abscisic acid levels in the leaf. Mesophyll cells were more prone to damage than bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells</b> at a leaf water potential of - 18. 5 bars. Tonoplast breakdown and cell disruption occurred in 25 % of the mesophyll cells. On rewatering, these disrupted cells did not recover. In bundle <b>sheath</b> <b>cells,</b> starch, lost at about - 13. 5 bars leaf water potential, reappeared within 2. 5 hours of rewatering...|$|R
