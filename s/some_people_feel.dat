5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E

Berman said [...] "I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel,</b> but [...] and I {{spent a lot of time}} coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that it was more a Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E

500|$|When Nixon died in 1994, {{his daughters}} invited Agnew {{to attend the}} funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; {{over the years he}} had {{rejected}} various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. [...] "I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside", he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: [...] "I am not blind or deaf to the fact that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve. I would remind these people that ... this ceremony {{has less to do with}} Spiro Agnew than with the office I held".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons why people allow {{themselves}} to be bound. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> a kind of freedom during corporal passivity, they can concentrate on their inner spirituality and feel at peace, as a participant in a study about motivation for bondage explained: [...] "Some people have to be tied up to be free". Others experience helplessness, struggle against their bonds, and feel a degree of masochistic pleasure from the restraint and pain, as well as being unobstructed for erotic stimulation by their partner.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> {{economic}} rights {{ought to be}} read into security of the person, as well as section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. [...] The rationale is that {{economic rights}} can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a liveable environment. [...] There has also been discussion within the Supreme Court and among academics as to whether security of the person guarantees some economic rights.|$|E

2500|$|This {{rule has}} been the subject of some controversy, as some shows have been ruled ineligible for the [...] "new" [...] category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the {{important}} awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as [...] "new" [...] gives them an unfair advantage, because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters.|$|E
2500|$|While <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> {{economic}} rights {{ought to be}} included, jurisprudence in this area appears not to support this view. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that [...] "The ability to generate business revenue by one's chosen means is not a right that is protected under s. 7 of the Charter." [...] In 2004, Justice Blair, writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Mussani v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario noted that [...] "the weight of authority {{is that there is}} no constitutional right to practise a profession unfettered by the applicable rules which and standards which regulate that profession", before going on to conclude that the revocation of Mr. Mussani's licence to practice medicine did not deprive him of life, liberty, or the security of his person. The courts have also held that [...] "salary or compensation (in whatever form they may take), are in my view a purely economic right, and are not protected by section 7." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manitoba Hydro {{has studied}} new HVDC {{transmission}} lines to {{run along the}} east side of Lake Winnipeg. The additional transmission capacity would be required to develop stations at Keeyask [...] and Conawapa. This plan would offset the concentration of transmission lines in the Interlake area (west of Lake Winnipeg and east of Lake Manitoba), and would provide additional security against transmission failures due to adverse weather or other causes. However, this area has no roads and very little development. Some environmentalists argue that this vast area of boreal forest should not be crossed by a transmission corridor. If roads were built {{at the same time as}} the lines, these roads [...] would allow year-round access to small First Nation communities east of the lake; <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> this would have more adverse than beneficial effects for these communities. From an engineering perspective, there is no connection between building a new transmission line east of Lake Winnipeg, and building a road east of the lake. In May 2005, the provincial government announced that it would not consider any route along {{the east side of}} Lake Winnipeg, even though the alternative routes through the Interlake region or west of Lake Manitoba would extend the transmission lines, and increase cost. The western route was chosen by the government to protect the proposed UNESCO biosphere reserve on the east side by local First Nations reserves called Pimachiowin Aki. [...] This decision was criticized by 19 former senior Manitoba Hydro engineers, who were in favour of the East side route.|$|E
