40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the role of midwife in {{education}} about the prevention <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, which is necessary. This thesis is focused on all types of prevention, from primary to quaternary. The greatest emphasis is placed on primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention mainly consists of the healthy lifestyle, elimination of risk factors, posibility of genetic testing and chemoprevention for high-risk women, etc. Secondary prevention is focused on the search for women with a risk <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> cancer. The best known methods are mammographic screening, ultrasound examination or <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination.</b> The objective <b>of</b> mentioned options is to detect the cancer disease in the stage, when is possible the most effective treatment with the greatest chance of a complete healing. The task of the midwife is {{on the basis of their}} knowledge to educate women about the disease itself, but also about preventive options. Midwife has to follow the principles of proper management during this education. The most important thing is to established friendly and trustful relationship in a peaceful environment. The essential task of the midwife is to motivate a "woman" to be really interested in her health condition and convince her to not underestimate prevention of this disease. The objective of this thesis was to investigate how women evaluate the education from midwife about the prevention <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. The research was conducted on the basis of a qualitative survey using techniques of interviews. The examined group was based on 8 women in age from 18 to 70 years. All the interviews were made anonymously with the preservation of their privacy. With the agreement of respondents were all interviews recorded on tape, transcribed and subsequently analyzed by the method of "pencil paper". The results were processed into three main categories, which were further divided into subcategories. The first question of research was adressed to how are women educated about the prevention <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. None <b>of</b> the respondents has never been educated from midwife, like the main source of information were described doctors or internet. The second question of research examined which information are received by women from midwives. It was found that none of the respondents were never been educated and it means that they never received any information. Most of women would really appreciate the information from midwife, specially about <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast.</b> The third question of research was dedicated to the preview of women on the prevention <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. Each <b>of</b> the respondents has same opinion that prevention is really important. Most of them are trying to follow it, but in fact insufficiently. The results of research revealed that women should be more educated by midwives about preventive possibilities, especially in <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast.</b> This examination is performed by most of the respondents, but not always in the right way. The research work shows that women are unsufficiently informed from the side of midwife. For this reason it is necessary to motivate midwives to educate their patients about the prevention <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. Mentioned information would be really appreciated by respondents, particularly about the <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast.</b> Based on the results of this research was created information leaflet for women about <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast.</b> These instructions should help them to perform self-examination correctly...|$|R

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} {{the most common form of}} cancer in female {{population}} in the Czech Republic. In 2002 the Czech Republic joined most European countries and launched nation-wide mammography screening, enabling women to attend regular preventive examinations when they reach 45 years of age. In January 2014 they started to address women to invite them for preventive breast cancer examinations, as part of a nationwide information campaign. Mortality of this cancer has been decreasing in recent years, which can be explained by the increasing quality of treatment and earlier detection of the disease. Therefore, knowledge of primary and secondary prevention is very important. The theoretical part briefly describes the anatomy of female breasts, defines a malignant tumor, as well as epidemiological aspects of breast cancer. Another chapter is about prevention itself. In the secondary prevention I describe <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>breasts</b> and the history and nature of mammography screening. I also present organizations implementing preventive programs aimed at breast cancer. The practical part includes research results, which were obtained through quantitative research questionnaires. The research group consisted of women who live in the Ústí region. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions and was answered by a group of 150 women between 18 and 44 years old and 150 women over 45 years. I handed out these questionnaires in Ústí healthcare center and I also created an electronic questionnaire which I sent across social networks. Out of the 150 (100 %) questionnaires distributed in Ústí healthcare center, I got only 60 back and 58 of them were sufficiently completed for the needs of the research, the return was only 38. 7 %. I received the remaining 242 questionnaires electronically. The aim of the study was to explore the awareness of risk factors of breast cancer of women in the Ústí Region and also to find out whether women in the Ústí region carried out <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>breasts</b> and if women over 45 attended regular mammography screening. Based on my research aim I set out four hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : Women in the Ústí region are informed about the risk factors of breast cancer. Hypothesis 2 : Women at the age of 18 to 44 in the Usti region are more informed about the risk factors of breast cancer than women in the age group over 45. Hypothesis 3 : The difference in the frequency of breast self-examination among women in the age group 18 to 44 is statistically more significant than in women in the over 45 age group. Hypothesis 4 : Attending mammography examination of women over 45 in the Ústí region rises according to their level of education. The results of testing my hypotheses show that women in the Ústí region are not informed about the risk factors of breast cancer. I assumed that awareness is higher among women in the 18 to 44 age group, but even this hypothesis wasn't proven. Awareness of risk factors is on the same level in category of 18 to 44 years as in women over 45 years of age. Regarding breast self-examination, women in the above 45 years old age group carry out self-examination more often than women 18 to 44 years old. Even the last hypothesis was not confirmed, attendance of mammography doesn't appear to depend on the education of women. Awareness of women needs to increase, especially in case of risk factors of breast cancer. Awareness increase could be achieved by greater information campaign on television, in newspapers, in businesses with high numbers of working women, or in secondary and higher education through various public lectures. Over 90 % of women attend Mammography screening according to my research, which are laudable results. The fact that the actual <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>breasts</b> isn't carried out at all by more than half of the women in the age group 18 to 44 is serious. This work could serve as teaching or study material to improve general knowledge of this topic...|$|E

Por sua letalidade e seqüelas físicas e emocionais que acarreta, é de suma importância sua detecção precoce. Os meios eficazes de detecção precoce são a mamografia e o auto-exame de mama. O objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar o conhecimento das profissionais da área da saúde de uma instituição pública sobre seu conhecimento em relação ao auto-exame de mama. Caracterizou-se como estudo descritivo-exploratório. Foram entrevistadas 38 mulheres, perfazendo um total de 95, 0 % das profissionais. Os resultados revelaram que as profissionais, apesar de compreendem a importância do auto-exame, têm muitas dúvidas quanto à técnica. Desconhecem a época de realizá-lo e muitas vezes não o fazem.

40|$|WHENEVER the {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer is under discussion, as with cancer in general, {{it is only}} natural to {{stress the importance of}} early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Halsted (1895) considered that not even a single day should be lost in instituting treatment for breast cancer, and since then the general teaching has always been that the greater the delay the worse the prognosis. This view is often linked with the opinion that if patients receive early treatment the outlook is necessarily good. Efforts are, therefore, being made at the present time to persuade patients with symptoms suggestive of cancer to overcome their fears and to come forward promptly for medical advice. Some physicians, through cancer detection centres and by teaching <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breasts,</b> are striving to find tumours before symptoms develop spontaneously. A few years ago our complacency in demanding early treatment for cancer and our faith in its effectiveness was shaken by McKinnon (1951 a, 1951 b, 1954, 1955) in Canada, and by Park and Lees (1951) in England.

40|$|Background: Breast cancer {{being one}} of the leading cancers among women in {{developing}} countries, prevention or identification of the disease at an early stage is of paramount importance in saving as well as improving the quality <b>of</b> life. <b>Breast</b> health awareness appears to be a pragmatic method for this. Objective: To determine the acceptability and effectiveness of an educational intervention programme on breast health awareness for rural women by trained female health workers. Settings and Design: Community based nonrandomised educational intervention study carried out over a period of 1 year. Three hundred and sixty rural women in the age group 30 - 59 years were randomly selected (and age-wise stratified), from a coastal village in Southern India. Methods: Women were educated on breast health and breast self-examination by specifically trained health workers and their awareness and proficiency levels were evaluated at the end of 1 and 3 months postintervention. Statistical analysis: This was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 10. Results: Following the educational intervention, a significant increase in overall awareness regarding breast cancer (z=- 15. 807; P< 0. 001) {{as well as in the}} performance <b>of</b> <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> 321 / 342 (93 &#x 0025;) was observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{women at}} risk for {{hereditary}} breast cancer {{are at increased risk}} of psychological distress. In order to tailor support for individual women, the availability of a tool enabling the identification of psychologically vulnerable women at an early stage is warranted. The objectives of this study were (1) to explore long-term psychological distress in women {{at risk for}} hereditary breast cancer adhering to regular surveillance, and (2) to identify women being vulnerable for long-term psychological distress, defined in terms of a multifactorial risk profile. METHODS: General distress and cancer-related distress were assessed at baseline (T 0) and after 5 - 8 years (T 1) in 197 high-risk women adhering to breast cancer surveillance. Coping styles, occurrence <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer in the family <b>of</b> origin, <b>breast</b> cancer risk perception, and frequency <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination,</b> as assessed at T 0, were examined as predictor variables for long-term distress (T 1). RESULTS: Across time, women reported a significant reduction in intrusion and avoidance. Intrusion levels were increased among women who had lost a first-degree relative to <b>breast</b> cancer. Predictors <b>of</b> increased long-term distress were passive and palliative coping styles, excessive <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination,</b> and overestimation <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer risk. On the other hand, coping through fostering reassuring thoughts was predictive for decreased long-term distress. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the identified risk profile, it is possible to identify vulnerable women at an early stage, who then may be offered additional and individually tailored support.

40|$|Abstract Background BRCA {{mutation}} carriers have a 40 - 80 % life-time risk <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> cancer. They may opt for yearly {{breast cancer}} surveillance or for prophylactic mastectomy. Both options show increased survival rates. It {{is a complex}} choice to be made between these two options. As a result most women experience high levels of distress and high needs for information. To fulfill the needs for psychosocial support and information we have introduced group medical consultations (GMCs). A GMC provides individual medical visits conducted within a group. This 90 minute group-visit with 8 - 12 patients gives patients the opportunity {{to spend more time}} with their clinician and a behavioral health professional and learn from other patients experiencing similar topics. However, it should be noted that group sessions may increase fear in some patients or influence their decision making. Methods/design In this randomized controlled trial, 160 BRCA mutation carriers diagnosed maximally 2 years ago are recruited from the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. Participants are randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to either the GMC intervention group (onetime participation in a GMC instead of a standard individual visit) or to a usual care control group. Primary outcome measures are empowerment and psychological distress (SCL 90). Secondary outcome measures are fear of cancer, information needs before the consultation and the received information, <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breasts,</b> patient satisfaction, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Data are collected via self-reported questionnaires 1 week before the visit, and at 1 week and at 3 months follow-up. A pilot study was conducted to test all procedures and questionnaires.

Utilization <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> and cervical cancer control behaviours in Australia is less than optimal, particularly amongst Eastern European and Arabic populations. Psychosocial factors have generally been found to predict cancer control uptake, yet little is known {{of the role of}} these factors amongst these ethnic populations. Guided by comprehensive health behavior theories, this research assessed the associations of cognitive and affective psychosocial variables to the utilization <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> and cervical cancer control behaviours among Croatian-, Lebanese-, Macedonian- and Australian-born women. In the absence of appropriate measures, the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire for healthy people (IPQ-RH) was empirically validated in the Arabic, Croatian and English languages for breast and cervical cancer contexts. Across several studies (total N = 904) women representing each of the four ethnic groups completed self-report measures relating to cognitive (e. g., attitudes towards the efficacy of mammography to detect cancer) and affective (e. g., breast cancer worry) factors and cancer control behaviour use (i. e., <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breasts</b> (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE), mammography, Pap smear and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake). Overall, Lebanese women were significantly lower users of BSE and mammography than Australian and Croatian women, and Macedonian women were less likely to have accepted the HPV vaccine than Australian women. Multiple regression analyses showed that across the studies a number of psychosocial and behavioural factors were associated with breast cancer screening (i. e., breast cancer worry, general risk factors and negative emotional representations) and cervical cancer control use (i. e., identity (symptoms), cyclical timelines for cervical cancer, perceived efficacy of cervical cancer control and general risk factors). The modifiable psychosocial factors that were identified in this research can provide the basis for future tailored health promotion initiatives targeting these ethnic groups to enhance their utilization of the cancer control strategies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} cultural {{models for}} breast and cervical cancer among low-income African-American women over 40, {{in order to}} better understand how those models might affect cancer screening behavior. The study is part of The Community-Based Cancer Screening Project, which is sponsored by Emory University, Grady Memorial Hospital, and the American Cancer Society. The Screening Project attempts to increase the use of mammography, clinical and <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast,</b> and cervical Pap smear among women aged 40 or older in a predominantly African-American, low-income, low educational level population that is currently underserved by any screening activities. The study of cultural models of cancer within the project was prompted by the recognition that if screening programs targeted at specific, underserved, populations are to succeed, cultural as well as logistical barriers to screening must be overome. Patients and clinicians must each understand how the other perceives cancer, its prevention, and its treatment. Only with this mutual understanding as a foundation, can physicians and their clients cooperate to improve cancer screening rates. Our research results indicate that the cancer models held by the patient population differ significantly from those held by clinicians. Women attending the clinics endure cancer screening tests that to them seem to serve only as heralds of a disease that will ultimately kill them. Most women doubt there is a cure for cancer, though some believe a person may live if the disease is caught in time. Even then, though, catching cancer 'in time' may mean somehow discovering the disease before it can even be detected as a spot on a mammogram or as dysplastic cells from a pap smear. If the cancer is not caught in time, and a woman is diagnosed as having the disease, some argue that the knowledge that she has it may cause mental deterioration and may speed her death. Even if her mind is unaffected, according to many women interviewed, she still faces treatment choices that may make her poor and seem certain to erode her health even further. Her faith in God seems {{to be one of the}} few completely benign and truly powerful treatment alternatives available to her. explanatory models cancer screening African-American health cross-cultural communication...|$|R

40|$|<b>Breast</b> <b>self-examination</b> is <b>of</b> {{interest}} for the early detection <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, especially in areas where mammography and regular physical examination <b>of</b> the <b>breasts</b> are not practicable as public health policies. At present, there is insufficient evidence that breast self-examination is effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer. To determine its effectiveness, this method should be applied in a comprehensive programme that provides teaching and guidance on practice of the technique, and facilities for self-referral and diagnosis (when any abnormality is detected) as well as treatment, {{taking into account the}} background (economic, social, and cultural) of the country or area concerned. Once the programme has been developed, its effectiveness in reducing breast cancer mortality will have to be assessed in carefully designed research studies. The favoured design for assessment is a randomized controlled trial. Other types of studies, such as quasi-experimental comparisons or a case-control study, are less satisfactory, but may be conducted under strictly specified conditions. Until the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination</b> has been established, it cannot be recommended as a public health measure for control <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare breast cancer {{knowledge}} and the use <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination</b> as a breast cancer screening tool among rural and urban women in the reproductive age group (15 - 49 years) in the rural and urban areas of Zambia. Methods: The study sites were located in the Solwezi rural district and Lusaka urban districts in Zambia. A total of 238 women participated in the study. Results: The findings revealed that 82 percent of the respondents in the rural area and 58 percent of women in the urban area had no knowledge <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. It was also found that 95 percent of the respondents in the rural and 95 percent of respondents in the urban areas did not practise breast self-examination. The most common reasons given by women for not practising <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination</b> were lack <b>of</b> knowledge on how to do it (65 percent of rural and 55 percent of urban women), the perception that it was not important to do <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination</b> (30 percent <b>of</b> urban and 27. 5 percent of rural women) and that they did not perceive themselves as being at risk <b>of</b> getting <b>breast</b> cancer (15 percent of urban and 8 percent of rural women). These findings show that there is a need for nurses to design an educational programme to sensitise women on the dangers <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer and the importance of early diagnosis through the use <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a test of several {{hypothesized}} predictors <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination</b> among low-income Mexican American women. Current research points to several factors as important predictors of preventive care.

For Mexican Americans, environmental barriers to health care are important factors. While findings are inconclusive regarding the role of language proficiency {{as a predictor of}} preventive care, the model includes this as a hypothesized predictor <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination.</b> The findings show a strong relationship between self-efficacy and frequency <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination.</b> Barriers to health care have a weaker direct effect upon <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination.</b> The effects <b>of</b> English-language proficiency are indirect and mediated by self-efficacy...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} depicting {{methods in}} the senology, gynaecology and obstetrics. "In the present times keep {{using a new}} method of depositing diagnostics. The development of these methods goes ahead very fast. The breakthrough was {{the discovery of the}} diagnostic imaging W. C. Röntgen, who discovered beams X in the mid- 20 th century. It is the discovery that started the era of the evolution of modern diagnostics. The theoretical part deals with the anatomy <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> and female genital organs. Further on, there is simply described the principle and the utilization of imaging techniques in the gynaecology, obstetrics and senology. In the senology part there is also the mention <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> cancer. The Breast cancer {{is one of the most}} common cancers affecting women. It is a hormone-dependent tumour, therefore, the origin often is involved in hormonal stimulation. On the occurrence <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> cancer is also involved in genetic factors. The most common risk factors include former the breast cancer, obesity, and exposure to ionizing radiation. The basic symptoms are as changing breast shape, size, pain, edema, ulceration. Highly effective prevention is <b>self-examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breast,</b> another preventive measure is the mammography screening. The Gynecologic section contains a list of the most common tests and a brief description. The final theoretical part is obstetrics, where I focused on a main topic- magnetic resonance imaging. This method is very useful but unfortunately, nowadays, in this field is still very rare. Harmfulness of this method is unproven, but is not recommended for use during the first trimester of pregnancy. The use of magnetic resonance imaging has its specifics and display area. It is used for example in the diagnosis of certain intracranial lesions, such as the absence of corpus calosum, intracerebral tumours, the detection of small lesions in the spine, unclear pathological structures and possibly congenital infection of the foetus. Its perspective is probably the possibility of evaluation of metabolic events during the development. The aim of my work is to analyse the radiological examination methods in senology, gynaecology and obstetrics. Another objective is to determine the number of specialized centres of prenatal diagnosis in the country. The hypothesis of the thesis were formulated as follows: Number of radiological examination methods increases. The practical part provides information relating primarily to the total number of radiological examination methods in Gynecology at the Hospital Budějovice (s. r. o) among 2010 and 2012. These investigations are primarily related to gynaecological diagnosis. All data were obtained from the hospital computer system. In this work was compared data of patients: ? Due to the age of the patients ? Due to the most common diagnosis ? Due to the total number of examinations in the years 2010 - 2012 Furthermore, the data from the internet portal of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the country (the Czech Republic) were used. As a curiosity, I used data from the first ultrasound in pregnancy and newborn mortality. While this is not the subject of my work, but the issue took me personally therefore I gave her a portion of my work. The results of this work demonstrate achievement of the objectives that have been identified in this work. We managed to confirm the hypothesis that the use of radiodiagnostic imaging is rising every year. The awareness of people about the possibilities of testing facilities is on the increase and the facilities of department radiological imaging methods are gradually improving...|$|R
