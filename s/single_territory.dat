The Greeks refused an Ottoman offer of an autonomous administration, and Deligiannis mobilized for war. The Great Powers refused to allow the expansion of Greece, and on 25 February 1897 announced that Crete would be under an autonomous administration and ordered the Greek and Ottoman Turk militias to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. This <b>single</b> <b>territory</b> became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of eastern Minnesota. The act established an administration to oversee the territory and had the land surveyed in accordance with The Land Ordinance of 1785. At the time the territory was created, {{there were only two}} American settlements in what would become Indiana: Vincennes and Clark's Grant. The population of the northwest included fewer than 5,000 Europeans. The Native American population was estimated to be near 20,000, but may have been as high as 75,000.|$|E

40|$|For lek-breeding in {{ungulate}} {{populations to}} continue, benefits to males defending lck territories and to females visiting leks must outweigh the costs. In this study, Kafue lechwe males on leks gained higher mating rates than nonlekking males, {{a result of}} sexually receptive females leaving herds and aggregating on leks. When die numbers of females on leks were experimentally reduced, benefits to males decreased, resulting in males gradually abandoning lek territories. A comparison {{with a population of}} nonlekking, resource-defending black lechwe showed that mating attempts by estrous females in herds were disrupted by harassing males eight times more frequently in a population of lek-breeding Kafue lechwe than in the nonlekking black lechwe. Despite {{the fact that there were}} fewer Kafue lechwe females on <b>single</b> <b>territories,</b> harassment of estrous females by males was greater on <b>single</b> <b>territories</b> of Kafue lechwe than on leks and greater than on black lechwe resource territories. Females were also absent on Kafue lechwe <b>single</b> <b>territories</b> for long periods because of erratic widespread movements of compact herds resulting from unpredictable distributions of resources. In contrast, black lechwe females were more evenly dispersed over homogeneous resources and for a given territory, females were likely to be present most of the time. Therefore, unlike black lechwe, male Kafue lechwe find it uneconomical to defend resource territories. Thus, costs to estrous females mating off leks and the absence of benefits to males attempting to defend resource-based territories may be important cofactors in the ap-pearance of lek-breeding in some ungulate populations. Key words: harassment, lechwe, leks, mating strategies, resource defense. [Bthav Ecol 8 : 1 - 9 (1997) ...|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, {{there was a}} {{significant}} movement in favor of this U.S. territory becoming a commonwealth, which would give it a level of self-government similar to Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. However, the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed, because its clauses were incompatible with the Territorial Clause (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2) of the U.S. Constitution. Other movements advocate U.S. statehood for Guam, union with the state of Hawaii, or union with the Northern Mariana Islands as a <b>single</b> <b>territory,</b> or independence.|$|E
