5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics {{has become more}} important, <b>so</b> <b>has</b> the debate about patenting of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E

60|$|But it is {{not this}} faculty of his which has been imitated by his scholars; for {{it is not}} this faculty which made him their ideal, however it may have {{attracted}} them. All which sensible men deplore in him is that which poetasters have exalted in him. His morbidity and his doubt have become in their eyes his differential energy, because too often, {{it was all in}} him with which they had wit to sympathise. They found it easy to curse and complain, instead of helping to mend. <b>So</b> <b>had</b> he. They found it pleasant to confound institutions with the abuses which defaced them. <b>So</b> <b>had</b> he. They found it pleasant to give way to their spleen. <b>So</b> <b>had</b> he. They found it pleasant to believe that the poet was to regenerate the world, without having settled with what he was to regenerate it. <b>So</b> <b>had</b> he. They found it more pleasant to obey sentiment than inductive laws. <b>So</b> <b>had</b> he. They found it more pleasant to hurl about enormous words and startling figures than to examine reverently the awful depths of beauty which lie in the simplest words and the severest figures. <b>So</b> <b>had</b> he.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and <b>so</b> <b>has</b> a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E

5|$|As global {{population}} and affluence has increased, <b>so</b> <b>has</b> {{the use of}} various materials increased in volume, diversity and distance transported. Included here are raw materials, minerals, synthetic chemicals (including hazardous substances), manufactured products, food, living organisms and waste. By 2050, humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year (three times its current amount) unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption. Developed countries' citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita, ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and <b>so</b> <b>has</b> a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E
