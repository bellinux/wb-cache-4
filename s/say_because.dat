5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (<b>say</b> <b>because</b> it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E

25|$|Fail safe core. LFTRs {{can include}} a freeze plug {{at the bottom}} {{that has to be}} {{actively}} cooled, usually by a small electric fan. If the cooling fails, <b>say</b> <b>because</b> of a power failure, the fan stops, the plug melts, and the fuel drains to a subcritical passively cooled storage facility. This not only stops the reactor, also the storage tank can more easily shed the decay heat from the short-lived radioactive decay of irradiated nuclear fuels. Even {{in the event of a}} major leak from the core such as a pipe breaking, the salt will spill onto the kitchen-sink-shaped room the reactor is in, which will drain the fuel salt by gravity into the passively cooled dump tank.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the courts applied the lex loci {{contract}}us or the law of the place where the contract was made to decide whether the given contract was valid. The apparent advantage of this approach was that the rule was easy to apply with certain and predictable outcomes. Unfortunately, it was also open to abuse, e.g. the place could be selected fraudulently to validate an otherwise invalid contract; it might lead to the application of laws with no real connection with the transaction itself, <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> the parties signed the agreement while on holiday; or it might have been difficult to decide where the contract was made, e.g. because it was negotiated and signed on a railway journey through several states.|$|E

She noted that her role did not require her to have much to <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|David Leitch {{directed}} a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which {{was believed to}} be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film Logan. This was meant to tease the film Deadpool 2, which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, Logan director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After Logans runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming X-Men film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to [...] "make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. There was nothing else to <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> we had said it." [...] Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for Deadpool 2 before Logan, confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the Deadpool films.|$|E

500|$|Hybrid Theory {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters {{commented that the}} band was a [...] "far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that [...] "they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds." [...] Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory {{four out of five}} stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a [...] "two-star honorable mention rating", citing [...] "Papercut" [...] and [...] "Points of Authority" [...] as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone gave the album {{two and a half stars}} and commented that Hybrid Theory had [...] "as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn" [...] and called it an album that [...] "reflects the frustration of life". Considering that the album came out in the year 2000, and that it earned a Diamond certification, it may have exerted a similar rock influence on the up and coming Millennial generation that Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) did for Generation X. It might even be possible to <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> of the popularity of this album, that Linkin Park could be thought of as the [...] "flagship" [...] rock band for the Millennials. This generation tends to gravitate more towards rap and pop music; and having these elements mixed into Linkin Park's style might have played a role in the album's success.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after {{training}} camp. Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team. Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game. [...] The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia {{for the remainder of the}} season. This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights. Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game-winning goal in three consecutive games. He was named the League's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as [...] "a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments") for November, and the League's best rookie for the 11th week of the season. In his shortened season in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists. Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the 2010–11 season, stating, [...] "I hope I'll be back next year, but right now, it's really hard to <b>say</b> <b>because</b> it will again be a tough decision." [...] Howson did not comment on Filatov's stance, except to say that he expects Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.|$|E

Because of the short, squat body and the way its legs work, these legs often partly conceal the main killing zone. Free shooting carries a high risk of wounding." ...|$|E

This is typical for these type of deals, which are investment deals rather than record deals. I can also say that the decision to terminate the term early, which suited both parties, was made well before the commercial release of the album". A spokesperson from the record label also released a statement saying [...] "It didn't work out with Charlotte and that's fair enough. There was no falling out. It was a mutual decision.

Cotler said that it is [...] "too simplistic to say that anti-Zionism, per se, is anti-Semitic" [...] and argued that labelling Israel as an apartheid state, while in his view [...] "distasteful", is [...] "still within the boundaries of argument" [...] and not inherently antisemitic.
