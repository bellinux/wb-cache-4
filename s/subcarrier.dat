30|$|However, the {{available}} <b>subcarriers</b> may {{be divided into}} several groups of <b>subcarriers</b> called subchannels. Subchannels may be constituted using either contiguous <b>subcarriers</b> or <b>subcarriers</b> pseudorandomly distributed across the frequency spectrum. Subchannels formed using distributed <b>subcarriers</b> provide more frequency diversity [12]. This permutation can be represented by Partial Usage of <b>Subcarriers</b> (PUSC) and Full Usage of <b>Subcarriers</b> (FUSC) modes. The subchannelization scheme based on contiguous <b>subcarriers</b> in mobile WiMAX is called Band Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC). Although frequency diversity is lost, band AMC allows system designers to exploit multiuser diversity, allocating subchannels to users based on their frequency response [1].|$|R

25|$|This scheme {{therefore}} cannot directly handle {{low frequency}} (or DC) modulating signals {{but this is}} not a problem in the many AC-coupled video and audio FM transmitters that use this method. Such signals may also be placed on a <b>subcarrier</b> above the cutoff frequency of the PLL loop filter.|$|E
25|$|In OFDM, the <b>subcarrier</b> {{frequencies}} {{are chosen}} {{so that the}} subcarriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that crosstalk between the subchannels is eliminated and intercarrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver. In conventional FDM, a separate filter for each subchannel is required.|$|E
25|$|Frequency (<b>subcarrier)</b> {{interleaving}} increases {{resistance to}} frequency-selective channel {{conditions such as}} fading. For example, when {{a part of the}} channel bandwidth fades, frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.|$|E

Typically, each subchannel is divided into Q subbands composed {{of a set of}} V adjacent <b>subcarriers</b> [14, 15, 24]. When one transmission block consists of M consecutive OFDMA symbols, let us define a bunch of consecutive V <b>subcarriers</b> (one subband) and M OFDMA symbols as a tile.|$|R

In June it ordered four Fokker 50s with delivery in late 1988. The new F27s were of the modernized -200 variant. For four months of 1986 Busy Bee leased a fifth F27-200.|$|E

Braathens' regional services in Western Norway were at the time operated by the <b>subcarrier</b> Norwegian Air Shuttle.

The latter took effect in October 2002. After Norwegian relaunched themselves as a low-cost carrier in September 2002, they were eager to rid themselves of regional routes. SAS therefore agreed to pay Norwegian NOK65 million cash to terminate the routes from 1 April 2003.|$|E

By using this proposed algorithm to schedule <b>subcarriers,</b> the remaining <b>subcarriers</b> in different cells are different parts of A and will have a low probability of overlap. The cell-edge users can also borrow the remaining <b>subcarriers</b> to meet their requirements with less interference.|$|R
30|$|We {{notice that}} the symbols on the odd <b>subcarriers</b> are always equal to zero, and the symbols on the even <b>subcarriers</b> lose the second {{summation}} in Equation 40.

30|$|We have {{calculated}} the computational complexity {{of all the}} architectures {{as a function of}} Pt,r, which is the number of available <b>subcarriers</b> either in transmission or reception. We have chosen this parameter for our analysis because it is a magnitude directly related to the number of active <b>subcarriers</b> N, which usually varies in MC standards that implement a certain signal model. For the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that all available <b>subcarriers</b> will be used as active <b>subcarriers</b> (Pt,r=N) and a range of variation for Pt,r from 16 to 128 <b>subcarriers.</b>|$|R
30|$|In practice, {{not all the}} <b>subcarriers</b> are {{available}} for transmission. It {{is often the case}} that null <b>subcarriers</b> are set on both the edges of the allocated bandwidth to mitigate interferences from/to adjacent bands [10, 11]. For example, IEEE 802.11 a has 64 <b>subcarriers</b> among which 12 <b>subcarriers,</b> one {{at the center of the}} band (DC component) and at the edges of the band are set to be null, i.e., no information is sent [12]. The presence of null <b>subcarriers</b> complicates the design of both the training preamble for channel estimation and pilot symbols for pilot-aided channel estimation over the frequency-selective channels. Null <b>subcarriers</b> may render equi-distant and equi-powered pilot symbols impossible to use in practice.|$|R

500|$|However, {{despite the}} pending switch to digital, analog {{television}} remains being transmitted in most countries. An {{exception is the}} United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [...] ). These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (North American designed), and SECAM (French designed). (It {{is important to understand}} that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do not {{have anything to do with}} the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.) For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated <b>subcarrier</b> is used for stereo FM.|$|E
2500|$|Our example: The OFDM {{equalization}} in {{the above}} numerical example would require one complex valued multiplication per <b>subcarrier</b> and symbol (i.e., [...] complex multiplications per OFDM symbol; i.e., one million multiplications per second, at the receiver). The FFT algorithm requires [...] complex-valued multiplications per OFDM symbol (i.e., 10 million multiplications per second), at both the receiver and transmitter side. This should {{be compared with the}} corresponding one million symbols/second single-carrier modulation case mentioned in the example, where the equalization of 125 microseconds time-spreading using a FIR filter would require, in a naive implementation, 125 multiplications per symbol (i.e., 125 million multiplications per second). FFT techniques can be used {{to reduce the number of}} multiplications for an FIR filter based time-domain equalizer to a number comparable with OFDM, at the cost of delay between reception and decoding which also becomes comparable with OFDM.|$|E
2500|$|OFDM {{requires}} {{very accurate}} frequency synchronization between {{the receiver and}} the transmitter; with frequency deviation the sub-carriers {{will no longer be}} orthogonal, causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) (i.e., cross-talk between the sub-carriers). Frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators, or by Doppler shift due to movement. While Doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver, the situation is worsened when combined with multipath, as reflections will appear at various frequency offsets, which is much harder to correct. This effect typically worsens as speed increases, and is an important factor limiting the use of OFDM in high-speed vehicles. In order to mitigate ICI in such scenarios, one can shape each sub-carrier in order to minimize the interference resulting in a non-orthogonal subcarriers overlapping. For example, a low-complexity scheme referred to as WCP-OFDM (...) consists of using short filters at the transmitter output in order to perform a potentially non-rectangular pulse shaping and a near perfect reconstruction using a single-tap per <b>subcarrier</b> equalization. Other ICI suppression techniques usually increase drastically the receiver complexity.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} for inserting pilot data in OFDM signals. In block-type pilots, all the <b>subcarriers</b> in some OFDM blocks (the whole spectrum) are reserved as pilot tones. In comb-type pilot models, some predefined <b>subcarriers</b> in each block serve as pilots. Hence, CFR at these <b>subcarriers</b> can be estimated using methods such as least square (LS) or {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE). Now for estimating the CFR at non-pilot <b>subcarriers,</b> interpolation methods ranging from simple linear or second order techniques [3] to time domain [4] and even more complex approaches are used. It is clear that by decreasing the frequency gap between the adjacent pilot <b>subcarriers,</b> the performance of the interpolation techniques improves. Therefore, the pilots are preferably put at equidistant <b>subcarriers</b> to provide uniformity.|$|R

The other N -U = N pc <b>subcarriers</b> are modulated by points from an M-PSK signal constellation. Thus, the proposed system can transmit more information at each symbol interval than the conventional MS system with N <b>subcarriers.</b> In addition the proposed system can decrease the bias that must {{be added to the}} MS electrical signal, because the number of <b>subcarriers</b> other than null <b>subcarriers</b> is smaller than that in the conventional MS systems and thus the minimum power is larger.
