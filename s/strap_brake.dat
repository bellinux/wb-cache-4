Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: The object {{of this series}} of tests was {{to determine}} the relative value of gasoline, denatured alcohol, and kerosene as fuel for an internal combustion engine designed and built for the use of gasoline. The fuels were tested under practically the same conditions, the only changes made in the engine were such that were necessary for obtaining the greatest brake horse power possible. The first or trial tests were made with a <b>strap</b> <b>brake</b> but it was soon found that this was not suitable for engines or motors above five horse power. We also found that oil was the best for cooling a brake of this type. After proving that the <b>strap</b> <b>brake</b> was insufficient, a wooden Prony brake was constructed and used throughout the remaining tests. With this brake a constant supply of water proved better for cooling, but there was a small amount of chattering which could not be avoided on account of the engine being of the four cycle type. The engine used was a ten horse power Witte Gasoline using the "hammer break" type of igniter. The fuel tank was placed on the wall above the engine so the supply did not depend on the pump. This tank was fitted with a gage glass so the amount of fuel at the start could be marked {{and at the end of}} the test, the overflow was put back and the tank filled to the point marked at the start. The amount required to fill the tank to the starting point, after putting back the overflow, was what the engine had used during the test. The cooling water for the cylinder [...] ...|$|E
50|$|While not {{strictly}} a kickstand, the Flickstand {{is a small}} bracket that flips down from the down tube and engages the front tire to prevent the front end from steering and tire from rotating, and thus enabling the bike to be safely leaned against an object without danger of the front end turning and the bike subsequently falling to the ground. These were made by Rhode Gear Company in the 1970s and 1980s. While the Flickstand is no longer made, a Velcro strap can be employed for similar success by <b>strapping</b> a <b>brake</b> lever to lock the <b>brake</b> or <b>strap</b> the front wheel to the down tube.|$|R
5000|$|While RIO {{focused on}} classic {{as well as}} newer {{production}} cars, Brumm focused on period racing vehicles (Castellarin 2002). Brumm's later models expanded to 1930s to 1950s race cars, accurately copying the real cars, down to varied numbering, striping, and nationalistic color schemes according to driver or to particular race. Early FIATs, Ferraris, and Alfa Romeos were common, but German and British cars also were in the line-up. For example, the 1938 Mercedes W125 Grand Prix no. 15 model accurately portrayed all kinds of intricate details including tiny rear-view mirror, low profile windscreen, suspension detail, authentic looking wire wheels, brown 'leather' hood <b>strap,</b> and disc <b>brakes.</b> This car raced in the United States and the model even portrays the Nazi flag on {{the rear of the}} body.Later, racing Ferraris and Alfa Romeos from the 1970s and 1980s were offered. Examination of company catalogs easily shows that European diecast manufacturers favored the 'patria', so naturally, Italian brands were prevalent in the Brumm line, though British Jaguars, the Vanwall, and Mercedes-Benzes were also represented in miniature. Different liveries were offered for promotional purposes, like Jägermeister racing FIATs, AGIP, Campari rum, or Amaro liqueur vans, or an Olio FIAT 600 multipla. At least some of these offerings Brumm referred to as its [...] "Serie Commerciale". Other nationalistic themes were seen in examples such as the Porsche Speedster with Eva Perón markings.|$|R
