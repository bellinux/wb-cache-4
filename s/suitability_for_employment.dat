Evidence suggests that obese people {{are perceived as}} having less leadership potential, and in comparison to normal weight peers, {{are expected to be}} less successful.

This study was conducted to determine the impact of gender appearance on perceptions of suitability for stereotypical professions. One hundred forty students from a university in central California indicated their impressions of how suitable 54 men and women were for employment in the medical field, both as a doctor and a nurse. Stimuli were computer-generated faces of nine men and nine women presented in three versions ??? the original, unaltered face, a version manipulated to appear more feminine, and a version manipulated to appear more masculine. It was predicted that perceivers would inhibit categorical-based stereotyping (i. e., rate males and females to be similarly suitable for employment as a doctor and nurse) but demonstrate feature-based stereotyping (i. e., rate feminized faces of both genders as more suitable for employment in nursing and masculinized faces of both genders as more suitable for employment as a doctor). As predicted, participants inhibited category-based stereotypes, but rated feminized faces of both genders as more suitable for nursing. Hypotheses regarding <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> as a doctor were not confirmed: Ratings did not differ by gender appearance for males, and feminized female faces were rated as more suitable than masculinized female faces.

40|$|Today, users {{sign on to}} most online social {{networking}} sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ via weak identities, i. e., unverified identities {{that do not require}} users to prove that their online identities match their offline (real world) personalities. Weak identities leave the sites vulnerable to a variety of fake identity or Sybil attacks. In this paper, we focus on identity impersonation attacks, a special class of Sybil (fake identity) attacks where the attacker spoofs (as-sumes) the identity of another real-world user. As more and more personal data about users becomes publicly available on the Web, impersonation attacks become easier to carry out. Identity impersonation attacks can be particularly dam-aging for the victim’s online reputation. As people’s on-line data is increasingly aggregated by search engines [1] and used for a variety of purposes including evaluating their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> [2], impersonation attacks, par-ticularly those that go undetected, can have serious adverse consequences for the victims, even in the offline world. Fur-ther, social engineering attacks launched using impersonated identities can result in material and financial losses for the victim as well as the victim’s friends [3]. Despite the serious threat posed by impersonation at-tacks [4, 5] and the woeful state of defenses against the attacks, few research studies, to date, have systematically studied impersonation attacks in online social networks. We argue that the current state of affairs is largely due to the difficulty in gathering extensive ground truth data about im-personation attacks in the real-world. Beyond a few anec-dotal examples that are reported in the popular press, we lack large datasets about impersonation attacks in online social networks {{that can be used to}} characterize and detect identities participating in such attacks. In this paper, we take the fist step toward understanding and detecting impersonation attacks by presenting a novel method that allows to gather extensive ground truth of im-personation attacks in current social networks. § 2 gives the key idea behind our method and § 3 presents some prelimi-nary results on characterizing impersonation attacks...|$|E

At present, vocational rehabilitation professionals have limited resources {{for assessing the}} retarded individual 2 ̆ 7 s <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> in relation to each person 2 ̆ 7 s respective vocational goal. This study attempted to investigate all of the behaviors and traits that the rehabilitation literature indicated were potential predictors of a successful adjustment to work, which {{in this study were}} termed vocational adaptivity. This was accomplished by arranging 58 behavior descriptors in such a manner as to form a behavior rating scale. Twelve additional characteristics were also included as background information items. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the behaviors and traits of the adult mentally retarded rehabilitation client that can be used to discriminate at a statistically significant level, between those who are potentially employable and those who are not. An analysis of the results of this study indicate that there does appear to be a number of behaviors that can be used to predict the vocational adaptivity of a mentally retarded rehabilitation client prior to job placement. A discriminant analysis of the data generated by this study, indicated that the 58 items in the rating scale could be used to predict beyond the conventional. 05 level of significance. When the background information item in regard to participation in a job seeking skills class was added, a significance level of. 0058 was attained. Whereas various combinations of the background information items were found to be slightly better predictors of vocational adaptivity than the rating scale and the job seeking skills class item, the latter were behaviors that are potentially controllable and therefore of more interest to the rehabilitation professionals. The results of this study suggest that the vocational adaptivity scale appears to be a useful screening device insofar as helping to identify problem behaviors prior to job placement...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to develop a personality-oriented job analysis measure {{that could be used to}} identify non-cognitive person attitudes relevant to a given job. One application of this new job analysis measure could be to use it within a person-job (P-J) fit predictive framework.;Three studies were conducted. The first study was aimed at testing an initial item pool developed for the personality-oriented job analysis measure and selecting the best items for each scale. The job analysis measure was constructed to assess (a) 15 personality traits measured by the Jackson Personality Inventory (Jackson, 1994) and (b) 12 work values measured by the Work Values Survey (Fraboni 2 ̆ 6 Jackson, 1992). In this first study, the final scales showed adequate to high levels of homogeneity and minimum levels of scale redundancy (N = 106).;In Study 2 the new personality-oriented job analysis measure was administered to 192 workers so as to develop relatively distinct job profiles that were later used in Study 3. The inter-rater reliability of these profiles was found to be quite high. Relations of job scales with demographic variables, such as age, education, gender, and tenure, indicated that differences between judges on these variables had little effect on worker perceptions of their jobs.;In Study 3, a parallel was drawn between employment interviewers 2 ̆ 7 subjective judgments of applicants 2 ̆ 7 <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> and objective measures of person-job fit. It was hypothesized that objective fit estimates would be a superior predictor of job performance and satisfaction than would subjective fit estimates. Further, it was predicted that objective fit indices would be a better predictor of job performance and satisfaction than would person variables used alone as predictors. The comparative results of Study 3 suggest that P-J fit methods utilizing profile comparison indices may not be more advantageous than the traditional multiple regression approach.;The results of the studies are interpreted as providing some evidence for the validity of the new personality-oriented job analysis measure in identifying job-relevant person attributes and in using these non-cognitive measures as predictors of job performance and satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|In 2004 it was {{reported}} that up to half a million elderly people may be victims of abuse at any one time. Studies have shown that elder abuse can have devastating effects upon service users and can often lead to long-term health problems. It is vital that health care service providers acknowledge the importance of recruitment decision-making when employing carers for work involving vulnerable adults. In 2002 the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) was established in the UK to ensure safer recruitment decisions could be made. The CRB check is utilised to facilitate safer recruitment decisions by providing employers with wider access to an applicant’s criminal record information through a Disclosure service. However, how these changes are impacting upon recruitment decisions and its implications for the protection of vulnerable adults is yet to be examined. Therefore, the research presented here, sets out to explore how recruitment decisions are being made by individual decision-makers using CRB Disclosure information. The implications of these decisions for the protection of vulnerable adults and the ex-offender are examined. Organisations from the National Health Service, Social Services, Higher Education, Further Education and Care Home sectors whose employees have contact with vulnerable persons were recruited to take part in this research. A mixed methods approach was utilised to investigate research objectives. The research objectives were as follows: 1. To analyse exactly who is responsible for making recruitment decisions in an organisation 2. To discover whether or not recruitment decisions are informed by any guidance 3. To assess what impact the knowledge of convictions has upon perceived <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> of individuals working with vulnerable persons 4. To examine how trade off decisions for employment are made 5. To identify how easy or difficult recruitment decisions are to make 6. To examine the implications for the protection of vulnerable persons and 7. To evaluate the implications for human rights, civil liberties, discrimination and social exclusion. The findings indicate that recruitment decisions are being made inconsistently both within and between organisations. Both the actual recruitment decision made and the reasons for these decisions varied. In addition, results suggested that the organisation to which an ex-offender applies to for a post could determine the success of their application based on the recruitment decision-maker/s involved in the process. Moreover, there was no general consensus on what constituted a problematic offending profile. In order to aid data collection, a software package named Survey Software was created. This allowed the administration of a series of vignettes, whilst recording and sorting the inputted information. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Gravitational waves {{were first}} {{predicted}} by Albert Einstein's Theory of general relativity, published in 1916. These waves are perturbations in the curvature of space-time. Indirect {{evidence of their}} existence has been obtained via observations of binary pulsar system inspirals by Hulse and Taylor. Research is now focussed on achieving direct detection of gravitational waves, giving {{a new way of}} observing astronoomical events in the universe. Gravitational waves are quadrupole in nature, causing tidal strains in space. The weak nature of gravity means that the magnitude of these strains is very small. Only astronomical scale sources are likely to produce waves of sufficient amplitude to be detected on Earth. In the frequency band of a few Hz to a few kHz, the expected strain amplitude for violent sources is of the order of 10 [superscript - 22]. Detection is most likely to be achieved using long baseline interferometer detectors. Currently several such detectors are in operation worldwide, including the GEO 600 detector, built in a collaboration involving the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow, the Albert Einstein Institute (Hannover and Golm), and the University of Cardiff. In America the LIGO detector network has three large interferometric detectors - two of 4 km arm length and one with 2 km arms. In Italy a European collaboration has constructed the 3 km VIRGO detector. Currently GEO 600 and LIGO have undertaken 5 data taking science runs with the most recent year long run, also involving VIRGO, concluding in November 2007. No detections have yet been confirmed, but analysis on the results of the most recent GEO 600 /LIGO/VIRGO run is ongoing. These detectors are now operating at, or close to their design sensitivities, so research is focussed on reduction of various noise sources by upgrading of the detectors. One important noise source is thermal noise (both Brownian and thermo-elastic) - a limiting factor at midband frequencies. Reduction of mechanical loss in mirrors and their suspensions will help lessen the impact of thermal noise in future detectors. The research detailed in this thesis was aimed at reducing thermal noise. In particular, it covers work undertaken to investigate the mechanical loss of suspension ribbons and fibres, test mass mirror coatings and also diffractive surfaces on test masses to evaluate their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> in future advanced gravitational wave detectors. Upgrade of LIGO to "Advanced LIGO" will aim to reduce thermal noise by implementing mirror suspension techniques pioneered in GEO 600. Specifically, it was initially proposed that test masses be suspended from silica ribbon fibres, a key choice that will be re-evaluated in this thesis. Ribbons (or fibres) will be fabricated by a CO[subscript 2] laser pulling machine being developed in Glasgow, with control programming being undertaken by the author. Characterising the dimensions, strength and vertical bounce frequencies of the ribbons is important to confirm their suitability for use in detector mirror suspensions. A dimensional characterisation machine was constructed to measure the ribbon's cross sectional dimensions, with emphasis being placed on achieving high resolution in the ribbon neck regions, where the most bending occurs. Also, a bounce testing machine was constructed to experimentally measure the ribbon's vertical bounce frequency. Finally a proof load test was constructed to verify that ribbons could support the required weight. Results showed that ribbons could be fabricated successfully with the required strength and bounce frequency, though shaping of the cross section still requires further research to achieve the optimum. In a pendulum system most of the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy rather than bending energy of the suspension fibres or ribbons. Thus the effective loss of the suspension fibres/ribbons is reduced or "diluted" and thermal noise is lower than may be naively expected. Dilution of the mechanical loss of the pendulum suspensions was investigated using finite element modelling. Methods for importing data from the dimensional characterisation machine were developed, and it was observed that the dilution resulting from ribbon suspensions was not as high as had been initially expected, with bending in the neck region of the ribbon being seen to significantly reduce dilution. It was observed that the rectangular ribbons had inferior dilution to equivalent cross section circular fibres for necks of the length typically being produced. A typical 7. 5 mm necked ribbon was seen to have a dilution 1. 5 times lower than an equivalent fibre, despite the ribbons having 3. 3 times greater dilution with no necks. Ribbons were only seen to have this superior dilution for very short necks. Bending in the necks resulted in an increased amount of bending strain energy occurring which caused the lower dilution factors. Additionally, bending occurring in the ears that join the fibres or ribbons to the masses was seen to further reduce the dilution. In the light of low dilution factors, reduction (ideally nulling) of thermoelastic noise was studied. Reduction in thermal noise in this way is proposed through the use of tapered fibres, which showed that a lower overall noise level than that from the baseline ribbons planned for Advanced LIGO can be achieved, despite lower dilution factors. In the light of this work tapered fibres have now been adopted as the baseling for Advanced LIGO. Measurement of test mass mirror samples showed that the mechanical loss of mirror coatings can be significantly reduced by doping the high refractive index layer, with reduction up to a factor of 2. 5 in measured mechanical loss observed, when compared to equivalent undoped coatings. In order to perform these measurements an interferometric read out system was constructed. Future detectors will use higher laser powers which may cause thermal distortions in transmissive optical components. Use of all reflective components may be required to reduce this problem, possibly via diffractive mirrors. Measurements were undertaken on samples to discover if introducing a diffraction grating to an optic's surface increased the mechanical loss. However, the grating was not seen to do this, and also did not increase the mechanical loss of an optical coating applied on top of its surface, which verified that diffractive optics are viable for use in future detectors.
