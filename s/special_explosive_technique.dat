40|$|When {{decommissioning}} {{nuclear power}} stations, the segmentation of the {{reactor pressure vessel}} is very difficult and time consuming due to the large wall thicknesses and high core activation encountered. Also as shown in a former study the approach of cutting typically 240 mm of steel for a 1300 MW PWR by conventional <b>explosive</b> <b>techniques</b> is not feasible because roughly 40 kg/m of high explosive would be needed, leading to an extensive generation of blast waves, dust and high velocity fragments. The borehole embrittlement/explosive technique developed and tested in this project reduces the amount of high explosive to approximately 2 kg per circumferential cut in the original scale. The liquid nitrogen cooling technique is state of art outside nuclear power stations and the handling of high explosives inside already has been realised. All steps of the proposed borehole embrittlement/shaped charge <b>explosive</b> <b>technique</b> can be easily handled by a manipulator and advantageously to mechanical and thermal cutting {{there is no need}} for any online controlling. Though until now no mock-up tests have been carried out the technique can compete especially for segmenting already removed parts of activated components, like rings of the vessel. This should be proved in practice within a German facility. (orig.)

50|$|In 1984, {{after many}} years of stable air traffic ridership, numbers {{increased}} in 1984, and the debate took off again.

The Civil Airport Administration launched a report in 1986, and recommended Hurum as the best location.
