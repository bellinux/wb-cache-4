Technology of interval and purposive regulation of cuts speed is used at most humps. The article discusses ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed to a safe level at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> equipped with quasi-continuous speed control system. Methodology. It proposed three fundamentally different ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>sorting</b> siding. The analysis of the ways to reduce cuts rolling speed to a safe level at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> was conducted using simulation the process of cuts rolling from humps equipped with quasi-continuous speed control. Findings. As a result of analysis, the inappropriateness of opposite elevation using on the roll-out part of the hump after the last separation switch point. Spot regulators of cars speed can be used to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>sorting</b> siding, but this leads to a division conditions deterioration on the last separating switch points of long cuts with the following after them short cuts. Reducing the cuts rolling speed at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>sorting</b> siding can be carried out using the beam on a stationary wagon retarders park brake position. Control Algorithm park brake position is quite simple. All produce should be unhooked from it at a safe speed. If the accuracy of the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>set</b> speed output to unhook from the park brake position is low, it is possible to eliminate the error of point regulators cars speed. Originality. The question where to start location point of wagon retarders zone to reduce speed to cut level requires additional research. Reducing rolling cut the speed at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> can be carried out using the beam on a stationary wagon retarders park brake position. Practical value.

The first is to find reasonable algorithms for typechecking Pure Type Systems [Bar 91] (PTS); the second is a technical question about PTS, the so called Expansion Postponment property (EP), which is tantalizingly simple but remains unsolved. There are several implementations of formal systems that are either PTS or closely related to PTS. For example, LEGO [LP 92] implements the Pure Calculus of Constructions [CH 88] (PCC), the Extended Calculus of Constructions [Luo 90] and the Edinburgh Logical Framework [HHP 87].

Incoming trains were split in the 11 reception sidings, propelled over the hump in the yard, from where the individual wagons rolled down a slope and were automatically sorted into new trains on the Yard's 50 main <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings.</b> The yard even had its own dedicated class of shunting locomotive (British Rail Class 13) for this purpose as BR's standard class of shunting locomotive was not powerful enough {{for use in the}} yard. [...] Each <b>of</b> the main <b>sorting</b> <b>sidings</b> was fitted with computer-controlled retarders to either slow the rolling wagons down before they hit other wagons already on the siding, or give wagons rolling too slowly a boost to move them along to the correct position in a particular siding. This wagon-control system, manufactured by Dowty, was very complex, needed almost constant maintenance, and crucially could not handle longer wheelbase wagons, which were already becoming more prevalent and required individual shunting. There was an express freight and departure yard of 10 sidings, and a 25 road secondary yard for local freight trains (with its own hump).|$|R
