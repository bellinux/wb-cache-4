Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>benefits</b> (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits {{of men and women who}} were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations about <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>benefits</b> may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{growth in}} wage {{inequality}} {{has important implications}} for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> solvency and the distribution of benefits. Because only earnings below the taxable maximum are subject to <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> payroll taxes, wage growth that is concentrated among very high earners will generate lower tax receipts than wage growth that is more evenly distributed. The progressivity of the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>benefit</b> formula increases benefit payouts when the share of workers with low wages grows. This study uses a dynamic microsimulation model to examine the aggregate and distributional consequences of alternative scenarios about the distribution of future wage growth among workers. We find fairly marked changes in projected <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>benefit</b> distributions, poverty, and long-term financing status with relatively modest changes in assumptions about wage differentials. ...|$|R

25|$|According to {{a report}} by the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the gender pay gap jeopardizes women's {{retirement}} security. Of the multiple sources of income Americans rely on later in life, many are directly linked to a worker's earnings over his or her career. These include <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>benefits,</b> based on lifetime earnings, and defined benefit pension distributions that are typically calculated using a formula based on a worker's tenure and salary during peak-earnings years. The persistent gender pay gap leaves women with less income from these sources than men. For example, older women's <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>benefits</b> are 71% of older men's benefits ($11,057 for women versus $15,557 for men in 2009). Incomes from public and private pensions based on women's own work were just 60% and 48% of men's pension incomes, respectively.|$|E
