6000|$|... "See here, Sis," [...] {{cried the}} young millionaire, [...] "I {{am going to}} take Miss Laning back in my runabout. She <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take her place with the Rovers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I nat'rally s'posed. Well, {{the old man}} <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{come out}} on promises, if you're {{disposed}} to make 'em. So you're master of your own movements, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] asked Asti, {{looking at}} him coolly. [...] "I should never have guessed it. Well, if you steal my goods, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>you</b> will be King of Thieves also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What new {{nonsense}} is this?" [...] cried Vane. [...] "I know there's {{some crazy}} yarn about the trees spreading fever, though every educated man knows why these epidemics return occasionally. And I know they <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell {{the noise of}} them among other trees in a gale, and I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> But even Cornwall isn't a lunatic asylum, and a tree that dines on a passing tourist--" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} both a writer and a {{political}} activist. Those who <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> have no conception of what literature really is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{open the}} chest {{in the corner}} there, {{and you will see}} the Devil {{squatting}} inside it; but you must hold the lid so that he shall not escape.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A week," [...] said Desmond. [...] "Ormsgill's time {{is running}} out, and he'll be here or send us word by then. He said he would, and what that man <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> count on being done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, old top," [...] said Archie, apologetically, [...] "the Emperor of the Blighters out yonder <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have a {{job here}} as waiter, and he won't do another dashed thing for you. How about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that 's in the Black Forest," [...] cried Singleton, with {{profound}} simplicity. [...] "They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make capital studies of trees there." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take nothing, but if {{she likes}} she can cook a large sole, only you won't be able to touch it.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, no doubt, Mr. Cumming, but {{you know}} all banks are not {{perfectly}} safe. Well, I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> manage that for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The colonel was tickled {{to death}} to receive so much deer meat," [...] {{said the old}} scout. [...] "And he <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stay until Saturday night if you wish. His lady {{said she had been}} wanting some venison for several weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} are fickle, Frances," [...] said Corona gravely, [...] "because I don't think you ever really loved that man at all. You only {{imagined}} you did. And he was not worthy of you. You are so good, dear; those shore people just worship you. Elliott <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do anything you like with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} will be to-morrow; for papa has a lazy fit coming on, and then he always plays with me and lets me rummage where I like, while he goes out or smokes in the garden. So be ready; and if he <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> come, I will have the flag up early and you can hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to go," [...] Clifford declared. [...] "I {{know some}} fellows {{who have been}} to Europe. They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have better fun here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rulledge {{pushed back}} his chair, {{and walked away}} in dudgeon. [...] "I'm a busy man myself. When you've got {{anything}} to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> send for me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Aunt Hannah thinks I {{ought to}} run out of doors a little while because I have stayed in the house so long. There isn't the least bit of need; but I must go, else she'll worry herself sick. She <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sit with her, an' I'll take Snippey with me, for he's needing fresh air more than I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I haven't {{forgotten}} anything this time, Marilla. But do {{you think}} it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good? I used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated. Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says we'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what if that cake doesn't rise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless you, no, child; it 's only {{powder to}} make a noise and scare 'em. I wouldn't {{like to be in}} his place, though; father <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never trust tigers as you can lions, no matter how tame they are. Sly fellers, like cats, and when they scratch it's no joke, I tell you," [...] {{answered}} Ben, with a knowing wag of the head, as the sides of the cage rattled down, and the poor, fierce creatures were seen leaping and snarling as if they resented this display of their captivity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> After all, <b>you</b> hadn't any {{passengers}} on the occasion I was referring to. I suppose you feel {{you have to consider}} them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good God!" [...] I cried, disconcerted beyond measure, [...] "won't {{you learn}} to do your own hair for me? Do <b>you</b> mean to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> love a man--" ...|$|R
60|$|The English waiters and servant girls always <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have {{whatever}} <b>you</b> like; but it {{does not}} always prove in the end that the promise can be realized.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if you're {{like the}} other Gentiles who have come into Utah you won't have scruples about drawing on a man. Father says the draw comes natural to you, and you're as quick as he is. Then he <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> beat any rifle shot he ever saw, and that long-barrelled gun you've got will shoot a mile. So {{if it comes to}} shooting--why, you can shoot. If you want to run--who's going to catch you on that white-maned stallion? We talked about you, George and I; we're mighty glad you're well and can ride with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, my good girl, we haven't {{the least}} {{intention}} of keeping {{you in the}} dark. If {{you want to leave}} your mistress like this in the midst of her anxieties she <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go and welcome. But it's not a bit of good in the world coming up with these cock-and-bull stories. The truth is your master's mad, that's the sober truth of it--hopelessly insane, you understand; and we've got to find him. But nothing's to be said, d'ye see? It's got to be done without fuss or scandal. But if there's any witness wanted, or anything of that kind, why, here you are; and,' he dropped his voice to an almost inaudible hoot, 'and well worth your while! You did see him, eh? Step into the trap, and all that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR PETER:--Aunt Olivia {{says for}} us all to write a {{compound}} letter to cheer you up. We are all awful glad you are getting better. It gave us an awful scare when we heard {{you were going to}} die. But you will soon be all right and able to get out again. Be careful you don't catch cold. I am going to bake some nice things for you and send them over, now that the doctor <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> eat them. And I'll send you my rosebud plate to eat off of. I'm only lending it, you know, not giving it. I let very few people use it because it is my greatest treasure. Mind you don't break it. Aunt Olivia must always wash it, not your mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> guess Mr. Jernyngham's errand," [...] he said. [...] "Unless we can hit on {{the truth}} before long, you'll have that gentleman in the guard-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{be married}} again, Arnold, which would {{certainly}} be best in all respects, and might save litigation some day. But here they come, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel made {{no answer}} {{for a long}} time. Then he said quietly:--"If you're passed by the Doctor I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go. I shouldn't smoke if I were you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Walter nodded. [...] "Well," [...] {{continued}} Pat, [...] "before {{this law}} was made trappers used to chop {{a hole in}} the side of a house and set a trap on the bed inside. Of course this drove the rats out, but they would soon be back, because there was nowhere else to go. By visiting the traps night and morning it was no trick at all to get all the rats. Now the law forbids this kind of trapping. Alec here doesn't approve of the law. He thinks that there are rats enough and to spare and he can't see that that kind of work is cutting his own nose off and killing the goose that lays the golden egg. <b>Says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> clean all the rats out of a place and in time more will come to take their places, and I can't make him see it any different." ...|$|E
60|$|He stood motionless, {{as one in}} a dream, {{or rather}} as if not knowing which was reality, and which phantom; gazing, gazing on at the bed where the King lay, round which the ecclesiastics were busying themselves, unperceiving that James, Bedford, and the nobles had quitted the apartment, till Percy first spoke {{to him in a}} whisper, then almost shook him, and led him out of the room. 'I am sent for you,' he said, in a much shaken voice; 'your king <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be of use.' Then {{tightening}} his grasp with the force of intense grief, 'Oh, what a day! what a day! My father! my father! I never knew mine own father! But he has been all to Harry and to me! Oh, woe worth the day!' And dropping into a window- seat, he covered his face with his hands, and gave way to his grief: pointing, however, to the council-room, where Malcolm found Bedford writing at the table, King James, and a few others, engaged in the same manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] {{interrupted}} North, {{only half}} concealing his disgust as {{he rose and}} carried the baby to the other room, {{beyond the reach of}} names that might shock its ladylike ears. The next morning he met the from-dance-returning Bessy abstractedly, and soon took his leave, full of a disloyal plan, conceived in the sleeplessness of her own bedchamber. He was satisfied that he owed a duty to its unknown parents to remove the child from the degrading influences of the barber Kanaka, and Hank Fisher especially, and he resolved to write to his relatives, stating the case, asking a home for the waif and assistance to find its parents. He addressed this letter to his cousin Maria, partly in consideration of the dramatic farewell of that young lady, and its possible influence in turning her susceptible heart towards his protege. He then quietly settled back to his old solitary habits, and for a week left the Robinsons unvisited. The result was a morning call by Trinidad Joe on the hermit. [...] "It's a whim of my gal's, Mr. North," [...] he said, dejectedly, [...] "and ez I told you before and warned ye, when that gal hez an idee, fower yoke of oxen and seving men can't drag it outer her. She's got a idee o' larnin'--never hevin' hed much schoolin', and we ony takin' the papers, permiskiss like--and she <b>says</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>can</b> teach her--not hevin' anythin' else to do. Do ye folly me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not; but we {{all feel}} that we can't disown our leader," [...] Broadwood answered. [...] "I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{understand}} {{that we have a}} hard row to hoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Kitty," [...] {{the married}} lady was <b>saying,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell the girls what you please about the gayeties of Niagara, {{when you get}} home. They'll believe {{anything}} sooner than the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel made {{no answer}} {{for a long}} time. Then he said quietly: [...] "If you're passed by the Doctor I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go. I shouldn't smoke if I were you." ...|$|R
