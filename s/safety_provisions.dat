30|$|Understanding the {{trade-off}} between social <b>safety</b> <b>provision</b> and its misuse {{is important for}} the design of a modern social security system which maximizes social <b>safety</b> <b>provision</b> under increasingly tight financial budget constraints (Aarts et al. 1996).

500|$|In a {{flashback}} {{sequence of the}} episode, Lucas is subjected to waterboarding, a method of torture. In order to ensure {{the authenticity of the}} sequence, Armitage was subjected to the actual torture. He agreed to perform the sequence after he was convinced by consultants from the FSB and CIA. Armitage was only waterboarded for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear as if he was on for longer. Kudos film and television, the production company behind Spooks, had to follow several health and <b>safety</b> <b>provisions</b> from an advisor to ensure the sequence strictly adheres to the advice. The advisor and a medic were present during filming. The ambient temperature of the room was raised to make Armitage as comfortable as possible. However, after the sequence was shot, Armitage changed his opinion entirely, stating; [...] "I only lasted five to ten seconds, and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{allow the}} cast to perform {{many of their}} own stunts. In filming fight sequences, they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves. The guns featured on the series are real. In scenes where guns are included, an armourer is on hand throughout {{the entirety of the}} sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming. After the sequence is shot, the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them, even if the guns are not loaded. Among other stunt work, Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence. The actor agreed after he was convinced by conultants from the FSB and CIA.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the impact and effects that defendant characteristics, Guidelines defined legally relevant variables, and process related variables have on length of imprisonment for offenders who are young. More specifically, this research looks at how the <b>safety</b> valve <b>provision,</b> spelled out in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, may condition the effect of variables on length of imprisonment by splitting the defendants up into groups based on if they qualified for the provision or not. Previous literature that has studied the effects of defendant characteristics and the <b>safety</b> valve <b>provision</b> is presented to base the current research off of. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines legalities are discussed at length and how a defendant can qualify for the <b>safety</b> valve <b>provision</b> and other judicial departures from the Guidelines. Finally, a regression analysis is conducted on the variables to see how qualifying for the <b>safety</b> valve <b>provision</b> or not conditions certain variables that affect length of imprisonment. Only two departures from the Guidelines resulted in a statistically significant difference between the two defendant groups. Suggestions for future research based on my findings are outlined as well...|$|R
