50|$|Generally once he hits {{that range}} on his weight indicator, he waits while the jars {{open to the}} less {{restricted}} point, whereupon the <b>sinker</b> <b>bar</b> travels upwards rapidly, providing an upwards hit on the downhole tools. The jars can then be 'reset' by lowering the line until {{the weight of the}} <b>sinker</b> <b>bar</b> closes, or pushes the inner mandrel of the hydraulic jars back to the starting position. Because the hydraulic jars are designed to provide a wait time to allow the operator to get up to the desired line tension, they can provide a very effective upwards hit.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical jars {{look like}} a long, tubular piece of {{machined}} metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' {{depends on how much}} <b>sinker</b> <b>bar</b> is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the <b>sinker</b> <b>bar</b> via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commercial}} {{failure of}} Lee's design {{might have led}} to a dead-end for the knitting machine, but John Ashton, one of Lee's assistants, made a crucial improvement by adding the mechanism known as a [...] "divider". This is used after the jack sinkers have pulled down a large loop over all the needles, and the <b>sinker</b> <b>bar</b> has separated out the loop, the dividers are rested on the loop to give the bearded needles guidance as they are pulled forward.|$|E
50|$|Air lift uses {{compressed}} air to lift water in operations such as dredging and underwater archeology. It {{is also found}} in aquariums to keep water circulating. These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts. These systems used single point injection of air into the liquid stream, normally through a foot valve {{at the bottom of the}} string. Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using {{compressed air}}, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift. In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of gas lift valves that could be used for unloading in stages. Some of these systems involved moving the tubing, or using wireline <b>sinker</b> <b>bars</b> to change the lift point. Others were spring operated valves. Ultimately, in 1944 W.R. King patented the pressurized bellows valve that is used today. In 1951 the sidepocket mandrel was developed for selectively positioning and retrieving gas lift valves with wireline.|$|R
5000|$|General play {{proceeds}} as you {{complete the}} six trialsâ€”completing 5 Fun Zone puzzles, completing 5 Thrill Zone puzzles, getting Thrill points (the letters spelling THRILLRIDE) {{in order to}} activate and complete the Nighttime Fantasy puzzle. Going on all the rides (activating all 10 zone puzzles), activating both multiballs, and frequently visiting the Snack <b>Bar</b> <b>sinker</b> are also needed to complete General play. Completing all six trials activates a [...] "Lights Out" [...] puzzle, breaking light bulbs with the ball; when this is done the table goes into Nighttime Fantasy Multiball mode before resetting the table (play continues, and multiple Lights Out are possible).|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic jars for {{slickline}} {{are generally}} meant to jar up only, because not enough <b>sinker</b> <b>bar</b> {{is able to}} feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the downhole tools. Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force {{on the top of}} the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by threaded connection to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the downhole tools. Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that hydraulic fluid has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{put forward}} a new {{specialty}} blasting method to solve drill-jamming based on stress concentration and stress wave theory. Drill-jamming accident of banji was successfully solved at the early 2006 through this method first: for this drill-jamming, study drilling tools and location of drill-jamming to find the weak position (Fig. 1); produce impact loading and form stress concentration (Fig. 3) at weak position by place well-designed explosive package at special position. Through many times controllable safe explosions and repeatedly impact loading, accurate fracture, separate <b>sinker</b> <b>bar</b> and the above parts from drill bit, this part raised up successfully (Fig. 7). The rest would be taken out after second reaming...|$|E
