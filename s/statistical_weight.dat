Non-participation and drop-out may introduce a bias whose magnitude {{depends on how}} strongly its determinants {{are related to the}} respective parameter of interest. Methods: When most information is missing, the standard approach is to estimate each respondent’s probability of participating and assign each respondent a weight that is inversely proportional to this probability. This paper contains a review of the major ideas and principles regarding the computation of <b>statistical</b> <b>weights</b> and the analysis of weighted data. Results: A short software review for weighted data is provided and the use of <b>statistical</b> <b>weights</b> is illustrated through data from the EDSP (Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology) Study.

Illustrations are given of contractile processes in fibers and of changes in macromolecular conformation in dilute solution.

A statistical mechanical treatment of the helix-coil transition involves the assignment of <b>statistical</b> <b>weights</b> to various states and the proper counting of these <b>statistical</b> <b>weights</b> in the formation and evaluation of the partition function; the thermodynamic properties of the system are derivable from the partition function.
