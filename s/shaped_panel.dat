The LS-DYNA finite element program along with the Concrete Damage Model was used to develop the numerical model and calibrated using the results of existing explosive trials. Both convex and concave <b>shaped</b> single curvature <b>panels</b> were assessed along with standards flat panels for the blast performance. Two different connection types were considered for the evaluation, which were identical to those used in the original explosive trials, named as dowelled type and angle cleat type connections.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of forming a third generation aluminium-lithium alloy (AA 2060) into a complex <b>shaped</b> <b>panel</b> component, was studied {{by using an}} advanced forming technology called solution heat treatment, cold die forming and in-die quenching (HFQ*) process. The flow stresses of AA 2060 were obtained at different temperatures ranging from 350 to 520 oC at the strain rate of 1 [*]s− 1. The suitable temperature to achieve the adequate ductility was found at 470 oC. By forming the AA 2060 blanks at the optimum forming temperature, experimental results exhibited the feasibility for forming complex-shaped AA 2060 components. The formed components were analysed through strain measurements. The post-form mechanical properties of AA 2060 were assessed using hardness and tensile tests. * HFQ® is a registered trademark of Impression Technologies Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{effective}} manufacturing process developed to overcome drawbacks {{that can occur}} using a nanofilled resin as matrix in aeronautical composites. Nanoparticles embedded in epoxy resins impregnating carbon fibers are able to improve a composite with new desired functionalities. As soon as the nanoparticles are dispersed in a resin, the viscosity dizzily rises and usually, the traditional manufacturing processes are not suitable to obtain a good quality of the manufactured panels. An alternative method has been developed starting from the Resin Film Infusion (RFI) process. This method has been firstly tested on several flat panels, and then it has been transferred on a more complex <b>shaped</b> <b>panel</b> with three stringers. In this work, a flame resistant resin based on a tetrafunctional epoxy precursor filled with carbon nanotubes to increase electrical conductivity, {{has been used for}} the panel manufacturing...|$|E

A test programme is presented which describes the material and workpiece information and the test plans for the experimental evaluation of the creep-ageing and springback behaviour of aluminium alloy 7 B 04 -T 651 under 115 oC. Experimental results from the creep-ageing and tensile tests {{were used to determine}} a CAF material model for the alloy. A flexible tool design has been proposed and a laboratory-scale prototype has been delivered and used to perform the CAF tests in this research. The determined CAF material model and geometry of the flexible tool design were treated as input and used to construct a CAF process model using finite element (FE) method. Comparisons between final deflections of FE-simulated and experimentally formed plates validated the springback predictive ability of the FE process model. The model was eventually employed to model springback-compensated tool shapes and using the modelled tool shapes to perform CAF tests have produced formed plates that have an average 0. 81 ?? 0. 14 mm of maximum absolute vertical difference from target shape. CAF can now be used to produce accurately <b>shaped</b> <b>panel</b> components in a laboratory environment using the equipment and techniques developed in this research. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, fashion {{industry}} and apparel manufacturing have been applying intelligent CAD technologies to operate garment <b>panel</b> <b>shapes</b> in digital form. As garment panels are being accumulated gradually, {{there is a}} growing interest in finding similar <b>panel</b> <b>shapes</b> from large collections. The retrieved <b>panel</b> <b>shapes</b> can provide recommendations for stylists to reference and re-create during the cognitive fashion design process. In this paper, we propose a novel graph modeling and matching method to facilitate the searching of <b>panel</b> <b>shapes</b> for sketch-based garment design. A <b>panel</b> <b>shape</b> is first decomposed into a sequence of connected segments and represented by the proposed bi-segment graph (BSG) model to encode its intrinsic features. A new matching metric based on weighted direct product graph and minimal spanning tree (WDPG-MST) is then proposed to compute the similarity between two BSG models of the <b>panel</b> <b>shapes.</b> Finally in the front-tier, we provide a sketching interface based on our previous work for designers to input and edit the clothing panels. The simulation of the resulting garment design is also visualized and returned to the user in 3 D. Experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

More recently Teamgeist and Jabulani balls have 14 and 8 panels, respectively, with dramatically different <b>panel</b> <b>shapes</b> and designs from conventional balls. The latest model called Cafusa, made with 32 panels, {{has been adopted}} by many soccer leagues. However, there are few studies on the aerodynamic characteristics of these balls. This study examined the trajectory and aerodynamic characteristics of soccer balls constructed with different numbers and <b>shapes</b> of <b>panels.</b> Results of wind tunnel tests indicated that the aerodynamic forces varied significantly according {{to the number of}} panels. They were also substantially different by the panel orientation of the balls and their rotation. The results for points of impact showed that the ball trajectory changes dramatically according to panel orientation, suggesting that panel orientation has significant effects on the flight of the balls. Furthermore, the <b>panel</b> <b>shapes,</b> rather than the numbers, are considered to affect the flight trajectory because balls with the same number of panels varied depending on their <b>panel</b> <b>shape</b> and orientation...|$|R

40|$|Creep-age forming (CAF) is an {{interesting}} process for the airframe industry, as {{it is able to}} form or <b>shape</b> <b>panels</b> into smooth, but complex, curvatures. In the CAF process, the ageing cycle of the alloy is used to relax external loads imposed to the part, through creep mechanisms. Those relaxed stresses impose a new curvature to the part. At the end of the process, significant spring back (sometimes about 70 %) is observed and the success in achieving the desired form depends on how the spring back can be predicted in order to compensate it by tooling changes. Most of the applications relate to simple (non stiffened) panels. The present work deals with the CAF of aluminum panels for aircraft wing skin application. CAF was performed using vacuum-bagging autoclave technique in small scale complex <b>shape</b> stiffened <b>panels,</b> machined from an AA 7475 alloy plate.
