25|$|In late 2006, Alexander {{announced}} that he had secured the requisite number of votes to become the Republican Party's Minority Whip in the Senate during the 110th Congress.

25|$|An early {{milestone}} {{in the rise}} in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott.</b> Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States {{would have been better}} off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{following}} passage of {{federal civil rights}} legislation in the mid-1960s and enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government, {{the influence of the}} Councils had waned considerably yet remained an institutional basis for the majority of white residents in Mississippi. The successor organization to the White Citizens' Councils is the St. Louis-based Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985 to continue collaborations between Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist political agendas in the United States. Republican politician and past <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott</b> of Mississippi was a member while North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms and Georgia Congressman Bob Barr were both strong supporters of the Council of Conservative Citizens; David Duke also spoke at a fund raising event, while Patrick Buchanan's campaign manager was linked to both Duke and the Council. In 1996, a Charleston, SC, drive-by shooting by Klan members of three African American males occurred after a Council rally; Dylann Roof, responsible for the 2015 murder of nine Emanuel AME church members in Charleston, espoused Council of Conservative Citizens rhetoric in a manifesto.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in April 2010: [...] "An analysis by Public Citizen found {{that at least}} 70 former members of Congress were lobbying for Wall Street and the financial services sector last year, including two former <b>Senate</b> <b>majority</b> <b>leaders</b> (<b>Trent</b> Lott and Bob Dole), two former House <b>majority</b> <b>leaders</b> (Richard A. Gephardt and Dick Armey) and a former House speaker (J. Dennis Hastert). In addition to the lawmakers, data from the Center for Responsive Politics counted 56 former Congressional aides on the Senate or House banking committees {{who went on to}} use their expertise to lobby for the financial sector." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the often}} heated debate over {{campaign}} finance reform, few events have generated more heat than <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Trent</b> Lott's selection of Professor Bradley A. Smith for a GOP {{seat on the}} Federal Election Commission. Critics called Smith, a noted expert on campaign finance, "unfit" to serve, his selection "an insult. " Someone on the FEC with his views, said one critic, is "unthinkable. " Given that opposition, President Clinton has thus far refused to nominate Smith. In response, the GOP has put a hold on Clinton's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations. What is Smith's "crime"? In his scholarly writings, he has challenged the conventional wisdom by arguing that past campaign finance reforms have made the system worse and that most proposed reforms {{would do the same}} [...] and, more important, would violate the First Amendment. He urges an end to limits on both contributions and spending [...] but with full disclosure. Although Smith's critics call him "radical," their attack has raised a question: Just who is the radical? For in case after case, the courts have been on Smith's side, not {{on the side of his}} critics. Indeed, what his critics plainly fear is that Smith, on the FEC, will not be "radical" enough, will not press the "robust enforcement" the courts have repeatedly struck down. For his part, Smith has said he will enforce the law, but he will not waste the tax-payers' money pursuing unconstitutional enforcement theories. His selection is a breath of fresh air that should bring needed balance to the campaign finance debate...|$|R
2500|$|Reid apologized on January 9, 2010, for racially tinged {{comments}} he {{had made}} when Obama was campaigning for president. In private conversations, Reid had remarked that Obama could win the Presidency because the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama—to whom he referred as being [...] "light-skinned" [...] and [...] "with no Negro dialect, unless {{he wanted to have}} one". These comments had been recently revealed by journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann in Game Change, their book about the 2008 election. In addition to his public apology, Reid called Obama to apologize; Obama accepted his apology, stating that {{as far as he was}} concerned, the book was closed on the incident. RNC Chairman Michael Steele and Senators John Cornyn and Jon Kyl called on Reid to resign his leadership position in the <b>Senate,</b> citing <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Trent</b> Lott resigning because of a statement relating to race. However, multiple experts said there was virtually no chance of that. DNC Chairman Tim Kaine and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Jack Reed expressed support for Reid and confidence he would retain his leadership position, and another senior Democrat indicated Reid has [...] "produced supportive statements from key African American leaders in the Congress and civil rights community".|$|R
2500|$|The {{last major}} push for congressional action came in 1996–1997. [...] Several bills had been {{introduced}} in both the House and the Senate. The most prominent was Senator Don Nickles' [...] "Paycheck Protection Act," [...] which <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott</b> re-introduced in 1998. The issue became caught in campaign finance reform legislation that year. Section 501 of the [...] "Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997" [...] (BRCA) merely codified the Beck decision, but the [...] "Paycheck Protection Act" [...] went much further and required all workers to affirm {{on an annual basis}} whether their dues could be used for political purposes. Senator Lott offered the Nickles bill as an amendment to the BRCA, which many Democrats (and some Republicans) saw as a poison pill amendment. Under procedures adopted by the Senate, Senators would need to reject the Lott amendment before voting on the BRCA. But with Republicans unwilling to vote against the amendment (which was popular with their conservative base), the Lott amendment was added to the BRCA and the Beck amendment died along with the BRCA after a number of other procedural votes.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott</b> said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E
