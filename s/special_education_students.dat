Decision making helps us to deal constructively with decisions in our lives. Making a decision involves making a commitment; however small, rationally and emotionally.

Life skill questionnaire with decision making skill was constructed and standardized.

40|$|Collaboration between {{general and}} <b>special</b> <b>education</b> {{teachers}} {{is essential for}} students with disabilities to have access to general education curriculum and instruction, and improved outcomes in school. The Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), and No Child Left Behind Legislation, include mandates that increase demands for collaboration. However, many general and <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers report not feeling prepared to step outside traditional roles to collaborate {{to meet the needs of}} this population. Collaboration is also a strong element of teaching and <b>special</b> <b>education</b> standards for teacher preparation. Yet, research shows many teacher education programs lack coursework and field experiences that focus on collaboration. The purpose of this study was to explore experiences <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teacher candidates had in collaboration with general <b>education</b> teachers during <b>student</b> teacher field placements. The research questions include: (a) To what extent are <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers expected to collaborate with general education teachers during field placements; and (b) How are perspectives on collaboration with general education teachers different between <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers and their mentor teachers? The study used qualitative multiple-case study design and content analysis. Data were collected across three different school contexts (elementary, middle school, and high school) in which <b>special</b> <b>education</b> candidates were placed for student teaching. Participants included <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers and their mentor teachers from each setting. Data sources included interviews, a survey of collaborative practices, text analysis of teacher work samples, and field-placement evaluations. Results of the study show many collaborative practices occur across different <b>special</b> <b>education</b> settings to various extents, and <b>special</b> <b>education</b> candidates have opportunities to learn about perspectives on collaboration and collaborative practices with general education teachers from mentor teachers. However, the standards-based student teaching performance measures did not guide or document the learning and experiences of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers in relation to collaboration with general education teachers. Recommendations are made for adding guidelines and performance measures in teacher education programs that prepare <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teacher candidates for collaborative roles in schools...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if <b>special</b> <b>education</b> and general <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers differed significantly in stress and selfefficacy during and following the student teaching semester. The institutional population was <b>special</b> <b>education</b> and general <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers at the top ten teacher producing universities in Texas and the sample was drawn from the four institutions which agreed to participate. Student teachers in these institutions were emailed a link to the survey site. The pretest resulted in a response rate of 16. 5 %, with 59 analyzable responses from participants. The posttest resulted in a response rate of 10 %, with 36 analyzable responses from participants. Data from 23 student teachers completed the stress pretest and posttest survey, and 22 student teachers completed the self-efficacy pretest and posttest survey. Data were analyzed using Friedman?s ANOVA and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. The survey contained two instruments, the Teacher Stress Inventory, and the Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale; and a researcher-developed demographic information sheet. Student teachers were asked to respond to questions pertaining to stress, as well as to how much influence student teachers have with certain aspects of the learning environment. Data analysis utilized descriptive and nonparametric inferential statistics to draw conclusions. Among the major research findings were: 1. General and <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers were significantly more stressed and demonstrated higher levels of self-efficacy from pretest to posttest. 2. Stress was most often caused by poorly motivated students and by students not trying to the best of their abilities. 3.

General <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers differed significantly in both stress and self-efficacy from pretest to posttest. The results of this study may provide a catalyst for further research examining the interplay between stress and self-efficacy, specifically for <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>student</b> teachers, and ultimately produce additional findings that may inform student teacher curricula.
