25|$|In solid mechanics, {{the slope}} of the <b>stress–strain</b> curve at any point is called the tangent modulus. It can be {{experimentally}} determined from {{the slope of}} a <b>stress–strain</b> curve created during tensile tests conducted on a sample of the material.|$|E
25|$|Non-Newtonian fluids {{have a more}} complicated, {{non-linear}} <b>stress-strain</b> behaviour. The sub-discipline of rheology {{describes the}} <b>stress-strain</b> behaviours of such fluids, which include emulsions and slurries, some viscoelastic materials such as blood and some polymers, and sticky liquids such as latex, honey and lubricants.|$|E
25|$|The {{point in}} the <b>stress-strain</b> curve at which the curve levels off and plastic {{deformation}} begins to occur.|$|E
25|$|The Voigt {{notation}} is {{used extensively}} in representing <b>stress–strain</b> relations in solid mechanics and for computational efficiency in numerical structural mechanics software.|$|E
25|$|Rubber {{exhibits}} unique {{physical and}} chemical properties. Rubber's <b>stress–strain</b> behavior exhibits the Mullins effect and the Payne effect and is often modeled as hyperelastic. Rubber strain crystallizes.|$|E
25|$|A more {{accurate}} approximation of the buckling load {{can be had}} {{by the use of}} the tangent modulus of elasticity, Et, which is less than the elastic modulus, in place of the elastic modulus of elasticity. The tangent is equal to the elastic modulus and then decreases beyond the proportional limit. The tangent modulus is a line drawn tangent to the <b>stress-strain</b> curve at a particular value of strain (in the elastic section of the <b>stress-strain</b> curve, the tangent modulus is equal to the elastic modulus). Plots of the tangent modulus of elasticity for a variety of materials are available in standard references.|$|E
25|$|Up to {{this amount}} of stress, stress is {{proportional}} to strain (Hooke's law), so the <b>stress-strain</b> graph is a straight line, and the gradient will be equal to the elastic modulus of the material.|$|E
25|$|Most silks, in {{particular}} dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of {{high tensile strength}} and extensibility (ductility). This enables a silk fibre to absorb {{a large amount of}} energy before breaking (toughness, the area under a <b>stress-strain</b> curve).|$|E
25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member {{is less than the}} elastic {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear <b>stress-strain</b> behavior. The <b>stress-strain</b> behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E
25|$|DSSM {{provides}} for very close fits to <b>stress–strain</b> curves, including for sands. Because it tracks {{conditions on the}} failure plane, it also provides close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something that other theories {{are not able to}} do. Additionally DSSM explains key relationships in soil mechanics that to date have simply been taken for granted, for example, why normalized undrained peak shear strengths vary with the log of the over consolidation ratio and why <b>stress–strain</b> curves normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-dimensional consolidation the void ratio must vary with the log of the effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for static load increments, and why the ratio of the creep value Cα to the compression index Cc must be approximately constant {{for a wide range of}} soils..|$|E
25|$|When a {{yield point}} is not easily defined based on {{the shape of the}} <b>stress-strain</b> curve an offset yield point is {{arbitrarily}} defined. The value for this is commonly set at 0.1 or 0.2% plastic strain. The offset value is given as a subscript, e.g., Rp0.2=310 MPa. High strength steel and aluminum alloys do not exhibit a yield point, so this offset yield point is used on these materials.|$|E
25|$|Young's modulus quantifies the {{elasticity}} of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as {{the ratio of}} rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the <b>stress-strain</b> curve when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{microscopic}} {{kinetic energy}} of a system arises as {{the sum of the}} motions of all the system's particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, whether it be the motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are those of the chemical and nuclear particle bonds, and the physical force fields within the system, such as due to internal induced electric or magnetic dipole moment, as well as the energy of deformation of solids (<b>stress-strain).</b> Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their <b>stress-strain</b> curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in soil mechanics to describe {{the magnitude of the}} shear stress that a soil can sustain. The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress. The <b>stress-strain</b> relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or residual strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of the scaffold material {{is perhaps the most}} important decision to be made. It must be biocompatible and biodegradable; in addition, it must be able to incorporate any physical, chemical, or biological cues desired, which in the case of some chemical cues means that it must have a site available for chemically linking peptides and other molecules. The scaffold materials chosen for nerve guidance conduits are almost always hydrogels. The hydrogel may be composed of either biological or synthetic polymers. Both biological and synthetic polymers have their strengths and weaknesses. It {{is important to note that}} the conduit material can cause inadequate recovery when (1) degradation and resorption rates do not match the tissue formation rate, (2) the <b>stress-strain</b> properties do not compare well to those of neural tissue, (3) when degrading swelling occurs, causing significant deformation, (4) a large inflammatory response is elicited, or (5) the material has low permeability.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to precisely define yielding due to the wide variety of <b>stress–strain</b> curves exhibited by real materials. In addition, there are several possible ways to define yielding: ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{relationship}} {{used extensively}} by practicing engineers is the empirical {{observation that the}} ratio of the undrained shear strength c to the original consolidation stress p' is approximately a constant for a given Over Consolidation Ratio (OCR). This relationship was first formalized by [...] and [...] who also extended it to show that <b>stress-strain</b> characteristics of remolded clays could also be normalized with respect to the [...] original consolidation stress. [...] The constant c/p relationship can also be derived from theory for both critical-state [...] and steady-state soil mechanics [...] [...] This fundamental, normalization property of the <b>stress-strain</b> curves is found in many clays, and was refined into the empirical SHANSEP (stress history and normalized soil engineering properties) method..|$|E
2500|$|The shear {{strength}} and stiffness of soil determines {{whether or not}} soil will be stable or {{how much it will}} deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary to determine if a slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall); some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the structure. Different criteria can be used to define the [...] "{{shear strength}}" [...] and the [...] "yield point" [...] for a soil element from a <b>stress–strain</b> curve. One may define the peak shear strength as the peak of a <b>stress–strain</b> curve, or the shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the shear resistance levels off. If the <b>stress–strain</b> curve does not stabilize before the end of shear strength test, the [...] "strength" [...] is sometimes considered to be the shear resistance at 15–20% strain. The shear strength of soil depends on many factors including the effective stress and the void ratio.|$|E
2500|$|A solid {{material}} will deform when a load {{is applied to}} it. If it returns to its original shape after the load is removed, this is called elastic deformation. In the range where the ratio between load and deformation remains constant, the <b>stress-strain</b> curve is linear. [...] Not many materials are linear and elastic beyond {{a small amount of}} deformation. A stiff material needs more force to deform compared to a soft material, and an infinite force would be needed to deform a perfectly rigid material, implying that it would have an infinite Young's modulus. Although such a material cannot exist, a material with a very high Young's modulus can be approximated as rigid.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Alvin Fidler {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 02, 1910. He studied civil {{engineering}}, earning a Bachelor of Science degree from Drexel Institute of Technology in 1932. He then went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), from which he earned a Master of Science in civil engineering in 1934, writing his thesis on [...] "A precise determination of stresses in bridges due to wind loads", and a Doctor of Science in civil engineering in 1940, writing his thesis on [...] "Investigation of <b>stress-strain</b> relationships of granular soils by a new cylindrical compression apparatus". While he was at MIT, he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). He also met Lillian E. Saari. They were married in 1939, and had three children, Marjorie, Donald and Richard.|$|E
2500|$|Kirkpatrick, Rankin & Long’s {{approach}} {{to the prediction of}} the enhanced punching strength of bridge deck slabs was based on the punching shear prediction equation derived by Long for the shear mode of punching failure, combined with an effective reinforcement ratio, which represented the arching action strength enhancement. The effective reinforcement ratio was determined from the maximum arching moment of resistance in a rigidly restrained concrete slab, which Rankin had derived for laterally restrained concrete slabs from McDowell, McKee and Sevin’s arching action deformation theory for masonry walls. [...] The derivation of the maximum arching moment of resistance of laterally restrained concrete bridge deck slabs utilised Rankin’s idealised elastic-plastic <b>stress-strain</b> criterion for concrete, valid for concrete cylinder strengths up to at least 70N/mm2, which he had derived on the basis of Hognestad, Hanson and McHenry’s ultimate parabolic stress block coefficients for concrete.|$|E
50|$|In solid mechanics, {{the slope}} of the <b>stress-strain</b> curve at any point is called the tangent modulus. It can be {{experimentally}} determined from {{the slope of}} a <b>stress-strain</b> curve created during tensile tests conducted on a sample of the material.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that for}} {{engineering}} purposes, we often assume the cross-section {{area of the}} material does not change during the whole deformation process, which is not true since the actual area will decrease while deforming due to necking. The one assuming cross-section area fixed is so called “engineering <b>stress-strain</b> curve”, the latter is “true <b>stress-strain</b> curve”. In a tension test, true strain is less than engineering strain. Thus, a point defining true <b>stress-strain</b> curve is displaced upwards {{and to the left}} to define the equivalent engineering <b>stress-strain</b> curve. The difference between the true and engineering stresses and strains will increase with plastic deformation. At low strains (such as elastic deformation), {{the differences between the two}} is negligible.|$|E
50|$|A main {{property}} of steel, {{which is used}} to describe its behavior, is the <b>stress-strain</b> graph. The <b>stress-strain</b> graphs of cold-formed steel sheet mainly fall into two categories. They are sharp yielding and gradual yielding type illustrated below in Fig.1 and Fig.2, respectively.|$|E
50|$|By {{gradually}} {{increasing the}} amplitude of oscillations, one can perform a dynamic <b>stress-strain</b> measurement. The variation of storage and loss moduli with increasing stress {{can be used}} for materials characterization, and to determine the upper bound of the material’s linear <b>stress-strain</b> regime.|$|E
50|$|For {{rubber and}} {{biological}} materials, more sophisticated models are necessary. Such materials may exhibit a non-linear <b>stress-strain</b> behaviour at modest strains, or are elastic up to huge strains. These complex non-linear <b>stress-strain</b> behaviours {{need to be}} accommodated by specifically tailored strain-energy density functions.|$|E
50|$|Non-Newtonian fluids {{have a more}} complicated, {{non-linear}} <b>stress-strain</b> behaviour. The sub-discipline of rheology {{describes the}} <b>stress-strain</b> behaviours of such fluids, which include emulsions and slurries, some viscoelastic materials such as blood and some polymers, and sticky liquids such as latex, honey and lubricants.|$|E

The linear-elastic region is either below the yield point, or if a yield point is not easily identified on the <b>stress-strain</b> plot it is defined to be between 0 and 0.2% strain, and is defined as the region of strain in which no yielding (permanent deformation) occurs.|$|E
