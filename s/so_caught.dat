5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up in their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting {{to come back to}} work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E
25|$|However, {{his view}} was {{not shared by}} all. Some of the messianists were <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up with their hope, that they {{interpreted}} each new erosion in the Rebbe's health, and ultimately his very death, as stages in the messianic process. They cited various midrashic statements to fuel their ecstasy as to the imminent revelation of the Messiah, {{and some of them}} drank and toasted l’chaim and danced before and during the funeral - an act that shocked many admirers of Schneerson across the Jewish world. And in the days after Schneerson's death, many journalists and pundits wrote how they expected the end of the movement.|$|E
500|$|The {{displays}} continued {{throughout the}} First World War, {{except that the}} use of rockets was prohibited under the Defence of the Realm Act. Reflecting contemporary events, the theme for the 1915 display was [...] "The Battle of the Marne"; in 1916 it was [...] "The War in Flanders", during which one spectator got <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up in the action that he waded across the lake to join in with the [...] "fighting". Anticipating the outbreak of the Second World War, the theme for the 1933 display was [...] "Air Raid on London".|$|E

500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
500|$|In May 1915, DeBeck and {{a partner}} named Carter {{launched}} a newspaper syndicate and correspondence cartooning course; DeBeck's advice to his correspondence students was: [...] "First learn how to draw—then go to a good art school and get a firm foundation in the arts". [...] The school was not a success, and DeBeck returned to Chicago and joined the Chicago Herald in December 1915. [...] He worked on a strip called Finn an' Haddie for the Adams Newspaper Service on the side. [...] On December 9, immediately after starting at the Herald, he began a strip called Married Life that <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> the attention of Hearst; legend says that, to acquire DeBeck, Hearst bought the Herald and merged it with the Chicago Examiner, as DeBeck had refused to join the Hearst empire after the Examiner raised his monthly salary from $35 to $200. [...] DeBeck's creations were first adapted to film when an animated version of Married Life appeared in a Seattle Sunday Times newsreel in 1917. [...] DeBeck created {{a number of other}} features, especially for the sports section, while his antics made him something of a local celebrity.|$|E
500|$|The Less Deceived {{was first}} noticed by The Times, who {{included}} {{it in its}} List of Books of 1955. In its wake many other reviews followed; [...] "most of them concentrated ... on the book's emotional impact and its sophisticated, witty language." [...] The Spectator felt the collection was [...] "in the running for the best published in this country since the war"; G. S. Fraser, referring to Larkin's perceived association with The Movement felt that Larkin exemplified [...] "everything that is good in this 'new movement' and none of its faults". The TLS called him [...] "a poet of quite exceptional importance", and in June 1956 the Times Educational Supplement was fulsome: [...] "As native as a Whitstable oyster, as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time, as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day, {{it may well be}} regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless mystifications of the last twenty years. With Larkin poetry is on its way back to the middlebrow public." [...] Reviewing the book in America the poet Robert Lowell wrote, [...] "No post-war poetry has <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> the moment, and caught it without straining after its ephemera. It's a hesitant, groping mumble, resolutely experienced, resolutely perfect in its artistic methods." ...|$|E

6000|$|Polly {{rose and}} went to the door without a word. In doing <b>so,</b> Tom <b>caught</b> a glimpse of her face, and said, hastily, [...] "Don't {{you think it would be}} a good plan?" ...|$|R
2500|$|We were <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> {{up in our}} own {{wild ride}} that we were being swept along doing what we were doing, and, I mean, at the time, we were meeting all these bands that we idolised and, and, were big fans of ... and, um, got to play gigs with them all ... The first tour we went on, then led into the next tour and, before we knew it, {{we were on the}} road to pretty much ten years solid.|$|E
2500|$|... "You see, everyone's {{starved for}} {{attention}} in Gypsy. [...] That craving, after all, is the motor that keeps showbiz puttering along. [...] And Mr. Laurents {{makes sure that}} we sense that hunger in everyone.... I was <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up in the emotional wrestling matches between the characters (and within themselves), that I didn't really think about the songs as songs.... There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cherryh's works depict {{fictional worlds}} with great realism {{supported}} by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, Andre Norton compared {{the effect of}} the work to Tolkien's: [...] "Never since reading The Lord of the Rings have I been <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up in any tale as I have been in Gate of Ivrel." [...] Another reviewer commented, [...] "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe". [...] Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about human nature. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the Chanur and Foreigner series.|$|E

2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books {{you go into a}} world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal." [...] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until converted by Aslan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter [...] "Ped" [...] Gill to form FGTH. During a {{particularly}} fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, {{and a female}} vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub [...] "The Warehouse", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford [...] {{a member of the}} headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys [...] apparently got <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as [...] "The Leatherpets" [...] and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals [...] "Krisco Kisses", [...] "Two Tribes", [...] "Disneyland", and [...] "The World Is My Oyster". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash.|$|E
2500|$|J. K. Rowling, {{author of}} the Harry Potter series, has {{said that she was}} a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the {{influence}} of The Chronicles on her work: [...] "I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station— it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts." [...] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child.
