The study area follows an environmental gradient across west-central Oregon, where leaf development varies in response to temperature and moisture. The relationship between the ratio of thematic-mapper simulator channels four and three and the leaf area index for selected closed canopy or fully <b>stocked</b> <b>forest</b> stands along the gradient is analyzed. Results show that a good relationship exists between the LAI and the IR/red ratio for conifers and that a conifer species-independent asymptotic relationship is observed between LAI and near IR/red reflectance, with near radiometric saturation occurring at an LAI of about 7 - 8...|$|E

A multiple-pass, region-based segmentation algorithm improves the segmentation of images from scenes better modeled as a nested hierarchy. A multiple-pass approach allows slow and careful growth of regions while interregion distances are below a global threshold. Past the global threshold, a minimum region size parameter forces development of regions {{in areas of}} high local variance. Maximum and viable region size parameters limit the development of undesirably large regions. Application of the segmentation algorithm for forest stand delineation in TM imagery yields regions corresponding to identifiable features in the landscape.

First, the geographic data required [elevation, also known as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), aspect, and slope] were generated using numerical maps (1 : 25, 000; National Geographic Information Institute). The 2010 5 th Forest Type Map (1 : 25, 000; Korea Forest Service) was used to derive data for forest type (tree species), which was used to distinguish bamboo forest and un-stocked forest land from the <b>stocked</b> <b>forest</b> land, and the Forest Soil Digital Map (1 : 25, 000; Korea Forest Service) was used to generate data on organic content, effective soil depth, soil humidity, and drainage. Finally, the raster data for identifying suitable CMG cultivation sites were reclassified after applying weights according to the conditions of each factor. The spatial resolution used in the study (10  m ×  10  m) was higher than that of a previous study (30  m ×  30  m) (Beon et al. 2013). This spatial resolution of 10  m ×  10  m refers to the area of each grid cell of the suitable cultivation site, which corresponds to an actual CMG cultivation area of 100  m 2.|$|E
40|$|While forest {{transition}} (FT) in South Korea {{began in}} 1955, when forest cover was only 35 % of national land area, {{significant increases in}} both forest cover and growing stock really occurred in the early 1970 s. Using reconstructed historical records, we empirically demonstrate that (1) FT in South Korea was mainly accomplished by the recovery of degraded, non-stocked forest; and (2) one-dimensional FT analysis using forest area alone has severe limitations in diagnosing meaningful changes in forest sustainability. The key driver of FT in South Korea was the government-led reforestation policy. The comprehensive reforestation plans, started in 1973, not only provided economic incentives {{to the general public}} by establishing clear quantifiable goals, they also promoted inter-agency cooperation and coordination, especially between the energy and forest sectors, to replace firewood with fossil fuels. These government-led efforts, accompanied by rural–urban migration, brought an increase in <b>stocked</b> <b>forest</b> area and a complementary rising average growing stock level. The case of South Korea shows that FTs can be cultivated in {{a relatively short period of}} time by a central authority, even with imperfect governance and low economic development...|$|E
40|$|The {{delineation}} of forested {{areas is}} a critical task, because the resulting maps are a fundamental input for a broad field of applications and users. Different national and international forest definitions are available for manual or automatic delineation, but unfortunately most definitions lack precise geometrical descriptions for the different criteria. A mandatory criterion in forest definitions is the criterion of crown coverage (CC), which defines {{the proportion of the}} forest floor covered by the vertical projection of the tree crowns. For loosely stocked areas, this criterion is especially critical, because {{the size and shape of}} the reference area for calculating CC is not clearly defined in most definitions. Thus current forest delineations differ and tend to be non-comparable because of different settings for checking the criterion of CC in the delineation process. This paper evaluates a new approach for the automatic delineation of forested areas, based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with a clearly defined method for calculating CC. The new approach, the ‘tree triples’ method, is based on defining CC as a relation between the sum of the crown areas of three neighboring trees and the area of their convex hull. The approach is applied and analyzed for two study areas in Tyrol, Austria. The selected areas show a loosely <b>stocked</b> <b>forest</b> at the upper timberline and a fragmented forest on the hillside. The fully automatic method presented for delineating forested areas from ALS data shows promising results with an overall accuracy of 96 %, and provides a beneficial tool for operational applications...|$|E

40|$|Seed-oil based {{biodiesel}} production particularly biodiesel {{production from}} the nonedible oil seed bearing plant - Jatropha curcas L. - {{is a key}} strategic direction outlined in the biofuels strategy of the Government of Ethiopia. The main objective underlying the strategy include substitution of imported diesel oil used in the road transport sector {{while at the same}} time contributing to the local and global greenhouse gasses (GHG) reduction efforts. In this study the environmental benefits and costs of production and use of Jatropha biodiesel in the road transport sector of Ethiopia is assessed using a life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology. The analysis focused on determining the potential environmental impacts and net non-renewable energy saving potential of biodiesel from Jatropha oil-seeds using the following metrics: (i) Net Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction, and (ii) Net Energy Balance (NEB) relative to diesel oil. The study shows that the net GHG emissions reduction potential of Jatropha Methyl Ester (JME) is highly influenced by the magnitude of initial carbon loss occurring in the process of conversion of different land uses to Jatropha plantation, and less so on other unit processes of JME production system analysed. The NEB of JME relative to use of diesel oil per functional unit of one GJ is less sensitive to impacts of land use change and is generally positive. Where no land use change impacts is considered, or where Jatropha is grown on lands with low carbon stock such as grasslands, substitution of diesel oil with JME in Ethiopia can provide GHG emission reduction of about 43 %, and for each MJ of JME produced the nonrenewable energy requirement will be 0, 38 MJ. Production of JME by converting lands with high above ground, below ground and/or soil carbon stocks such as shrub lands or well <b>stocked</b> <b>forest</b> lands will result in net loss of carbon and require ecological carbon payback time of 50 to hundreds of years. The impact of introducing and use of JME-diesel oil blends by Anbassa City Bus Services Enterprise (ACBSE) bus fleets shows that, displacement of diesel oil with JME that have positive GHG reduction potential, will also contribute to the reduction of air pollutants and improvement of ambient air quality in Addis Ababa. Two key recommendations of this research work are that to ensure environmental sustainability of biodiesel production from Jatropha seeds (i) land availability and land suitability assessment for estimating the potential available land for Jatropha (and other oil-seed bearing plants) shall be conducted, and (ii) minimum requirements on GHG reduction and NEB requirements on biodiesel shall be established.

Due to the harsh local environments and strong typhoon attacked in recent years, numerous Casuarina trees have died. As a result, various canopy {{gaps in the}} intended windbreak belt have been created. This study was mainly conducted to understand the influences of these canopy gaps on the local microclimate in the windbreak belt, by the multi-layer anemometer, instruments of microclimate, and TDR (Time-Domain-Reflectometry) soil moisture observations. The {{results of this study}} may be useful for coast windbreak management. The results indicated that the soils in the forest zone of Taichung harbor is sand with extremely low organic matter content. This is unfavorable to grow and sprout in forest. The bulk density and particle density of soils in each canopy gaps are between 1. 44 ～ 1. 48 g/cm 3 and 2. 28 ～ 2. 46 g/cm 3 respectively and have no conspicuous difference. The average porosity of the soils is 38 % in the experimental areas. Casuarina trees have good salinity tolerance, and the electrical conductivity experiment shows that the soil salinity level is low. As a result, it has small influences on growing of Casuarina trees. Moreover, the smaller canopy gap is, the smaller air temperature difference is, but the relative humidity is higher (more than 78 %). The atmospheric pressure and soil moisture have little difference in different canopy gaps of forest. The soil moisture in the fully <b>stocked</b> <b>forest</b> land, forest land with a small and medium canopy gap is 0. 4 % higher then it in forest land with a large canopy gap and the check plot. The daily sunshine duration, radiation, illumination, evaporation, and soil temperature appeared to positively related to canopy gaps. The average height of Casuarina trees in the study area lies between 10 ～ 13 m, and the height of cone lies between 7 ～ 9 m approximately. Most seeds can float 10. 8 ～ 17. 2 m by wind, a few can float even farther. Therefore, it is proposed that 30 m to be used as the thinning interval. 台中港木麻黃防風林造林迄今已屆 30 年，由於立地環境惡劣，以及近年來強勁颱風吹襲之影響，許多林木開始衰退枯萎、倒塌，林帶內逐漸產生各種大小的空隙。為瞭解不同空隙對微氣候之影響，本研究在台中港防風林區勘選 6 個試區，以多層風速計、微氣候及TDR (Time-Domain-Reflectometry) 土壤水分觀測儀等進行觀測分析，所得結果可提供海岸防風林營造以及林帶疏伐之參考依據。 由研究結果得知，台中港林區屬於砂土，有機質含量極低，不利於林木生長與萌芽。各空隙間之土壤總體密度與顆粒密度，分別介於 1. 44 ～ 1. 48 g/cm 3 及 2. 28 ～ 2. 46 g/cm 3 之間，差異不大。因根系作用，土壤孔隙率較高，各試區平均為 38 ％。由於木麻黃本身屬於耐鹽樹種，經電導度試驗結果顯示，各試區土壤鹽度不高，因此，對於木麻黃生長影響較小。 再者，林帶空隙愈小，其氣溫差也愈小，但相對濕度較高，平均達 78 ％以上，至於氣壓及土壤水分在不同林帶空隙間之差異極微。整體平均而言，鬱閉林帶、小空隙及中空隙之土壤水份僅高於對照點及大空隙約 0. 4 %；然而，日照時數、全天日射量、光度、蒸發量及土壤溫度皆隨林帶空隙愈大而有增加的趨勢。 由於本研究試區之木麻黃平均樹高介於 10 ～ 13 m之間，其毬果高度約在 7 ～ 9 m處，種子在氣流吹送下，多數可飄行 10. 8 ～ 17. 2 m，少部分能飄更遠，因此，建議於林帶更新時，疏伐間距可採用 30 m。摘要	I Abstract	II 目錄	IV 圖目錄	VII 表目錄	X 第一章 緒論	 1 一、前言	 1 二、研究動機	 2 三、研究目的	 4 四、研究流程	 4 第二章 前人研究	 6 一、防風林之相關研究	 6 二、飄鹽量之相關研究	 8 三、林帶空隙之相關研究	 9 四、林帶微氣候之相關研究	 11 第三章 試驗地點、材料與方法	 14 一、試區勘選	 14 二、試區概況	 17 （一）位置、地形與地質	 17 1. 位置	 17 2. 地形	 17 3. 地質	 18 (1) 現代沖積層	 19 (2) 頭嵙山層	 19 (3) 卓蘭層	 19 (4) 錦水頁岩	 19 （二）氣象資料	 21 1. 風速與風向	 24 2. 氣溫與相對溼度	 24 3. 氣壓	 24 4. 降水量與蒸發量	 24 5. 日照量與雲量	 25 （三）潮汐水位	 25 三、材料與方法	 27 （一）土壤性質試驗	 27 1. 土壤採集	 27 2. 水份係數	 28 3. 有機質含量	 28 4. 總體密度(假比重) 	 29 5. 顆粒密度(真比重) 	 29 6. 孔隙率	 29 7. 質地分析	 29 8. 電導度	 31 （二）微氣候測定	 32 （三）風速與風向測定	 34 （四）種子飄落試驗	 39 1. 木麻黃樹高測定	 39 2. 現地種子飄落試驗	 40 3. 風洞試驗	 40 第四章 結果與討論	 44 一、土壤性質分析	 44 （一）有機質含量	 44 （二）總體密度（假比重）	 44 （三）顆粒密度（真比重）	 47 （四）孔隙率	 47 （五）質地分析	 48 （六）電導度	 49 二、微氣候資料分析	 51 （一）氣溫 	 51 （二）相對溼度	 54 （三）氣壓 	 56 （四）日照時數	 59 （五）光度	 60 （六）全天日射量	 61 （七）蒸發量	 63 （八）土壤溫度	 64 （九）土壤水份	 66 三、風向與風速測定 	 69 四、種子飄落範圍分析	 72 （一）木麻黃樹高測定	 72 （二）現地種子飄落試驗	 72 （三）風洞試驗	 76 第五章 結論與建議	 80 一、結論 	 80 （一）土壤性質分析方面	 80 （二）微氣候分析方面	 80 （三）風向風速分析方面	 82 （四）種子飄落範圍分析方面	 82 二、建議 	 83 第六章 參考文獻 	 84 附錄一 	 9...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{economics}} of conversion and fragmentation of forest land. The forestry economics literature has generally focussed on the management of a single stand for timber and nontimber forest benefits with little attention being paid to forest level land use decisions, and in particular forest stand interactions. As noted by Bowes and Krutilla (1989), the focus on a single stand may be a considerable weakness of the multiple-use forest land use models given that the provision of nontimber forest benefits, such as biodiversity storage, watershed protection and micro-climatic maintenance, often depend on the setting of a single stand within a larger forest area. If this is the case, then decisions about forest land use and allocation need {{to take account of}} the interaction between the stand and the total <b>stock</b> of <b>forest</b> land. The nature of the relationship between stand and total <b>stock</b> of <b>forest</b> land is of central importance. In this paper, we define three cases that reflect a range of typical stand-stock relationships that may arise: those being constant, diminishing and increasing marginal returns to the scale of the total <b>forest</b> <b>stock.</b> We explore the forest land use decision {{from the perspective of a}} social planner. Taking stand-total <b>forest</b> <b>stock</b> interactions effects into account has important implications for the choice of framework for the economic analysis as well as for the forest land allocation decision. This paper shows that it is not just the level of forest conversion that may be affected by taking stand-stock interactions into account, but also the spatial distribution of the remaining patches of forest land for the provision of non-timber forest benefits. The insights from this paper are particularly applicable to those tropical forest regions facing high rates of forest conversion and fragmentation.

40|$|Natural resouce {{economics}} is mainly {{concerned with the}} efficient use of natural resource stocks, such as mineral and energy deposits, fish <b>stocks,</b> <b>forests</b> and other land areas, air and water resources. Because of the public good nature of these stocks, and their associated service flows, the competitive market cannot be relied on to use these resources efficently. In the absence of public intervention, the consequences of inefficient resource use are all too familiar - overfishing, overcutting the forests, misuse of mineral and energy reserves, loss of environmental assets and pollution. This paper argues that the standard microeconomics tools of analysis {{can be used to}} generate static and dynamic conditions of efficient natural resource use. Hoever in modelling resource use, the various characteristics of the resource should be taken into account. Section 2 considers the role of natural resources as either final demand goods or intermediate goods, and suggests that the standard theories of demand and supply can be used to analyse the economics of natural resource use...|$|R
