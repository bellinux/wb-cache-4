(Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E

It is a gift which qualifies him, along with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, Vachel Lindsay and Carl Sandburg, as a great American minstrel.

Lyrically, the track describes a house party, as mentioned in the opening lines [...] "It's our party, we can {{do what we want}} / It's our party, we can <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want / It's our party, we can love who we want / We can kiss who we want / We can live how we want". It also makes several references to recreational drug use, including [...] "dancing with molly", using a slang term for ecstasy, and [...] "trying to get a line [...] in the bathroom". After initial confusion whether the former lyric was [...] "dancing with molly" [...] or [...] "dancing with Miley", Cyrus clarified that she was referring to ecstasy, commenting that [...] "if you’re aged ten it’s 'Miley', if you know what I'm talking about then you know. I just wanted it to be played on the radio and they’ve already had to edit it so much." ...|$|E

500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] should go on the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years now, this is our fifth record, and I thought it would be boring to just keep making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, so I wanted to do something special." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2009, in {{response}} to a fallacious news article deemed to slander the nation, Circassian activists ramped up efforts with the scheduling of a mass-protest against the ignorance of the Russian government and the Russian people of their rights in Karachaevo-Cherkessia. However, the government canceled the gathering, saying it would be banning any and all public gatherings for an indefinite period {{to prevent the spread of}} the H1N1 flu virus. However, the head of the Circassian youth movement, Timur Jujuev, said [...] "All the public markets continue working on a regular basis, so where is the emergency?
