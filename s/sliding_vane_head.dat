Firstly, the <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> pump and the centrifugal pump work independently, and the performance is recorded. Then, {{the two types of}} pumps are combined together, with the <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> pump acting as the feeding pump. Comparison is made between the performance of the independently working pump and the performance of series operation pump. Results show that the system flow rate is determined by the <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> pump. In order to ensure the stability of the series operation pumping system, the energy consumption required by the pipeline under the system flow should be greater than the pressure energy centrifugal pump can generate. Otherwise, the centrifugal pump can not operate stably, with reflux, swirl, gas-liquid two-phase flow in the runner and strong vibration and noise.

40|$|Positive {{displacement}} {{machines are}} the most suitable devices for small-scale waste heat to power conversion units based on an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) due to their capabilities of handling small mass flow rates and high pressure ratios. Among the technologies, <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> machines provide unique features such as low operating revolution speed, geometrical flexibility and uncomplicated manufacturing. Nonetheless, research and product development in this field have been constrained {{by the lack of}} interfaces between deforming and moving fluid domains that characterize <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> devices and the design tools at the state of the art.

40|$|AbstractDuring a {{homologation}} cycle, {{engine cooling}} pump operates at off-design {{conditions that are}} characterized by low efficiency and, in turn, impacts on the vehicle fuel economy and emissions performances. Furthermore, the conventional centrifugal technology struggles with the need of implementing thermal management strategies. In order to address these issues, the current paper presents {{the development of an}} innovative engine cooling pump for automotive applications that is based on the <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> technology. The experimental performances of the novel pump were compared with the ones of a conventional centrifugal device through a test bench that reproduced the real operating conditions of a passenger car engine cooling circuit.

40|$|Heat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular, but poor electricity generating efficiency limits the potential energy savings of electrically powered units. Thus the work reported in this thesis concerns {{the development of a}} range of gas engine driven heat pumps for industrial and commercial heating applications, which recover heat from the prime mover, normally rejected to waste. Despite the convenience of using proprietary engine heat recovery packages, investigations have highlighted the necessity to ensure the engine and the heat recovery equipment are compatible. A problem common •to all air source heat pumps is the formation of frost on the evaporator, which must be removed periodically, with the expenditure of energy, to ensure the continued operation of the plant. An original fluidised bed defrosting mechanism is proposed, which prevents the build-up of this frost, and also improves system performance. Criticisms have been levelled against the rotary <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> compressor, in particular the effects of lubrication, which is essential. This thesis compares the rotary <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> compressor with other machines, and concludes that many of these criticisms are unfounded. A confidential market survey indicates an increasing demand for heat pumps up to and including 1990, and the technical support needed to penetrate this market is presented. Such support includes the development of a range of modular gas engine driven heat pumps, and a computer aided design for the selection of the optimum units.

40|$|In <b>Sliding</b> <b>Vane</b> Rotary Compressors, {{as well as}} in most of {{positive}} displacement machines, the oil is injected to fulfill sealing and lubrication purposes. However, the oil injection could produce an additional effect during the compression phase with a great saving potential from the energetic point of view. Being the air inside the cell at a higher temperature than the oil injected, a cooling effect could be achieved so decreasing the mechanical power required for the compression. At the moment, the oil is introduced inside the compressor vanes through a series of simple holes that are only able to produce solid jets. In this way any effective heat transfer is prevented, as demonstrated by p-V measurements inside the cells during the compression phase. In the current study, a theoretical model of a sprayed oil injection technology was developed and further experimentally validated. The oil was injected along the axial length of the compressor through a number of pressure swirl atomizers which produced a very fine spray. The conservation equations, solved with a Lagrangian approach, allowed to track the droplets evolution from the injection until the impingement onto the metallic surfaces of the vanes. The theoretical approach assessed the cooling effect due to the high surface to volume ratio of the droplets and a reduction of the indicated power was predicted. The model validation was carried out through a test campaign on an mid-size <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> compressor equipped with a series of pressure swirl injectors. The reconstruction of the indicator diagram as well as the direct measurements of torque and revolution speed revealed a reduction of the mechanical power absorbed close to 7 % using an injection pressure of 20 bar. The model is in a satisfactory agreement with the tests and it also confirms the experimental trends available in the literature. A parametric analysis on the injection pressure and temperature and on the cone spray angle was eventually carried out in order to identify an optimal set of operating injection parameters...|$|R

40|$|In the {{compression}} mechanisms of a rotary compressor for air conditioners, a vane and a rolling piston are provided {{to separate the}} suction chamber and {{the compression}} chamber. The rolling piston {{is driven by the}} crank, and revolves on the axis of the shaft eccentrically, and also rotates on its own axis. The vane undergoes reciprocating motion, and its top usually comes into contact with the rolling piston by the spring force and the discharge pressure. The lubricating condition between the vane top and the rolling piston is severe because the contact pressure is high owing to the line contact of the vane top. For the prevention of scuffing, abnormal wear and so on, it is important to clarify the lubricating characteristics between the vane top and the rolling piston. Because the normal force acting on piston at vane contact is greatly influenced by the friction of <b>vane</b> <b>sliding</b> surface between the vane and the vane-slot, a mixed lubrication analysis of the <b>vane</b> <b>sliding</b> surface between the vane and the vane-slot is required to obtain the normal force acting on piston at vane contact accurately. In order to investigate the lubricating characteristics between the vane top and the rolling piston, a numerical analysis of the motion of the rolling piston and the motion of the vane considering the mixed lubrication of the <b>vane</b> <b>sliding</b> surface has been performed. The cases of different friction coefficient of the <b>vane</b> <b>sliding</b> surface at solid contact were calculated, and the results were compared.

50|$|An oval gear meter is a {{positive}} displacement meter that uses two or more oblong gears configured to rotate {{at right angles to}} one another, forming a T shape. Such a meter has two sides, which can be called A and B. No fluid passes {{through the center of the}} meter, where the teeth of the two gears always mesh. On one side of the meter (A), the teeth of the gears close off the fluid flow because the elongated gear on side A is protruding into the measurement chamber, while on the other side of the meter (B), a cavity holds a fixed volume of fluid in a measurement chamber. As the fluid pushes the gears, it rotates them, allowing the fluid in the measurement chamber on side B to be released into the outlet port. Meanwhile, fluid entering the inlet port will be driven into the measurement chamber of side A, which is now open. The teeth on side B will now close off the fluid from entering side B. This cycle continues as the gears rotate and fluid is metered through alternating measurement chambers. Permanent magnets in the rotating gears can transmit a signal to an electric reed switch or current transducer for flow measurement.
