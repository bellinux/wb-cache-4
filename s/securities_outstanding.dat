40|$|In this dissertation, I {{propose a}} theoretic {{foundation}} to compute {{earnings per share}} (EPS) for firms with both common shares and dilutive <b>securities</b> <b>outstanding.</b> I derive a new EPS measure, market EPS, which {{is defined as the}} expectation of the future earnings per share. From the view of investors, market EPS naturally captures EPS information in stock prices. It is compared to basic EPS and diluted EPS, which are suggested in the dual presentation under the current U. S. rule. The comparisons show that market EPS is below the range defined by basic EPS and diluted EPS as long as the expected future abnormal earnings is zero. This indicates a weakness behind the thinking of the current rule. I also find that the diluted EPS by the treasury stock method overstates market EPS more than that by the if-converted method. In addition, given all conditions the same, the upward bias of diluted EPS of growth firms is smaller than that of non-growth firms. To support the proposed theory, I conduct an empirical study using a dataset containing 3130 firm-year employee stock option plans from 1997 to 2006. The results show that diluted EPS under the rule is, on average, larger than market EPS by 1 %. Furthermore, the bias is larger for firms that are heavy users of employee stock options and for firms that have higher earnings volatility...|$|E

40|$|The Chinese {{banking system}} is {{critical}} to the functioning of the Chinese economy, being the main conduit through which savings are allocated to investment opportunities. Banking activity in China has grown rapidly over the past decade in association with the expansion of the Chinese economy, and the Chinese banking system now includes some of the world’s largest banks. Chinese banks have become more commercially orientated over this period, although the Chinese Government retains considerable influence over their activities. This article examines the size and structure of the Chinese banking system and the key characteristics of banking activity in China. The regulatory and institutional arrangements for banking in China are also outlined. Size and Structure of the Chinese Banking System The Chinese banking system is large relative {{to the size of the}} Chinese economy and has expanded significantly over the past decade. Consolidated banking system assets (including assets in Chinese banks ’ foreign branches and subsidiaries) were equivalent to around 240 per cent of GDP at the end of 2011, up from around 200 per cent in the early 2000 s (Graph 1). Domestic credit is estimated to be equivalent to 145 per cent of GDP. This creditto-GDP ratio is high relative to countries with similar levels of per capita income (IMF 2011 a). Other funding sources in China are less developed than intermediated credit: debt <b>securities</b> <b>outstanding</b> (excluding central government and central bank debt) and equity market capitalisation are each equivalent to around 30 – 40 per cent of GDP. 1 The five largest banks in China are, in order of decreasing size, Industrial and Commercial Bank o...|$|E
40|$|Crises on {{external}} sovereign debt are typically defined as defaults. Such a definition accurately captures debt-servicing {{difficulties in the}} 1980 s, a period of numerous defaults on bank loans. However, defining defaults as debt crises is problematic for the 1990 s, when sovereign bond markets emerged. In contrast to the 1980 s, the 1990 s are characterized by significant foreign debt-servicing difficulties but fewer sovereign defaults. In order to capture this evolution of debt markets, we define debt crises as events occurring when either a country defaults or its bond spreads are above a critical threshold. We find that our definition outperforms the default-based definition in capturing debt-servicing difficulties and, consequently, in fitting the post- 1994 period. In particular, liquidity indicators are significant in explaining our definition of debt crises, while they do not play any role in explaining defaults after 1994.

40|$|The {{structure}} of fmancial {{markets in the}} USA, Euro-zone and Australia have undergone significant changes {{in response to the}} reduced need for their central banks to issue government securities. For example, the adoption of an Economic and Monetmy Union (EMU) has required a high degree of consistency in a number of policy areas including mles to restrict the size of budget deficits. ill the early 2000 's adjusting to reduced government securities was a key consideration in US fmance literature (Reinha 1 t and Sack, 2000; Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 2002, 2), but has become less important with the resurgence of large domestic deficit budgets in the US since 2002. The continued surplus budgets in Australia have meant that the implications of less government bonds outstanding on fmancial markets continues to be discussed. Most of the EMU countries have run moderate budget deficits (% GDP), so the absolute amount of euro-denominated government <b>securities</b> <b>outstanding</b> has fluctuated and tended to grow slowly. Therefore fear of a severe liquidity squeeze has not eventuated but some aspects of changed and restricted issuance have continued to be relevant. The Australian Treasurer adopted a medium term commitment to achieve and then maintain surplus budgets (from 1997), reducing the need for government bond issuance in the Australian fmancial market. In an Australian Government initiated Review on the Commonwealth Government Securities Market (Review) (2002), stakeholders views were sought {{on the extent to which}} government bonds offer unique financial market characteristics. The Review invited discussion of alternative · instruments to replace the dominant role of government securities. This research paper investigates developments in the Australian financial market since the Review (2002), and considers whether a rapid growth of corporate bonds has allowed adequate availability of low risk securities with benchmark status and liquidity, as existed in a government bond dominated fixed interest security market. The paper compares Australian experience with EMU markets, where growth of an interest rate swap market and credit derivatives have helped manage credit risk as well as supplement market liquidity. The research makes a preliminary assessment of how these financial markets have adapted to changed availability of government security issuance...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe role of U. S. Army Special Forces (SF) in the counterproliferation {{of weapons of}} mass destruction (WMD) has been minimal in recent years. As globalization leads to increased ability of both states and non-state actors to acquire WMDs, the efforts of Army SF should increase accordingly. Focusing on nuclear weapons, this thesis argues that Army SF elements are ideally positioned to contribute to the counterproliferation mission through the use of the global special operations forces (SOF) network. Utilizing the regional expertise of Army SF and its network of foreign military and government contacts achieved through years of sustained relationships, it serves as an ideal opportunity for strengthening counterproliferation capabilities across the world. Rather than focusing exclusively on the interdiction of WMDs by specialized SOF elements, this thesis recommends shifting to Phase Zero—before WMDs are present—with a focus on building partner capacity to combat WMDs. It examines the adaptation of existing Army SF programs and authorities in order to focus them on WMD and compares this to Army SF augmenting existing non-SOF counterproliferation programs. Finally, it explains how these missions can build relationships within the global SOF network for future operations against proliferators and lead to improved international <b>security.</b> <b>Outstanding</b> ThesisMajor, United States Arm...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedU. S. critical infrastructure includes those assets that {{are vital to}} maintaining the nation's security, economy, and public health and safety. A reliable supply of electric power provides an essential foundation for the daily operation of all national critical infrastructure {{as well as most}} aspects of modern society. A sustained loss of electricity would be significantly detrimental to the economy and the health and security of the nation. Since 1935, the U. S. electric power industry has been heavily regulated in order to address issues such as consumer protection, rate control, conservation, and market competition. However, legislators have not considered the impact of regulations on the resiliency of critical infrastructure. This thesis argues that the energy sector regulatory framework has directly resulted in decreased security and reliability of electric power infrastructure. Energy legislation has created a "tragedy of the commons" situation for power transmission lines where utilities are reluctant to invest in infrastructure needed to ensure the reliable delivery of electricity. The solution to ensuring the resilience of electric power infrastructure is to craft a combination of regulatory improvements, reliability standards, and financial incentives to ensure the electric power industry is able to provide the foundational structure needed for U.

40|$|Objective of {{the thesis}} Harford and Uysal (2014) {{suggest that the}} access to public bond markets relaxes {{financial}} constraints optimally enabling companies to undertake more of their profitable acquisition opportunities in the United States. Rated companies are more active acquirers, bid more aggressively for their public targets and experience only slightly lower announcement returns in domestic deals. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to provide a relevant point of comparison for the original US findings by investigating the impact of bond market access on M&A activity in Europe, where corporate borrowing has traditionally relied more on private sources of debt capital. I extend the original empirical setup by accounting for actual debt capital market <b>securities</b> <b>outstanding</b> instead of using credit ratings as a proxy and include cross-border acquisitions in the analyses in order to capture the complete effect of public bond market access on acquisition activity in Europe. Data and methodology The initial data set of this study consists of 41, 744 financial year observations of 4, 661 public companies in EU- 15 countries, Norway and Switzerland, downloaded from Thomson One database. It is further complemented with the data on 8, 219 bond issues and 6, 231 M&A transactions by these companies, downloaded from SDC databases. In addition to univariate tests, I analyze the impact of bond market access on acquisition likelihood using probit regressions. I account for the cumulative and relative sizes of the observed deals employing Tobit regressions. Finally, I run regular OLS regressions in the tests of bid premiums and acquirers' announcement returns. Empirical findings European companies with public bonds outstanding have 2. 9 % higher yearly acquisition likelihood and 0. 9 % higher yearly asset-adjusted deal values than other companies. The findings compare well with Harford and Uysal (2014), but the magnitude of the phenomenon is somewhat smaller, which is consistent with the lower importance of bond financing in Europe. The findings hold in the subsample of large companies as well as after accounting for the probability of having bonds outstanding. Also, I find moderate evidence that the European acquisition likelihood effect may be related mainly to riskier cross-border deals. Unlike in the United States, bond market acquirers do not pay higher premiums or experience robustly lower announcement returns. Overall, European bond market companies appear to be capable of exhausting more of their profitable acquisition opportunities without significant adverse effects on acquisition quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The main aims of the project were twofold: (1) to identify for eleven benchmark years - occurring at five-year intervals starting with 1868 and ending in 1918 - Britain's 125 largest companies (as measured by the market capitalization of their ordinary shares); and (2) to construct a consistent dataset of the key financial characteristics of the identified companies. The project's aims were designed to serve two objectives: (1) to permit detailed measures of profitability for each identified company, embracing both security price appreciation (or depreciation, {{as the case may}} be) and payments of dividends and interest; and (2) the creation of a British stock exchange index compatible with the FT-SE 100 in use since 1984. The key financial characteristics of the companies examined by the project were: (1) the monthly closing price of each traded security for each identified company; (2) the number of each traded security outstanding {{at the end of each}} month. Multiplied together, characteristics (1) and (2) produce market capitalization by security for each month. Summing all securities issued by a company produces for each month its total market capitalization. The other key financial characteristics were: (3) the paid-up amount for each security, including premiums (if any); (4) the nominal value of each security; (5) the payments (if any) made in each month to holders of the securities. Characteristics (3) -(5) record the flows of funds to companies and the flows of funds from them, thereby permitting measures of financial profitability. The data relate to 'British' companies with London Stock Exchange quotes for their ordinary shares. To be included, companies had: to have their securities quoted in sterling (or at least a preponderance of them in sterling); to pay dividends and interest in sterling; to have a London office; and, to have a preponderance of British directors. Main Topics : This data collection is an interim deposit and further material will subsequently be added to complete it. This, first installment, is presented in two file sets. The first set consists of summary benchmark tables for four years: 1868, 1883, 1898, and 1913. In each of these tables, the largest 125 British companies are ranked according to the size of the market value of their ordinary shares on the last trading day in June of the relevant year. Column (2) shows, for each company, the market value of ordinary shares outstanding - the basis of the rankings. This value was arrived at in the following manner: the closing mid-market price (average of bid-ask) per share on the indicated day, multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Column (3) reports analogous calculations for debentures (if any). Column (1) reports the sum of Columns (2) and (3), plus the market capitalization of any preference shares outstanding. All traded securities were allocated to one or another of the categories, so that Column (1) represents total market capitalization. The last column, headed dividend rate of return at market, is the total cash dividend paid on ordinary shares in the twelve months ending on the last trading day of June. The first file set also includes the scanned, edited data set from the Investor's Monthly Manual from which the benchmark rankings were taken. The second file set contains the data for individual companies. The data are set out in six columns. Column (1) is the date (by month). Column (2) is the last quoted price of the indicated security in the indicated month. Column (3) is the number of the indicated <b>securities</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Thus (Column 1) multiplied by (Column 2) equals the aggregate market value of the indicated security. Column (4) records the paid-up amount for each security. Column (5) records the nominal value of the security. Any difference between Columns (4) and (5) represents a liability incurred by the registered owner of the security. Column (6) records announced dividends (or interest, as the case may be) per share (or security) as a per cent of nominal value. Thus (Column 6) multiplied by (Column 4) equals the cash dividend (interest) paid on the share (security). Thus (Column 6) multiplied by (Column 4) multiplied by (Column 3) equals total cash dividend (or interest) paid by the company to holders of the indicated security. An integral part of the individual company data is the accompanying company notes, which provide detail on capital structure and dividends. This is especially important when bonus (or deeply discounted) shares are issued. Ignoring these notes may cause dividends in particular to be under-estimated. A Directory to the individual companies is also included. Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} a model {{based on current}} corporate finance theories which explains stock returns associated with the announcement of issuer exchange offers. The major independent variables are changes in leverage multiplied by senior <b>security</b> claims <b>outstanding</b> and changes in debt tax shields. Parameter estimates are statistically significant and consistent in sign and relative magnitude with model predictions. Overall, 55 {{percent of the variance}} in stock announcement period returns is explained. The evidence is consistent with tax-based theories of optimal capital structure, a positive debt level information effect, and leverage induced wealth transfers across security classes...|$|R

NATO Allies and the Russian Federation created the NATO-Russia Council, which replaced the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. The summit was held in the Pratica di Mare Air Force Base outside Rome because of <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> requirements soon after the 9/11 attacks.|$|R

40|$|Turnovsky (1995) derives in a continuous-time {{model of}} a {{decentralized}} economy that the correct specification of the firm’s objective function is to maximize the initial value of its <b>outstanding</b> <b>securities.</b> The firm value is the discounted flow of real earnings. For the discrete-time version of the model, we show that the correct computation of the firm value needs to be modified. Depending on the specific formula employed, different values of the equity premium result. asset prices, firm value, equity premium...|$|R

Accordingly, Ginnie Mae {{does not use}} derivatives to hedge {{and it does not}} carry long-term debt (or related <b>outstanding</b> <b>securities</b> liabilities) on its balance sheet. Instead, private lending institutions approved by Ginnie Mae originate eligible loans, pool them into securities, and issue the Ginnie Mae MBS instruments. These institutions include geographically diverse mortgage companies, commercial banks, and thrifts of all sizes, as well as state housing finance agencies.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{there being}} an {{abundance}} of research on business excellence, {{there is very little}} research that focuses specifically upon the security sector. This study takes into account the views of both sides: those who supply security and those who buy security (clients). It includes a review of some relevant literature, in depth interviews and a global survey. The study aims to establish the relative importance of factors deemed most crucial in driving <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> performance; and to better understand the barriers to industry-wide excellence and provide some recommendations on how these can be overcome...|$|R
