60|$|The {{figure a}} a a a is a board, about 18 inches by 12, {{to which the}} parts are to be attached, and {{which is to be}} nailed against the wall, at the height of about 8 feet, b c d c is a plate of tin or brass, 8 inches by 12, of the form {{represented}} in the drawing. At c c, the lower extremities of the parts at the sides, the metal is bent round, so as to clasp a wire which runs from c to c, the ends of which wire are bent at right angles and run into the board. The plate will consequently turn on this axis, as on a hinge. At the top of the plate d, a small projection of the tin turns inwards, and to this, one end of the cord m m is attached. This cord passes back from d to a <b>small</b> <b>pulley</b> at {{the upper part of the}} board, and at the tower end of it a tassel, loaded so as to be an exact counterpoise to the card, is attached. By raising the tassel, the plate will of course fall over forward till it is stopped by the part b striking the board, when it will be in a horizontal position. On the other hand, by pulling down the tassel, the plate will be raised and drawn upwards against the board, so as to present its convex surface, with the words STUDY HOURS upon it, distinctly to the school. In the drawing it is represented in an inclined position, being not quite drawn up, that the parts might more easily be seen. At d, there is a small projection of the tin upwards, which touches the clapper of the bell suspended above, every time the plate passes up or down, and thus give notice of its motions.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much <b>smaller</b> <b>pulley</b> was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|R
50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large tensioning pulley (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of {{a stop on the}} mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple <b>smaller</b> <b>pulleys</b> in a block and tackle arrangement.|$|R

50|$|This is the 'classic' Mamod {{model and}} has been in {{production}} with minor updates and modifications for nearly 50 years. It is a model of a typical traction engine with a full-length canopy. The engine itself is an oscillating-cylinder unit, the same as the SR1/a which is based on the old MM2 unit. The boiler is longer than that on the SR1 although it is the same volume internally. The front part is an empty void into which, in the earlier versions, the exhaust steam was fed through the choke (it controlled the exiting steam not the inlet steam). The TE1a differs from the TE1 in having a reversing lever to control the speed and direction of the model, initially used on the MEC1 of 1965 and subsequently applied to the TE in 1967, whereas the TE1 was unidirectional only with an exhaust 'choke' to control the speed. The TE1 was claimed to cover a third of a mile in ten minutes on a single filling. Power is delivered to the back axle by means of a drive band running from a <b>small</b> <b>pulley</b> on the flywheel to the rim of one of the back wheels. This can be removed to allow the engine to run stationary or to drive a lineshaft and tools. The front axle of the model is mounted on a central pivot with a simple copper stub spring which provides a crude form of suspension. It is also steerable, by means of a shaft running from the axle up inside the chimney (later models post 67). Early models did not use the later control rod for steering but used a rod mounted directly into a hole in the early model square axle box. Both designs could be screwed down to lock the wheels in a fixed position. A control rod can be attached to the top of this shaft with a wooden handle on top to allow the operator to steer the model as it moves. The TE1/A has a green boiler (this green has varied over the years from apple green to a dark brunswick green, similar to GWR locomotives), red spoked wheels and flywheel, a white/cream coloured canopy and a black firebox/smokebox/chimney. It is also available in a distinctive alternative paint scheme, with a polished brass boiler and maroon wheels. Other limited edition models have been produced in the last decade using blue or black paint work as well of variations of the colours mentioned already.|$|E

The assembly strategy for complex-shaped parts has been discussed by Song et al. [15], where a force control based on visual geometric information of the parts was developed. Cho et al. [16] developed a sensor-less force control for industrial robots, that was applied to a peg-in-hole assembly task by using a disturbance observer that estimates disturbance torques at each robot’s joints.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Increased {{miniaturization}} {{of surgical}} instruments {{is essential to}} successfully perform surgical procedures in restricted areas as in many applications of minimally-invasive surgery. Miniaturization permits increase in dexterity and decrease in access incisions which are required in many surgical procedures. Tendon-based transmissions provide several important advantages for the mechanical design of miniaturized surgical devices. Reflected mass and inertia are reduced since tendon-based transmissions allow to locate the motors far apart from the actuated joint. In spite of providing several important advantages, they introduce several non linear effects that must be considered and modeled to achieve suitable performance. In this paper tendon-based transmission system for surgical robotics is illustrated. And nonlinear friction, due to direct sliding of synthetic fiber cables over <b>small</b> fixed <b>pulleys</b> (pins) is discussed and models aiming at compensating these nonlinearities are presented...|$|R
