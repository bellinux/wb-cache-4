5000|$|While {{not being}} urged to avoid competition, women had few {{opportunities}} {{to compete in}} sport in Australia until the 1880s. After that date, new sporting facilities were being built {{around the country and}} many new sport clubs were created. Athletic events were being held in schools in Australia by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. The Glennie School in Toowoomba was one school to host races for girls during their annual girls' <b>sport</b> <b>day.</b> During the 1920s, girls were able to run while wearing bloomers, instead of skirts. The first meeting for women's athletics took place in 1926 and was organised by the NSWAAA. The purpose of the meeting was to determine if it would be possible to send women to compete in the 1928 Summer Olympics based on merit. Only one female athlete was determined to be good enough to send. That was E.F. Robinson. The first women's national athletics body designed to govern the sport in Australia was founded in 1932 and was called the Australian Women's Amateur Athletic Union. It was designed to oversee state organisations in Victoria (1929), Queensland (1921), New South Wales (1932) and South Australia. (1932) The first Australian woman to travel overseas to compete was E.F. Robinson, who went to the 1928 Summer Olympics where she ran in the 100-metres. She came in third and was the only Australian female on the 1928 Australian Olympic team.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{included a}} series of papers involving physical activity among children and adolescents. The first study examined the predictive validity of an age-specific MET prediction equation among children of varying body size. The results indicated that a widely used MET prediction equation overestimates energy expenditure at slow walking speeds (except 1 mph). This overestimation was greater among relatively smaller children. Contemporary issues dealing with youth physical activity and energy expenditure levels were also examined in this dissertation. The day-to-day variability in estimated energy expenditure was examined using generalizability theory. The results suggested that limited variability in daily energy expenditure existed during a 7 -day monitoring period. It was concluded that small daily absolute changes in the energy expended from sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity existed to maintain levels of total energy expenditure. The largest source of variability in daily energy expenditure (other than the differences between intensity levels) was from the participant x activity intensity interaction term (23 %). Traditionally, the inter-individual differences in physical activity or energy expenditure focus on age and gender differences. This dissertation also examined maturity-related differences in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Although {{significant differences in the}} average amount of MVPA/day were not found between biological maturity groups the absolute differences in MVPA were considered. Early maturing boys and late maturing girls averaged the most MVPA/day. Among boys, this observation may be related to somatic changes that occur during puberty. Among girls, underlying biological mechanisms may exist that reduce physical activity in early maturers to optimize reproductive potential;Although the focus in physical activity research is typically on the average amount of daily physical activity between groups, {{it is also important to}} understand the primary sources of daily physical activity. The final study of this dissertation quantified the relative contribution of youth sport to total daily physical activity. The results indicate that, on average, youth sport contributed nearly 25 % of the total daily MVPA, which was equivalent to approximately 30 minutes. However, it appears that the additional MVPA accumulated during youth sport was not maintained on a non-youth <b>sport</b> <b>day...</b>|$|E

The tour was held on the second Sunday of December; therefore, the homes were decorated for Christmas in the family's traditional manner. A booklet was prepared describing the homes and sponsors or advertisements told of our area businesses. The public could drive to the homes or bus tours with tour guides were provided for a small additional charge. How your dub publicized -the project: The tour is the rainbow at the end of a full year's work. We screened over 1600 children last year in grades 1, 3, and 7. Naturally, we have publicity coverage for this with pictures and stories in our papers. We make sure the public knows of our service projects and that the money used is raised by the tour of homes. We give three scholarships of at least $ 1, 000 each to students in Health and Allied Fields at our local universities. Again publicity for our club with emphasis being on how we appreciate the support the community has given to our open door tour which enables us to give these scholarships. Our three local nursing homes are recipients ofour service dollars. A very good article and pictures appeared showing a group of senior citizens enjoying exercise time. They were using a type of parachute provided by Quota for their health and enjoyment. Again a gentle reminder of the tour of homes supported by Ruston and the surrounding communities. The Med Camps held throughout the summer have at least two students that are on 'scholarships' from the Quota Club. Our goal is to let the community know that we organize, direct, and collect monies for these projects, but it is really their money that is being returned to our community for use by our citizens. There are other projects we support and try to keep Quota's name before the community. Some of these are telephone hearing screening for the community, peach cookery contest for the State Peach Festival, providing a hearing aide to a nine year old boy that was hurt in a ball accident, etc. However, when it is time to remind people of the forthcoming tour of homes, then we really concentrate on making sure that the public knows about Quota and when and where the tour will be. We have a kick ott party in July and at this time we start the gende build up to the December, second Sunday, unveiling of our current homes on tour. The overall club theme is set at this kick ott. Membership is divided between homes and captains are selected. Challenges are exchanged between Quota groups and the tour is on its way. Time lines are drawn for the ditTerent projects. Then the rush is on for ad sales, final proofs and publishing ofour tour booklet. Homes are photographed and written up with emphasis on the uniqueness of each home. Home owners are invited to our program meeting to meet each of our members and we explain the ditTerent stages of this tour and discuss what we expect from each other. A local artist is engaged to sketch the homes for our gift to each homeowner as a way to express our appreciation for their help in this project. Publicity begins soon after the kick ott and six weeks before tour date, pictures and interviews with homeowners begin to appear in our newspaper. Advertisements appear as public service reminders on our local TV. The radio stations run public service announcements and interviews with members ofways and means committee. Posters can be seen in businesses, offices and schools. Any way we can draw attention to the tour date is our goal. When the tour is over, we try to let the community know how we did and to express our appreciation to them for supporting such a worthwhile project. Positive effects of the publicity on your club: Quota is a viable part of Ruston. Quotarians are known as doers and achievers. We are leaders in our community. We have a diversified membership and so much talent that leadership is second nature. Other comments: We are not changers. We are enhancers. We have a great ways and means project and we will continue to look for ways to improve it. The booklet with ad sales and the bus tours were added recently. We will continue to analyze each tour and find ways to improve and grow better each year.

50|$|After the War inter-house {{competition}} {{became the}} main focus of the <b>Sports</b> <b>Day,</b> with the Times Shield becoming the main prize and prizes of small cups and medals awarded instead, bought by cash donations. In 1924 the Victor Ludorum Cup was first awarded, to the boy who gained the most points on <b>Sports</b> <b>Day.</b> In 1926 T.E. Jones changed <b>Sports</b> <b>Day</b> to the first Wednesday, and later a mid-June Saturday. The townsfolk of Hitchin were excluded from the event, with only parents and invited guests being spectators to the event. In 1931 the Junior Victor Ludorum award was first awarded and the <b>Sports</b> <b>Day</b> became <b>Sports</b> <b>Days,</b> with general races on the first days and inter-house events on a second day. This was reverted the following year. During the Second World War, the <b>Sports</b> <b>Day</b> was run as per normal. In 1948 the javelin and discus throwing were introduced to the event, followed by the shotput in 1952 and hop, step and jump in 1958. Even hammer throwing was tried, but the danger of the event (because of the lack of a cage) forced its stoppage. In 1955, after the arrival of M.G. Dolden in 1953, <b>Sports</b> <b>Day</b> was moved to May, a Victor Ludorum Cup was introduced for the intermediate years (14-16), the novelty races were scrapped completely, the tug-of-war was dropped as the finale and the Hitchin Town Band stopped playing at the event, making it school-only {{for the first time since}} 1899.|$|R
