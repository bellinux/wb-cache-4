It was shown unambiguously, for conditions of practical interest, that there were no significant effects of <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> rate and wind speed on the measurement of fibre mass concentration and fibre number concentration respectively. Thus, any observed bias in the measurement of fibre concentration by manual counting must instead be attributable to psychological effects relating to the density of fibres on the filter.

40|$|Flow records {{gathered}} by routers provide valuable coarse-granularity traffic information for several measurement-related network applications. However, {{due to high}} volumes of traffic, flow records need to be sampled before they are gathered. Current techniques for producing <b>sampled</b> <b>flow</b> records are either focused on selecting flows from which statistical estimates of traffic volume can be inferred, or have simplistic models for applications. Such <b>sampled</b> <b>flow</b> records are not suitable for many applications with more specific needs, such as ones that make decisions across flows. As a first step towards tailoring the sampling algorithm to an application’s needs, we design a generic language in which any particular application can express the classes of traffic of its interest. Our evaluation investigates the expressive power of our language, and whether flow records have sufficient information to enable sampling of records of relevance to applications. We use templates written in our custom language to instrument sampling tailored to three different applications—BLINC, Snort, and Bro.

The uniform peak intensities in the data plot indicate a consistent measurement of the calibration particles. The peak intensities exhibit a Gaussian distribution as shown in Fig. 11B. The fluorescent signals without SSAW focusing are shown in Fig. 11C as a negative control for comparison. Because the non-focused particles have different trajectories in the microchannel, {{a large number of}} them miss the excitation light spot or moved in different planes along the vertical direction, resulting in a much lower number of peaks detected with a larger non-uniformity in peak intensities. The SSAW-based 3D focusing enabled microfluidic cytometer does not require any sheath flows or complex structures, and it allows for simple operation over a wide range of <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> rates.

40|$|In {{black carbon}} (BC) {{measurements}} obtained using the filter-based optical technique, artifacts {{are a major}} problem. Recently, it has become possible to correct these artifacts {{to a certain extent}} by using numerical methods. Nevertheless, all correction schemes have their advantages and disadvantages under field conditions. In this study, a new correction model {{that can be used for}} determining artifact effects on BC measurements was proposed; the model is based on two different light attenuation (ATN) increasing rates. Two aethalometers were used to measure ATN values in parallel at aerosol <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> rates of 6 and 2 L min − 1. In the absence of sampling artifacts, the ratio of ATN values measured by the two aethalometers should be equal to the ratio of the <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> rates (or aerosol deposition rates) of these two aethalometers. In practice, the ratio of ATN values measured by the two aethalometers was not the same as the ratio of the <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> rates of the aethalometers because the aerosol loading effects varied with the aerosol deposition rate. If the true ATN value can be found, then BC measurements can be corrected for artifacts by using the true ATN change rate. Therefore, determining the true ATN value was the primary objective of this study. The proposed correction algorithm can be used to obtain the true ATN value from ATN values acquired at different <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> rates, and the actual BC mass concentrations can be determined from the true ATN change rate. Before BC correction, the BC concentration measured at the <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> rate of 6 L min − 1 was smaller than that measured at 2 L min − 1 by approximately 13 and 9 % in summer and winter seasons, respectively. After BC correction by using the true ATN value, the corrected BC for 6 L min − 1 can be exactly equal to the corrected BC for 2 L min − 1. Field test results demonstrated that loading effects on BC measurements could be corrected accurately by using the proposed model. Additionally, the problem of enhanced light ATN caused by light scattering at the unloaded filter can be overcome without using any light scattering coefficient. Therefore, the correction algorithm can be applied to a newly designed instrument to determine actual real-time BC concentrations by using two sampling spots for different aerosol deposition rates. Moreover, a simple empirical correction scheme for post-processing for correcting the existed aethalometer BC data is also presented. While this simple correction scheme is dependent on the aerosol type, it can be used to correct BC data when the primary source of BC and the weather conditions are similar to those in this study. Furthermore, two existed aethalometers with appropriate flow control can be used to create correction schemes suitable for different environments...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{free air}} is {{required}} {{in a wide range}} of scientific and technical applications such as pre-filtering for gas analysers or for the artefact correction of particle mass concentration measurements. Most common processes for the removal of particles from a gas stream are filtration and electrostatic precipitation. However, both mechanisms introduce changes to the thermodynamic conditions and/or the composition of the gas, which might be detrimental to the downstream measurement of gas or particle concentrations. For highly efficient separation of gas and particles with no changes of the thermodynamic conditions and substantially no changes to the gas phase, a coaxial Gas Particle Partitioner (GPP) has been developed and intensively tested. The GPP utilizes corona charging to electrically charge the particles and a strong electric field in a separate unit to take them out of the <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> when switched on. The corona was optimised with respect to gas formation, i. e. a gold wire of only 25 µm is used as corona electrode along with positive corona polarity. Additionally, the vicinity of the corona wire gets continuously flushed by means of a wash flow, which is spatially separated from the <b>sample</b> <b>flow,</b> to prevent gases formed by the corona, such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen from reaching the sample aerosol flow. Inside the GPP, the total aerosol flow is split into a <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> and an excess gas flow. The splitting of the flow ensures that evaporation or release of particles, deposited on the outer wall does not affect the <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> but only the excess gas flow. The flow splitter is designed such that the particle size distribution in the <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> is identical to the ambient distribution, when the GPP is switched off.

The laboratory investigations have shown that the GPP is able to separate gas and particles with an efficiency of near 100 % in the particle size range of 25 nm < dp < 10. 7 µm. For particle sizes below 25 nm, the separation efficiency decreased with decreasing particle size. The measures for a minimization of the influence of the corona on the gas composition have led to substantially reduced O 3 and NOx concentrations in the <b>sample</b> <b>flow.</b> Compared to the worst case (100 µm gold wire, negative polarity, no wash flow) the additional ozone concentration could be reduced by 98. 5 % and the nitrogen dioxide concentration by approx. 90 %...|$|E

The bioaerosol concentrations recorded by three different collection techniques have been compared with each other: impaction onto a glass slide, impaction onto an agar medium, and impingement into a liquid.
