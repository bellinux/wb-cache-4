5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It {{is much more}} common during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown intermediate host is an earthworm that only emerges when it rains. The worm was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and <b>spicule</b> (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and the texture of the eggs.|$|E
5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at the tip. In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at the tip. The <b>spicule,</b> a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{researchers}} believed spicules {{could send}} heat into the corona. However, following observational {{research in the}} 1980s, {{it was found that}} <b>spicule</b> plasma did not reach coronal temperatures, and so the theory was discounted.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the dynamic}} solar {{chromosphere}} is fundamental in solar physics. <b>Spicules</b> {{are an important}} feature of the chromosphere, connecting the photosphere to the corona, potentially mediating the transfer of energy and mass. The aim of this work is to study the properties of <b>spicules</b> over {{different regions of the}} sun. Our goal is to investigate if {{there is more than one}} type of <b>spicules,</b> and how <b>spicules</b> behave in the quiet sun, coronal holes, and active regions. We make use of high-cadence and high-spatial resolution Ca II H observations taken by Hinode/SOT. Making use of a semi-automated detection algorithm, we self-consistently track and measure the properties of 519 <b>spicules</b> over different regions. We find clear evidence of two types of <b>spicules.</b> Type I <b>spicules</b> show a rise and fall and have typical lifetimes of 150 - 400 s and maximum ascending velocities of 15 - 40 km/s, while type II <b>spicules</b> have shorter lifetimes of 50 - 150 s, faster velocities of 30 - 110 km/s, and are not seen to fall down, but rather fade at around their maximum length. Type II <b>spicules</b> are the most common, seen in quiet sun and coronal holes. Type I <b>spicules</b> are seen mostly in active regions. There are regional differences between quiet sun and coronal hole <b>spicules,</b> likely attributable to the different field configurations. The properties of type II <b>spicules</b> are consistent with published results of Rapid Blueshifted Events (RBEs), supporting the hypothesis that RBEs are their disk counterparts. For type I <b>spicules</b> we find the relations between their properties to be consistent with a magnetoacoustic shock wave driver, and with dynamic fibrils as their disk counterpart. The driver of type II <b>spicules</b> remains unclear from limb observations. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ. 17 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
50|$|Hexasterophoran sponges have <b>spicules</b> called hexactines {{that have}} six rays set at right angles. Orders within hexasterophora are {{classified}} by how tightly the <b>spicules</b> interlock with Lyssanctinosan <b>spicules</b> less tightly interlocked {{than those of}} Hexactinosan sponges.|$|R
40|$|Solar <b>spicules</b> have eluded modelers and {{observers}} for decades. Since {{the discovery of}} the more energetic type II, <b>spicules</b> have become a heated topic but their contribution to the energy balance of the low solar atmo-sphere remains unknown. Here we give a first glimpse of what quiet Sun <b>spicules</b> look like when observed with NASA’s recently launched Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Using IRIS spectra and filtergrams that sample the chromosphere and transition region we compare the properties and evolution of <b>spicules</b> as observed in a coordinated campaign with Hinode and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Our IRIS observa-tions allow us to follow the thermal evolution of type II <b>spicules</b> and finally confirm that the fading of Ca II H <b>spicules</b> appears to be caused by rapid heating to higher temperatures. The IRIS <b>spicules</b> do not fade but continue evolving, reaching higher and falling back down after 500 − 800 s. Ca II H type II <b>spicules</b> are thus the initial stages of violent and hotter events that mostly remain invisible in Ca II H filtergrams. These events have very different properties from type I <b>spicules,</b> which show lower velocities and no fading from chromo-spheric passbands. The IRIS spectra of <b>spicules</b> show the same signature as their proposed disk counterparts...|$|R
25|$|Sponges {{are some}} of Earth’s oldest and most {{ubiquitous}} animals. The appearance of sponge <b>spicule</b> fossils {{date back to the}} Precambrian Era around 580 million years ago. An assemblage of these fossils were found in the Doushanto formation in Southern China. Some circular impressions from the Ediacaran Hills in Southern Australia are also reported to be sponges. They are one of the only lineages of metazoans from this era that continue to survive, and remain relatively unchanged.|$|E
25|$|Reproduction {{is usually}} sexual, though hermaphrodites {{are capable of}} self-fertilization. Males are usually smaller than females/ hermaphrodites (often much smaller) and often have a {{characteristically}} bent or fan-shaped tail. During copulation, one or more chitinized spicules {{move out of the}} cloaca and are inserted into the genital pore of the female. Amoeboid sperm crawl along the <b>spicule</b> into the female worm. Nematode sperm is thought to be the only eukaryotic cell without the globular protein G-actin.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indirect}} symptoms characterize Retinitis Pigmentosa {{along with the}} direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia, which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the {{fundus of the eye}} as the Ophthalamic triad. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) caused by bone <b>spicule</b> formation, (2) a waxy appearance of the optic nerve, and (3) the attentuation of blood vessels in the retina.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone <b>spicule</b> accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from a {{statistical}} study of He II 304 Angstrom EUV <b>spicules</b> and macrospicules at the limb of the Sun. We use high-cadence (12 sec) and high-resolution (0. 6 arcsec pixels) resolution data from the Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). All of the observed events occurred in quiet or coronal hole regions near the solar pole. <b>Spicules</b> and macrospicules are typically transient jet-like chromospheric-material features, the macrospicules are wider and have taller maximum heights than the <b>spicules.</b> We looked for characteristics of the populations of these two phenomena that might indicate whether {{they have the same}} or different initiation mechanisms. We examined the maximum heights, time-averaged rise velocities, and lifetimes of about two dozen EUV <b>spicules</b> and about five EUV macrospicules. For <b>spicules,</b> these quantities are, respectively, approx. 5 - 30 km, 5 - 50 km/s, and a few 100 - approx. 1000 sec. Macrospicules were approx. 60, 000 km, 55 km/s, and had lifetimes of approx. 1800 sec. Therefore the macrospicules were taller and longer-lived than the <b>spicules,</b> and had velocities comparable to that of the fastest <b>spicules.</b> The rise profiles of both the <b>spicules</b> and the macrospicules matched well a second-order ("parabolic'') trajectory, although the acceleration was generally weaker than that of solar gravity in the profiles fitted to the trajectories. The Macrospicules also had obvious brightenings at their bases at their birth, while such brightenings were not apparent for most of the <b>spicules.</b> Most of the <b>spicules</b> and several of the macrospicules remained visible during their decent back to the solar surface, although {{a small percentage of the}} <b>spicules</b> faded out before their fall was completed. Are findings are suggestive of the two phenomena possibly having different initiation mechanisms, but this is not yet conclusive. Qualitatively the EUV 304 Angstrom <b>spicules</b> match well the properties quoted for "Type I'' Hinode Ca II <b>spicules,</b> even though we observed these 304 Angstrom <b>spicules</b> at a polar location, where typically only "Type II'' <b>spicules</b> are seen in the Hinode Ca II images.

There was also much more about his shipmates, with one or two of whom Mr. Mohun had evidently made great friends. He told his sister a great deal about them, and his conversations with them, whereas he had only told Dolores abut one little midshipman getting into a scrape.

60|$|It is well, however, {{to bear in}} {{mind that}} the Lower Palæozoic rocks {{probably}} do not give us anything at all representative of the first beginnings of life on our planet. Unless a creature has bones {14} or other hard parts, unless it wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is unlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind. To-day there are hundreds of thousands of species of small soft-bodied creatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists to discover. In the world's past, millions of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished and passed away without a trace remaining. The waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of the so-called Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety {15} of lowly, jelly-like, shell-less and boneless creatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches. The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of the existence of everybody in the neighbourhood. It is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a <b>spicule</b> or a carapace or a lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the future, that it goes upon the Record. But in rocks of an age prior to those which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined carbon, is sometimes found, and some authorities consider that it may have been separated out from combination through the vital activities of unknown living things.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from a {{statistical}} study of He II 304 Angstrom Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) <b>spicules</b> at the limb of the Sun. We also measured properties of one macrospicule; macrospicules are longer than most <b>spicules,</b> and much broader in width than <b>spicules.</b> We use high-cadence (12 second) and high-resolution (0. 6 arcseconds pixels) resolution data from the Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). All of the observed events occurred near the solar north pole, where quiet Sun or coronal hole environments ensued. We examined the maximum lengths, maximum rise velocities, and lifetimes of 33 Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) <b>spicules</b> and the macrospicule. For {{the bulk of the}} Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) <b>spicules</b> these quantities are, respectively, approximately 10, 000 - 40, 000 kilometers, 20 - 100 kilometers per second, and approximately 100 - approximately 1000 seconds. For the macrospicule the corresponding quantities were respectively approximately 60, 000 kilometers, approximately 130 kilometers per second, approximately 1800 seconds, which is typical of macrospicules measured by other workers. Therefore macrospicules are taller, longer-lived, and faster than most Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) <b>spicules.</b> The rise profiles of both the <b>spicules</b> and the macrospicules match well a second-order ("parabolic") trajectory, although the acceleration was often weaker than that of solar gravity in the profiles fitted to the trajectories.

40|$|<b>Spicules</b> are {{relatively}} small, narrow and elongated structures that stick out above {{the edge of}} the solar disk. They are very dynamic and appear as jets that shoot out into the outer solar atmosphere. Up until recently, in the era before adaptive optics and advanced image post-processing techniques, variable seeing conditions and limited telescope aperture sizes did not allow for major advancement in the {{understanding of the nature of}} <b>spicules.</b> In 2007, a new class of highly dynamical <b>spicules</b> was discovered with the solar telescope on-board the Hinode satellite, the "type II" <b>spicules.</b> Recent studies indicate that the type II <b>spicules</b> are very important concerning the mass loading and energy balance of the hot solar corona. In this thesis, we analyze two unique time sequences of the limb obtained from the Swedish 1 -meter Solar Telescope. These observations have high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. We investigate short-lived streaks in the far wings of the H-alpha spectral line. These events are characterized by a strong spectral asymmetry in the wing associated with high Doppler velocity. Before, these asymmetries have been observed exclusively in the blue wing of strong chromospheric lines in regions close to disc-center and were called "Rapid Blue-shifted Excursions" (RBEs). RBEs have been identified as the on-disk counterpart of the type II <b>spicules</b> seen off-limb by Hinode. We investigate this connection in more detail. We find similar RBE-like events in the red wing of H-alpha, or "Rapid Red-shifted Excursions". This is expected from a target region close to the solar limb. We also investigate the off-limb <b>spicules</b> seen in the wings of H-alpha and their possible connection to type II <b>spicules.</b> Our findings strengthen the connection between the RBEs/RREs and type II <b>spicules</b> and it strongly indicates that the off-limb <b>spicules</b> seen in H-alpha, the RBEs/RREs on-disk and the type II <b>spicules</b> seen by Hinode are the same phenomenon...|$|R
