40|$|To {{improve the}} {{treatments}} for low back pain, new designs of total disk replacement have been proposed. The {{question is how}} well these designs {{can act as a}} functional replacement of the intervertebral disk. Four finite element models were made, for four different design concepts, to determine how well they can mimic the physiological intervertebral disk mechanical function. The four designs were a homogenous elastomer, a multi-stiffness elastomer, an elastomer with <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket,</b> and a hydrogel with <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket.</b> The best material properties of the four models were determined by optimizing the model behavior to match the behavior of the intervertebral disk in flexion-extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending. It was shown that neither a homogeneous elastomer nor a multi-stiffness elastomer could mimic the non-linear behavior within the physiological range of motion. Including a <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket</b> around an elastomer allowed for physiological motion in all degrees of freedom. Replacing the elastomer by a hydrogel yielded similar good behavior. Mimicking the non-linear behavior of the intervertebral disk, in the physiological range of motion is essential in maintaining and restoring spinal motion and in protecting surrounding tissues like the facet joints or adjacent segments. This was accomplished with designs mimicking the function of the annulus fibrosus...|$|R

40|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} the major tissue for insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Each {{skeletal}} muscle is composed of hundreds to thousands of individual fibers. Because of the marked cellular diversity among fibers, it is advantageous to understand muscle function at the <b>single</b> <b>fiber</b> level. This thesis aimed to provide insights on skeletal muscle fiber type heterogeneity, concentrating on <b>single</b> <b>fibers</b> from the rat epitrochlearis muscle. Research from this thesis developed and validated techniques for simultaneous assessment in a <b>single</b> <b>fiber</b> of: glucose uptake (GU), fiber type (by myosin heavy chain isoform expression), fiber volume, and abundance of multiple proteins (by immunoblotting). GU capacity differed by both fiber type and stimulus: 1) IIA fibers consistently had the greatest insulin-stimulated GU capacity (IIA>IIB, IIX, IIB/X) across {{a wide range of}} the lifespan (2 -, 5 -, 9 -, and 25 -months-old) and 2) IIB fibers had the greatest AICAR-stimulated GU capacity. The primary insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT 4) was most abundant in IIA fibers, supporting the idea that insulinstimulated GU capacity is, in part, a function of the number of GLUT 4 transporters present. To better understand insulin resistance, GU was measured by <b>single</b> <b>fibers</b> from obese Zucker (OZ) versus lean Zucker (LZ) rats, and there was significant insulin resistance (44 - 58 %) for each fiber type. Lower levels of IκB-β in OZ fibers supported the idea for greater inflammation and NFκB activation contributing to the insulin resistance. In vivo electroporation of an ectopic gene was successful, allowing xiii visualization of fluorescent protein (DsRed) expression in <b>single</b> <b>fibers</b> without altering GU. Strong evidence was provided to support the combination of <b>single</b> <b>fiber</b> analysis with genetic manipulation to study the role that a gene-of-interest has on fiber typespecific GU capacity. Overall, results from this dissertation provided the first data showing conclusive evidence for fiber type-specific GU differences within a skeletal muscle. The extensive characterization of <b>single</b> <b>fibers</b> in this thesis provides unique insights for understanding muscle biology.
