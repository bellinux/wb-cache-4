5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} <b>step-down</b> <b>transformer</b> and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Constant-voltage speaker {{systems are}} {{analogous}} to electrical power transmission methods employed by power companies to transmit electrical power over long distances. Typically, a power company will {{step up the}} voltage of the power being transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current and therefore also reduces the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped back down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a <b>step-down</b> <b>transformer</b> to convert the voltage back to a usable level.|$|E

Therefore the wire diameter can be diminished, calculating it only from the condition of its heating by load currents. Later, it must be checked if the wire diameter corresponds to mechanical requirements. In supplying the energy via low-voltage lines, greater expenses {{must be taken into}} account than in delivering this energy via medium voltage lines.

40|$|Abstract: In {{power system}} planning, the general {{concern is the}} ability of a power system to supply {{increasing}} loads without undervoltages. Nonetheless, decrease in loads can also occur in power systems, e. g., when mines are decommissioned leading to shrinkage in load. Depending on the scale of the load reduction, problem of steady overvoltages can arise. This study proposes an investigation of using of <b>step-down</b> <b>transformers</b> to reduce steady state overvoltages in a lightly loaded network comprising of long corridors. The investigation evaluates the proposal of installing transformers {{at both ends of the}} length network, forming a ring of transformers to derate the operating voltage of the derated network. The load flow simulation studies are initially carried out manually by scaling the load down using the Power System Software for Engineers (PSS/E). The load flow studies for the lowest load served without violations are carried out for the case without transformers and the derated case with transformers. The study further proposed the use of Python program to automate the studies through scaling the load down until the voltage limits are reached by sending commands to PSS/E using Python syntax. In addition to this, the use of Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is proposed for optimally selecting a combination of lines to accommodate the least load within the voltage limits. The load is scaled down automatically in PSS/E using Python program with the least load served as an objective function and the constraints being the voltage limits. The study found that the use of <b>step-down</b> <b>transformers</b> can successfully reduce the steady state overvoltages in a lightly loaded network. The introduction of Python program to automate the studies was successful. Lastly, intelligence of Tabu Search algorithm can successfully select the optimal combination of lines to serve the least load without voltage violations. M. Phil.
