40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis {{is the ability to}} tune various {{molecular}} properties by controlling and utilizing aromaticity and antiaromaticity in the lowest electronically excited states. This investigation is based on qualitative theory, quantum chemical (QC) calculations and experimental work. Baird's rule tells that the π-electron count for aromaticity and antiaromaticity is reversed in the ππ* triplet (T 1) state when compared to Hückel's rule for the singlet ground state. The excited state aromatic character of [4 n]annulenes is probed by usage of two structural moieties, the cyclopropyl (cPr) group and the silacyclobutene (SCB) ring. The results of QC calculations and photoreactivity experiments showed that the cPr group and the SCB ring remained closed when attached to or fused with [4 n]annulenes so as to preserve T 1 aromatic stabilization. In contrast, both moieties ring-opened when attached to or fused with [4 n+ 2]annulenes as a means for alleviation of T 1 antiaromaticity. These two structural moieties are shown to indicate T 1 aromatic character of [4 n]annulenes except in a limited number of cases. The T 1 antiaromatic character of compounds with 4 n+ 2 π-electrons was utilized for photo(hydro) <b>silylations</b> and photohydrogenations. QC calculations showed that due to T 1 antiaromaticity, benzene is able to abstract hydrogen atoms from trialkylsilanes. The photoreactions occurred under mild conditions for benzene and certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, COT was found to be unreactive under similar conditions. It is further revealed that various properties of molecules can be tailored by rational design using Baird’s rule. Three modes of connectivity (linear, bent, and cyclic) of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCH) were explored by DFT calculations. When the PCHs contain a central [4 n]unit and 4 nπ-electron perimeter, bent isomers have lower triplet state energies than linear ones due to increased T 1 aromaticity in the bent isomers. With regard to the cyclic connectivity, macrocyclic compounds are designed by modifying the C 20 monocycle through incorporation of monocyclic units (all-carbon as well as heterocyclic) and the impact of macrocyclic T 1 aromaticity upon insertion of different units is examined through QC calculations. The results provide insights on excited state aromaticity in macrocyclic systems...|$|R

Sonication and acid gas treatments were found to lead to higher capacity sorbents than the more traditional preparative techniques. The CO 2 capture potential of the sorbents was characterized via a custom modified thermogravimetric analyser combined differential thermoanalyser and a custom made "adiabatic" rig, {{the potential of the}} sorbents for CO 2 capture via vacuum swing adsorption process technology was in particular targeted, however the sorbents were also considered {{in the context of a}} potential temperature swing adsorption process. The sorbents were found to exhibit useful selective CO 2 sorption capacities which were achieved via the reversible chemisorption of CO 2 via reaction with the amine groups to form ammonium carbamates. The larger porosity OMS sorbents were found to lead to higher capacity sorbents on account of their ability to contain more of the active sorbent phase. Sorption at relatively higher process temperatures, as possible for flue gas, was preferred to achieve the kinetics required for VSA processing of the higher capacity sorbents on account of the temperature dependence of the diffusion of gases through the amine sorbent phase. The high process temperatures lead to decomposition of the sorbent by urea formation via carbamate dehydration, however the incorporation of water into the feed gases (such as is in combustion flue gases) was found to inhibit this process and so validate the potential of these types of materials for the proposed application. The sorbents were otherwise found to exhibit stability. Pelletized forms of the sorbents, such as it is thought would be required for industry application, were prepared via compression either in amine form, or in carbamate form for otherwise solid in liquid dispersions. Such pelletized sorbents were likewise found to exhibit viable, albeit reduced, CO 2 working capacities under the conditions tested. Solid amine sorbents prepared were thus found to be a promising potential option for the post combustion capture of CO 2 towards reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R

5000|$|Because most heterocyclic bases contain {{multiple}} nucleophilic sites, site selectivity is {{an important}} issue in nucleoside synthesis.
