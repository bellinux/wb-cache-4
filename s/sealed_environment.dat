40|$|This thesis has {{the overall}} {{objective}} {{to develop the}} optimum sealing system between the retarder and transmission. Today, there is a pressure-relief and two radial seals separation between the retarder and transmission. It {{has been found that}} carbon residue formation may occur between retarder axle and seal lips with, in some cases, leakage as a result. We have in this thesis tried to explain the phenomenon of carbon residue, how it is formed and why it can be seen just on the seals? A rig test was conducted where we show how friction, speed, transmission temperature and mitigation phases of the retarder affects temperatures in the <b>sealing</b> <b>environment.</b> Factors affecting the coke structure are reported, together with proposals for measures that provide a mitigating <b>seal</b> <b>environment.</b> The material is PTFE, which is standard in the seals today; we believe meets all requirements for the sealing material.

MEMS components include a variety of sensors, microengines, optical components, and other devices. They often have exposed mechanical structures which during assembly require particulate control, space in the package, non-contact handling procedures, low-stress die attach, precision die placement, unique process schedules, hermetic <b>sealing</b> in controlled <b>environments</b> (including vacuum), and other special constraints. These constraints force changes in the techniques used to separate die on a wafer, in the types of packages which can be used in the assembly processes and materials, and in the <b>sealing</b> <b>environment</b> and process.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that GaAs devices in hermetically sealed packages when exposed to temperatures as low as 125 oC can exhibit unacceptable degradation in both RF and DC characteristics.

Subsequently, atomic hydrogen diffuses into the channel region of the FET structure and neutralizes the Si donors, resulting in a degradation of the device characteristics. Most of the data indicates the onslaught of the problem to occur after 500 hours at 125 oC.

50|$|At this time, the Army {{looked at}} two {{alternate}} vehicles {{that could be}} fielded more quickly. The FMC company had developed an IFV version of the M113, which had a one-man turret mounting a 25 mm gun, a <b>sealed</b> <b>environment,</b> and firing ports. The vehicle weight was 15 tons. The U.S. Army rejected it due to limited mobility, which would have prevented it from keeping pace with the proposed MBT-70. However, the design was purchased by the Dutch and Belgian governments. The other alternate vehicle was the West German Marder, which mounted a 20 mm autocannon, two 7.62 mm MGs, relatively strong steel armor, and full CBR protection. The U.S. Army rejected it due to it not being amphibious, too large and heavy for air transport, and too expensive.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cloud chamber}} {{consists}} of a <b>sealed</b> <b>environment</b> containing a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol. An energetic charged particle (for example, an alpha or beta particle) interacts with the gaseous mixture by knocking electrons off gas molecules via electrostatic forces during collisions, resulting in a trail of ionized gas particles. The resulting ions act as condensation centers around which a mist-like trail of small droplets form if the gas mixture is {{at the point of}} condensation. These droplets are visible as a [...] "cloud" [...] track that persist for several seconds while the droplets fall through the vapor. These tracks have characteristic shapes. For example, an alpha particle track is thick and straight, while an electron track is wispy and shows more evidence of deflections by collisions.|$|E
50|$|Anthropogenic cloud can be {{generated}} in laboratory or in situ to study its properties or use it for other purpose. A cloud chambers is a <b>sealed</b> <b>environment</b> containing a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol. When a charged particle (for example, an alpha or beta particle) interacts with the mixture, the fluid is ionized. The resulting ions act as condensation nuclei, around which a mist will form (because the mixture is {{on the point of}} condensation). Cloud seeding, a form of weather modification, is the attempt to change the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud. The usual intent is to increase precipitation (rain or snow), but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{claims of}} {{cultivable}} ancient bacteria within <b>sealed</b> <b>environments</b> highlight our limited {{understanding of the}} mechanisms behind long-term cell survival. It remains unclear how dormancy, a favored explanation for extended cellular persistence, can cope with spontaneous genomic decay over geological timescales. There has been no direct evidence in ancient microbes for the most likely mechanism, active DNA repair, or for the metabolic activity necessary to sustain it. In this paper, we couple PCR and enzymatic treatment of DNA with direct respiration measurements to investigate long-term survival of bacteria sealed in frozen conditions for up to one million years. Our results show evidence of bacterial survival in samples up to half a million years in age, making this the oldest independently authenticated DNA to date obtained from viable cells. Additionally, we find strong evidence that this long-term survival is closely tied to cellular metabolic activity and DNA repair that over time proves to be superior to dormancy as a mechanism in sustaining bacteria viabilit...|$|R

50|$|Dynamic {{generators}} {{can provide}} power {{at more than}} 4 times the conversion efficiency of RTGs. NASA and DOE have been developing a next-generation radioisotope-fueled power source called the Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) that uses free-piston Stirling engines coupled to linear alternators to convert heat to electricity. SRG prototypes demonstrated an average efficiency of 23%. Greater efficiency {{can be achieved by}} increasing the temperature ratio between the hot and cold ends of the generator. The use of non-contacting moving parts, non-degrading flexural bearings, and a lubrication-free and hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>environment</b> have, in test units, demonstrated no appreciable degradation over years of operation. Experimental results demonstrate that an SRG could continue running for decades without maintenance. Vibration can be eliminated as a concern by implementation of dynamic balancing or use of dual-opposed piston movement. Potential applications of a Stirling radioisotope power system include exploration and science missions to deep-space, Mars, and the Moon.|$|E

This gives us an opportunity to determine if the behaviors reported in <b>sealed</b> bid <b>environments</b> can be detected in the more active market environment. As such, the experiments are also a test of the robustness of earlier experiments that demonstrate that in economies with homogeneous preferences single compound securities organized by double auctions are able to aggregate information. The basic result is that a severe winner's curse is not observed. The irrationality observed in sealed bids does not extend itself to the double auction environment.
