5|$|The {{difficulty}} with Richards' transformation {{from the point}} of view of building practical filters was that the resulting distributed element design invariably included series connected elements.

5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production {{that lead to}} increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
