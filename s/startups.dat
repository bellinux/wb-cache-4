25|$|Startup {{investing}} is {{the action}} of making an investment in an early-stage company (the startup company). Beyond founders' own contributions, some <b>startups</b> raise additional investment at some or several stages of their growth. Not all <b>startups</b> trying to raise investments are successful in their fundraising. The solicitation of funds became easier for <b>startups</b> as result of the JOBS Act. Prior to the advent of equity crowdfunding, a form of online investing that has been legalized in several nations, <b>startups</b> did not advertise themselves {{to the general public}} as investment opportunities until and unless they first obtained approval from regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) that typically involved a listing of the startup's securities on a stock exchange. Today, there are many alternative forms of IPO commonly employed by <b>startups</b> and startup promoters that do not include an exchange listing, so they may avoid certain regulatory compliance obligations, including mandatory periodic disclosures of financial information and factual discussion of business conditions by management that investors and potential investors routinely receive from registered public companies.|$|E

40|$|It is {{essential}} to address the <b>startup</b> issues prior to the wide application of loop heat pipes (LHPs) in both space and terrestrial surroundings. As non-condensable gas (NCG) {{is an important factor}} affecting the <b>startup</b> behavior, its effects on the <b>startup</b> performance of an ammonia-stainless steel LHP with and without preconditioning were experimentally investigated in this work. Nitrogen with controlled amounts was used to simulate the NCG, and the temperature overshoot, liquid superheat and <b>startup</b> time were employed as the evaluation criteria. Four situations relating to initial liquid/vapor distribution in the evaporator were examined: (1) both evaporator core and vapor grooves are filled with liquid, (2) vapor exists in vapor grooves and the evaporator core is filled by liquid, (3) vapor grooves are filled by liquid and vapor exists in the evaporator core, and (4) vapor exists in both evaporator core and vapor grooves. Experimental results showed that with NCG presence in the LHP, the <b>startup</b> could only proceed in situation 1 with preconditioning, while it could proceed in situations 1, 3 or 4 without preconditioning. For the <b>startup</b> in situation 1, a larger NCG inventory led to much degraded <b>startup</b> performance, and a higher <b>startup</b> heat load could benefit the <b>startup.</b> For the <b>startup</b> in situation 3, the most difficult <b>startup</b> situation, NCG resulted in a very high temperature overshoot, which may even exceed the maximum allowable value. For the <b>startup</b> in situation 4, the existence of NCG in the vapor grooves could facilitate the evaporation there, leading to a very desirable <b>startup...</b>|$|R
