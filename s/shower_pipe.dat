40|$|The {{drinking}} water quality changes during the transport through distribution systems. Domestic {{drinking water}} systems (DDWSs), {{which include the}} plumbing between the water meter and consumer's taps, are the most critical points in which water quality may be affected. In distribution networks, the drinking water temperature and water residence time are regarded as indicators of the drinking water quality. This paper describes an experimental research {{on the influence of}} stagnation time and temperature change on drinking water quality in a full-scale DDWS. Two sets of stagnation experiments, during winter and summer months, with various stagnation intervals (up to 168 h of stagnation) were carried out. Water and biofilms were sampled at two different taps, a kitchen and a shower tap. Results from this study indicate that temperature and water stagnation affect both chemical and microbial quality in DDWSs, whereas microbial parameters in stagnant water appear to be driven by the temperature of fresh water. Biofilm formed in the <b>shower</b> <b>pipe</b> contained more total and intact cells than the kitchen pipe biofilm. Alphaproteobacteria were found to dominate in the shower biofilm (78 % of all Proteobacteria), while in the kitchen tap biofilm Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were evenly distributed.

Peninsula is a remote campground which can be subject to winter and/or road closures. Campsite reservations can be made only on-season and during off-season it is first-come, first-served.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the process}} of {{papermaking}} by pulp and paper plants, a thick and viscous deposits, termed slime, is quickly formed around the paper machines, which can affect the papermaking process. In this study, we explored {{the composition of the}} bacterial biota in slime that developed on <b>shower</b> <b>pipes</b> from 2 machines at a Canadian paper mill. Firstly, the composition was assessed for 12 months by DNA profiling with polymerase chain reaction coupled with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Except for short periods (2 - 3 months), clustered analyses showed that the bacterial composition of the slime varied substantially over the year, with less than 50 % similarity between the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles. Secondly, the screening of 16 S rRNA gene libraries derived from 2 slime samples showed that the most abundant bacteria were related to 6 lineages, including Chloroflexi, candidate division OP 10, Clostridiales, Bacillales, Burkholderiales, and the genus Deinococcus. Finally, the proportion of 8 bacterial lineages, such as Deinococcus sp., Meiothermus sp., and Chloroflexi, was determined by the Catalyzed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization in 2 slime samples. The results showed a high proportion of Chloroflexi, Tepidimonas spp., and Schlegelella spp. in the slime samples...|$|R
40|$|Samples {{obtained}} from plumbing systems of hospitals, nonhospital institutions and homes were cultured for Legionella spp. {{by plating the}} samples directly on a selective medium. Swab samples {{were taken from the}} inner surfaces of faucet assemblies (aerators, spouts, and valve seats), showerheads, and <b>shower</b> <b>pipes.</b> Water and sediment were collected from the bottom of hot-water tanks. Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1, 5, and 6 were recovered from plumbing fixtures of the hospitals and nonhospital institutions and one of five homes. The legionellae (7 to 13, 850 colony-forming units per ml) were also present in water and sediment from hot-water tanks maintained at 30 to 54 degrees C, but not in those maintained at 71 and 77 degrees C. Legionella micdadei was isolated from one tank. Thus legionellae are present in hot-water tanks which are maintained at warm temperatures or whose design results in warm temperatures {{at the bottom of the}} tanks. We hypothesize that hot-water tanks are a breeding site and a major source of L. pneumophila for the contamination of plumbing systems. The existence of these bacteria in the plumbing systems and tanks was not necessarily associated with disease. The extent of the hazard of this contamination needs to be delineated...|$|R
5000|$|Typically {{there are}} ground nozzles that spray water upwards {{out of the}} splash pad's raindeck. There may also be other water {{features}} such as a rainbow (semicircular <b>pipe</b> <b>shower),</b> or mushroom- or tree-shaped showers. Some splash pads feature movable nozzles {{similar to those found}} on fire trucks to allow users to spray others. The showers and ground nozzles are often controlled by a hand activated-motion sensor, to run for limited time.|$|R
40|$|Biofilm {{formation}} {{is a universal}} phenomenon pertaining to a microorganism attaching itself to a surface that is in constant contact with water. It occurs widely on the ships hulls, dentures, eyes due to non compatible contact lenses, implanted medical devices, <b>showers</b> tubes, cooling <b>pipes</b> in nuclear reactors, water distribution systems etc. Environmentally and economically viable solutions are increasingly being researched to prevent and control the biofilm formation. Natural and synthetic compounds have been studied extensively to address the issue. This paper reviews the use of various methods being adopted to prevent and inhibit the formation of biofilms and other futuristic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Fine-grained energy {{metering}} {{in homes}} and buildings pro-vides a promising technique {{for addressing the}} unmaintain-able energy consumption levels of worldwide buildings. Me-tering electricity, lighting, natural gas, HVAC, occupancy, and water on a per appliance or room basis can provide invaluable insight when trying to reduce a building’s energy footprint. A myriad of sensor designs and systems collect data on partic-ular building aspects, but are often hampered by installation difficulty or ongoing maintenance needs (like battery replace-ment). We address these common pitfalls for water and heat metering by developing a small, energy-harvesting sensor that meters using the same thermoelectric generator with which it powers itself. In short, {{the rate at which}} the harvester captures energy is proportional to the heat production of the monitored appliance or pipe and this relationship allows us to estimate energy use simply based on the sensor’s ability to harvest. We prototype our sensor in a bracelet shaped form-factor that can attach to a <b>shower</b> head <b>pipe,</b> faucet, or appliance to provide local hot water or heat metering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of thermal energy recovered from hot water shower drains in bathrooms equipped with instantaneous type water heaters in high-rise residential buildings of Hong Kong. In particular, a simple single-pass counter-flow heat exchanger installed at a horizontal <b>shower</b> drainage <b>pipe</b> {{was used as a}} preliminary heat recovery measure by heating up the cold water supply to a water heater. The thermal energy exchange at the heat exchanger was evaluated with the effectiveness number-of-transfer-units (ε-NTU) approach. User shower patterns including shower operating time and water flow rate were sampled from an interview survey with the Monte-Carlo sampling technique. Yearly water temperatures at the shower heads, shower drains and cold water supply taps were recorded in sample operations of hot water showers in bathrooms and used for sample inputs in this study. The results showed that 4 - 15 % thermal energy would be recovered from a shower drain with a 1. 5 m long single-pass counter-flow heat exchanger for a drain pipe of 50 mm diameter.

5000|$|In {{the next}} few months, inmates got tougher punishments for the most minor of infractions. Some complained of being forced to [...] "stand under the clock" [...] — {{standing}} at attention in the prison rotunda {{for hours at a}} time. Others griped at not being given forks or knives in the commissary. Just after midnight on March 29, an inmate awoke moaning and begging to be taken to the infirmary. A nurse gave him an aspirin and told him to report sick in the morning. He protested, loudly. As if prearranged — and the riot almost certainly was planned to some degree — men in adjoining cells began to tear apart their metal cots. Then they used the legs to pry open their cell doors in a mass breakout. With startling speed, the 52 cons chased their guards out of the wing, barricaded the entrance and wrecked everything they could lay their hands on. They smashed cell toilets, shredded beds, broke windows and set fires. The inmates were in control of the three-tiered block. Prison guards toting tommy guns ringed the area and blared a loudspeaker message for the men to come out with their hands up. The order was answered with a <b>shower</b> of steel <b>pipes,</b> blackjacks and glass shards. Warden Carty decided to wear down the inmates rather than storm the cell blocks. Guards lobbed in tear gas and trained a spray of fire hoses through the shattered cell windows. The rioters issued no demands until a last, pitiful plea not to be punished. This was denied, and the last bleary-eyed, soaking-wet rebel gave up 46 hours after the disturbance began but the year of riots had just begun.|$|R
