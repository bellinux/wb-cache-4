Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E

5000|$|Psidium cattleyanum, {{commonly}} known as Cattley guava, <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> or cherry guava, is a small tree (2-6 m tall) in the Myrtaceae (myrtle) family. The species is named in honour of English horticulturist William Cattley. Its genus name Psidium comes from the Latin psidion, or [...] "armlet." [...] The red-fruited variety, P. cattleyanum var. cattleyanum, is {{commonly known}} as purple guava, red cattley guava, red <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> and red cherry guava. The yellow-fruited variety, P. cattleyanum var. littorale is variously known as yellow cattley guava, yellow <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava,</b> yellow cherry guava, lemon guava and in Hawaii as waiawī. Although P. cattleyanum has select economic uses, it is considered the most invasive plant in Hawaii.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{follow-up}} color changes in low-calorie <b>strawberry</b> and <b>guava</b> jellies during storage. To this end, one formulation of each flavor was prepared varying the application of hydrocolloids (pectin and modified starch). The jellies were studied regarding pH, soluble solids, water activity and syneresis. In order to follow-up color changes, the samples remained stored for 180 days in chambers with controlled temperatures of 10 °C (control) and 25 °C (commercial), and color instrumental analyses (L*, a*, and b*) were performed every 30 days. Arrhenius model was applied to reaction speeds (k) at different temperatures, where light <b>strawberry</b> and <b>guava</b> jellies showed greater color changes when stored at 25 °C compared to the samples stored at 10 °C. Activation energy values between 13 and 15 kcal. mol - 1 and Q 10 values between 2. 1 and 2. 3 were obtained for light strawberry jelly and light guava jelly, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that, with respect to color changes, every 10 °C temperature increase reduces light jellies shelf-life by half...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the fruit}} is {{cultivated}} and favored by humans, many animals and birds consume it, readily dispersing the seeds in their droppings and, in Hawaii, <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> (P. littorale) {{has become an}} aggressive invasive species threatening extinction to more than 100 other plant species.

50|$|Humblot's flycatcher {{has a very}} {{restricted}} {{range and}} is threatened because of destruction and degradation of the forest {{and the spread of}} introduced species such as the <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleyanum), which could overwhelm native species, the common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and rats which may raid the nests. The population of 10,000-19,000 individuals is decreasing and the species is classed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered.|$|E
50|$|Threats to {{the species}} include feral pigs, which uproot and trample vegetation, leading to loss of plant cover and root networks, which then leads to erosion. They {{pick up the}} seeds of {{invasive}} plant species and transport them to new habitats. Fences have been erected in critical areas to exclude the pigs. Non-native plants affecting the euphorb include silky oak (Grevillea robusta), corky-stem passionflower (Passiflora suberosa), and <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium littorale).|$|E
50|$|Oftentimes the {{introduced}} species is {{better equipped to}} survive and competes with the native species for food or other resources. For example, the <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> tree is one of Hawaii's worst invasive species. It is dangerous because it crowds out native plant species, breaks up natural areas, disrupts native animal communities, alters native ecosystem processes like water production, and provides refuge for alien fruit flies that are a major pest of Hawaiian agriculture.|$|E
50|$|For a start, {{studies were}} carried out on cinchona (Succirubra and Ledgeriana), tea (Dangri, Dhonjan, Rajghur, Charali Assam, Amulguri and Dutea), coffee (Mysore variety), orange, lemon, pomelo, tree tomato, <b>guava,</b> <b>strawberry</b> and three species of grass (Australian blue couch, carpet and Guinea grass). It was {{confirmed}} the uplands could support the growing of tea. This gave the British the impetus to develop the place.|$|R
5000|$|Paraguayans {{cultivated}} {{numerous other}} fruits, vegetables, and spices for both domestic consumption and export. Most common were citrus fruits, which were ideal for Paraguay's subtropical and tropical climate. [...] Paraguay also produced pineapples, {{which according to}} some sources originated in Paraguay, and peaches, which were farmed commercially by fruit companies from the United States. Bananas, plums, <b>strawberries,</b> pears, avocados, <b>guavas,</b> papayas, mangoes, grapes, apples, watermelon, and other melons were cultivated to varying degrees as well. [...] Vegetable production included gourds, squash, tomatoes, and carrots. Onions and garlic were widely grown and commonly used in cooking.|$|R
50|$|A feijoa {{may be used}} as an {{interesting}} addition to a fruit smoothie, and may be used to make wine or cider and feijoa-infused vodka. The flavour is aromatic, strong and complex, inviting comparison with <b>guava,</b> <b>strawberry,</b> pineapple, and often containing a faint wintergreen-like aftertaste. It also is possible to buy feijoa yogurt, fruit drinks, jam, ice cream, and such in New Zealand. It also may be cooked and used in dishes where one would use stewed fruit. It is a popular ingredient in chutney. The very strong, complex flavour can make using feijoas, in combination with other fruits or vegetables, a creative and complex undertaking.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} a shrub growing 0.5 to 2 meters tall with hairy leaves {{and green and}} white flowers. It grows in the cloud zone of the {{mountains}} in wet, windy habitat. This habitat is degraded by several forces, including feral pigs and exotic plant species such as Koster's curse (Clidemia hirta) and <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleianum). In conservation efforts, some plants have been fenced to protect them and many seeds have been collected.|$|E

50|$|The native flora {{comprises}} 89% endemic species, but {{the flora}} of Hawaii now {{includes more than}} 1044 introduced plant species; more than 100 of these {{are likely to be}} invasive in natural areas. Species such as the <b>strawberry</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleianum), and christmasberry (Schinus terebinthifolius) have spread across wide areas, competing with native species and altering the natural ecosystem. Recent invaders like miconia or velvet tree (Miconia calvescens) and Himalayan raspberry (Rubus ellipticus) are now permanently established over large areas. These species are predicted to decrease watershed function.|$|E
