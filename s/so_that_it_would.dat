5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> also be activated automatically {{in the case of}} a catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the {{structure}} was also {{supposed to have}} a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma also noted that the bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> sway during an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Education in Nigeria is {{overseen by}} the Ministry of Education. Local {{authorities}} take responsibility for implementing policy for state-controlled public education and state schools at a regional level. The education system is divided into Kindergarten, primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. After the 1970s oil boom, tertiary education was improved <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> reach every subregion of Nigeria. 68% of the Nigerian population is literate, and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).|$|E

5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be more difficult to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Bartholdi's statue {{was to be}} laid inside Fort Wood, a disused army base on Bedloe's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had rarely been used, though during the Civil War, it {{had served as a}} recruiting station. The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven-point star. The statue's foundation and pedestal were aligned <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} generals' plot, Đính sent Colonel Nguyễn Hữu Có, {{his deputy}} corps commander, to Mỹ Tho {{to talk to the}} 7th Division commander, Colonel Bùi Đình Đạm, and two regimental commanders, the {{armoured}} unit commander, both subordinate to Đạm, and the chief of Mỹ Tho province. Exhorting them to join the coup, he stated that all the generals were in the plot except the strongly loyalist Huỳnh Văn Cao, and that Đính would soon join. According to one account, Đính had intended that loyalists would report Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be possible to complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the nonprofit}} {{organization}} Friends of the High Line {{was formed by}} Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the neighborhood that the line ran through. They advocated for the line's preservation and reuse as public open space, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> become an elevated park or greenway, similar to the Promenade Plantée in Paris. The organization was initially formed as a small community group to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and transformation {{at a time when}} the historic structure was under the threat of demolition during Rudy Giuliani’s second mayoral term.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of aerodynamics and how airship bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable airship. She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's findings. For a more efficient steerable airship vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> act like an inclined plane.|$|E
5|$|No {{news about}} the game was made {{available}} for 18 months after it was initially announced. Davis thought the game was announced too early, causing excitement for it to die down {{too far from the}} release date. The developers carried out focus tests during this period, and the gameplay was found to be too slow-paced compared to competitors such as Call of Duty. As a result, the team spent time to speed up the game's action <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> more closely match the narrative.|$|E

50|$|The nitride ion, N3−, {{is never}} {{encountered}} in protic solution because <b>it</b> is <b>so</b> basic <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be protonated immediately. Its ionic radius {{is estimated to}} be 140 pm.|$|R
5|$|O'Brien {{immediately}} {{sued the}} British Government for false imprisonment, {{and to avoid}} any liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down when it was being prepared <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition. He was released in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so {{that it looked like}} a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|Squall was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modelled after late actor River Phoenix. Squall's weapon, the gunblade, also made <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be difficult to master. In order to make players understand Squall's silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character's thoughts open to them. Squall's first voiced appearance {{was in the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for all other English-speaking appearances.|$|E

5|$|Tintin et les Picaros began {{serialisation}} in both Belgium and France in Tintin-l'Hebdoptmiste {{magazine in}} September 1975. It was then {{published in a}} collected volume by Casterman in 1976. For this publication, a page {{was removed from the}} story <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> fit the standard 62-page book format. The page in question was located between pages 22 and 23 of the published book, and featured Sponz attempting to smash a glass, but accidentally breaking a statue of Bordurian political leader Kurvi-Tasch instead. A launch party was held at the Hilton Hotel in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{licensed}} other editions from 1936 to 1938, and {{the game}} was exported from the UK and resold or reprinted in Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Chile, The Netherlands, and Sweden. In Italy, under the fascists, the game was changed dramatically <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have an Italian name, locations in Milan, and {{major changes in the}} rules. This was for compliance under Italian law of the period. Italian publishers Editrice Giochi produced the game in Italy until 2009, having held a unique licensing agreement from Parker Brothers and their own copyright dating back to 1935/1936. As of 2009, Hasbro has taken over the publishing of the game in Italy, but have also, for now, kept the Milan-based properties.|$|E
5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|E
