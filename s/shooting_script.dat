5|$|A {{second draft}} was {{finished}} by September. Captain Blumburtt, Chattar Lal, {{and the boy}} Maharaja originally had more crucial roles. A dogfight was deleted, {{as well as those}} who drank the Kali blood turned into zombies with physical superhuman abilities. During pre-production, the Temple of Death title was replaced with Temple of Doom. From March to April 1983, Huyck and Katz simultaneously performed rewrites for a final <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the screenwriting process, Parker and Colesberry began {{scouting}} locations. They visited {{eight states}} based on suggestions {{made by the}} location department. The <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> required that a total of 62 locations be used for filming. In December 1987, Parker and Colesberry traveled to Mississippi to visit the stretch of road where Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were murdered. The filmmakers were initially reluctant about filming in Mississippi; they expressed interest in filming in Forsyth County, Georgia before being persuaded by John Horne, head of the Mississippi's film commission. Parker also met with Mississippi governor Ray Mabus, who voiced his support of the film's production.|$|E

5|$|In early January 1923 Stroheim {{arrived in}} San Francisco, where he scouted {{locations}} and finished writing the <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b> While researching for Greed, he attended society functions {{in town and}} met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother Charles and his sister-in-law Kathleen. To capture the authentic spirit of the story, Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in Iowa Hill, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included Cliff House and San Francisco Bay.|$|E
5|$|The screenplay's early drafts {{suggested}} a {{four and a}} half-hour film with a potential budget of $40 million – double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros. The director knew film mogul Arnon Milchan and met with him to help finance the film. Milchan was eager {{to work on the}} project and launch his new company, Regency Enterprises, with a high profile film like JFK. Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put up the money for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from Gerolmo's {{original}} draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman {{and created the}} character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman. The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally beats a news cameraman {{was based on an}} actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which a CBS News cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case. Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker that {{the relationship between the two}} characters be more discreet. By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete <b>shooting</b> <b>script,</b> which he submitted to Orion executives. Gerolmo did not visit the production during principal photography, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} such {{programs}} arises from the presence of certain peculiarities in standard screenplay format which are not handled well by generic word processors. A good example would be the formatting and revision-tracking requirements of <b>shooting</b> <b>scripts.</b> The page-break constraints imposed by standard screenplay format are also difficult to implement using standard word processors.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} made on a {{production}} budget of about $15 million and shot {{in various parts of}} Los Angeles, California, beginning on September 25, 2010. Locations were picked by Refn while Gosling drove him around the city at night. At the director's request, Los Angeles was picked as the shooting location due to budget constraints. Refn moved into a plush Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him. They would work on the script and film all day, then watch films, edit or drive at night. Refn asked that the editing suite be placed in his home as well. With a <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> of 81 pages, Refn and Gosling continued to trim down dialog during filming.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the {{director}} Andrei Tarkovsky had two motives for cinematically adapting the Polish science fiction novel, Solaris (1961), by Stanisław Lem: firstly, he admired Lem's work. Secondly, he needed work and money, because his previous film, Andrei Rublev (1966) had gone unreleased, and his screenplay, A White, White Day, had been rejected (even though in 1975 {{it would be}} realised as The Mirror). A film of a novel by Stanisław Lem, a popular and critically respected writer in the USSR, was a logical commercial and artistic choice. Tarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the cinematic adaptation of the novel Solaris. With Fridrikh Gorenshtein, Tarkovsky co-wrote the first screenplay in the Summer of 1969; two-thirds of it occurred on Earth. The Mosfilm committee disliked it and Lem got furious over this unacceptably drastic alteration of his novel. The final screenplay yielded the <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> which has less action on Earth, and Kelvin's marriage to his second wife, Maria, was deleted from the story.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{devoted a}} large amount of secrecy for Batman Returns. The art {{department}} was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's fake working title Dictel to go anywhere near the sets. Kevin Costner was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a private investigator to track down the accomplice. $65 million was spent during the production of Batman Returns, while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million. The final shot of Catwoman looking at the Bat-Signal was completed during post-production and {{was not part of the}} <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b> After Batman Returns was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a body double was chosen.|$|E
50|$|A {{novelisation}} of this serial, {{written by}} Ian Marter, {{was published by}} Target Books in May 1985. The novelisation restores material cut from the original <b>shooting</b> <b>scripts</b> including the UNIT raid to rescue Professor Watkins and Vaughn convincing Routledge to shoot himself. In this novel the Russian Air Base is named as Nikortny, a punning tribute to actor Nicholas Courtney.|$|R
25|$|There are {{no plans}} to novelise episodes from the 2005–present revival of Doctor Who. Instead, the BBC {{published}} original novels featuring the Ninth Doctor and Tenth Doctor, with Eleventh Doctor-based novels announced for 2010, and a hardback script book containing the <b>shooting</b> <b>scripts</b> for the 2005 series. Scripts for later seasons {{have not yet been}} published as of 2010, though 2005-2009 lead writer Russell T Davies has made his scripts available online.|$|R

Five of the seven hardcover editions were credited to Kenneth Bulmer. This included, presumably erroneously, the fifteenth novel. The two Arthur Barker hardbacks were credited to Ken Blake.|$|R

Robin Wright, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton {{were all}} being {{considered}} the role was recast with Nicole Kidman. Billy Dee Williams {{took on the}} role of Harvey Dent in Batman on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, after having worked with him on The Client. Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so after his son's insistence. Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast. Robin appeared in the <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> of Batman Returns but was deleted due to too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. Chris O'Donnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.|$|E

40|$|This article grows most {{immediately}} {{out of the}} Scholars and Artists in Residence (SAR) Fellowship held at the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) in October/November 2008, {{investigating the}} relationship between the history of Australian jazz and the formation of Australian identity. At that stage of the work-in-progress the primary source material was moving image and related materials such as <b>shooting</b> <b>scripts,</b> stills and promotional items. Around 60 moving image items were examined, 1 including feature films, newsreels and documentaries, as well as printed materials such as <b>shooting</b> <b>scripts</b> and treatments, covering the years 1919 to 2008. The broader background to this work was a professional interest in cultural history as an acoustic field, the particular example of music, jazz and especially its diasporic forms, and most specifically the deep interest in Australian jazz of a longtime active performer, and in policy development and administration. The research is continuing (including through a follow-up SAR Fellowship for 2009), with reference to other forms of primary material such as sound recordings and sleeve notes, memoirs, interviews, reviews and promotional material. This interim account of the negotiation between Australian jazz and discourses of nation confines itself to film and moving image...|$|R
50|$|The Silver Star {{productions}} are infamous {{for their}} extremely low budgets, {{which might have}} {{also contributed to the}} low technical quality. In the book Gods In Spandex, Richard Harrison states that the Page films he appeared in didn't have complete <b>shooting</b> <b>scripts</b> and many scenes were improvised, hence the disjointed narrative. However, {{it can be said that}} Page's early films are particularly bad, even on the admittedly low Silver Star standards, but they have attracted some cult interest, especially in French B-movie fandom.|$|R

5|$|Umboh was {{an authoritarian}} perfectionist, who often reshot scenes he felt flawed and refused {{input from the}} actors. He {{sometimes}} worked together with other directors, including Sjumandjaja, Misbach Yusa Biran, and Arifin C. Noer, to improve the film's flow. These collaborations influenced {{the atmosphere of the}} films; for example, films shot with Noer like Sesuatu yang Indah (Something Beautiful; 1976) came across as surrealistic, while collaborations with Sjumandjaja were more realistic. <b>Shooting</b> <b>scripts</b> were often prepared minutes before shooting, but, according to Karya, Umboh memorised each line of dialogue and used his recollection during dubbing.|$|R

Begelman left MGM because several of his projects had performed poorly at the box office. This put all of his future projects, Buckaroo Banzai included, in jeopardy. Begelman formed Sherwood Productions and exercised a buy-out option with MGM for the Banzai script. He took it to 20th Century Fox who agreed to make it with a $12 million budget.

25|$|All Is Lost {{was written}} and {{directed}} by J. C. Chandor, his second feature film, following 2011's Margin Call. During his time commuting from Providence, Rhode Island to New York City, Chandor developed the idea for All Is Lost.

On February 9, 2012, Redford's casting was confirmed for All Is Lost as its only cast member. In addition to there being only one actor in the film, Redford also stated that the film has no dialogue, although there are a few spoken lines. For these reasons, the <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> was only 31 pages long.|$|E
