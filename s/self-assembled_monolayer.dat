50|$|An {{important}} issue in molecular electronics is {{the determination of}} the resistance of a single molecule (both theoretical and experimental). For example, Bumm, et al. used STM to analyze a single molecular switch in a <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayer</b> to determine how conductive such a molecule can be. Another problem faced by this field is the difficulty of performing direct characterization since imaging at the molecular scale is often difficult in many experimental devices.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{immobilization}} methods used is <b>Self-Assembled</b> <b>Monolayer</b> (SAM) on gold surface. Jenkins and collaborators 2001, used mercaptoethanol patches surrounded by SAM composed of octadecanethiol (ODT) to study the adsorption of egg-phosphatidylcholine on the ODT SAM. A pattern of ODT-mercaptoethanol was made onto a 50 nm gold film. The gold film was obtained through thermal evaporation on a LaSFN 9 glass. The lipid vesicles were deposited on the ODT SAM through adsorption, giving a final multilayer thickness greater than 80 Å.|$|E
50|$|Low {{surface energy}} {{coatings}} {{can also provide}} a superhydrophobic surface. A <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayer</b> (SAM) coating can provide such surfaces. To maintain a hydrophobic surface, the head groups bind closely to the surface, while the hydrophobic micelles stretch {{far away from the}} surface. By varying the amount of SAM you coat on a substrate, one could vary the degree of hydrophobicity. Particular superhydrophobic SAMs have a hydrophobic head group binding to the substrate. In one such work, 1-dodecanethiol (DT; CH3(CH2)11SH) is assembled on a Pt/ZnO/SiO2 composite substrate, producing contact angles of 170.3°. The monolayers could also be removed with a UV source, decreasing the hydrophobicity.|$|E

To this purpose, two diacetylene derivatives were synthesized:[*] the novel 14 -(9 H- 9 -carbazolyl) tetradeca- 10, 12 -diyn- 1 -yl disulfide (CDS 9) and the henicosa- 10, 12 -diyn- 1 -yl disulfide (DS 9). Both monomers were employed to prepare two-dimensional <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayers</b> (2 D-SAMs) by chemisorption on gold-sputtered platforms and three-dimensional <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayers</b> (3 D-SAMs) on gold nanoclusters by direct synthesis in organic solvent. The chemisorbed diacetylenes were then converted to the polymeric form by exposure to UV radiation, and their morphological and spectroscopic properties investigated by several techniques. From SERS data it was inferred that both monomers show the same behavior, in that the highly conjugated blue phase was observed in the 3 D-SAMs, while only the less extended red conformation {{was found in the}} corresponding 2 D-SAMs...|$|R
50|$|Discovery and {{validation}} of protein biomarkers are crucial for diseases diagnosis. Coupling of SPRM with MALDI-mass spectrometer (SUPRA-MS) enables the multiplex quantification of binding and molecular characterization {{on the basis}} of different masses. SUPRA-MS is used to detect, identify and characterize the potential breast cancer biomarker, LAG3 protein, introduced in the human plasma. Glass slides were taken to prepare gold chips via coating with thin layers of chromium and gold by sputtering process. Gold surface was functionalized using solution of 11-Mercapto-1-undecanol (11-MUOH) and 16-mercapto-1-hexadecanoic acid (16-MHA). This <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayer</b> was activated with sulfo-NHS and EDC. Pattern of sixteen droplets was deposited on the macroarray. Immunoglobin G antibodies were spotted against Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (α-LAG3) and rat serum albumin (α-RSA). After placing biochip in the SPRi and running buffer solution in the flow cell, α-LAG3 was injected. Special image station was used on the proteins that are attached. This station can also be placed on the MALDI. Before placing on the MALDI, captured proteins were reduced, digested and loaded with matrix in order to avoid contamination.|$|E
50|$|Significant nonspecific protein {{adsorption}} during implantation {{can cause}} adverse effects. However, some proteins can be beneficial in stabilizing the implant by reducing micro-motion and implant migration, {{as well as}} improving the signal quality through increased neuron connection; improving the long-term performance. Instead of relying on the native cells to secrete these proteins, they {{can be added to}} the surface of the material prior to implantation. The surface modification of biomaterials with proteins has been done with great success in various regions of the body. However since the anatomy of the brain is different from the rest of the body, the types of proteins that must be used in these applications vary from those used elsewhere. Proteins like laminin that promotes neuronal outgrowth and L1 that promotes axonal outgrowth have shown great promise in surface modification applications; L1 more so than laminin because of the decreased attachment associated with astrocytes - the cells responsible for glial scar formation. Proteins are typically added to the material surface via <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayer</b> (SAM) formation.|$|E
5000|$|Tantalum(V) oxide {{films have}} a variety of {{applications}} including as optical films with refractive indices as high as 2.039 and as a thin-film dielectric material in dynamic random access memory and semiconductor field-effect transistors. [...] The approach chosen for preparation of these materials is determined by the desired properties. Direct hydrolysis is appropriate when the presence of residual water or the use of high temperatures for drying is acceptable. Micropatterns can be produced by site-selective deposition using the hydrolysis approach by forming a <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayer</b> followed by high temperature annealling. [...] Chemical vapour deposition allows control of the thickness of the film on a nanometre scale, which is essential for some applications. Direct pyrolysis is convenient for optical applications, where transparent materials with low light loss due to absorption is important, and has also been used to prepare nitride read-only memory. [...] Electrochromism is the property of some materials to change color when charge is applied, and is the means by which so-called smart glass operates. Films produced by tantalum(V) ethoxide hydrolysis has been used to prepare amorphous tantalum(V) oxide films suitable for electrochromic applications.|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{modeling}} of <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayers</b> (SAMs) {{to assess the}} quality of SAM layers {{in terms of their}} leaky behavior. In the modeling, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and a conceptual and simplified resistance-resistance-capacitance (RRC) electrical model from an electrochemical setup were demonstrated. Based on the model, Matlab-based simulation was carried out to find out the suggestive low frequency measurement for analyzing the defective monolayers. Finally, the developed electrical model facilitated the interpretation of the EIS spectra measured in the range of 10  Hz to 100  kHz and provided the capacitance, resistance and thickness of the monolayer. Thus the proposed model could be considered as a powerful tool to characterize the defective SAMs, which was very specific to determine the resistive behavior of the <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayers</b> prepared for shorter adsorption time.

50|$|Local {{oxidation}} {{of silicon}} surfaces by noncontact atomic-force microscopy is an emerging and promising method for patterning surfaces at the nanometer scale {{due to its}} very precise control of the feature size. The features created with this technique {{can be used for}} the template growth and preferential deposition of different molecules like single molecule magnets, biomolecules and conjugated organic molecules.This method of nanopositioning is an important tool for the fabrication of new nanodevices based on the novel properties exhibited by some nanoparticles and molecules. Potential applications of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) such as Mn12 as bits for information storage or qubits for quantum computation require methods for nanoscale-controlled positioning and/or manipulation of those molecules. The patterning of the Mn12 molecules on a silicon surface is achieved by first derivatizing this surface with a <b>self-assembled</b> <b>monolayer</b> of APTES, which leaves it terminated by amino groups (-NH2). Such termination electrostatically repels the Mn12 molecules. Subsequently, a pattern of silicon dioxide is defined by LON. The SMM molecules are predominantly deposited on the oxide motives because of electrostatic attraction. The electrostatic attraction between the silicon oxide fabricated by LON and the Mn12 molecules achieves the preferential deposition of this molecules with a nanoscale accuracy.|$|E
