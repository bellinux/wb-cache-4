25|$|Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a {{textiles}} magnate, patented {{the modern}} form of fixed-spool <b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, {{the line was}} drawn off {{the leading edge of}} the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.|$|E

Just as with the <b>spinning</b> <b>reel,</b> the line is thrown from a fixed spool and can therefore be used with relatively light lures and baits. [...] However, the spincast reel eliminates the large wire bail and line roller of the <b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> in favor of one or two simple pickup pins and a metal cup to wind the line on the spool. [...] Traditionally mounted above the rod, the spincast reel is also fitted with an external nose cone that encloses and protects the fixed spool.|$|E

2500|$|The name of Holden Illingworth, a {{textiles}} magnate, {{was first}} {{associated with the}} modern form of fixed-spool <b>spinning</b> <b>reel.</b> [...] When casting the Illingworth reel, line was drawn off {{the leading edge of}} the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. [...] Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{spinning}} reels do {{not suffer}} from backlash, line can occasionally be trapped underneath {{itself on the}} spool or even detach from the reel in loose loops of line. [...] Some of these issues {{can be traced to}} overfilling the spool with line, while others are due {{to the way in which}} the line is wound onto the spool by the rotating bail or pickup. [...] Various oscillating spool mechanisms have been introduced over the years in an effort to solve this problem. [...] Spinning reels also tend to have more issues with twisting of the fishing line. [...] Line twist in spinning reels can occur from the spin of an attached lure, the action of the wire bail against the line when engaged by the crank handle, or even retrieval of line that is under load (<b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> users normally pump the rod up and down, then retrieve the slack line to avoid line twist and stress on internal components). [...] In order to minimize line twist, many anglers who use a <b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> manually reposition the bail after each cast with the pickup nearest the rod in order to minimize line twist.|$|E
2500|$|Fly reels are {{normally}} manual, single-action designs. Rotating {{a handle on}} the side of the reel rotates the spool which retrieves the line, usually at a 1:1 ratio (i.e., one complete revolution of the handle equals one revolution of the spool). [...] Fly reels are one of the simplest reels and have far fewer parts than a <b>spinning</b> <b>reel.</b> [...] The larger the fish the more important the reel becomes. [...] On the outside of the reel there are two levels of knobs these are the spool release and the drag adjustment.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948, the Mitchell Reel Company of Cluses, France {{introduced}} the Mitchell 300, a <b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> with {{a design that}} oriented {{the face of the}} fixed spool forward in a permanently fixed position below the fishing rod. [...] The Mitchell reel was soon offered in a range of sizes for all fresh and saltwater fishing. [...] A manual line pickup was used to retrieve the cast line, which eventually developed into a wire bail design that automatically recaptured the line upon cranking the retrieve handle. [...] An anti-reverse lever prevented the crank handle from rotating while a fish was pulling line from the spool. [...] With the use of light lines testing from two to six pounds, modern postwar spinning reels were capable of casting lures as light as , and sometimes lighter.|$|E
2500|$|Spinning reels, {{also called}} fixed spool reels, were {{in use in}} North America {{as early as the}} 1870s. [...] They were {{originally}} developed to allow the use of artificial flies, or other lures for trout or salmon, that were too light in weight to be easily cast by bait casting reels. [...] Fixed-spool or spinning reels are normally mounted below the rod; this positioning conforms to gravity, requiring no wrist strength to maintain the reel in position. [...] For right-handed persons, the spinning rod is held and cast by the strong right hand, leaving the left hand free to operate the crank handle mounted {{on the left side of}} the reel. [...] Invention of the fixed-spool or <b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> solved the problem of backlash, since the reel had no rotating spool capable of overrunning and fouling the line.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{fishing reels}} are {{suspended}} {{from the bottom of}} the rod, since this position requires no wrist strength to overcome gravity while enabling the angler to cast and retrieve without changing hands. [...] The baitcasting reel's unusual mounting position atop the rod is an accident of history. [...] Baitcasting reels were originally designed to be cast when positioned atop the rod, then rotated upside-down in order to operate the crank handle while playing a fish or retrieving line. [...] However, in practice most anglers preferred to keep the reel atop the rod for both cast and retrieve by simply transferring the rod to the left hand for the retrieve, then reverse-winding the crank handle. [...] Because of this preference, mounting the crank handle on the right side of a bait casting reel (with standard clockwise crank handle rotation) has become customary, though models with left-hand retrieve have gained in popularity in recent years thanks to user familiarity with the <b>spinning</b> <b>reel.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Underspin reels or Triggerspin <b>reels</b> are <b>spin</b> cast <b>reels</b> {{in which}} the reel is mounted {{underneath}} a standard spinning rod. [...] With the reel's weight suspended beneath the rod, underspin reels are generally more comfortable to cast and hold for long periods, {{and the ability to}} use all standard spinning rods greatly increases its versatility compared to traditional <b>spin</b> cast <b>reels.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Spool {{tension on}} most modern baitcasting reels can be {{adjusted}} with adjustable spool tension, a centrifugal brake, or a magnetic [...] "cast control." [...] This reduces spool overrun during a cast and the resultant line snare, known as backlash, colloquially called a [...] "bird's nest" [...] or [...] "birdie". This backlash {{is a result of}} the angular momentum of the spool and line which is not present with a fixed spool or <b>spinning</b> <b>reel.</b> [...] Each time a lure of a different weight is attached, the cast control must be adjusted for the difference in weight. [...] The bait casting reel design will operate well with a wide variety of fishing lines, ranging from braided multifilament and heat-fused [...] "superlines" [...] to copolymer, fluorocarbon, and nylon monofilaments (see Fishing line). [...] Most bait casting reels can also easily be palmed or thumbed to increase the drag, set the hook, or to accurately halt the lure at a given point in the cast.|$|E
2500|$|With a fixed spool, spincast reels can cast lighter lures than bait cast reels, {{although}} friction of {{the nose}} cone guide and spool cup against the uncoiling line reduces casting distance compared to spinning reels. [...] Spincast reel design {{requires the use of}} narrow spools with less line capacity than either baitcasting or spinning reels of equivalent size, and cannot be made significantly larger in diameter without making the reel too tall and unwieldy. [...] These limitations severely restrict the use of spin cast reels in situations such as fishing at depth, when casting long distances, or where fish can be expected to make long runs. [...] Like other types of reels, spin cast reels are frequently fitted with both anti-reverse mechanisms and friction drags, and some also have level-wind (oscillating spool) mechanisms. [...] Most spin cast reels operate best with limp monofilament lines, though at least one spin cast reel manufacturer installs a thermally fused [...] "superline" [...] into one of its models as standard equipment. During the 1950s and into the mid-1960s, they were widely used and very popular, though the <b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> has since eclipsed them in popularity in North America. [...] They remain a favorite fishing tool for catfish fishing and also for young beginners in general.|$|E
2500|$|Spinning rods {{are made}} from {{graphite}} or fiberglass with a cork or PVC foam handle, and tend to be between 5 and 8.5 feet (1.5‚Äì2.6 m) in length. Typically, spinning rods have anywhere from 5-8 guides arranged along {{the underside of the}} rod to help control the line. The eyes decrease in size from the handle to the tip, with the one nearest the handle usually much larger than the rest to allow less friction as the coiled line comes off the reel, and to gather the very large loops of line that come off the spinning reel's spool. Unlike bait casting and spin casting reels, the <b>spinning</b> <b>reel</b> hangs beneath the rod rather than sitting on top, and is held in place with a sliding or locking reel seat. The fisherman's second and third fingers straddle the [...] "leg" [...] of the reel where it is attached to the reel seat on the rod, and the weight of the reel hangs beneath the rod, which makes for a more comfortable way to fish for extended periods. This also allows the rod to be held in the fisherman's dominant hand (the handle on most modern spinning reels is reversible) which greatly increases control and nuance applied to the rod itself. Spinning rods and reels are widely used in fishing for popular North American sport fish including bass, trout, pike and walleye. Popular targets for spinning in the UK and European continent are pike, perch, eel and zander (walleye). Longer spinning rods with elongated grip handles for two-handed casting are frequently employed for saltwater or steelhead and salmon fishing. Spinning rods are also widely used for trolling and still fishing with live bait.|$|E
