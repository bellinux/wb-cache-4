5|$|Within an hour, White {{called his}} wife {{from a nearby}} diner; <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at a church and was {{with him as he}} turned himself in. Many left flowers on the steps of City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a {{spontaneous}} candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary's Cathedral. Two memorials were held for Milk; a small one at Temple Emanu-El and a more boisterous one at the Opera House.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the face-in-the-mirror scene, Endeavour includes another recognition of John Thaw. His daughter, Abigail, appears as the crossword editor for the Oxford Mail, whom Morse questions.

25|$|In December 2006, Newsweek {{reported}} that Hunter {{had been hired}} by the Edwards campaign to produce a series of webisodes that portrayed behind-the-scenes life on the campaign trail. Hunter had pitched {{the idea of creating}} the series to Edwards when <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at a bar in New York, where the politician was attending a business meeting. The campaign paid Hunter's production company, Midline Groove, over USD$100,000 for the short documentaries that were uploaded to YouTube upon completion. In 2006, Business Week included one of the episodes as a feature in a web video.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E
500|$|Before the Gettysburg Campaign, Pickett fell in {{love with}} a Virginia teenager, LaSalle [...] "Sallie" [...] Corbell (1843–1931), {{commuting}} back and forth from his duties in Suffolk to be with her. Although Sallie would later insist that <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in 1852 (at age 9), she did not marry the 38-year-old widower until November 13, 1863. The couple had two children, George Edward Pickett, Jr. (born July 17, 1864) and David Corbell Pickett (born 1865 or 1866). David died in late 1873 or January 1874 of measles.|$|E

500|$|Parker's {{personality}} and reputation often caused problems with business for Presley. Hal Wallis {{is reported to}} have said [...] "I'd rather try and close a deal with the devil" [...] than do any deal with Parker. Sam Katzman described Parker as [...] "the biggest con artist in the world". Gladys Presley took a strong dislike to Parker from the first time <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> saying [...] "That Colonel [...] [...] [...] he's the Devil himself". Although Presley privately described Parker to his friends as a [...] "lardass, bad tempered son of a bitch", he never publicly denounced Parker.|$|E
500|$|Later {{she drew}} a {{distinction}} between their methods, arguing that Quimby's involved one mind healing another, while hers depended on a connection with Divine Mind. In February 1883 Julius Dresser, a former patient of Quimby's, accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby's work as her own. In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853, nine years before <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> She wrote later: [...] "We caught some of his thoughts, and he caught some of ours; and both of us were pleased to say this to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{staff members}} {{have their own}} {{problems}} to deal with. Charlie has been offered immunity from the special prosecutors and Leo, among others, suggests he take it. Charlie, however, insists that he will [...] "stay with [...] team". Donna, who in the previous episode ("Ways and Means") went {{on a date with}} a Republican congressional aide involved in the investigation, comes clean with Josh. It turns out <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> not only once, but also on another occasion after she had found out what position he held, and Josh is not pleased. C.J. is provoked by an inexperienced lifestyle reporter, Sherri Wexler (Mara), trying to put her in a bad light and responds by embarrassing her in front of a full press room.|$|E

500|$|Washington {{also claimed}} that American University cut off {{contact with him}} after he punched Tomjanovich. However, {{this appears to be}} a {{misrepresentation}} of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: [...] "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant." [...] John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight. Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in college: ...|$|E
500|$|Fortunately for Northrup – {{as it was}} {{the peak}} of the McCarthyite [...] "Red Scare" [...] – Hubbard's {{allegations}} were apparently ignored by the FBI, which filed his letter but took no further action. In June 1951, she finally secured the return of Alexis by agreeing to cancel her receivership action and divorce suit in California in return for a divorce [...] "guaranteed by L. Ron Hubbard". <b>She</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Wichita to resolve the situation. He told her that she was [...] "in a state of complete madness" [...] due to being dictated to and hypnotized by Hollister and his [...] "communist cell". Playing along, she told Hubbard that he was right and that the only way she could break free of their power was by going through with the divorce. He replied, [...] "You know, I'm a public figure and you're nobody, so if {{you have to go through}} the divorce, I'll accuse you of desertion so it won't look so bad on my public record." [...] She agreed to sign a statement, written by Hubbard himself, that retracted the allegations that she had made against him: ...|$|E
500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. <b>She</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E

Tamerlan was known to cheat on Russell, and a friend of Russell's told her mother that the relationship was abusive.

They lived at 21 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London, which now bears a blue plaque.|$|E
2500|$|The Master {{showed a}} {{dramatic}} personality change upon regenerating into the Mistress/Missy.

("Deep Breath, Death in Heaven") When <b>she</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> again, Missy pretended to be an android and kissed him passionately. ("Dark Water") Despite still being manic and a psychopath, she later showed a willingness to reform, spending centuries in the Doctor's custody as a show of her commitment. Later, she felt torn between the Doctor, who represented her repentance, and her past incarnation, who represented a return to her old ways; she ultimately chose the Doctor, for which her past incarnation killed her in disgust ("The Doctor Falls").|$|E
