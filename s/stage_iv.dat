5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one, once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it.

A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in <b>stage</b> <b>IV</b> encephalopathy, when cerebral oedema may be visible. Other neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are not currently regarded as useful, although they may show abnormalities. Electroencephalography shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0, even if minimal HE is present; in stages I, II and III there are triphasic waves over the frontal lobes that oscillate at 5Hz, and in <b>stage</b> <b>IV</b> there is slow delta wave activity. However, the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing hepatic encephalopathy from other conditions.|$|E
5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially <b>Stage</b> <b>IV</b> cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease.

She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (<b>Stage</b> <b>IV)</b> which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain. Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry {{in front of all}} their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later.

40|$|Nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) {{is predominantly}} of the undifferentiated histological subtype. Histological differentiation is of limited prognostic significance in NPC. Recent {{studies have suggested}} that downregulation of the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex may {{play a crucial role in}} the initial stage of cancer invasion and metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis in human cancers. Expression of E-cadherin has not been reported previously in NPC, and its prognostic value in NPC is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression pattern of E-cadherin and its associated partner, β-catenin, in NPC and their possible applications as prognostic markers to predict the clinical outcome of NPC. Expression of the E-cadherin and β-catenin was examined by immunohistochemical methods in 74 cases of primary NPC and 17 of their corresponding lymph node metastases. Normal nasopharyngeal epithelium showed strong and homogeneous immunocytochemical staining of E-cadherin and β-catenin at the cell membranes and intercellular junctions. In contrast, primary NPC showed variable and heterogeneous staining patterns of E-cadherin and β-catenin. Loss of membranous E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with advanced stages of diseases (P <. 001). Eighty percent to ninety percent of NPC in <b>stages</b> <b>IV</b> and V (Ho's staging), respectively, showed a reduced (< 35 %) membranous staining of E- cadherin compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelium. Expression of β- catenin also was downregulated in advanced NPC. Ninety percent to one hundred percent of NPC in <b>stages</b> <b>IV</b> and V (Ho's staging) expressed a reduction (< 35 %) of immunocytochemical staining of β-catenin. The expression pattern of β- catenin staining was strongly associated with the expression of E-cadherin (P <. 001). Unlike E-cadherin, nuclear staining of β-catenin expression was observed in some of the primary NPC and lymph node metastasis. Reduced expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin expression was associated with a shorter survival of NPC patients (P <. 001). In advanced NPC patients (<b>stages</b> <b>IV</b> and V), a significant difference in survival was observed in tumors with higher or lower levels of E-cadherin expression (P =. 0224, log-rank test). These observations suggests that expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin may have prognostic values in NPC patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In <b>stage</b> <b>IV</b> disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and compacts, forming a creamy-white egg mass. Each egg mass may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a single cell to a veliger (a larval form common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae can be assigned to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are Stage III, and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are <b>Stage</b> <b>IV.</b> L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E

40|$|Single point {{mutations}} of ras oncogenes {{are found}} in many tumors {{and contribute to the}} pathogenesis of the cancer. The product of the ras gene, p 21 protein, was found expressed in several neuroblastoma tissues. However, the role of ras gene in this tumor has yet to be clarified. To contribute {{to the understanding of the}} ras activation, 79 fresh biopsies of neuroblastoma were studied to investigate the possibility that ras would be activated by point mutation. Analysis of H-ras and N-ras was performed by means of PCR and SSO, while K-ras mutations were detected by multiplex-ASPCR. None of the neuroblastomas examined showed H- or K-ras activation, while N-ras mutations were demonstrated in only three patients (3, 7 %). N-myc oncogene is amplified in a substantial number of patients with neuroblastoma. N-myc amplification was studied by Southern blot technique. N-myc amplification was demonstrated in 13. 2 % of patients less than 1 year of age at diagnosis and 23 % of older children. Two of the patients (one stage I and one <b>stage</b> <b>IVs)</b> with N-ras mutation and without N-myc amplification had a good outcome, while the third (<b>stage</b> <b>IVs)</b> with N-myc amplification had a poor prognosis. These results suggest that ras activation is a rare event in both amplified and non-amplified neuroblastoma tumors and that N-ras activation was not involved in the clinical outcome of these patients. Moreover, our data suggest that p 21 expression is induced by a post-transcriptional activation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} was to characterize vitellogenin expression in the ovary and hepatopancreas, and to describe the morphometry and ultrastructure of oocytes, in the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum at various stages of ovarian development. Five ovarian stages were defined: (I) immature, (II) maturing, (III) mature, (IV) spawned, and (V) reorganized. Ovaries and hepatopancreas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for vitellogenin expression. Vitellogenin expression in both ovary and hepatopancreas was predominantly widespread, beginning at Stage I, peaking at Stage III, and decreasing in <b>Stages</b> <b>IV</b> and V. Characterization of the ovary included measurement of the following germ cell types: oogonia (OG), and previtellogenic (PV), early vitellogenesis (EV), advanced vitellogenesis (AV), and mature (M) oocytes. Mean ± SD diameter of OG and EV oocytes in Stages I (14. 2 ± 5. 5 and 119. 8 ± 15. 7 μm) and II (17. 9 ± 4. 8 and 114. 3 ± 34. 6 μm), respectively, were significantly different from that in <b>Stages</b> <b>IV</b> (16. 6 ± 4. 7 and 107. 0 ± 24. 6 μm) and V (14. 4 ± 4. 1 and 101. 0 ± 25. 2 μm).
