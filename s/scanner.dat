40|$|Abstract — Laser <b>scanners</b> {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of MEMS research for more than three decades. During the last decade, miniaturized projection displays and various medical-imaging applications became the main driver for progress in MEMS laser <b>scanners.</b> Portable and truly miniaturized projectors became possible with the availability of red, green, and blue diode lasers during the past few years. Inherent traits of the laser scanning technology, such as the very large color gamut, scalability to higher resolutions within the same footprint, and capability of producing an always-in-focus image render it a very viable competitor in mobile projection. Here, we review the requirements on MEMS laser <b>scanners</b> for the demanding display applications, performance levels of the best <b>scanners</b> in the published literature, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and mechanically coupled actuation principles. Resonant high-frequency <b>scanners,</b> low-frequency linear <b>scanners,</b> and 2 -D <b>scanners</b> are included in this review.

5|$|From launch until 1974, Landsat 1 {{transmitted}} over 100,000 images, which covered {{more than}} 75% of the Earth's surface. The {{majority of these}} images were taken with the multispectral <b>scanner.</b> On 05 August 1972 the return beam vidicon failed after taking only 1690 images.|$|E
5|$|In 2002–2003 Galileo {{spacecraft}} had two {{passes through}} the gossamer rings. During them its dust counter detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5μm. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft's star <b>scanner</b> detected small, discrete bodies (< 1 km) near Amalthea. These may represent collisional debris generated from impacts with this satellite.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to CAP's own corporate fleet, many member-owned aircraft are {{made available for}} official tasking by CAP's volunteers should the need arise. Aircraft on search missions are generally crewed by at least three qualified aircrew members: a Mission Pilot, responsible for the safe flying of the aircraft; a Mission Observer, responsible for navigation, communications and coordination of the mission as well as ground observation; and a Mission <b>Scanner</b> {{who is responsible for}} looking for crash sites and damage clues. Additionally, the mission <b>scanner</b> may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage. Because of the additional ARCHER equipment, the crew of a Civil Air Patrol GA8 Airvan may also include an operator of the ARCHER system, depending upon the requirements of the mission and the capabilities of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|... 3D <b>scanners</b> {{capture the}} {{geometry}} of an objects and produce a three-dimensional digital model. Artec’s 3D <b>scanners</b> are structured light <b>scanners.</b> They operate by projecting light in a pattern, usually {{in the form of}} multiple parallel beams, onto an object. By projecting a grid pattern on the object, the <b>scanners</b> are able to capture the deformation or distortion from multiple angles and then calculate the distance to specific points on the object using triangulation. The three-dimensional coordinates obtained are used to digitally reconstruction the real-world object. Light <b>scanners</b> can utilize either blue light or white light, which is what Artec’s <b>scanners</b> use. The choice of light does not impact the processes or concepts behind the technology.|$|R
30|$|Digital {{models are}} {{produced}} by digitizing the oral structures, either directly or indirectly, with intra- or extraoral <b>scanners,</b> respectively. Three types of <b>scanners</b> are typically used: mechanical <b>scanners</b> with a touch-probe, laser <b>scanners,</b> or white light <b>scanners</b> [5, 6]. Because light <b>scanners</b> work without touching the areas of interest, they are preferred over the touch-probe <b>scanners</b> [5]. There are four types of imaging technologies employed: triangulation, parallel confocal, accordion fringe interferometry, and 3 D in motion video [7]. To gather surface data points, the light (laser or white) is projected from the source onto an object and either reflected back to a sensor or to an absorbing source. While a high-resolution image is an important requisite for accurately measuring dimensions, the mathematical models and algorithms used to reconstruct the model and produce the 3 D images also {{play an important role}} [8, 9].|$|R

5|$|The MSS was {{manufactured}} by Hughes Aircraft Company.

40|$|To {{assess whether}} {{absolute}} mass scores are comparable or differ between identical 64 -slice MDCT <b>scanners</b> {{of the same}} manufacturer and to compare absolute mass scores to the physical mass and between scan modes using a calcified phantom. A non-moving anthropomorphic phantom with nine calcifications of three sizes and three densities was scanned 30 times on three 64 -slice MDCT <b>scanners</b> of manufacturer A and on three 64 -slice MDCT <b>scanners</b> of manufacturer B in both sequential and spiral scan mode. The mean mass scores and mass score variabilities of seven calcifications were determined for all scanners; two non-detectable calcifications were omitted. It was analyzed whether identical <b>scanners</b> yielded similar or significantly different mass scores. Furthermore mass scores were compared to the physical mass and mass scores were compared between scan modes. The mass score calibration factor was determined for all <b>scanners.</b> Mass scores obtained on identical <b>scanners</b> were similar for almost all calcifications. Overall, mass score differences between the <b>scanners</b> were small ranging from 1. 5 to 3. 4 % for the total mass scores, and most differences between <b>scanners</b> were observed for high density calcifications. Mass scores were {{significantly different from the}} physical mass for almost all calcifications and all <b>scanners.</b> In sequential mode the total physical mass (167. 8  mg) was significantly overestimated (+ 2. 3 %) for 4 out of 6 <b>scanners.</b> In spiral mode a significant overestimation (+ 2. 5 %) was found for system B and a significant underestimation (− 1. 8 %) for two <b>scanners</b> of system A. Mass scores were dependent on the scan mode, for manufacturer A scores were higher in sequential mode and for manufacturer B in spiral mode. For system A using spiral scan mode no differences were found between identical <b>scanners,</b> whereas a few differences were found using sequential mode. For system B the scan mode did not affect the number of different mass scores between identical <b>scanners.</b> Mass scores obtained in the same scan mode are comparable between identical 64 -slice CT <b>scanners</b> and identical 64 -slice CT <b>scanners</b> on different sites can be used in follow-up studies. Furthermore, for all systems {{significant differences were found between}} mass scores and the physical calcium mass; however, the differences were relatively small and consistent...|$|R
50|$|<b>Scanners</b> were Line <b>Scanners</b> (LSC), Universal Trunk <b>Scanners</b> (USC), Junctor <b>Scanners</b> (JSC) and Master <b>Scanners</b> (MS). The {{first three}} only scanned for supervision, while Master <b>Scanners</b> did all other scan jobs. For example, a DTMF Receiver, mounted in a Miscellaneous Trunk frame, had eight demand scan points, {{one for each}} frequency, and two {{supervisory}} scan points, one to signal {{the presence of a}} valid DTMF combination so the software knew when to look at the frequency scan points, and the other to supervise the loop. The supervisory scan point also detected Dial Pulses, with software counting the pulses as they arrived. Each digit when it became valid was stored in a software hopper to be given to the Originating Register.|$|R
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral <b>Scanner</b> (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E
