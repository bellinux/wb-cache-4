50|$|In MacPherson's {{original}} design, an {{anti-roll bar}} also acted as the radius rod. This requires {{the bar to}} be attached through a ball joint, so as to also provide longitudinal control. In most contemporary designs, still commonly termed MacPherson struts, the radius rod and anti-roll bar are now separate, with the anti-roll bar mounted in a <b>sliding</b> <b>bush.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Model 39 used a {{conventional}} <b>slide,</b> barrel <b>bushing,</b> <b>slide</b> arrangement {{as opposed to}} the exposed barrel arrangement of the P38. Model 39 locking is done by a modification of the Browning P35 (High Power) cam-locked breech. First generation Model 39 slides used either a long, spring steel extractor or a spring-loaded, pivoting claw extractor. Long extractors tended to be fragile and were replaced by the pivoting type. However, the long extractor proved to be more reliable than the pivoting version.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} usable properties of surface layers improvement of cast carbon steel 200 – 450, by put directly in foundingprocess a composite surface layer {{on the basis of}} Fe-Cr-C alloy. Technology of composite surface layer guarantee mainly increase inhardness and aberasive wear resistance of cast steel castings on machine elements. This technology can be competition for generallyapplied welding technology (surfacing by welding and thermal spraying). In range of studies was made cast steel test castings withcomposite surface layer, which usability for industrial applications was estimated by criterion of hardness and aberasive wear resistance of type metal-mineral and quality of joint cast steel – (Fe-Cr-C). Based on conducted studies a thesis, that composite surface layer arise from liquid state, was formulated. Moreover, possible is control of composite layer thickness and its hardness by suitable selection of parameters i. e. thickness of insert, pouring temperature and solidification modulus of casting. Possibility of technology application of composite surface layer in manufacture of cast steel <b>slide</b> <b>bush</b> for combined cutter loader is presented...|$|R

Shoulder bushing installed in duct so shoulder rests on inside surface of duct. Bolt <b>slides</b> in <b>bushing</b> in duct wall between more open and less open positions. No relative motion or wear between bolt and slot panel. Prevents bushing from being dislodged by stop forces and provides stiffer stopping surface than sleeve bushing bonded in duct wall...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The high {{temperature}} self-lubrication Ni-Cr-W matrix composites were prepared by powder metallurgy and sintered by {{hot isostatic pressing}} (HIP). Atomized Ni-Cr-W powder was mixed with friction components of MoS 2 and Graphite. The mixed powders were cold pressed 450 MPa and sintered at 1100 ℃~ 1200 ℃ {{in the presence of}} argon atmosphere for 1 hour under 180 MPa hot isostatic pressing with respect to their application in <b>slide</b> bearing <b>bushing.</b> The tribological properties are investigated on UMT- 2 tester in ball-on-disc against alloy steel ball. The results showed that the appropriate addition of MoS 2 show excellent antifriction and wear resistance. And the friction coefficients and wear rates decrease over the wide temperature range of 25 ℃ ~ 600 ℃ compared that of the composites by pressureless sintered method. The results indicated tha...|$|R
40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{composites}} {{have been}} extensively studied {{because of the}} excellent tribological behavior among plastics. However, laboratory specimens and tests are generally discussed, whereas application studies on industrial components are infrequent. In this paper, an injection molded bush made of tribological PEEK was analyzed to correlate wear behavior and molded material structure. Bushes were tested under unlubricated sliding conditions {{by means of a}} short wear test. Surface analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical microscopy were used to evaluate the distribution of the different composite fillers (polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE, graphite particles and carbon microfibers) and their effect on the final bush behavior. A significant lack of homogeneity was observed in the molded bush and black bands appeared on the shaft surface after testing due to the <b>sliding.</b> The <b>bush</b> geometry and the injection molding process should be optimized to allow the best tribological behavior of the molded material under working conditions...|$|R
50|$|H.F.S. Morgan's 1909 Runabout used sliding pillar suspension, an {{independent}} front suspension system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide {{up and down a}} fixed pillar that also acts as the kingpin and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tire and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, <b>sliding</b> through a <b>bush</b> on the axle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{our recent}} work, {{in order to}} realize joint element in {{lightweight}} and compact joints for tall humanoid robots, a new joint element was designed. It consists of a harmonic drive gearing device, a multi axis mechanism and a resin bush. The resin <b>bush</b> <b>slides</b> on a titanium crankshaft of the pole shape while the joint works. However, the bush was stuck, and stopped movement of the joint. In our present work, we observed the bush surfaces against two materials; the titanium and the 7075 aluminum alloy have been used.

Mary Mitchell Slessor (1848 - 1915) chose {{to open up}} the {{territory}} of the Okoyong tribe as part of her mission work. In an often-retold episode, Mary Slessor was given a canoe and paddlers by King Eyo of Creek Town in 1888, despite being warned of the dangers of the area and likely hostility from its occupants. However, Mary Slessor managed to set up her base in Okoyong (in the town of Arochukwu) and gain the trust and respect of local people through her missionary work. This slide comes from a set on mission, culture and industry in Calabar, southeast Nigeria generated by the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church of Scotland (which was incorporated with the Church of Scotland in 1929. ...|$|R
