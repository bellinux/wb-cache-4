40|$|The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) is {{dedicated}} to the principle that accidents are preventable and strives to provide a safe work environment for employees, subcontractors, and visitors. Management is committed to the belief that effective safety and operational objectives go hand-in-hand. At a minimum, SLAC expects subcontractors to comply with applicable health and safety regulations as described in this program. SLAC reserves the right to review subcontractors ’ written safety programs upon request. To ensure that subcontracted services are completed in compliance with California Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) standards and Department of Energy (DOE) health and safety requirements, such work at SLAC will be managed according to established and approved procedures. Environment, safety, and health (ES&H) considerations must be integral to the planning and execution of <b>subcontracted</b> <b>service</b> work at SLAC. <b>Subcontracted</b> <b>service</b> personnel at all tiers must be fully aware of their legal and contractual responsibility to prevent occupational accidents and injuries. 1. 1 Hazards/Impacts Incidents could occur involving <b>subcontracted</b> <b>service</b> personnel and others if work is not well planned i...|$|E
40|$|Current {{service order}} {{handling}} systems in telecommunications industry have {{problems such as}} user-unfriendliness, long service waiting time, uneasy customization of services, limited capability of in-house services, and inefficient human resources allocation. Consequently, the current solutions for the ordering process cannot be used to meet the business needs of service providers. To solve this problem, a generic service order handling model is suggested. Based on the TINA-C information modeling and computation modeling concepts, service order handling information object types and interfaces were defined. The three ordering interfaces studied in this model are: service negotiation, service ordering and order tracking for the main service provider and <b>subcontracted</b> <b>service</b> provider. To support the transfer of ordering information, the Store-and-Forward Paradigm is proposed. This Store-and-Forward paradigm {{is based on the}} use of e-mail (e. g., X. 400) to transport non-realtime information...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relative}} importance of price and trust and their interaction in subcontractor selection.

The conjoint analysis is based on a sample of medium-sized contractors from the Dutch residential building industry. Findings: The research shows that neither price nor trust can be downplayed as procurement mechanisms. On the one hand, through repeated relationships main contractors become more confident in judging the performance of subcontractors. The level of trust increases and finally affects the supplier selection. On the other hand, favourable quotes are a prerequisite for trust to become choice relevant. Moreover, the extent to which subcontractors have performed with respect to quality, technical know-how and cooperation in the past finally accounts for whether they are chosen or not. Research limitations/implications: The joint occurrence of price and trust as procurement mechanisms should be acknowledged. More research is needed to understand the trade-offs main contractors make between price and trust while procuring <b>subcontracted</b> <b>services.</b> Practical implications: Subcontractors need to offer competitive bids to be able to increase their chance of recurrent relationships with main contractors and thus trust development.

50|$|As part {{of their}} efforts to {{demonstrate}} ethical practices, many large companies and global brands are integrating codes of conduct and guidelines into their corporate cultures and management systems. Through these, corporations are making demands on their suppliers (facilities, farms, <b>subcontracted</b> <b>services</b> such as cleaning, canteen, security etc.) and verifying, through social audits, that they are complying with the required standard. A lack of transparency in the supply chain is known as mystification, which bars consumers from the knowledge of where their purchases originated and can enable socially irresponsible practices. Supply Chain Managers are under constant scrutiny to secure the best pricing for their resources, which becomes a difficult task {{when faced with the}} inherent lack of transparency. Cost Benchmarking is one effective method for identifying competitive pricing within the industry. This gives negotiators a solid basis to form their strategy on and drive overall spend down.|$|R

This article looks into the quasi-employment arrangements of student interns, who occupy an ambiguous space between being a student and being a worker at the point of production. Some employers recruit interns on their own, while others secure a supply of student labor through coordinated support of provincial and lower-level governments that prioritize investments, as well as through <b>subcontracting</b> <b>services</b> of private labor agencies. The incorporation of teachers into corporate management can strengthen control over students during their internships. While interns are required to do the same work as other employees, their unpaid or underpaid working experiences testify that intern labor is devalued. Exposés of abuses, such as using child labor in the guise of interns, have pressured the Chinese state and companies to eventually take remedial action. Reclaiming student workers’ educational and labor rights in the growing intern economy, however, remains contested. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R

40|$|An {{intermodal}} container transportation network {{is being developed}} between Rotterdam and several inland terminals in North West Europe: the EUROPEAN GATEWAY SERVICES (EGS) network. This network is developed and operated by the seaports of EUROPE CONTAINER TERMINALS (ECT). To use this network cost-efficiently, a centralized planning of the container transportation is required, to be operated by the seaport. In this paper, a new mathematical model is proposed for the service network design. The model uses {{a combination of a}} path-based formulation and a minimum flow network formulation. It introduces two new features to the intermodal network-planning problem. Firstly, overdue deliveries are penalized instead of prohibited. Secondly, the model combines self-operated and <b>subcontracted</b> <b>services.</b> The service network design considers the network-planning problem at a tactical level: the optimal service schedule between the given network terminals is determined. The model considers self-operated or subcontracted barge and rail services as well as transport by truck. The model is used for the service network design of the EGS network. For this case, the benefit of using container transportation with multiple legs and intermediate transfers is studied. Also, a preliminary test of the influence of the new aspects of the model is done. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed model is suitable for the service network design in modern {{intermodal container}} transport networks. Also, the results suggest that a combined business model for the network transport and terminals is worth investigating further, as the transit costs can be reduced with lower transfer costs...|$|R

30|$|Entrepreneurial would-be German {{capacity}} suppliers {{see this}} situation {{as an opportunity}} to gain home market business. Such firms are typically not members of their local Employer Association and, as a result, are not bound to pay the collectively bargained wages or abide by other collectively agreed upon conditions that employer association member firms negotiate with trade unions. These firms hire older skilled workers who have been made redundant in their customer firm operations. They then supplement these workers with immigrant labor that they are able to draw on from eastern and southern Europe. One supplier we visited, for example, had a robust mixture of Italian, Greek, Polish and Ukranian personnel. The immigrant mix can vary; the point is that these firms offer German customers reliable local capacity <b>subcontracting</b> <b>service</b> without any of the distance induced unpredictability and cost of CEE rivals. Interestingly, this shift in home country production location needs and CEE supplier competitiveness is leading to a revival of traditional German capacity sub-contracting regions, such as the Schwaebische Alb, (e.g. Albstadt), or the traditional small producer metalworking areas south and east of the Ruhr (Bergisches Land, Sauerland, Siegerland). Though these regions have long traditions in capacity outsourcing (Herrigel 1995), the new emerging suppliers there constitute new terrain in the contemporary German manufacturing landscape.|$|R
