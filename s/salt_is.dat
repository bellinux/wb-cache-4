5|$|In Wicca, <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> {{symbolic}} of the element Earth. It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies. A dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar, and <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> used {{in a wide variety}} of rituals and ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. <b>Salt</b> <b>is</b> believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>is</b> {{essential}} {{for life in}} general, and saltiness {{is one of the}} basic human tastes. Animals tissue contain larger quantities of salt than plant tissues do. <b>Salt</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the oldest and}} most ubiquitous food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{solar salt}} and block <b>salt</b> <b>were</b> {{coarse-grained}} {{when they left}} the reservation.

5|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>is</b> {{processed}} {{from salt}} mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> present in many processed foods.|$|E

5000|$|Related to the Tutton's <b>salts</b> <b>are</b> the alums, which <b>are</b> also double <b>salts</b> {{but with}} the formula MM'(SO4)2(H2O)12. The Tutton's <b>salts</b> <b>were</b> once termed [...] "false alums".|$|R
5|$|BZP is a {{piperazine}} derivative {{which comes}} as either the hydrochloride salt or a free base. The hydrochloride <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> a white solid while the base form is a slightly yellowish-green liquid. BZP base is corrosive and causes burns.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E
5|$|In many East Asian cultures, <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment.

5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} {{in the lake}} and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish. More <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> added yearly via rivers and streams, though the amount is {{much less than the}} relict salt from Bonneville.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{sources of}} dietary iodine include seafood, such as fish, {{seaweeds}} (such as kelp) and shellfish, dairy products and eggs {{so long as}} the animals received enough iodine, and plants grown on iodine-rich soil.

5|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>is</b> mostly sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} {{with the}} formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>is</b> {{present in}} most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> used {{in the preparation of}} butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> converted to soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of}} the act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized <b>salt</b> <b>is</b> added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E
50|$|In 1899, it was {{estimated}} that around 82 million pounds of <b>salt</b> <b>were</b> used in the United States specifically for dairy purposes. At that time, this amount of <b>salt</b> <b>was</b> valued at US $800,000.|$|R
50|$|Important {{place in}} Pskov export to the Hanse was salo (cured slabs of fatback). A {{dedicated}} quality control facility was organized in Dorpat {{to test the}} imported salo from Pskov. One {{of the most valuable}} imported commodities for Pskovians <b>was</b> <b>salt.</b> The importance of salt during the Middle Ages times was caused by its wide range of application. <b>Salt</b> <b>was</b> used as not only in food preservation but also in leather curing. <b>Salt</b> <b>was</b> produced in high quantities only in a few remote regions.
