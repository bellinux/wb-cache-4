The objective {{of this paper is}} to propose a new tailings disposal procedure for the deep <b>sea</b> <b>mining</b> industry. Through comparisons of the tailings disposal methods which exist in on-land mining and the coastal mining fields, a new tailings disposal procedure, i. e., the submarine–backfill–dam–reuse (SBDR) tailings disposal procedure, is proposed. It combines deep sea submarine tailings disposal, backfill disposal, tailings dam disposal, and tailings reuse disposal for the deep <b>sea</b> <b>mining</b> industry. Then, the analytic network process (ANP) method is utilized to evaluate the performances of different tailings disposal methods. The evaluation results of the ANP show that the new proposed tailings disposal procedure is the most suitable for the deep <b>sea</b> <b>mining</b> industr...|$|R

There {{have been three}} times more attacks to naval ships using <b>sea</b> <b>mines</b> than all other forms combined. <b>Sea</b> <b>mines</b> have always been viewed upon as underhanded and unchivalrous, yet they provide a weaker navy the capability to stall and damage a vastly superior navy. Utilizing unmanned sensors to detect <b>sea</b> <b>mines</b> {{is the goal of}} the navy for the future. Computer-aided detection (CAD) of <b>sea</b> <b>mines</b> is much faster and more consistent than a human operator, yet it is not currently being utilized by any of our mine countermeasure assets. Although there are many studies that have incorporated computer aided detection and classification algorithms with sonar imagery for mine warfare, few have used Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). During an amphibious assault scenario the ability to land assets quickly and mitigate risk is vital to the success. This thesis analyzes Rapid Overt Aerial Reconnaissance data from an Office of Naval Research experiment by Fort Walton Beach, FL. The CAD algorithm that was developed consistently detects <b>sea</b> <b>mines</b> in LIDAR data while having a manageable false alarm rate. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
