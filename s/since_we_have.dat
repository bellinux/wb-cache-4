25|$|Even {{the name}} Gentius or Genthius {{does not help}} {{to solve the problem}} <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> two Illyrian forms Genthius and Zanatis. If Gentius or Genthius derives from *ǵen- (be born) this is proof of a Centum language, but if the name Zanatis is {{similarly}} generated (or from *ǵen- know) than we have a Satem language. Another problem related to the name Gentius is that nowadays it cannot be stated surely if the initial /g/ of the sources was a palatovelar or a labiovelar.|$|E

25|$|After their Defeat the Rebels {{retired to}} the Isle aux Noix, where they {{continued}} till lately, sending out some Parties, and many Emissaries, to debauch the Minds of the Canadians and Indians, {{in which they}} have proved too successful, and for which they were too well prepared by the Cabals and Intrigues of these two last years; We knew of their being reinforced, and very considerably, I suppose, as they appeared in Numbers near St. John's last Sunday Evening; where or when they landed, or the Particulars <b>since,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> but very imperfect Accounts of, all Communications with the Forts of St. John's and Chambli, being, as far as I can find, entirely cut off.|$|E

This {{is an issue that}} we've been following very closely <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been made aware of these allegations, and we are aware of the allegations. Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
500|$|The party turned {{for home}} on 27 January, picking up Spencer-Smith on 29th. He was by now {{physically}} helpless {{and had to}} be loaded on to the sledge. Mackintosh was soon unable to pull, and could only stagger along beside the sledge; by this time the de facto leadership of the group had passed to Joyce and Richards. Joyce described the group's plight: [...] "I have never known such shocking conditions. This is one of the hardest pulls <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> trekked...all we can do is to slog on with the greatest possible speed." ...|$|E

500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone {{looked at me like}} I was nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E
500|$|For this, in August 1996, {{while still}} mixing the film's soundtrack, Madonna hired remixers Pablo Flores and Javier Garza. According to Flores, the singer wanted {{something}} that [...] "would be dance but {{faithful to the}} movie and to Argentina with a latin feel". Madonna herself said she wanted the remix to have a [...] "Latin flavor and elements of Tango music". The mix was completed in two weeks at Miami and Los Angeles. Madonna had to re-record the vocals of the track in English and Spanish, while an Argentinean bandoneon {{was added to the}} song's intro. Named the [...] "Miami Mix", it was sent to radio stations and DJs on late December 1996 and was officially released as the soundtrack's second single on 4 February 1997. Barney Kilpatrick, VP of promotion for Warner Bros. Records, said that [...] "the only reason this mix is being done was to accommodate Top 40 radio [...] <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a two-disc soundtrack, we're interested in selling albums, not singles". Warner Bros wanted to create buzz for the film with the song, not the single remix. There were also talks of releasing an Evita EP, containing remixes of [...] "Buenos Aires", [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] and [...] "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", but it never materialized.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{returned}} to the Mill Rats for the 2014–15 season on September 17, 2014. Ian McCarthy described him as the team's [...] "franchise player <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been in existence." [...] The Mill Rats also replaced Spon with head coach Julian King. In his season opener, Anderson scored 21 points and recorded seven assists to push Saint John past the Miracles on November 1, 2014. In his next game vs. the Storm on November 6, he notched 19 points and 10 rebounds and followed up with another double-double against the same team, with 14 points and 14 assists. On November 21, 2014, Anderson dropped 31 points on the A's and topped that performance with 34 points against the Storm in his following appearance. However, the two contests resulted in defeats. He was a candidate to earn Player of the Week honors, but the award went to Brandon Robinson instead. On November 30, he scored a season-high 39 points in a loss to the Storm. Anderson had 31 points and seven assists in his next game vs. the Rainmen. He scored 30 or more points in {{just one of the}} remaining 16 regular season games, and the Mill Rats exited the playoffs after losing in the first round to the Storm, 2–3, in the best-of-five series.|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{suggested}} that Andrew Cuomo's primary {{run in the}} 2010 gubernatorial election against incumbent David Paterson, {{who was the first}} African-American governor of New York, would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising 2002 gubernatorial primary contest against Carl McCall, at the time the highest-ranking African-American and first major party candidate for governor in the state. Rangel had been a staunch supporter of McCall against Cuomo in 2002, even going as far as saying that he would not necessarily endorse Cuomo had he emerged as the Democratic nominee for governor. For the upcoming 2010 gubernatorial race, Rangel {{suggested that}} for the white Cuomo to challenge the African-American incumbent would not be [...] "the moral decision". [...] Rangel also said, [...] "There might be an inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> most African-Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion." [...] Paterson fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election. [...] By this point, Rangel's continuing difficulties, together with the death a few months prior of Percy Sutton and the failure of Paterson (Basil Paterson's son), marked the end of the era of Harlem's [...] "Gang of Four".|$|E
