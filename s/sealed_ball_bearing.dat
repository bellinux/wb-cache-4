40|$|An elbow or {{knee joint}} for a hard space suit or similar usage is formed of three {{serially}} connected rigid sections which have truncated spherical configurations. The ends of each section form solid geometric angles, and the sections are interconnected by hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> The outer two sections are fixed together for rotation {{in a direction}} opposite to rotation of the center section. A preferred means to make the outer sections track each other in rotation comprises a rotatable continuous bead chain which engages sockets circumferentially spaced on the facing sides of the outer races of the bearings. The joint has a single pivot point and the bearing axes are always contained in a single plane for any articulation of the joint. Thus flexure of the joint simulates the coplanar flexure of the knee or elbow and is not susceptible to lockup...|$|R

40|$|Since the origin, the use {{of liquid}} oxygen as {{oxidizer}} is widespread in space propulsion. It has {{been the source of}} numerous incidents. Many materials can burn violently in an oxygen enriched environment when ignited. Consequently, it is mandatory to perform oxygen compatibility tests. In the present work, compatibility tests are impact tests and auto ignition tests. Both standardized test methods are illustrated by test results on polymeric materials (i. e. fluorinated resins, polyimides, polyetherketone) for <b>seals</b> and <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> cage. For future needs, in order to face the increase of pressure of injection of propellants in cryogenic engines, the adiabatic compression test has been identified as well suited for qualifying materials as oxygen compatible in highly constraining conditions.

50|$|Commonly {{constructed}} from {{materials such as}} aluminum, hardened cold rolled steel and galvanized steel, <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides consist of two linear rows of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> contained by four rods and located on differing sides of the base, which support the carriage for smooth linear movement along the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> This low-friction linear movement can be powered by either a drive mechanism, inertia or by hand. <b>Ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides {{tend to have a}} lower load capacity for their size compared to other linear slides because the balls are less resistant to wear and abrasions. In addition, <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides are limited by the need to fit into housing or drive systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this report}} considers {{the life of the}} ball set as well as the respective lives of the races to reassess the effect of ball-race conformity on <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> life. The related changes in <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> life are incorporated in life factors {{that can be used to}} modify the bearing predicted life using the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and ISO Standards. Two simple algebraic relationships were established to calculate life factors LF(sub c) to determine the effect of inner- and outer-race conformity combinations on bearing L(sub 10) life for deepgroove and angular-contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> respectively. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as conformity combinations, the calculated life for deep-groove <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> can be over 40 percent less than that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. For angular-contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> the life can vary between + 16 and - 39 percent from that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. Comparing the two <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> types, the life factors LF(sub c) for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 40 percent lower than that for angular-contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{rotor system}} {{supported}} by an angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> displays very complicated non-linear behaviour due to non-linear Hertzian contact force. The non-linear force and moment {{caused by the}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> are calculated {{on the basis of}} the relationship between deflection, and five-degree-of-freedom dynamic equations of the rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system are established. The Newmark-β method and the Newton–Raphson method are used to solve the non-linear equations. The dynamic characteristics of angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> are computed, considering the non-linear vibration of the rotor system. Taking angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> QJS 208 ACQ 4 C 1 /HNP 4 as an example, the effects of the vibration of the rotor system on bearing dynamic characteristics are analysed. The results show that the spin-to-roll ratio of balls, the slide ratio of the cage, and stiffness of the bearing all vary obviously with the non-periodic vibration range of the rotor; initial contact angle and axial load of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> change the non-linear dynamic nature of the rotor system and dynamic characteristics of the <b>bearing.</b> The rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system can work stably by choosing the structural and operation parameters reasonably...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>bearings</b> {{have been}} used to support {{rotating}} shafts in machines such as wind turbines, aircraft engines, and desktop computer fans. There has been extensive research in the areas of condition monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> As the identification of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> defects by inspection interrupts the operation of rotating machines and can be costly, the assessment of the health of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> relies on the use of condition monitoring techniques. Fault detection and life prediction methods have been developed to improve condition-based maintenance and product qualification. However, intermittent and catastrophic system failures due to bearing problems still occur resulting in loss of life and increase of maintenance and warranty costs. Inaccurate life prediction of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> is of concern to industry. This research focuses on prognostics of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> based on vibration and acoustic emission analysis to provide early warning of failure and predict life in advance. The failure mechanisms of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in cooling fans are identified and failure precursors associated with the defects are determined.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> service life is its internal radial clearance. However, this parameter is also very complex because it depends on applied radial load and <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> dimensions, surface finish and manufacturing materials. Thermal condition of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> also significantly affects internal radial clearance. Despite many researches performed in order to find out relevant facts about different aspects of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> thermal behaviour, only few of them are dealing with the real working conditions, where high concentration of solid contaminant particles is present. That’s why the main goal of research presented in this paper was to establish statistically significant correlation between <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> temperatures, their working time and concentration of contaminant particles in their grease. Because of especially difficult working conditions, the typical conveyor idlers bearings were selected as representative test samples and appropriate solid particles from open pit coal mines were used as artificial contaminants. Applied experimental methodology included thermographic inspection, as well as usage of custom designed test rig for <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> service life testing. Finally, by obtained experimental data processing in advanced software, statistically significant mathematical correlation between mentioned bearings characteristics was determined and applied in commonly used internal radial clearance equation.
