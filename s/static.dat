5|$|<b>Static</b> Shock is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} {{based on the}} Milestone Media/DC Comics superhero <b>Static.</b> It premiered on September 23, 2000, on The WB Television Network's Kids' WB! block programming. <b>Static</b> Shock ran for four seasons, with 52 half-hour episodes in total. The show revolves around Virgil Hawkins, an American boy of African descent, who uses the secret identity of <b>Static</b> after exposure to a mutagen gas during a gang fight gave him electromagnetic powers. Part of the DC animated universe, the series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation from a crew composed mostly {{of people from the}} company's past shows but also with the involvement of two of the comic's creators, Dwayne McDuffie and Denys Cowan.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a <b>Statics</b> Preserving Sparse Radon transform (SPSR) algorithm. The de-coloration power of Radon basis functions depends on different factors. The {{most important one}} is <b>statics.</b> <b>Statics</b> decrease the sparsity of Radon models.

SPSR algorithm includes <b>statics</b> into the Radon bases functions, allowing for a sparse representation of <b>statics</b> contaminated data in the Radon domain.

5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a <b>static</b> universe. The modified field equations predicted a <b>static</b> universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's <b>static</b> universe.|$|E

50|$|Paul Milgrom and Chris Shannon {{pointed out}} in 1994 that the {{assumptions}} conventionally used to justify the use of comparative <b>statics</b> on optimization problems are not actually necessary—specifically, the assumptions of convexity of preferred sets or constraint sets, smoothness of their boundaries, first and second derivative conditions, and linearity of budget sets or objective functions. In fact, sometimes a problem meeting these conditions can be monotonically transformed to give a problem with identical comparative <b>statics</b> but violating {{some or all of}} these conditions; hence these conditions are not necessary to justify the comparative <b>statics.</b> Stemming from the article by Milgrom and Shannon as well as the results obtained by Veinott and Topkis an important strand of operational research was developed called monotone comparative <b>statics.</b> In particular, this theory concentrates on the comparative <b>statics</b> analysis using only conditions that are independent of order-preserving transformations. The method uses lattice theory and introduces the notions of quasi-supermodularity and the single-crossing condition. The wide application of monotone comparative <b>statics</b> to economics include production theory, consumer theory, game theory with complete and incomplete information, auction theory, and others.|$|R
40|$|The <b>statics</b> problem, whether short wavelength, long wavelength, residual, or trim, {{has always}} been one of the more {{time-consuming}} and problematic steps in seismic data processing. We routinely struggle with issues such as poor signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, cycle skipping, truncated refractors, wavelets with ambiguous first arrival times, etc. Elevation variations create their own problems and impact the choice of datum—floating, phantom or recourse to a zero-velocity layer. Even if we can overcome some of these problems, we still have a “catch 22 ” situation in which accurate velocity estimation requires good <b>statics,</b> while good <b>statics</b> estimation requires accurate velocities. To characterize these ambiguities, we have come up the oxymoron “time-varying <b>statics.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Inversion for {{refraction}} <b>statics</b> is a {{key part}} of three-dimensional (3 D) reflection seismic processing. The present thesis has two primary goals directed toward improvement of refraction <b>statics</b> inversion. First, I attempt {{to improve the quality of}} the travel-time data right at the beginning of the processing sequence and before any inversion. Any error in the travel times or geometry caused during acquisition or processing would propagate into the resulting model and may harm the resulting image. To implement rigorous, model-independent data quality control, I view the first-arrival travel times as surfaces in 3 D, which allows utilization of the travel-time reciprocity condition to check for errors in geometry and in first-arrival picking. The second goal of this study is in development of a new inversion approach for refraction <b>statics</b> specifically for 3 D seismic datasets. The first-break travel-times are decomposed by using a ô-p parameterization, which allows an automatic derivation of a high-quality initial subsurface model. This model is further improved by using accurate, multi-layer ray-tracing and inversion techniques to obtain accurate refraction <b>statics.</b> An iterative inversion scheme based on the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique is utilized, and its performance is measured and discussed. To assess the quality of the inverse and establish the optimal grid sizes, I use several types of resolution tests. Finally, the surface consistent <b>statics</b> is calculated and applied to a real dataset from southern Saskatchewan. A comparison of the resulting <b>statics</b> model with <b>statics</b> calculated by using standard industry software is made, and the <b>statics</b> correction is incorporated in seismic processing. An overall result of this study is in demonstration that the fully 3 D, ô-p based travel-time inversion method works, is applicable to large seismic datasets, and results in detailed shallow subsurface models and reliable <b>statics</b> solutions. Several recommendations for extending and improving the proposed approaches are also made...|$|R
30|$|The {{engineering}} <b>statics</b> dataset comprises student {{data from}} instructors who taught with the OLI Engineering <b>Statics</b> {{course in the}} fall 2011 term (August–December 2011). <b>Statics</b> {{is the study of}} methods for quantifying the forces between bodies. Forces are responsible for maintaining balance and causing motion of bodies, or changes in their shape. You encounter a great number and variety of examples of forces every day, such as when you press a button, turn a doorknob, or run your hands through your hair. Motion and changes in shape are critical to the functionality of man-made objects as well as objects the nature. This course uses algebra and trigonometry and is suitable for use with either calculus- or non-calculus-based academic <b>statics</b> courses. Completion of a beginning physics course is helpful for success in <b>statics,</b> but not required. Many key physics concepts are included in this course.|$|R
