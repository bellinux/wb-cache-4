5|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{data rate}} in USB2.0 is 480Mbit/s (60MB/s) per controller and is shared amongst all attached devices. Some chipset manufacturers overcome this bottleneck by providing multiple USB2.0 controllers within the <b>southbridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Martello {{was born}} on September 26, 1930, in Dudley, Massachusetts, being raised on a small farm rented by his father, the Italian {{immigrant}} Rocco Luigi Martello. Following the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, the Martellos were forced from their land and moved first to Worcester, Massachusetts and then to <b>Southbridge,</b> Massachusetts. It was here that Leo was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, but his parents divorced soon after. Unable to care for him alone, his father sent Martello to the Catholic boarding preparatory school attached to Assumption College, Worcester, which was run by the Augustinians of the Assumption. He spent six years at the school, later describing it as the unhappiest period of his life. He studied graphology and {{from the age of}} 16 began making radio appearances as a graphologist, also writing stories for magazines.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Southbridge</b> Branch from East Thompson, Connecticut to <b>Southbridge,</b> Massachusetts {{was part}} of the {{original}} charter for the <b>Southbridge</b> and Blackstone Railroad, and opened in 1867, after it had been consolidated.|$|E
25|$|In Massachusetts, Route 169 is an {{undivided}} two-lane highway {{through the}} towns of <b>Southbridge</b> and Charlton. It begins as North Woodstock Road, briefly overlaps Route 131 as part of East Main Street, then splits north on Mechanic Street at the American Optical rotary, bypassing <b>Southbridge</b> center. At {{the north end of}} Mechanic Street, the highway follows Worcester Street north to the Charlton town line, where it changes its name to <b>Southbridge</b> Road. It ends at U.S. Route 20 in Charlton City, a village in Charlton.|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, Nvidia {{released}} a refreshed nForce2, called [...] "nForce2 Ultra 400". The nForce2 Ultra 400 and nForce2 400 represented official {{support for a}} 200 MHz FSB and PC-3200 DDR SDRAM, whereas the older nForce2 had only supported a maximum of 166 MHz FSB. Ultra 400 offered dual-channel support, while the plain 400 was single-channel PC-3200-capable. Both performed very similarly because neither had the IGP and again Athlon XP did not benefit significantly from the added bandwidth because the Athlon XP's bus was only capable of bandwidth matching a single channel of PC-3200. The new chipset again was partnered with several different <b>southbridges,</b> including one with (MCP-T) and one without (MCP) SoundStorm and dual Ethernet NICs. In 2004 three new <b>southbridges</b> were introduced: MCP-S integrated Serial ATA, MCP-RAID had additional RAID-functions and MCP-Gb featured Gigabit Ethernet. These newer <b>southbridges</b> did not integrate the SoundStorm unit nor the dual-Ethernet capabilities of the MCP-T.|$|R
50|$|The nForce400/405/410/430 {{refer to}} nForce4 based <b>southbridges</b> {{which are used}} {{together}} with GeForce 6100/6150 series northbridges to form a chipset with integrated graphics. The combination is a follow-up to the popular nForce2 IGP chipset.|$|R
50|$|The <b>southbridges</b> {{also support}} hybrid drives via SATA or {{supported}} ATA ports, which is compliant {{with the requirements}} of the Windows ReadyDrive technology, which is basically a conventional hard drive with an embedded NAND flash module.|$|R
25|$|Route 131 {{begins at}} U.S. Route 20 in Sturbridge, {{just west of}} where that route meets Interstate 84, and just south of I-84's {{terminus}} with Interstate 90. After crossing under I-84, Route 131 meets the former northern end of Route 15, which was a continuation of Connecticut Route 15. Route 131 continues southeastward into <b>Southbridge,</b> where it crosses the Quinebaug River. In downtown <b>Southbridge,</b> Route 131 meets {{the northern end of}} Route 198 before becoming concurrent with Route 169 for half a mile, south of the <b>Southbridge</b> Industrial Park and the old American Optical Company plant.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1849 the <b>Southbridge</b> and Blackstone Railroad was {{incorporated}} {{to extend the}} line west from Blackstone to <b>Southbridge.</b> On its way to Douglas, this railroad passed through Ironstone, {{where there was a}} factory that made Kentucky Blue Jeans, and a nearby iron forge. The Midland Railroad {{was incorporated}} May 2, 1850 to build a new entrance to Boston, merging with the existing one south of Dedham. The two companies were consolidated with the Norfolk County Railroad on December 12, 1853 to form the Boston and New York Central Railroad, which had the intent of continuing southwest through Connecticut all the way to New York City. The first section of this extension was incorporated in May 1853 as the East Thompson Railroad, forming the Connecticut portion of the <b>Southbridge</b> and Blackstone.|$|E
5000|$|... microATX boards {{often use}} the same {{chipsets}} (northbridges and <b>southbridges)</b> as full-size ATX boards, allowing them to use {{many of the same}} components. However, since microATX cases are typically much smaller than ATX cases, they usually have fewer expansion slots.|$|R
50|$|The Central Manufacturing Company was {{established}} in 1837, {{and was one of}} <b>Southbridge's</b> major employers well into the 20th century. The company built its premises on the site of <b>Southbridge's</b> earliest grist- and sawmills, and the town grew around the facility. By late in the 19th century most New England textile mills were in decline, due to increased competition in the South. However, Central Manufacturing embarked on a major renovation of its plant in 1908. It knocked {{a significant portion of the}} 1837 plant, and built the present two story brick structure, with the surviving 1837 section attached to its rear. The building is in the Romanesque Revival style, with rounded arch windows and a small tower.|$|R
50|$|Advanced clock {{calibration}} (ACC) is {{a feature}} originally available for Phenom families of processors, particularly for Black Edition ones, {{to increase the}} overclocking potential of the CPU. ACC {{is supported by the}} SB710 and the SB750 <b>southbridges,</b> and available through BIOS settings on some motherboards and AMD OverDrive utility.|$|R
25|$|In Worcester County: Blackstone, Brookfield, Charlton, Douglas, Dudley, East Brookfield, Grafton, Hopedale, Leicester, Mendon, Milford, Millbury, Millville, North Brookfield, Northbridge, Oxford, <b>Southbridge,</b> Spencer, Sturbridge, Sutton, Upton, Uxbridge, Warren, Webster.|$|E
25|$|On February 11, 1867 the BH leased the Norfolk County Railroad, finally reopening {{the full}} line from Mechanicsville to Boston. That same year, the branch to <b>Southbridge</b> (part of the {{original}} <b>Southbridge</b> and Blackstone charter) opened. The Norwich and Worcester Railroad was leased in 1869, finally giving it a route to Boston, using the N from the Providence line at Plainfield north to the old Norfolk County Railroad at Mechanicsville. In August 1872 a direct connection from Willimantic {{on the line to}} Providence northeast to Mechanicsville opened, completing the direct line to Boston.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2003, Despres faced his former tag team partner Dr. Heresy {{defeating}} him for the EWA Heavyweight Championship on September 5 in <b>Southbridge,</b> Massachusetts. He lost the title three months later to Antonio Thomas in Ludlow, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|By {{efficiently}} transferring device heat to {{a separate}} heat exchanger which can use larger heat sinks or fans, water cooling can allow quieter overall operation. Devices such as GPUs, Northbridges, <b>Southbridges,</b> hard disk drives, memory, voltage regulator modules (VRMs), and even power supplies can be separately water-cooled; in fact the whole PC can be immersed in some cases.|$|R
50|$|The 2-1/2 story wood {{frame house}} {{was one of}} the first houses built when Hamilton Street was laid out. It was built for Theodore Harrington, son of Henry Harrington, founder of <b>Southbridge's</b> Harrington Cutlery Company, a {{manufacturer}} of knives used in the manufacture of shoes. Its most notable feature is its ornate architrave and doorway with sidelights and transom window.|$|R
50|$|Windsor Court {{is a short}} spur road on {{the south}} side of North Street, which runs east-west north of <b>Southbridge's</b> {{downtown}} and south of the Quinebaug River. Between the road and the river stands part of the former manufacturing facility of the American Optical Company, once <b>Southbridge's</b> leading employer. Two of the five buildings in the district flank Windsor Court, facing south toward North Street, while the other three stand on the west side of Windsor Court. They are essentially identical in original construction, 2-1/2 story wood frame structures with gable roofs. They differ from traditional triple-decker construction in that they have gabled roofs and Colonial Revival styling. Distinctive features include corner pilasters and recessed porches, some of which have since been enclosed. Although the roofline starts at the second floor, the houses have dormers that run most of the length of the structure, giving the third floor unit additional space. These features are similar to those found in another cluster of company housing on Twinehurst Place.|$|R
25|$|With {{the advent}} of AMD's APUs in 2011, {{traditional}} north bridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to as single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided <b>southbridge</b> functionality.|$|E
25|$|Carter, who is of pākehā and Māori descent, {{was born}} in Leeston, a small town 10 minutes drive from the Carter family home in <b>Southbridge</b> in the South Island of New Zealand, to Neville and Bev Carter, and has one older sister, Sarah. From the age of 5, he played with <b>Southbridge</b> Rugby Club as a half back (scrum half) and {{would go on to}} make {{representative}} teams for Ellesmere & Canterbury Country. He attended Ellesmere College where he played mostly at first five-eighth, and then in his final year he transferred to Christchurch Boys High School to further his chances of making it big in rugby. Some have said he was a shy and quiet young man who kept grand aspirations to himself. His great uncle was Canterbury and New Zealand half back Bill Dalley, a member of the 1924–25 Invincibles and later a Canterbury rugby administrator.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of student {{organizations}} {{are associated with the}} college. With its relative distance from a major city, and without a Greek life at Holy Cross, undergraduate social life revolves around a number of school-sponsored groups, events, and off-campus houses on nearby city streets (notably Boyden, Cambridge, Caro, Chelsea, College, and <b>Southbridge</b> streets) which are open to upperclassmen.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} located north of <b>Southbridge's</b> central {{business}} district, {{on the north}} side of North Street, about midway between Foster and Mechanic Streets. It is a single-story masonry structure, with a cruciform plan and a central cupola. The front (south-facing) facade is flanked by low square towers topped by rounded wood-frame stages that are terminated in crosses. The entrance, set between these towers, is flanked by Corinthian columns and topped by a full Greek entablature.|$|R
50|$|Water cooling {{can be used}} to cool many {{computer}} components, {{but especially}} the CPU. Water cooling usually uses a CPU water block, a water pump, and a water-to-air heat exchanger. By transferring device heat to a separate heat exchanger which can variously be made large and use larger, lower-speed fans, water cooling can allow quieter operation, improved processor speeds (overclocking), or a balance of both. Less commonly, GPUs, Northbridges, <b>Southbridges,</b> hard disk drives, memory, voltage regulator modules (VRMs), and even power supplies can be water-cooled.|$|R
50|$|Built {{sometime}} in the 1830s, this house is an early example of a side entry gable front Greek Revival house, a style that became much more common in subsequent decades. An early local historian claimed that it was built to rival in style the Tiffany-Leonard House, another fine brick Greek Revival house located in the city center. This house was built for Samuel Judson, owner of one of <b>Southbridge's</b> early cotton mills. Later in the 19th century it was acquired by Libya Merritt Litchfield, treasurer and co-owner of the Litchfield shuttle factory.|$|R
25|$|When a {{snowstorm}} forced Sbraccia and Nelson to cancel a scheduled title defense in North Richland Hills, Texas on March 3, the titles were held up. Several days following this, McCarthy teamed with Knuckles Nelson to defeat Jason Rage & Slyk Wagner Brown {{at a house}} show in <b>Southbridge,</b> Massachusetts. Dalton would also gain an impressive singles victory over Trooper Gilmore, a one-time NWA New England Heavyweight Champion, at the Good Times Emporium in Somerville, Massachusetts on May 29.|$|E
25|$|Central Massachusetts {{encompasses}} Worcester County, {{which is}} hilly and rocky. It features the urban city of Worcester, {{and the smaller}} cities of Fitchburg, Leominster, Gardner, and <b>Southbridge.</b> Central Massachusetts also includes many rural hill towns, forests, and small farms. The geographic center of Massachusetts is {{in the town of}} Rutland, in central Worcester County. The Quabbin Reservoir (formed by the dammed Swift Rivera former Connecticut River tributary), borders the western side of the county; it is the main water supply for Greater Boston.|$|E
25|$|The Xbox 360 has an {{extensive}} amount of bandwidth {{in comparison to}} its competition; however, this statistic includes the eDRAM logic to memory bandwidth, and not internal CPU bandwidths. The eDRAM internal logic to its internal memory bandwidth is 256GB/s. The high bandwidth is used primarily for z-buffering, alpha blending, and antialiasing; it saves time and space on the GPU die. Between the eDRAM die and the GPU, data is transferred at 32GB/s. The memory interface bus has a bandwidth of 22.40GB/s and the <b>Southbridge</b> a bandwidth of 500MB/s.|$|E
50|$|The Hamilton Millwright-Agent's House {{is set on}} {{the south}} side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 131), just near its {{junction}} with Hamilton Street in <b>Southbridge's</b> Globe Village. The house stands on a rise overlooking the former Hamilton Woolen Company mill. It has typical Greek Revival characteristics, and is stylistically similar to the Judson-Litchfield House on South Street. It has a doorway with sidelights and transom, and window openings with granite sills and lintels. There is a side ell, in front of which is a porch with Doric posts and a Greek entablature.|$|R
50|$|The PCH then {{incorporates}} {{a few of}} the remaining northbridge functions (e.g. clocking) in addition to all of the <b>southbridge's</b> functions. The system clock was previously a connection and is now fused in with the PCH. Two different connections exist between the PCH and the CPU: Flexible Display Interface (FDI) and Direct Media Interface (DMI). The FDI is only used when the chipset requires supporting a processor with integrated graphics. The Intel Management Engine was also moved to the PCH starting with the Nehalem processors and 5-Series chipsets.|$|R
50|$|The Judson-Litchfield House {{is located}} on <b>Southbridge's</b> south side, on a rise {{on the south side}} of South Street. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof. Its front (north-facing facade) is three bays wide, with the {{entrance}} set in the right bay recessed in a segmented-arched opening, and windows set in openings with granite lintels and sills. The main gable is fully pedimented, with a louvered half-oval opening at its center. A porch added to the left of the building is a later 19th-century addition.|$|R
