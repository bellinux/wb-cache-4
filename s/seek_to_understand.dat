5|$|Condensed matter {{physics is}} {{a branch of}} physics that deals with the {{physical}} properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all approaches that <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the brain and}} the rest of the nervous system. Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian School theorizes {{that the}} {{subjective}} choices of individuals including individual knowledge, time, expectation, and other subjective factors, cause all economic phenomena. Austrians <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the economy by}} examining the social ramifications of individual choice, an approach called methodological individualism. It differs from other schools of economic thought, which have focused on aggregate variables, equilibrium analysis, and societal groups rather than individuals.|$|E
25|$|In {{development}} geography, geographers study spatial {{patterns in}} development. They {{try to find}} by what characteristics they can measure development by looking at economic, political and social factors. They <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development. Studies compare More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs). Additionally variations within countries are looked at such as the differences between northern and southern Italy, the Mezzogiorno.|$|E

25|$|New technologies, such as {{biotechnology}} {{and computer}} science (for data processing and storage), and technological advances {{have made it possible}} to develop new research fields, including genetic engineering, agrophysics, improved statistical analysis, and precision farming. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the human-nature interactions of traditional agriculture, including interaction of religion and agriculture, and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} {{is based on}} the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, cognition has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} heavily debated topics of the period was that of faith versus reason. Avicenna and Averroes both leaned more {{on the side of}} reason. Augustine stated that he would never allow his {{philosophical}} investigations to go beyond the authority of God. Anselm attempted to defend against what he saw as partly an assault on faith, with an approach allowing for both faith and reason. The Augustinian solution to the faith/reason problem is to (1) believe, and then (2) <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E

25|$|Governance and {{decision}} making is conducted at a special meeting for worshipâ€”often called a meeting for worship with a concern for business or meeting for worship for church affairs at which all members can attend, as in a Congregational church. Quakers consider {{this to be a}} form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They believe this is the gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|E
25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{affirms that}} human beings exist in a world around them and that through {{background}} a priori (before experience) foreknowledge, they constantly <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> themselves and that world, including other humans and inanimate objects. Heidegger termed human beings as Dasein, the German word for being-there. In other words, an individual is termed Dasein {{because he or she}} exists there, being there at some place in the present. Put in more simple terms, an individual is Dasein because he or she literally exists. Heidegger, along with Dilthey, was concerned about understanding human nature, what it means to exist, to be.|$|E
25|$|Jung's staunchest {{critics have}} {{accused him of}} either mystical or metaphysical essentialism. Since archetypes are defined so vaguely and since archetypal images have been {{observed}} by many Jungians in a wide and essentially infinite variety of everyday phenomena, they are neither generalizable nor specific {{in a way that}} may be researched or demarcated with any kind of rigor. Hence they elude systematic study. Jung and his supporters defended the impossibility of providing rigorous operationalised definitions as a problem peculiar not only to archetypal psychology alone, but also other domains of knowledge that <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> complex systems in an integrated manner.|$|E

25|$|Scriptural {{interpretation}} â€“ WELS confesses {{that the}} Bible is the inspired, inerrant and infallible Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:20-21, 1 Corinthians 2:13, John 17:17, Psalm 12:6, Titus 1:2) and follows a Historical-Grammatical approach to interpretation. The {{meaning of a}} portion of Scripture is discerned by paying careful attention to grammar, syntax, vocabulary and context. In this regard, the historical setting forms part of the context of Scripture, the text itself indicating how important a part. The ELCA, on the other hand, has been open to Historical-Critical Methods of Biblical interpretation which <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the scriptures with primary reference to historical and social context. Most other specific doctrinal {{differences between the two}} churches stem from this overarching disagreement.|$|E
25|$|Dilthey {{strongly}} rejected using a model formed {{exclusively from}} the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften), and instead proposed developing a separate model for the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). His argument centered around the idea that in the natural sciences we seek to explain phenomena in terms of cause and effect, or the general and the particular; in contrast, in the human sciences, we <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{in terms of the}} relations of the part and the whole. In the social sciences we may also combine the two approaches, a point stressed by German sociologist Max Weber. His principles, a general theory of understanding or comprehension (Verstehen) could, he asserted, be applied to all manner of interpretation ranging from ancient texts to art work, religious works, and even law. His interpretation of different theories of aesthetics in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was preliminary to his speculations concerning the form aesthetic theory would take in the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary psychologists <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{psychological}} {{mechanisms by}} understanding the survival and reproductive functions {{they might have}} served {{over the course of}} evolutionary history. These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances. In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.|$|E

500|$|Gandhi {{was brought}} up as a {{vegetarian}} by his devout Hindu mother. The idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in Hindu Vaishnavism and Jain traditions in India, such as in his native Gujarat, where meat is considered {{as a form of}} food obtained by violence to animals. Gandhi's rationale for vegetarianism was largely along those found in Hindu and Jain texts. Gandhi believed that any form of food inescapably harms some form of living organism, but one should <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and reduce the violence in what one consumes because [...] "there is essential unity of all life".|$|E

In other words, Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically {{only to the extent that}} they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals, models that Weber called [...] "ideal types", from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors. The analytical constructs of an ideal type never exist in reality, but provide objective benchmarks against which real-life constructs can be measured.|$|E
