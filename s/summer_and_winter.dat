5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter.</b> On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> solstices.|$|E

5|$|Sonja Henie of Norway won {{her second}} {{consecutive}} {{gold medal in}} the ladies' individual figure skating competition. Andrée Brunet and Pierre Brunet of France won their third consecutive medal in pairs figure skating, having won bronze in Chamonix before golds in St. Moritz and Lake Placid. In the men's event, Austrian figure skater Karl Schäfer beat out three-time Olympic champion Gillis Grafström of Sweden. American Edward Eagan became the first athlete to win medals at both <b>Summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Winter</b> Olympics; he had won a gold medal in light heavyweight boxing at the 1920 Summer Olympics and took home a gold in the four-man bobsleigh at Lake Placid. Although other athletes since have earned medals in both <b>Summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Winter</b> Olympics, Eagan remains the only person to have won gold medals in both.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{the water}} regime due to the {{construction}} of the Ithai barrage across the Manipur River have caused changes in the vegetation composition of the phumdis.

5|$|Historically, German {{athletes have}} been {{successful}} contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count (when combining East and West German medals). Germany was the last country to host both the <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> games in the same year, in 1936 the Berlin Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. In Munich it hosted the Summer Games of 1972.|$|E
5|$|In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E

5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery {{near the base}} of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead hatchery in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E

50|$|Coastal regions, {{especially}} the western coast of Courland Peninsula, possess a more maritime climate with cooler <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> milder <b>winters,</b> while eastern parts exhibit a more continental climate with warmer <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> harsher <b>winters.</b>|$|R

5|$|Comiket, {{short for}} Comic Market, {{is a large}} comic {{convention}} held twice a year in Tokyo, Japan during August and December, which {{are referred to as}} the <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> Comic Markets, respectively. Key has been an active participant in the convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999, where they sold Kanon-related products (as Kanon was their only release at the time); one such product was a Zippo lighter. The first Air-related products Key sold at the convention were at Comiket 59 in December 2000. Typical products include: postcards, telephone cards, calendars, posters, and albums. The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the brand produces.|$|E

5|$|Pallas has unusual dynamic {{parameters}} {{for such a}} large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as {{the central part of}} the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β,λ) = (30°,−16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter,</b> large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.|$|E
