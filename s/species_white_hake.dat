40|$|With {{the decline}} in “ {{traditional}} ” groundfish resources in the waters around Newfoundland, interest in the exploitation of alternate <b>species</b> including <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis tenuis) has increased. Presently there is a limited directed fishery for <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> on the southern Grand Banks. It is more commonly taken in mixed fisheries with cod, monkfish and skate. There is no quota for the hake fishery in NAFO Divisions 3 LNO and Subdivision 3 Ps and effort is regulated only by closures due to excessive by-catch of other species. This paper provides: a review of fishery catch, effort, and catch composition; an analysis of abundance, biomass and size composition from research vessel surveys; and an examination of spatial distribution, for <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> in NAFO Div. 3 LNO and Subdiv. 3 Ps, 1985 - 1998. By 1995, abundance had declined to lowest historic levels. However in 1999 - 2001, the biomass and abundance indices increased dramatically due to recruitment, and particularly a very large 1999 year-class. Locale and spatial extent of the stock remained relatively constant {{since the start of}} stratified research surveys in the 1970 s, restricted to a narrow band along the southwest edge of the Grand Banks and into the Laurentian and Hermitage Channels where bottom temperatures are warmest (> 4 °C). <b>White</b> <b>hake</b> occupied a wide range of bottom depths along the slope from 150 to 800 m. Range of total length of hake has changed little over the years 12 - 120 cm. However, a very large 1999 year-class resulted in a dominant mode of 25 cm (1 year old) fish in the 2000 survey and a 40 cm mode (2 year olds) in 2001...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis tenuis) {{abundance}} {{has been}} increasing on the northeast coast of Newfoundland {{over the past two}} decades. In these coastal areas juvenile <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> and Greenland cod (Gadus ogac) overlap spatially and temporally in eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat, an important nursery for young of the year gadids. Concern has arisen that the recent increase in <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> abundance may be negatively impacting other gadids, such as Greenland cod. The purpose of my study was, therefore, to investigate the habitat use and behavioural interactions of juvenile <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> and Greenland cod and how this may vary in response to predator threat (an age 3 + Atlantic cod; G. morhua) and interspecific competition. A series of laboratory experiments were undertaken to determine habitat use under these different scenarios by dividing the bottom of two replicate arenas (2 x 2 x 0. 5 m) into thirds and covering these with artificial eelgrass, cobble, or sand. My study documented overlapping habitat use by juvenile <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> and Greenland cod and supported the contention that eelgrass serves as an important refuge habitat for both species, with Greenland cod showing the highest affinity. Furthermore, interspecific competition experiments showed evidence of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> excluding Greenland cod from preferred habitat as a result of competition for refuges. The size advantage that <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> gain over Greenland cod early during demersal life may be the main mechanism that influences the outcome of this habitat competition...|$|R
40|$|<b>White</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis tenuis, Mitchill 1815) is a bottom-dwelling fish {{distributed}} only in {{the northwest}} Atlantic from Cape Hatteras to southern Labrador; with dense concentrations in the Gulf of Maine, on the Scotian Shelf, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the southern Grand Banks. Over their entire range, <b>white</b> <b>hakes</b> are found at bottom depths from 4 oC). They occupy {{a wide range of}} bottom depths along the slope out to 800 m; at depths considerably greater than what is observed in other parts of their range. <b>White</b> <b>hake</b> may be classified as “ temperature keepers”: maintaining a constant temperature range by changing their depth distribution. The largest year-class since 1977 was observed in 1999; first detected by an IYGPT survey and also observed in a Spanish research survey. An estimated growth rate of about 2. 5 cm per month corresponds to the dominant 25 -cm mode of <b>white</b> <b>hakes</b> seen in the following year’s Canadian spring research survey. There appears to be some geographic separation of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> life stages in NAFO Div. 3 NO and Subdiv. 3 Ps.

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the biology of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> in the {{southern}} Gulf of St. Lawrence were investigated from commercial and research survey data collected between 1965 and 1978. Nominal catches have generally declined from an annual average of 5, 400 metric tons in 1960 - 69 to 4, 800 tons in 1970 - 78. Length compositions af <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> landed by otter trawlers indicate {{a higher proportion of}} larger fish in the mid- 1970 's than in the mid- 1960 's, the difference probably being due to a change in fishing practices. There was no difference in the length-weight relationships of males and females, but males attained sexual maturity at smaller sizes than did females. Comparable length-at-age data for Div. 4 T and 4 X show considerably faster growth in Div. 4 X, indicating that growth may be inversely related to temperature. Limited observations on fecundity indicate that <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> may be among the most fecund on the commercially- exploited fishes in the Northwest Atlantic. 52 Fig. 1.

40|$|Klein-MacPhee 2002). Depth {{distribution}} of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> varies {{by age and}} season; juveniles typically occupy shallower areas than adults, but individuals of all ages tend to move inshore or shoalward in summer, dispersing to deeper areas in winter (Musick 1974; Markel et al. 1982). Small <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> are difficult to distinguish from red hake, Urophycis chuss, resulting in a small degree of bias in reported nominal catches (NEFSC 2005). Larval distributions indicate the presence of two spawning groups in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank and Scotian Shelf region, one which spawns in deep water on the continental slope in late winter and early spring, and a second which spawns on the Scotian Shelf in the summer (Fahay and Able 1989; Lang et al. 1994).

40|$|The {{preliminary}} SCAA/ASPM {{assessment of}} <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> {{presented to the}} previous GARM meeting is refined and updated, being advantaged by the greater availability of catch-at age information for the surveys and now also for commercial catches. Six assessment variants are presented, which reflect {{whether or not to}} take survey catchat-length information into account in fitting the assessment models, whether to use a Ricker or a Beverton-Holt form for the stock-recruitment relationship, and whether or not to constrain the multiplicative bias factor for the autumn NEFSC survey sweptarea estimates of biomass to preclude the possibility of herding. Imposing this last constraint leads to an appreciable deterioration in the overall likelihood of the model; the likelihood also indicates a slight preference for the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt form. Inclusion of the survey catch-at-length data in the likelihood leads to a considerable improvement in estimation precision, but also shows a marked overestimate by the model of the proportion of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> of 20 cm and less in the autumn NEFSC surveys. Both variants are put forward as candidates to provide the basis for scientific management advice. The variant which includes the catch-at-length information reflects lesser abundance in absolute terms, a greater retrospective pattern, but also current abundance at a greater proportion of the MSY level, when compared to its counterpart. The estimation of current resource status in relation to the MSY level is critically dependent on the determination of the parameters which specify the starting (1963) numbers-at-age vector for the assessment. ...|$|R

The measures identified in the ALWTRP are also intended to benefit minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which are not strategic, but are known to be taken incidentally in commercial fisheries. This final rule implements additional regulations for the fisheries currently covered by the ALWTRP (the Northeast sink gillnet, Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot, Mid-Atlantic gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, and Southeastern U.
