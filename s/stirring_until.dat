60|$|At {{the moment}} my glance fell on that {{prostrate}} form I paused and stood still, trembling {{like a person}} struck with a sudden pang in the heart, who thinks that his last moment has come to him unawares. After a while I slunk away out of the great circle of firelight into the thick darkness beyond. Instinctively I turned towards the forests across the savannah--my forest again; and fled away from the noise {{and the sight of}} flames, never pausing until I found myself within the black shadow of the trees. Into the deeper blackness of the interior I dared not venture; on the border I paused to ask myself what I did there alone in the night-time. Sitting down, I covered my face with my hands as if to hide it more effectually than it could be hidden by night and the forest shadows. What horrible thing, what calamity that frightened my soul to think of, had fallen on me? The revulsion of feeling, the unspeakable horror, the remorse, was more than I could bear. I started up with a cry of anguish, and would have slain myself to escape at that moment; but Nature is not always and utterly cruel, and on this occasion she came to my aid. Consciousness forsook me, and I lived not again until the light of early morning was in the east; then found myself lying on the wet herbage--wet with rain that had lately fallen. My physical misery was now so great that it prevented me from dwelling on the scenes witnessed on the previous evening. Nature was again merciful in this. I only remembered that it was necessary to hide myself, in case the Indians should be still in the neighbourhood and pay the wood a visit. Slowly and painfully I crept away into the forest, and there sat for several hours, scarcely thinking at all, in a half-stupefied condition. At noon the sun shone out and dried the wood. I felt no hunger, only a vague sense of bodily misery, and with it the fear that if I left my hiding-place I might meet some human creature face to face. This fear prevented me from <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> the twilight came, when I crept forth and made my way to the border of the forest, to spend the night there. Whether sleep visited me during the dark hours or not I cannot say: day and night my condition seemed the same; I experienced only a dull sensation of utter misery which seemed in spirit and flesh alike, an inability to think clearly, or {{for more than a few}} moments consecutively, about anything. Scenes in which I had been principal actor came and went, as in a dream when the will slumbers: now with devilish ingenuity and persistence I was working on Managa's mind; now standing motionless in the forest listening for that sweet, mysterious melody; now staring aghast at old Cla-cla's wide-open glassy eyes and white hair dabbled in blood; then suddenly, in the cave at Riolama, I was fondly watching the slow return of life and colour to Rima's still face.|$|E
50|$|Aguapanela is made {{by adding}} pieces of panela to water and <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> the pieces are entirely dissolved.

50|$|The pigment was {{originally}} prepared {{by making a}} solution of sodium carbonate at a temperature of around 90 °C, then slowly adding arsenious oxide, while constantly <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> everything had dissolved. This produced a sodium arsenite solution. Added to a copper sulfate solution, it produced a green precipitate of effectively insoluble copper arsenite. After filtration the product was dried at about 43 °C. To enhance the color, the salt was subsequently heated to 60-70 °C. The intensity of the color depends on the copper : arsenic ratio, which in turn was affected by {{the ratio of the}} starting materials, as well as the temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Queso blanco is {{considered}} one of the easier cheeses to make, as it requires no careful handling and does not call for rennet or a bacterial culture. It is usually made by heating whole fresh milk to near-boiling, adding an acidifying agent such as vinegar, <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> curds form, then draining the curds in cheesecloth for three to five hours. Such cheeses are also known as [...] "bag cheeses", as the curds are normally hung in a bag of cheesecloth to drain. Many Mexican home cooks make their own instead of purchasing it; when made for the evening meal, it is often prepared in early afternoon and left to drain until evening. As it is highly perishable, it must be refrigerated or used immediately once the whey has drained out.|$|E
50|$|Zinc acetate Zn(CH3COO)2 {{solution}} is prepared in ethanol under vigorous <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> zinc acetate is dissolved in ethanol in temperature around 50 °C. Then ethanol is added and continuously stirred under temperature around 80 °C {{for half an}} hour. After that, the {{solution is}} cooled under room temperature. NaOH in ethanol solution is prepared by vigorous stirring with 50 °C, and then added to prepared zinc acetate in ethanol at room temperature. After that ZnO seeds are put in hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) solution, commonly called hexamine, for growth process. Hexamine is water-soluble chemical and the growth process {{can be done in}} the temperature range 55-95 °C. After ZnO nanopatilces are grown to desired shape, then the particles will be coated with silica particles by using Stoeber method. The process is carried out in ammonia-catalyzed reaction of TEOS in ethanol-water solution. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) can be added optionally for stabilization purpose. Hydrolysis reaction is initiated to form silica nanoparticles coated on ZnO nanoparticles.|$|E
50|$|Cajeta {{is made by}} {{simmering}} goat's milk, or {{occasionally a}} sweetened liquid, <b>stirring</b> frequently, <b>until</b> it becomes very viscous due to evaporation of water, and caramelized. While goat milk is the most usual base, other liquids or juices may be used.|$|R

25|$|Dave Duncan {{wrote the}} Venice Trilogy (2007–2009), {{starring}} the legendary clairvoyant, astrologer, and physician Maestro Nostradamus, who solves mysteries for {{the rulers of}} Venice, Italy while never leaving his apartments. Instead he sends the young swordsman Alfeo Zeno on various investigative tasks around the city, seeking clues, arranging interviews, and generally <b>stirring</b> up trouble <b>until</b> something happens. Nostradamus holds a similar disdain for women, and Alfeo's primary romantic partner is a highly-ranked courtesan, similar in station to Lily Rowan (an independent socialite).|$|R
60|$|Honest Captain Cuttle, as {{the weeks}} flew over him in his {{fortified}} retreat, by no means abated any of his prudent provisions against surprise, because of the non-appearance of the enemy. The Captain argued that his present security was too profound and wonderful to endure much longer; he knew that when the wind stood in a fair quarter, the weathercock was seldom nailed there; and he was too well acquainted with the determined and dauntless character of Mrs MacStinger, to doubt that that heroic woman had devoted herself {{to the task of}} his discovery and capture. Trembling beneath the weight of these reasons, Captain Cuttle lived a very close and retired life; seldom <b>stirring</b> abroad <b>until</b> after dark; venturing even then only into the obscurest streets; never going forth at all on Sundays; and both within and without the walls of his retreat, avoiding bonnets, as if they were worn by raging lions.|$|R
30|$|The {{superparamagnetism}} Fe 3 O 4 hollow microspheres {{were prepared}} through a modified hydrothermal reaction [15]. Briefly, 2  mmol FeCl 3 · 6 H 2 O, 4  mmol sodium citrate, and 6  mmol urea were dissolved in 40  ml deionized water. Then, 0.3  g PAM was added under continuous <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> it was dissolved totally and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (80 -ml capacity). The autoclave was heated to 200  °C and maintained for 12  h, {{then it was}} cooled to room temperature. The black product was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol three times and then dried under vacuum overnight for further characterization.|$|E
30|$|Two {{copper wires}} were {{connected}} to the pad of the as-printed micro-electrode using silver paste to make {{a connection to the}} electrochemical instruments. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) served as electrolyte was prepared by adding PVA power (6  g) into H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution (6  g H 2 SO 4 into 60  mL deionized water). The whole mixture was heated to 85  °C under vigorous <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> the solution became clear. After cooling down, the gel solution was drop cast {{to the surface of the}} microelectrodes. After PVA/H 2 SO 4 gel electrolyte being solidified, the preparation of the MSCs was completed.|$|E
30|$|The {{flexible}} asymmetric SC {{consists of}} CC@CoAl-LDHs as the positive electrode, CC@rGO as the negative electrode, and PVA/KOH as the electrolyte and separator. The assembly process is as follows: PVA/KOH gel was prepared by mixing 6  g of PVA powder into 100  mL of 6  M KOH aqueous solution. The mixture was heated to 90  °C with <b>stirring</b> <b>until</b> it became clear. Then, {{the positive and}} negative electrodes were immersed into the PVA/KOH gel for 15  min and then solidified for 10  min. Next, the electrodes were immersed in the gelled electrolyte again and assembled into a sandwich structure. The fabrication of a flexible ASC cell was completed after the gel electrolyte solidified at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|In Aragon {{the same}} dish may be also called Gachas, {{but more often}} it is {{referred}} to by the local name of Farinetas. It is prepared by frying thick pieces of bacon in olive oil and taking them off the pan when they have released some fat. Then water and fine corn flour {{are added to the}} same pan, slowly <b>stirring</b> the mixture <b>until</b> it is cooked. The proportion is roughly 250 g of flour, 150 g of bacon, 1 liter of water, three large spoonfuls of extra virgin olive oil and a teaspoonful of salt.|$|R
50|$|Chifir' is {{typically}} prepared with 5-8 tablespoons of loose tea (or tea bags) per person poured {{on top of}} the boiled water. It is brewed for 10-15 minutes without <b>stirring</b> - <b>until</b> the leaves drop {{to the bottom of the}} cup. Chifir' is often drunk by pouring a small amount of Chifir into a mug, and adding boiling water to soothe and dilute the strong tea, or it can be consumed without sugar by those that seek a caffeine high. Those that prefer to simply enjoy the chifir' drink it with milk. To avoid bitterness, sweets can also be held in the mouth before or with the tea. Sugar is sometimes added; however, the nature of the tea tends to have it retain a bitter flavor. Milk is often used to make the tea less bitter or to make it less acidic. It is to be drunk slowly, otherwise it may cause vomiting. Ultimately, making chifir' involves brewing a great deal of black tea and for a long time. It may be left to brew overnight and drunk either hot or cold.|$|R
40|$|Bottom-up {{approach}} is an appealing strategy to build complex three-dimensional (3 D) viable tissues in vitro starting from microtissue precursors (μTP). In this work we biofabricated a thick dermal-like tissue by sequentially combining two steps: a μTPs production and assembly followed by tissue maturation in a purpose-built bioreactor. The μTPs were produced by first seeding bovine primary fibroblasts on gelatine microparticles and then cultivating them in <b>stirring</b> conditions <b>until</b> {{a thick layer}} of ∼ 80 μm of de novo synthesized extracellular matrix uniformly covered the microparticle surface. The μTPs were then loaded into a cylindrical chamber (2 mm in depth and 35 mm in diameter) and let to maturate and assemble into a 3 D viable biohybrid tissue under specific fluid flow conditions. Several combinations of perfusion and/or tangential fluid flow were applied and their effect on the tissue formation and maturation was assessed. Results show that structural composition and mechanical features of the final 3 D bioengineered tissue are strongly affected by the hydrodynamic environment and demonstrate that by optimizing culture conditions a 3 D viable tissue with properties similar to that of native derma could be produced. © 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc...|$|R
