25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into <b>something</b> <b>too</b> hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E
25|$|In the Egyptian, Greek and Roman empires, women usually fed {{only their}} own children. However, {{breastfeeding}} {{began to be}} seen as <b>something</b> <b>too</b> common to be done by royalty, and wet nurses were employed to breastfeed the children of the royal families. This extended over time, particularly in western Europe, where noble women often made use of wet nurses. Lower-class women breastfed their infants and used a wet nurse only if they were unable to feed their own infant. Attempts were made in 15th-century Europe to use cow or goat milk, but these attempts were not successful. In the 18th century, flour or cereal mixed with broth were introduced as substitutes for breastfeeding, but this was also unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|A {{second letter}} {{was sent to}} several {{corporations}} seeking donations for a vehicle, running shoes and to cover the other costs of the run. Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. He observed {{that while he was}} grateful to be alive following his cancer treatment, [...] "I remember promising myself that, should I live, I would rise up to meet this new challenge [...] face to face and prove myself worthy of life, <b>something</b> <b>too</b> many people take for granted." [...] The Ford Motor Company donated a camper van, while Imperial Oil contributed fuel, and Adidas his running shoes. Fox turned away any company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions, as he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.|$|E

500|$|By the 1570s, Sir Henry Sidney and {{his wife}} had become {{somewhat}} disillusioned and embittered about lacking financial rewards on the Queen's part for their long service. In 1572 Mary Dudley even had to decline a barony for her husband in a letter to William Cecil, himself Baron Burghley since the previous year: The expenses such a title implied were simply too great, Sir Henry's mind being [...] "dismayed [...] hard choice" [...] between choosing financial ruin and royal displeasure [...] "in refusing it". Two years later, in 1574, she quarrelled with the Lord Chamberlain (her brother-in-law, the Earl of Sussex) over accommodation at court. She refused to exchange her accustomed rooms with a cold chamber that had previously been [...] "but the place for my servants". All in all though, she explained, [...] "old Lord Harry and his old Moll" [...] would accept [...] "like good friends the small portion allotted our long service in court; which as little as it is, seems <b>something</b> <b>too</b> much." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was giving}} up {{hope of finding}} Judy when she arrived in his new camp. [...] "I couldn’t believe my eyes. As I entered the camp, a scraggy dog hit me square between the {{shoulders}} and knocked me over! I’d never been {{so glad to see}} the old girl. And I think she felt the same!" [...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was <b>something</b> <b>too</b> large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E
500|$|Black Francis {{recalled}} {{that he wrote}} [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] around {{the time he was}} age 14 or 15. Years later after the Pixies were formed, producer Paul Kolderie noted the group didn't want to record [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] for its demo [...] "The Purple Tape". The group referred to it as [...] "the Tom Petty song", according to Kolderie. Producer Gary Smith said, [...] "There was some reluctance to do 'Here Comes Your Man' because it was too pop, there was <b>something</b> <b>too</b> straight about it." [...] When 4AD label head Ivo Watts-Russell handpicked the track listing for the group's debut release Come on Pilgrim, he intentionally left out [...] "Here Comes Your Man". Watts-Russell stated that he liked the song, but [...] "it felt just too obviously commercial and I didn't know what we were doing with [...] ". Watts-Russell also felt it was too reminiscent of Mink DeVille's [...] "Spanish Stroll". For a post-Surfer Rosa single, 4AD rejected another recording of the song; they later chose [...] "Gigantic", with [...] "River Euphrates" [...] on the B-side.|$|E

500|$|In September 2005, {{the band}} {{announced}} the album's title and {{revealed that the}} title track, [...] "Lights and Sounds", was confirmed {{to be the first}} single from the album, with a video shot in Van Nuys, California and a release date of November 15. On October 24, the band began a tour in support of the album, during which they began playing at small venues at college arenas. The tour lasted for six weeks. In November 2005, it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band. Key explained that the band went through [...] "a lot of the highest and lowest points" [...] and that making an album [...] "would be on the highest list, and losing a member would be on the lowest." [...] He also added, [...] "It's really been a long journey together, you know, so obviously, parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience. It was either go on without him, or don't go on at all. And, at the core, we decided that we had <b>something</b> <b>too</b> great to let go of, and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him." [...] Harper was replaced by Ryan Mendez.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} a near-future, post-apocalyptic world. The team {{wanted to}} try {{something}} different, unwilling to return to a setting that was similar to Resistance 3. Instead of depicting a world with a dark atmosphere and gritty environments, the catastrophe that occurs in the game's story line is referred to as an [...] "awesomepocalypse” that transforms the user's initial view [...] of the game's world as a [...] "playground" [...] for players to explore and do whatever they want – [...] "emphasizing the fun of free [...] during end times." [...] The goal was to make players feel that the post-apocalyptic world in Sunset Overdrive is fun and limitless, delighting and lively, instead of a place that is dreadful and worrying. To achieve this, vibrant and vivid colors were used to create the game's world and the team hoped that by tweaking the nature of the setting, the game would be [...] "self-aware, humorous, and fun". The team also intentionally avoided creating a very serious tone because the final product needed to be entertaining and comparable to games like Crazy Taxi and Jet Grind Radio, instead of <b>something</b> <b>too</b> serious that looked like an interactive movie. The team emphasized [...] "fun trumps realism" [...] and reflected that through the [...] "Next-gen Respawn" [...] system, unrealistic weaponry, and the game's visual style.|$|E
2500|$|Magical realism is {{referred}} to in the 2015 Netflix series Narcos, which opens with a title card, from which the narrator reads: [...] "Magical realism is defined as what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by <b>something</b> <b>too</b> strange to believe. There is a reason magical realism was born in Colombia".|$|E

2500|$|The {{terms are}} broadly {{descriptive}} rather than critically rigorous. Matthew Strecher defines magic realism as [...] "what {{happens when a}} highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by <b>something</b> <b>too</b> strange to believe". Many writers are categorized as [...] "magical realists", which confuses the term and its wide definition. Magical realism {{is often associated with}} Latin American literature, particularly authors including genre founders Miguel Angel Asturias, Jorge Luis Borges, Elena Garro, Juan Rulfo, Rómulo Gallegos, Gabriel García Márquez and Isabel Allende. In English literature, its chief exponents include Salman Rushdie, Alice Hoffman, and Nick Joaquin.|$|E
