25|$|In India, {{five players}} in IPL Season 5 (2012) were {{suspended}} for <b>spot-fixing.</b> The five players were Mohnish Mishra, Shalabh Srivastava, TP Sudhindra, Harmeet Singh and Abhinav Bali. The suspensions {{were not for}} any specific event during the season, but a sting operation revealed all five either discussing earlier cases of <b>spot-fixing</b> they had been involved in, or seeking future <b>spot-fixing</b> opportunities.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} Twenty20 cricket {{is said to}} have made <b>spot-fixing</b> more {{difficult}} to detect in cricket, because the faster and more variable nature of the game makes anomalies related to <b>spot-fixing</b> less visible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spot-fixing</b> {{attempts}} to defraud bookmakers by a player taking a pre-arranged action {{to fix the}} result of that specific event. <b>Spot-fixing</b> differs from match fixing, in which the final result of a match is fixed; or point shaving, in which corrupt players (or officials) attempt to limit the margin of victory of the favoured team. <b>Spot-fixing</b> is more difficult to detect than match fixing or point shaving, and by its nature can be perpetrated by a lone fraudulent player without needing any other players or officials to co-operate. The growth of internet gambling and increased variety of betting options (e.g. spread betting, first-scorer betting) resulted in the emergence of <b>spot-fixing,</b> particularly through {{the first decade of the}} 2000s.|$|E
5000|$|Chandila had {{allegedly}} received [...] from bookies in the 2013 IPL season, {{of which}} [...] {{was paid to}} him to <b>spot-fix</b> in the match against Mumbai Indians on 17 May 2013 before which he was arrested. After being arrested, he was immediately suspended by his employer, Air India. In January 2016, {{he was given a}} life ban from all forms of cricket by the BCCI.|$|R
40|$|The {{motions of}} the subducting and the {{overriding}} plates influence the spatial and temporal distribution of back-arc spreading. Cenozoic plate motions in hot <b>spot-fixed</b> and no-net-rotation reference frames were studied with attention to correlations between changes in motion and episodes of back-arc spreading in the western Pacific. The results suggest that major back-arc opening occurs when both the overriding plate retreats from the trench in an absolute sense and the subducting plate undergoes a significant speed-up. Neither phenomenon alone is sufficient to initiate spreading. Three major plate velocity increases can be identified in the Cenozoic: (1) the Pacific plate 5 - 9 Ma; (2) the Indian plate at 27 Ma; and (3) the Pacific plate at 43 Ma, due to its shift from northerly to more westerly motion. At the present time, the Indian and Philippine are the only overriding plates that are retreating from their Pacific trenches and back-arc spreading occurs only on these two retreating plates. Although the Indian plate has been retreating for at least 25 Ma, back-arc spreading began only following the Pacific plate speed-up 5 - 9 Ma. Earlier, during the Indian plate speed-up, no overriding plates were retreating strongly and no back-arc spreading epsiodes are preserved from this time. For the earliest Pacific plate shift at 43 Ma, the Eurasian plate was not advancing, thus creating the only favorable plate kinematic conditions in the Cenozoic for back-arc basin formation in this region. It is unclear whether extension in the Japan Sea {{is a result of}} these conditions...|$|R

25|$|Australian rugby league player Ryan Tandy {{was found}} guilty of <b>spot-fixing</b> during a 2010 National Rugby League season match between North Queensland Cowboys and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Tandy, playing for Canterbury-Bankstown, was {{involved}} in <b>spot-fixing</b> the first score of the match to be a North Queensland penalty goal.
