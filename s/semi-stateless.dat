We aim {{to investigate the}} performances of the proposed <b>semi-stateless</b> approach, named “MARS”, over the existing stateless approaches. Mars supports both real-time UDP traffic, and best-effort UDP and TCP traffic. The main objective of MARS is to minimize the end-to-end delay of traffic. The proposed model uses admission control with a temporary reservation process for real-time flows, and regulation techniques for best-effort and real-time flows. The simulations performed with ns- 2 illustrate the advantages of MARS mechanisms. The {{results show that the}} proposed approach achieves better performances over the SWAN model in terms of the average end-to-end delay under non-highly dynamic topology...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades social {{scientists}} have examined the relationship between sport and expressions of nationhood in different national contexts. Research about sport in Scotland has contributed to this broader scholarship. Although Scotland is a <b>semi-stateless</b> nation it is an anomaly since in certain sports it has autonomy on the global stage. Much attention has been given {{to the ways in which}} these sports mediate expressions of Scottish nationhood but research has rarely examined the ways that Scottish/British national identities are manifest in relation to British sports teams. This essay examines newspapers' coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympic women's curling competition. The event was won by Britain, but the team were all Scottish and curling is regarded as a Scottish sport. In broad terms the analysis affirms that global cultural practices such as Olympic sports offer the terrain in which to play out the contested national discourse of stateless nations...|$|E
