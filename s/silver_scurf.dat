50|$|Soil types {{influenced}} {{the development of}} <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> to a great extent, both at harvest season and the following three-month storage period. Some soils displayed suppressiveness in different levels. The results from experimental trials revealed a significant negative correlation between <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> disease severity, and soil NO3 content and Fe availability. NO3 had been negatively correlated with <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> disease previously. This provides a possible suppressive effect of these two soil components. NO3 is an efficient nitrogen source used by H. solani. Therefore, a direct adverse effect between <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> and NO3 {{is not likely to}} happen. A probable explanation for this observation is that NO3 could function on other soil microorganisms which possibly act as H. solani antagonists. These results indicated that microbial antagonists may be the key components contributing to soil suppressiveness and their antagonists may lead efficient biological control of <b>silver</b> <b>scurf.</b>|$|E
50|$|When <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> {{was first}} found in Moscow in 1871, it was {{considered}} as a minor plant disease. After an increase in <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> incidence from America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, China, and New Zealand since 1968, the disease was later considered a pathogen of major importance. Although the disease did not cause potato yield losses and only affected the cosmetic appearance of the tuber, it had {{a huge impact on}} the potato market. With growing consumer demands for attractive appearance in fresh market cultivars, <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> on potatoes with blemishes and discoloration have been rejected by the industry. Furthermore, the <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> causes water loss which makes it difficult to peel the tubers. The excess tuber shrinkage also causes weight loss in tubers. From the cosmetic effect, dehydration, and weight loss of the tubers, the fresh market is facing major economic losses from the disease even today. For example, the Idaho's potato industry lost about 7 to 8.5 million dollars from the <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> disease. Not only does the cost come from rejecting <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> diseased potatoes, but it also comes from an increase in the amount of time needed for sorting and inspecting every potato.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>scurf</b> is a {{plant disease}} that {{is caused by}} the plant {{pathogen}} Helminthosporium solani. This pathogen is a fungus which is specific to infecting only potato tubers. <b>Silver</b> <b>scurf</b> is a blemish disease, meaning the effect it has on tubers is mostly cosmetic and affects “fresh market, processing and seed tuber potatoes." [...] There are some reports of it affecting development, meaning growth and tuber yield. This is caused by light brown lesions, which in turn change the permeability of tuber skin and then it causes tuber shrinkage and water loss, which finally causes weight loss. The disease has become economically important because <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> affected potatoes for processing and direct consumption have been rejected by the industry. The disease cycle can be divided into two stages: field and storage. It is mainly a seed borne disease and the primary source of inoculum is mainly infected potato seed tubers. Symptoms develop and worsen in storage because the conditions are conducive to sporulation. The ideal conditions for the spread of this disease are high temperatures and high humidity. There are also many cultural practices that favor spread and development. Luckily, there are multiple ways to help control the disease.|$|E
50|$|As the {{frequency}} of resistant isolates to TBZ increase, some other fungicides have been tested to control <b>silver</b> <b>scurf,</b> such as imazalil, prochloraz and propiconazole fungicides, which are all classified in conazole, DMI (demethylation inhibitors). Imazalil and prochloraz fungicides are commonly used in seed treatment, while propiconazole fungicide is usually for foliar treatment.|$|E
50|$|Diseases {{resistances}} {{for this}} variety include, field immune to potato wart {{and it is}} highly resistant to PVA and PVY. Also, Vivaldi is moderately resistant to leaf roll, PVX, late blight on tuber, <b>silver</b> <b>scurf,</b> blackleg and black dot and is moderately susceptible to late blight on leaves, common scab, powdery scab, rhizoctonia and skin spot.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} {{microbes}} that cause similar damage to potato crops to S. scabies. In the UK {{the most common}} are the powdery scab caused by the protist Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea and <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> and black dot caused by the fungi Helminthosporium solani and Colletotrichum coccodes respectively. Netted scab {{is thought to be}} caused by other species including S. reticuliscabiei.|$|E
5000|$|Effective {{chemical}} control of dry rot {{can be achieved}} with chemicals like Tops MZ, Maxim MZ, and Moncoat MZ. These chemicals protect not only against dry rot, but also against other potato diseases like rhizoctonia, <b>silver</b> <b>scurf,</b> and black dot. These chemical treatments can delay emergence of the young plants, but this doesn't mean these chemicals shouldn't be used. Many fungicides, including thiabendazole, work best when they are applied to tubers before they are cut into seed pieces.|$|E
50|$|The disease {{cycle of}} <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> {{can be divided}} in two phases (field and storage). The primary source of {{inoculum}} is infected potato seed tubers. This inoculum is then transferred to the daughter tubers through an unknown mechanism, although indirect evidence suggests it happens {{when they come in}} direct contact or close proximity to daughter tubers. Conidia produced on the surface of seed tubers are dispersed by rain or irrigation to uninfected tubers. These conidia germinate and infect tubers. The pathogen enters through the periderm or lenticels. After that, the pathogen colonizes the periderm cells in the tuber. Infection may happen when tubers are formed and can continue in the season. In harvest (mostly in summer), <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> symptoms are not too apparent. However, the symptoms develop and worsen due relatively humid and warm temperatures in storage, since these conditions are conducive to sporulation. Secondary inoculum is produced by conidia, which can spread in storage by wind of ventilation while the tubers are in storage. When a seed tuber from this storage is planted, this can then carry inoculum to the field. It was believed that overwintering soil-borne inoculum wasn’t important in the disease cycle, but recent studies suggest H.solani may survive in the soil {{for a short period of}} time, which can cause more infection.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>scurf</b> is a {{plant disease}} of potato, {{which is caused}} by the {{anamorphic}} ascomycete fungus, Helminthosporium Solani. Potato tubers are the only known host of Helminthosporium solani. It is a highly specific pathogen which does not have a secondary host or alternate host. A common symptom of this disease is blemishing {{on the surface of the}} potato tubers. These blemishes are tan and/or gray due to a loss of pigment, and they are usually irregularly shaped. Also, a post-harvest symptom can be shrinkage and shriveling of the outer tissue of the potato due to water loss. Black spots can also be found on the surface of infected tubers, which are a sign of the disease. These are made up of conidia and conidiophores of the pathogenic fungus. [...] The conidia are characterized by being very darkly melanized and having multiple pseudosepta. Another characteristic of this fungus is the absence of motile spores.|$|E
50|$|Acremonium strictum is {{generally}} {{known as a}} mycoparasite, as shown in its antagonistic relationship with Helminthosporium solani. H. solani is a potato (Solanum tuberosum) associated fungus, that has caused extreme and widespread losses in all market classes of potatoes since emerging in the United States. Commonly referred to as <b>silver</b> <b>scurf,</b> H. solani causes blemishes that decreases {{the quality of the}} crop, making it unfit for marketing. In more severe cases, H. solani causes weight loss in potatoes and creates lesions in the periderm, creating entry points for other tuber pathogens. In pure cultures of H. solani, isolates show white sectoring and rings, differential coloration and reduced sporulation in culture. Upon infection of A. strictum, cultures of H. solani were uniformly black, without white sectors or rings. A. strictum was able to significantly reduce sporulation of H. solani by 30%, spore germination by 20%, and mycelial growth 8% in culture. This evidence suggests that A. strictum may be used as a biological control agent against H. solani, which would greatly increase potato crop yields.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the effects of irrigation and soil management on potato tuber diseases. Supplemental irrigation, soil amendment and crop rotation can improve potato growth and tuber yield under drought stress conditions, but may also increase potato tuber diseases. The effects of irrigation, soil amendment and crop rotation on the incidence of tuber diseases were quantified from 1994 to 1997 in potato plots. Surface sprinkler irrigation was applied each year, based on tensiometer or moisture block readings deployed in field plots. Black scurf (Rhizoctonia solani), black dot (Colletotricchum coccodes), <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> (Helminthosporium solani) and common scab (Streptomyces scabei) diseases were quantified on potato tubers randomly sampled at harvest and kept at storage temperature of 7. 2 °C before visual disease assessment. The incidence of tuber diseases varied among irrigation treatments, crop rotations and soil amendments. The mean incidence of black scurf, <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> and black dot ranged from 3 - 18, 2 - 33 and 4 - 7 %, in best, un-irrigated and reduced irrigation, respectively. The incidence of back scurf, <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> and black dot diseases ranged from 2. 4 - 10, 0. 8 - 21 and 1 - 31 % on potato tubers grown in plots under green manure rotation crop (peas/vetch).

Lisäkokeita tarvitaan mm. perunan juurenasutuksesta ja kantojen estovaikutuksista juuristo-oloissaThe causal {{agents of}} Potato scab, S. scapies, S. turbidiscapies and S. aureofaciens spoil {{the quality of}} tubers, slow down the {{formation}} of potato seedlings, {{increase the number of}} small sized tubers and therefore can {{have a significant impact on}} the potato harvest. Sometimes the technical methods applied in the potato farming are not effective enough and there are no chemical means available to prevent potato scab. In this work the properties of selected Finnish Actinomyces-isolates were studied from the point of view of biological control. Both potato scab forming and stains that do not cause visible signs of potato scab in tubers were selected for the study. The purpose was to study the ability of the stains to inhibit the growth of potato scab bacteria in different pH-conditions. In addition the ability of Streptomyces-strains to inhibit the growth of <b>silver</b> <b>scurf,</b> stem cancer and black scurf was studied. The competitive balance between different Actinomyces and fungal strains was tested on plates. Greenhouse tests were used to study the root infesting of Actinomyces strains. Streptomyces strains inhibited each others growth. This inhibition was not linked to scab. All strains tested prevented the growth of <b>silver</b> <b>scurf</b> and ps pathogens but strains S. griseoviridis ja 16 IV turned out being especially effective in preventing. All strains grew in pH-conditions 5. 5 - 8. 0. An unknown Streptomyces strain 16 IV did not grow well in pH 5. 5 and S. turbidiscapies which is known to persist in acidic conditions grew well also in pH 8. 0. All tested strains colonized potato root. The study showed that some of the isolates had potential for future studies in biological control. More research is needed to study the root colonization and the antagonism properties of selected strains in root conditions.
