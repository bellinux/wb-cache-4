40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Recently, the {{fabrication}} of organic photovoltaic devices from water-dispersed nanoparticulate materials (<b>solar</b> <b>paint)</b> has attracted increasing interest since {{it offers the}} potential of morphological control coupled with device processing {{in the absence of}} organic solvents which are toxic to human beings and the environment. However, to date the reported efficiencies of nanoparticulate organic photovoltaic (NP-OPV) devices have been disappointingly low compared to the standard organic photovoltaic devices. This low efficiency reflects a lack of understanding of the structural motif of NP-OPV devices. Furthermore {{the fabrication}} conditions used for NP-OPV devices are not well determined as yet. To improve NP-OPV device performance, understanding the structural motive of NP-OPV devices is necessary and OPTIMISED fabrication conditions for NP-OPV need to be determined. By using relevant techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we analyse and optimise the conditions for fabricating NP-OPV devices and show a significant improvement in efficiency as compared to previous work. Using calcium and lithium fluoride interface layers between the aluminium and the active layer were also investigated in this project. It is found that proper thickness of the interface also contributes to improving the performance of NP-OPV devices. In this project poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) is used as the electron donor and phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM), phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 71 BM), and indene-C 60 -bisadduct (ICBA) as the electron acceptors. The highest efficiency of nanoparticle devices fabricated for P 3 HT:PC 61 BM is 1. 36 %; for P 3 HT:PC 71 BM is 2. 00 %; and for P 3 HT:ICBA is 3. 29 % which are by far the highest efficiencies reported so far for each system. Moreover an efficiency of 3. 29 % is the highest efficiency for NP-OPV devices reported. In this project we also investigate the structural motive of NP-OPV devices and find that for P 3 HT:PC 61 BM nanoparticles, the particles are core-shell in nature with a PC 61 BM-rich core and a P 3 HT-rich shell. For P 3 HT:ICBA nanoparticles, the particles are also core-shell in nature with a P 3 HT-rich shell and ICBA-rich core but upon annealing a highly intermixed P 3 HT:ICBA is formed, which is driven by the enhanced miscibility of ICBA in crystalline P 3 HT and this morphological change results in much higher device efficiencies...|$|E

A Ni-Al 2 O 3 absorber was pyrolytically coated with SnO 2 to improve its coating quality. Undesirable increase of solar reflectance obtained {{as a result of}} the SnO 2 was reduced by applying a silica antireflection layer produced by a dipping technique from colloidal silica sol. Annealing of Ni particles in an Al 2 O 3 matrix was also carried out and compared to particles heated without the matrix. Due to the Al 2 O 3 matrix, a much slower oxidation rate was found for the embedded particles. In addition, the optical performance of commercial Ni-Al 2 O 3 and Ni-NiOx absorbers were experimentally compared at oblique incidence. A better solar-absorptance of the Ni-Al 2 O 3 at higher angles of incidence was found. This is due to enhanced optical interference in the double-layer structure of Ni-Al 2 O 3, which could not be achieved in the graded index film of Ni-NiOx. The optical properties of Si-Al 2 O 3 films of different thicknesses have been investigated by preparing the films using an integral coloration method. The solar-absorptance and thermal-emittance were found to increase with increasing film thickness. Due to high thermal-emittance, the Si-Al 2 O 3 coating shows non-selective absorbing properties. Its feasibility for a selective solar absorber was studied by modeling the coating as a function of coating thickness for different particle size and volume fraction using four-flux theory. The results indicated that the Si-Al 2 O 3 coating is not a suitable candidate for selective solar absorbers. Scattering and absorption cross-sections of FeMnCuOx and black carbon pigments have been obtained from reflectance and transmittance measurements in the solar wavelength range. The cross-sections were determined by using pellets consisting of low pigment volume fractions dispersed in KBr matrix. The cross-sections exhibit linear dependence of the volume fraction, indicating that single scattering dominates. The cross-sections were used to model the optical properties of <b>solar</b> selective <b>paints</b> using four-flux model resulting in good agreement between calculations and experiments...|$|R
