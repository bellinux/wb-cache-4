50|$|The court {{challenge}} originated {{after the}} 1993 general federal election, when the CPC failed to field at least 50 candidates. Under the then Canada Elections Act, {{which had been}} amended {{just prior to the}} 1993 vote by the former Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, a registered federal party which fails to run at least 50 candidates in a general election would not only be automatically de-registered, but would also be <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> its <b>net</b> assets which would then {{be turned over to the}} Government of Canada.|$|R

In July, 1898, the Marconi telegraphy was employed to report the results of yacht races at the Kingstown Regatta for the Dublin Express newspaper. A set of instruments were fitted up in a room at Kingstown, and another on board a steamer, the Flying Huntress.

NET managed code, {{able to run}} on a <b>stripped</b> versions <b>of</b> the. <b>NET</b> platform (e. g., Compact Framework) and still generic enough to be used on. NET or other CLI compatible frameworks. Such a component is not normally provided with stock libraries in their compact version, since its implementation is quite tricky when relying on reduced reflection services. However, this component makes easier the development of distributed applications involving mobile devices and desktop computers or mainframes. Our implementation faced several problems ranging from lack of features in the base classes to the interframework portability problem, since the same object could have different implementation. The resulting product shows satisfactory performance figures and has a modular and flexible architecture...|$|R

40|$|Aggressive {{environmental}} conditions as moisture, temperature and presence of salts, {{may affect the}} interfacial behaviour of FRCM bonded to masonry. To check the effectiveness of intervention solid clay brick samples and masonry assemblages including mortar joints were investigated. <b>Strips</b> <b>of</b> carbon fibre <b>nets</b> were applied with a cementitious or a lime based matrices. Specimens were exposed to salt crystallisation tests, according to a RILEM procedure, and to thermal cycles with a temperature variation ranging between - 10 °C and + 70 °C. The characteristic size of damage of the samples were monitored by visual observation and laser profilometer; the loss of bond of the composites was verified by pull-off test. Tests results showed different behaviour between the inorganic matrices applied on bricks having different strengths. Moreover, the adhesion strength was affected {{by the presence of}} bed joints. The adherence of the specimens of cement matrix depends from the type of substrate and his damage. Specimens of lime matrix do not seem to have a relation between damage of the substrate and adherence, as the failure occurred at the interface matrix/strengthening...|$|R
