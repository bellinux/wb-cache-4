5|$|Following Turning Point, A.J. Styles {{tried to}} unite Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance. On the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact, Christian Cage became {{leader of a}} joint alliance, until Kurt Angle and Robert Roode {{attacked}} him {{at the end of}} the episode. This led to Angle defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008. There, Angle defeated Cage after Styles attacked Cage, effectively <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Angle Alliance. The two fought again for the title at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008, where Tomko cost Cage the title, <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Angle Alliance as well.|$|E

25|$|Most American Indians {{east of the}} Mississippi River were {{affected}} by the war, and many tribes were divided over {{the question of how}} to respond to the conflict.

Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on <b>the</b> British <b>side,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> largest group coming from the Iroquois tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may {{reflect the fact that}} the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was {{to have a chance to}} succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Kurt Angle, who was {{accompanied}} by Karen Angle, fought Christian Cage. The duration of the match was eighteen minutes and forty-five seconds. Near the end, Angle performed his signature Angle Slam maneuver, resulting in a near-fall. Cage then performed his signature Unprettier maneuver, also resulting in a near-fall. Angle attempted his ankle lock submission maneuver which was countered by Cage {{into one of his}} own. Angle soon submitted to the hold, however the referee was distracted by the Karen. A.J. Styles ran down to the ring and pulled Karen away from the ring. Styles then hugged Cage, before springboarding off the top rope and bashing Cage {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm, effectively <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Angle Alliance. Angle then performed the Angle Slam to gain the victory and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E

5|$|This {{was not an}} {{encouraging}} start for the operation but despite this, the LCS decided {{to continue with the}} deception. Colonel Thornton's trip was approved and he travelled to Stockholm toward the end of April. Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences were treated with a high degree of secrecy in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's conversations were recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, but he kept this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Borneo Campaign {{to retake}} the territory, Allied forces bombed {{most of the major}} towns under Japanese control, {{including}} Sandakan, which was razed to the ground. The Japanese ran a brutal prisoner of war camp known as Sandakan camp for those <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British. The majority of the POWs were British and Australian soldiers captured after the fall of Malaya and Singapore. The prisoners suffered notoriously inhuman conditions, and amidst continuous Allied bombardments, the Japanese to forced them to march into Ranau, which is about 260kilometres away, in an event known as the Sandakan Death March. The number of prisoners were reduced to 2,345, with many of them killed en route by either friendly fire or by the Japanese. Only six of the several hundred Australian prisoners lived to see the war's end. In addition, of the total of 17,488 Javanese labourers brought in by the Japanese during the occupation, only 1,500 survived mainly due to starvation, harsh working conditions and maltreatment. In March 1945, Australian forces launched Operation Agas in order to gather intelligence in the region and launch guerilla warfare against the Japanese. The war ended on 10 September 1945 after the Australian Imperial Forces (AIF) succeeded in the battle of North Borneo.|$|E
5|$|During the Boshin War of 1868-69, the Nanbu clan {{initially}} {{attempted to}} remain neutral. However, {{under the leadership}} of Nanbu Toshihisa and the karō Narayama Sado, the Nanbu clan later sided with the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei). On September 23, 1868, the Nanbu clan's troops joined in the attack on the Akita Domain, which had seceded from the alliance and sided with the imperial government. By October 7, Nanbu troops took Ōdate, one of the Akita Domain's castles. However, due to the collapse of the alliance, the Nanbu clan surrendered to the imperial army on October 29, 1868. After the war, the Nanbu clan's holdings were drastically reduced by the imperial government as punishment for <b>siding</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> northern alliance. While Hachinohe and Shichinohe Domains survived intact, a large area of what is now northeastern Aomori Prefecture was given as a resettlement zone for former samurai of Aizu Domain. The Nanbu were also briefly expelled from Morioka itself, and were assigned new lands surrounding the vacant Shiroishi Castle before being allowed to returned to Morioka a few months later. Two years after the war, as with all other daimyō, the heads of all three Nanbu branches were relieved of their offices by the abolition of the han system.|$|E
