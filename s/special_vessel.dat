6000|$|Stanley, {{a man of}} some intelligence--witness {{his grasp}} of the secret of {{successful}} plough-making (none for the home market!)--had often considered this important proposition of phlegm. People said England was becoming degenerate and hysterical, growing soft, and nervous, and towny, {{and all the rest}} of it. In his view there was a good deal of bosh about that! [...] "Look," [...] he would say, [...] "at the weight that chauffeurs put on! Look at the House of Commons, and the size of the upper classes!" [...] If there were growing up little shrill types of working men and Socialists, and new women, and half-penny papers, and a rather larger crop of professors and long-haired chaps--all the better for the rest of the country! The flesh all these skimpy ones had lost, solid people had put on. The country might be suffering a bit from officialism, and the tendency of modern thought, but the breed was not changing. John Bull was there all right under his moustache. Take it off and clap on little side-whiskers, and you had as many Bulls as you liked, any day. There would be no social upheaval so long as the climate was what it was! And with this simple formula, and a kind of very deep-down throaty chuckle, he would pass to a subject of more immediate importance. There was something, indeed, rather masterly in his grasp of the fact that rain might be trusted to put out any fire--give it time. And he kept a <b>special</b> <b>vessel</b> in a special corner which recorded for him faithfully the number of inches that fell; and now and again he wrote to his paper to say that there were more inches in his vessel than there had been [...] "for thirty years." [...] His conviction that the country was in a bad way was nothing but a skin affection, causing him local irritation rather than affecting the deeper organs of his substantial body.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Epidemiologic {{investigations}} of the Latin America cholera epidemic have repeatedly implicated untreated drinking water and water touched by hands during storage as important vehicles for disease transmission. To prevent such transmission, we provided a new narrow-mouthed, plastic, water storage vessel and 5 % calcium hypochlorite solution for home disinfection of stored water to a Bolivian Aymara Indian community at risk for cholera. We evaluated acceptance of this intervention {{and its effect on}} water quality. Each of 42 families in the study obtained water from a household well; fecal coliform bacteria were found in water from 39 (93 %) of 42 wells and 33 (79 %) of 42 usual water storage vessels. One group of families received the <b>special</b> <b>vessels</b> and chlorine (group A), a second received only the <b>special</b> <b>vessels</b> (group B), and a third served as a control group (group C). Water samples collected every three weeks from group A <b>special</b> <b>vessels</b> had lower geometric mean fecal coliform colony counts (P < 0. 0001) and lower geometric mean Escherichia coil colony counts (P < 0. 0001) than water from group B or C vessels.

50|$|The {{coffee grounds}} are then {{put into a}} <b>special</b> <b>vessel,</b> called a jebena, and boiled. A jebena is usually made of clay and has a spherical base, a neck and pouring spout and a handle where the neck connects with the base.

Spock is taken by Jones' beauty and her ability to observe Kollos without its maddening effects.

40|$|With current {{construction}} technology of offshore wind turbines, {{there is a}} need for a major marine spread to install the foundation, tower and turbine. There is a clear benefit that offshore installation can be integrated into one operation. The large-scale composite bucket foundation is a basis for the one-step integrated transportation and installation technique with a <b>special</b> <b>vessel.</b> The proposed transportation and installation technique will minimize offshore spread and maximize the proportion of work carried out onshore with consequent benefits in terms of cost, quality and safety. The composite bucket foundation with self-floating property would be towing into a semicircle groove of the vessel and connected with wireropes of the fixed crane. Afterwards, tower and turbine are attached onto the foundation at shore and the whole unit of foundation, tower and turbine is loaded out from the quayside, transported to site and set down on the seabed. During transportation, half of the unit weight is taken by the hoisting system of the vessel and other weight is supported by air cushions inside the composite bucket foundation. A detailed case is studied to determine the motions of the vessel with two units to confirm the viability and feasibility of such a method of the integrated transportation. The transportation and installation methodology are developed to reduce the time spent on offshore works in order to fit the installation work within the time windows with great economic benefits...|$|E
40|$|Jelo lives {{among the}} Chukch {{reindeer}} herders. In autumn, a helicopter forcibly takes {{children to school}} and brings provisions for the winter which everyone can take from the warehouse according to his needs. Since school education results in Russification, reindeer herders are mostly older men. One morning Jelo wakes {{to find out that}} it is the young reindeer holiday (qaanmatgörgön), consisting of two holidays. First is the day of killing young thin-furred reindeer (teetawhögögön) for summer skins. As the weather becomes colder and the reindeer fur thicker, the second reindeer holiday (wöllgönqaanmatgörön) takes place where reindeer are killed for winter skins. Fire can not be lighted from a match on these days but has to be lighted with traditional means; the coals are kept then overnight in a <b>special</b> <b>vessel.</b> The Chukch clad in festive clothes and the reindeer herd is let loose. They catch a black-and-white patched male calf, cow and bull chosen last night by the wiseman guided by spirits. These reindeer are traditionally sacrificed with a ritual spear - first the bull, then cow and calf. People smear each other's faces with blood of the sacrified animals and also mark the natas. It brings bad luck to wash the blood off and thus people look blood-striped {{for the next couple of}} days until the dried blood comes off. The reindeer heads are put on top of staves and leftt here. Next come festivities at the fire, culminating in people becoming crazed from eating mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) ...|$|E

40|$|MCS(Multi Channel Seismic Survey) is {{used for}} purpose of an {{investigation}} in a focal region and submarine resource-searching {{all over the world}} in recent years. <b>Special</b> <b>vessel</b> for MSC is often also built all over the world. But an environmental protection group shows the suspicion by which a high-power air gun source of MCS has an influence upon ecology of a marine mammal. Therefore the user of MCS is requesting always to watch a marine mammal. So JAMSTEC made a guideline to protect a marine mammal independently. When finding a marine mammal in a watch area, this guideline has decided that an air gun is stopped. But this guideline followed the example of foreign countries. An American researcher was planning a crustal structure investigation in the Hawaii Islands neighborhood jointly with JAMSTEC in 2014. But the opposite of an environmental protection group made them cancel a plan. To check influence to a marine mammal by this research, PE method suitable for long-distance propagation analysis was used. The distribution of the acoustic propagation attenuation and a receiving pulse from the offing in the Hawaii Islands to the Alaska offing were calculated by PE method. The air gun source used for a simulation is loaded into a new research vessel of JAMSTEC "KAIYO".
