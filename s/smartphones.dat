40|$|Background and Aims <b>Smartphone</b> addiction, its {{association}} with <b>smartphone</b> use, and its predictors {{have not yet been}} studied in a European sample. This study investigated indicators of <b>smartphone</b> use, <b>smartphone</b> addiction, and their associations with demographic and health behaviour-related variables in young people. Methods A convenience sample of 1, 519 students from 127 Swiss vocational school classes participated in a survey assessing demographic and health-related characteristics as well as indicators of <b>smartphone</b> use and addiction. <b>Smartphone</b> addiction was assessed using a short version of the <b>Smartphone</b> Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SAS-SV). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate demographic and health-related predictors of <b>smartphone</b> addiction. Results <b>Smartphone</b> addiction occurred in 256 (16. 9 %) of the 1, 519 students. Longer duration of <b>smartphone</b> use on a typical day, a shorter time period until first <b>smartphone</b> use in the morning, and reporting that social networking was the most personally relevant <b>smartphone</b> function were associated with <b>smartphone</b> addiction. <b>Smartphone</b> addiction was more prevalent in younger adolescents (15 - 16 years) compared with young adults (19 years and older), students with both parents born outside Switzerland, persons reporting lower physical activity, and those reporting higher stress. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were unrelated to <b>smartphone</b> addiction. Discussion Different indicators of <b>smartphone</b> use are associated with <b>smartphone</b> addiction and subgroups of young people have a higher prevalence of <b>smartphone</b> addiction. Conclusions The study provides the first insights into <b>smartphone</b> use, <b>smartphone</b> addiction, and predictors of <b>smartphone</b> addiction in young people from a European country, which should be extended in further studies...|$|R
40|$|Despite a huge {{spike in}} <b>smartphone</b> overuse, the {{cognitive}} and emotional consequences of <b>smartphone</b> overuse have rarely been examined empirically. In two studies, we investigated whether separation from a <b>smartphone</b> influences state anxiety and impairs higher-order cognitive processes, such as executive functions. We found that <b>smartphone</b> separation causes heightened anxiety, which in turn mediates the adverse effect of <b>smartphone</b> separation on all core aspects of executive functions, including shifting (Experiment 1) and inhibitory control and working-memory capacity (Experiment 2). Interestingly, impaired mental shifting was evident regardless {{of the extent of}} <b>smartphone</b> addiction, whereas <b>smartphone</b> addiction significantly moderated the negative effect of <b>smartphone</b> separation on inhibitory control, as assessed by the Stroop task.

40|$|The {{advent of}} the <b>smartphone</b> has {{dramatically}} altered how we communicate, navigate, work and entertain ourselves. While the advantages of this new technology are clear, constant use may also bring negative consequences, such as a loss of productivity due to interruptions in work life. A link between <b>smartphone</b> overuse and loss of productivity has often been hypothesized, but empirical evidence on this question is scarce. The present study addressed this question by collecting self-report data from N= 262 participants, assessing private and work-related <b>smartphone</b> use, <b>smartphone</b> addiction and self-rated productivity. Our results indicate a moderate relationship between <b>smartphone</b> addiction and a self-reported decrease in productivity due to spending time on the <b>smartphone</b> during work, {{as well as with}} the number of work hours lost to <b>smartphone</b> use. <b>Smartphone</b> addiction was also related to a greater amount of leisure time spent on the <b>smartphone</b> and was strongly related to a negative impact of <b>smartphone</b> use on daily non-work related activities. These data support the idea that tendencies towards <b>smartphone</b> addiction and overt checking of the <b>smartphone</b> could result in less productivity both in the workplace and at home.

In the right end of the distribution of <b>smartphone</b> usage, concepts such as <b>smartphone</b> addiction seem warranted. An area that so far lacks research concerns the effect of <b>smartphone</b> restriction generally and specifically on subjective withdrawal related scores across different degrees of <b>smartphone</b> usage. The present study examined withdrawal related scores on the <b>Smartphone</b> Withdrawal Scale (SWS), the Fear of Mission Out Scale (FoMOs) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scale during a <b>smartphone</b> restriction period, lasting 72 hours. In all, 127 participants were randomly assigned into one of two conditions; a restricted condition (n= 67) or a control condition (n= 60). During the restriction period, the aforementioned scales were completed three times a day by the participants. The results revealed a significant difference in scores between the restricted condition and the control condition on the SWS. Further, the participants with higher scores on <b>smartphone</b> addiction in the restricted condition were, compared to those with lower scores on <b>smartphone</b> addiction, significantly more negatively affected by the <b>smartphone</b> restriction condition, according to the SWS and the PANAS (Negative Affect) than those with higher and lower addiction scores in the control condition.

40|$|Background: <b>Smartphone</b> overdependence {{is a type}} {{of mental}} {{disorder}} that requires continuous treatment for cure and prevention. A <b>smartphone</b> overdependence management system that is based on scientific evidence is required. This study proposes the design, development and implementation of a <b>smartphone</b> overdependence management system for self-control of smart devices. Methods: The system architecture of the <b>Smartphone</b> Overdependence Management System (SOMS) primarily consists of four sessions of mental monitoring: (1) Baseline settlement session; (2) Assessment session; (3) Sensing & monitoring session; and (4) Analysis and feedback session. We developed the smartphone-usage-monitoring application (app) and MindsCare personal computer (PC) app to receive and integrate usage data from <b>smartphone</b> users. We analyzed <b>smartphone</b> usage data using the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID). Based on the baseline settlement results, we designed a feedback service to intervene. We implemented the system using 96 participants for testing and validation. The participants were classified into two groups: the <b>smartphone</b> usage control group (SUC) and the <b>smartphone</b> usage disorder addiction group (SUD). Results: The background <b>smartphone</b> monitoring app of the proposed system successfully monitored the <b>smartphone</b> usage based on the developed algorithm. The usage minutes of the SUD were higher than the usage minutes of the SUC in 11 of the 16 categories developed in our study. Via the MindsCare PC app, the data were successfully integrated and stored, and managers can successfully analyze and diagnose based on the monitored data. Conclusion: The SOMS is a new system that is based on integrated personalized data for evidence-based <b>smartphone</b> overdependence intervention. The SOMS is useful for managing usage data, diagnosing <b>smartphone</b> overdependence, classifying usage patterns and predicting <b>smartphone</b> overdependence. This system contributes to the diagnosis of an abstract mental status, such as <b>smartphone</b> overdependence, based on specific scientific indicators without reliance on consultation...|$|R
