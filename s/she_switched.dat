5|$|It {{was around}} this time that <b>she</b> <b>switched</b> from {{attending}} the local Congregational church, {{where she had been}} baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church.

He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was devoutly religious, actively supported her new church as she had her old.|$|E
