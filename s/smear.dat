5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap <b>smear</b> (also called a cervical <b>smear),</b> in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap <b>smear</b> was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap <b>smear,</b> is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the <b>smear</b> will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap <b>smear</b> can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{sensitivity}} of cervical cytology for detection of glandular lesions {{is reported to}} be low. We conducted this study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) <b>smears</b> for uterine glandular lesions and to compare the diagnostic utility of conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) <b>smears</b> for glandular lesions. Materials and Methods: Archived histopathology records of all cases reported as endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma in the study period were identified and the available corresponding Pap <b>smears</b> (in preceding 1 year) were retrieved. In addition, the Pap <b>smears</b> reported as glandular cell abnormalities (GCA) during the same study period were retrieved. The overall prevalence of GCA, sensitivity, and specificity of Pap <b>smears</b> for the detection of GCA was calculated. The diagnostic accuracy of conventional and LBC <b>smears</b> for the diagnosis of GCA was also compared. Results: The prevalence of GCA in our study was 0. 32 %. The overall specificity of Pap <b>smears</b> for the diagnosis of GCA was 60. 8 %, this was not significantly different between conventional and LBC <b>smears</b> (P = 0. 4). The overall {{sensitivity of}} Pap <b>smears</b> for the detection of GCA was 41. 8 %; LBC <b>smears</b> had significantly better sensitivity as compared to conventional <b>smears</b> for the detection of endometrial as compared to endocervical adenocarcinoma (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The prevalence of GCA in Pap <b>smears</b> is low. The specificity of Pap <b>smears,</b> for diagnosis of GCA, was found to be moderate. However, the overall sensitivity of Pap <b>smears</b> for the detection of GCA was low, though better for LBC as compared to conventional <b>smears...</b>|$|R

The marketing segment targeted for study was women with positive Pap <b>smears.</b> A comparison group of women with negative Pap <b>smears</b> was sampled from the same clinic during the time frame July 1, 1982, to July 1, 1984. Nine research questions were investigated. Responses have been reported relative to the following questions: 1.

Does the incidence of positive Pap <b>smears</b> depend on whether or not a woman smokes? 3. Does the incidence of positive Pap <b>smears</b> depend on the type of contraceptive (pill or barrier) used by a woman? 4. Does the incidence of positive Pap <b>smears</b> depend number of abortions experienced by a woman? 5. Does the incidence of positive Pap <b>smears</b> depend on the number of pregnancies experienced by a woman? 6.

40|$|Objective: To compare, with a {{retrospective}} study, endocervical and metaplastic cell number {{to identify the}} cytology of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) of the cervix.

40|$|Abstract: Covariantly <b>smeared</b> {{sources are}} {{commonly}} used in lattice QCD to enhance the projection onto the ground state.

In particular, as a → 0, iterative procedures like Jacobi <b>smearing</b> require increasingly large iteration counts in order to reach physically-sized <b>smearing</b> radii rsm ∼ 0. 5 fm, and the resulting sources are strongly distorted. To bypass this issue, we propose a covariant <b>smearing</b> procedure (“free-form smearing”) that allows us to create arbitrarily shaped sources, including in particular Gaussians of arbitrary radius...|$|R

40|$|Aim: A {{retrospective}} study was undertaken to investigate {{how to improve}} the diagnosis of endocervical adenocarcinoma in screening programs. Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 29 slides of women diagnosed with cancer but who had negative <b>smears.</b> The slides were subdivided in 12 <b>smears</b> taken {{less than one year}} before diagnosis by histology and 17 <b>smears</b> taken between one and 10 years prior to diagnosis. A hundred <b>smears</b> of healthy women were used for comparison. All <b>smears</b> were studied macroscopically after which both groups of <b>smears</b> were scanned by the Neural Network Scanner (NNS). Differences between groups were studied for statistical significance using Pearson's Chi-squared test. Findings: The macroscopic parameter of these <b>smears</b> found to be present most frequently was a heavy admixture, of blood. The presence of blood (lysed or not) in the <b>smears</b> was equally consistently highlighted by the NNS. Statistical significance of the association of this parameter, with the presence of cancer, was demonstrated. Conclusion: The awareness of blood as a background feature of adenocarcinoma of the cervix will help to select cases needing special attention. These difficult bloody <b>smears,</b> studied by light microscopy and by NNS images can also be selected for additional MiB- 1 staining. With this approach, blood in <b>smears,</b> otherwise frequently leading to a compromise of classification, can become a blessing in disguise.
