40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on a recent {{demographic}} study of the <b>statistical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> between Geraldton and Esperance and an ethnographic survey in that region, undertaken to understand the changes occurring in rural- communities. The paper will then examine the links between continuing depopulation trends and diminishing infrastructure, focusing on how these demographic changes impact on {{the daily lives of}} the Western Australian agricultural population, particularly women, and what effect these changes and government policy are having on the delivery of essential services. The overall population of the region from Geraldton south to Esperance in Western Australia, excluding the metropolitan area, has increased in the years between 1961 and 1996. The Australian Bureau of Statistics 2 ̆ 7 (ABS) twelve statistical divisions show fairly steady population growth and politicians and bureaucrats often cite these statistics as evidence of growth, vibrance and percipient regional planning. However, if the ABS <b>statistical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> are analysed even in a cursory manner, {{it is obvious that the}} increase in population has not been uniform. A small number of subdivisions show a significant population increase while the majority of inland subdivisions have experienced depopulation. Those divisions which are limited to agricultural production and can be defined as completely rural show a persistent decrease in population. The depopulation trend is exacerbated when the populations of regional towns in these more rural districts are excluded. For those rural dwellers living in the wheatbelt that stretches inland from Geraldton to Esperance the 2 ̆ 2 misinterpretation 2 ̆ 2 of the statistics has meant that regional issues and concerns are not properly understood by policy makers. There is a feeling that they are the 2 ̆ 7 forgotten people 2 ̆ 7, less important than urban dwellers and the mining sector.

40|$|Supporting the {{lifestyles of}} the populations of modern cities {{requires}} vast quantities {{of natural resources and}} leads to environmental stresses such as air and water pollution. Research into the metabolism of cities therefore aims at understanding the physical flows into, within, and out of cities with a view to reducing the use of resources and the environmental impacts. One important physical indicator is energy use. Most studies on cities only consider direct or end-user energy consumption. Since the function of cities is to serve the lives of their residents, indirect energy use in cities, or energy embodied in the consumption of goods and services by its residents, can be regarded as being as important as direct energy use. However, physical models of cities are extremely complex and have difficulty in dealing with boundary issues, and hence the indirect resource requirements. In this paper we use input–output analysis and detailed household expenditure data to yield comprehensive energy use breakdowns for the 14 <b>Statistical</b> <b>Subdivisions</b> of Sydney. Multivariate regression and structural path analysis (SPA) are used to interpret the results. Clear correlations can be drawn between energy use and income, household size, age, and degree of urbanity. The structural path analysis is used to demonstrate how significant differences in lifestyles between inner and outer areas of Sydney leads to different energy use characteristics. This final consumption-based approach to analysing the energy requirements for households has important implications for measures aimed at reducing energy use, whic...|$|R
40|$|Purpose A {{trend of}} higher suicide rates in rural and remote {{areas as well}} as areas with low {{socioeconomic}} status {{has been shown in}} previous research. Little is known whether the influence of social deprivation on suicide differs between urban and rural areas. This investigation aims to examine how social deprivation influences suicide mortality and to identify which related factors of deprivation have a higher potential to reduce suicide risk in urban and rural Queensland, Australia. Methods Suicide data from 2004 to 2008 were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register. Age-standardized suicide rates (15 + years) and rate ratios, with a 95 % confidence interval, for 38 <b>Statistical</b> <b>Subdivisions</b> (SSDs) in Queensland were calculated. The influence of deprivation-related variables on suicide and their rural-urban difference were modelled by log-linear regression analyses through backward elimination. Results Among the 38 SSDs in Queensland, eight had a higher suicide risk while eleven had a lower rate. Working-age males (15 - 59 years) had the most pronounced geographic variation in suicide rate. In urban areas, suicide rates were positively associated with tenant households in public housing, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the unemployment rate and median individual income, but inversely correlated with younger age and households with no internet access. In rural areas, only tenant households in public housing and households with no internet access heightened the risk of suicide, while a negative association was found for younger and older persons, low-skilled workers or labourers, and families with low income and no cars. Conclusions The extent to which social deprivation contributes to suicide mortality varies considerably between rural and urban areas.

40|$|Aim: Using data on New South Wales {{ambulance}} {{calls to}} suspected overdoses from July 1997 to June 1999 to: a) examine temporal and geographic trends in calls; and b) compare geographic patterns of fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose. Method: The NSW Ambulance Service provided {{data on the}} occasions when an ambulance attended a person on whom the drug overdose/poisonings protocol was used, and to whom naloxone was administered. The geographic distribution of ambulance attendances was approximated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Statistical Local Area (SLA) and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Subdivision</b> (SSD). Estimates of social disadvantage were correlated with the rate of ambulance attendances for each region. Results: 9, 116 callouts were made. In cases with data on age and gender, 89 % were aged 15 - 44 years, and 31 % were female. South Sydney (n= 1, 819) and Liverpool (n= 1, 602) SLAs accounted for 37 % of calls; the higher rates outside Sydney were in Newcastle, Orange and Kiama. There was {{a strong correlation between}} rates of ambulance callouts and fatal heroin overdoses. The number of calls increased from an average of 361 calls per month in 1997 - 98 to 399 in 1998 - 99. The majority of calls (54 %) were made between midday and 9 pm.

Specific interviewing difficulties and solutions to these are proposed for interviewing Tongans. Suggestions to overcome the suspicions of respondents and the dangers of ethnocentrisim {{on the part of}} the researcher are also suggested. A questionnaire is included and its design, to include internal checks and ease in tabulation are noted. Chapter Two deals with migration motives, both real and stated. These motives are confined in the main, to those acting at the source, Tonga, and include population pressures on land, housing, employment and capital. Data is provided from recent surveys in Tonga, together with the results of a survey of Tongans residing in the Central Auckland Urban Area, 1974. An examination of data provided by the Department of Statistics, concerning arrivals and departures, is included in Chapter Three. This is supplemented with data on airfares and the manner in which the migrant raised sufficient capital to purchase his passage, from the survey. Special attention is paid to permits and the reason why some Tongans have overstayed their legally permitted stay. Chapter Four compares the demographic and social characteristics of Tongans with other Polynesians in New Zealand. Age, marital status, dependents, sex, religion, birthplace and educational qualifications of migrants in the survey are recorded. The results of an investigation into the occupational and residential characteristics of Tongan migrants are recorded in Chapters Five and Six. Comparison is drawn between the unskilled occupations of Tongans and other Polynesians and the location of place of work and residence is noted.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Globally, suicide {{accounts}} for 5. 2 % of deaths among persons aged 15 to 44 years and its incidence is rising. In Australia, suicide rates peaked in 1997 {{and have been}} declining since. A substantial part of that decline stems from a plunge in suicides by one particular method: asphyxiation by motor vehicle exhaust gas (MVEG). Although MVEG remains {{the second most common}} method of suicide in Australia, its incidence decreased by nearly 70 % in the decade to 2006. The extent to which this phenomenon has been driven by national laws in 1986 and 1999 that lowered permissible levels of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions is unknown. The objective of this ecological study was to test the relationship by investigating whether areas of Australia with fewer noxious vehicles per capita experienced lower rates of MVEG suicide. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We merged data on MVEG suicides in Australia (2001 - 06) with data on the number and age of vehicles in the national fleet, as well as socio-demographic data from the national census. Poisson regression was used to analyse the relationship between the incidence of suicide within two levels of geographical area [...] postcodes and <b>statistical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> (SSDs) [...] and the population density of pre- 1986 and pre- 1999 passenger vehicles in those areas. (There was a mean population of 8, 302 persons per postcode in the study dataset and 87, 413 persons per SSD.) The annual incidence of MVEG suicides nationwide decreased by 57 % (from 2. 6 per 100, 000 in 2001 to 1. 1 in 2006) during the study period; the population density of pre- 1986 and pre- 1999 vehicles decreased by 55 % (from 14. 2 per 100 persons in 2001 to 6. 4 in 2006) and 26 % (from 44. 5 per 100 persons in 2001 to 32. 9 in 2006), respectively. Area-level regression analysis showed that the suicide rates were significantly and positively correlated with the presence of older vehicles. A percentage point decrease in the population density of pre- 1986 vehicles was associated with a 6 % decrease (rate ratio [RR] = 1. 06; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 05 - 1. 08) in the incidence of MVEG suicide within postcode areas; a percentage point decrease in the population density of pre- 1999 vehicles was associated with a 3 % decrease (RR = 1. 03; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 04) in the incidence of MVEG suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Areas of Australia with fewer vehicles predating stringent CO emission laws experience lower rates of MVEG suicide. Although those emission laws were introduced primarily for environmental reasons, countries that lack them may miss the benefits of a serendipitous suicide prevention strategy.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for quantification of age-related brain changes. The method includes calculating 3 D volumetric texture descriptors, extracting principal compo-nents, and assessing {{the significance of}} brain changes using multivariate analysis techniques. Structural changes were evaluated using high resolution anatomical MRI-T 1 brain images {{of a group of}} 152 healthy subjects aged from 18 to 70 years (76 males and 76 females). The Talairach par-cellation system was applied to study normal brain aging on four scale levels: the whole cerebrum, the nine coro-nal sections, the twelve axial sections, and 108 box-shaped sections resulting from both <b>subdivisions.</b> <b>Statistical</b> anal-ysis has revealed significant brain deteriorations with age at different scale levels. Most of the brain regions are af-fected with a slight predominance in the frontal lobes. We concluded that 3 D texture analysis followed by statistical evaluation procedures is a robust technique for detecting age-related changes in the anatomical MR images of the human brain...|$|R
