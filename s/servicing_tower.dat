50|$|Work {{began on}} LC-34 in 1960, {{and it was}} {{formally}} dedicated on June 5, 1961. The complex consisted of a launch platform, umbilical <b>tower,</b> mobile <b>service</b> <b>tower,</b> fueling facilities, and a blockhouse. Two steel flame deflectors were mounted on rails to allow placement beneath the launch platform. The <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> was likewise mounted on rails, and it was moved to a position 185 meters west of the pad before launch. At 95 meters high, it was the tallest structure at LC-34.|$|R

50|$|LC-12's first launch was Atlas 10A on January 10, 1958. During {{the second}} half of the year, a larger {{umbilical}} <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> was built in preparation for the C series Atlas tests, flown from December 1958 to August 1959.|$|R
50|$|On 24 September 1959, {{the first}} Atlas-Able, 9C, {{exploded}} during a static firing test at LC-12, after a turbopump {{on one of}} the engines failed triggering a complete engine shutdown. The damaged turbopump continued to allow oxidizer to flow, feeding the fire beneath the vehicle. About a minute later the rocket suffered a structural failure, collapsed and exploded. The entire <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> and both umbilical towers were knocked over and the concrete launch stand caved in. Because damage to LC-12 was so extensive, it did not host another launch until Missile 56D in May 1960. The large <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> was not rebuilt following the explosion of Atlas 9C. It then hosted more ICBM tests along with the second and third Atlas Able probes.|$|R
50|$|The legacy Atlas-Centaur {{umbilical}} {{towers of}} both pads were demolished in 2006. The mobile <b>service</b> <b>towers</b> were both demolished in controlled explosions on June 16, 2007. Tower B was demolished at 13:59 GMT (09:59 EDT) and tower A followed twelve minutes later at 14:11 (10:11 EDT).|$|R
50|$|Coolhull Castle has a four-storey <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> and three-storey {{rectangular}} block (hall house) {{attached with}} a hall at first-floor level. Both sections have Irish crenellations. There is a bartizan in the northeast. The tower doorway {{is protected by}} a murder-hole. Other features include fireplaces, garderobe and slop stone.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the launch site was started in March 1960 {{under the direction of}} Department 581 (including the Second Geophysics Institute), and completed in less than six months, including a weather station, radars, control and tracking stations, launch pad, <b>service</b> <b>tower,</b> propellant storage room, propulsion testing facilities, living quarters, etc.|$|R

The draft environmental impact assessment with a finding of [...] "no significant impact" [...] was published in February 2011. Demolition began on the pad's fixed and mobile <b>service</b> <b>towers</b> in summer 2011.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 April 1984, it {{was added}} to the US National Register of Historic Places; however it was not {{maintained}} and gradually deteriorated. On 6 August 2005 the mobile <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> was demolished as a safety precaution due to structural damage by corrosion. [...] The blockhouse was demolished in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The Goddard {{building}} {{has the same}} basic design as Richards. Its two laboratory <b>towers</b> and <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> (for stairs, elevators, etc.) are connected {{in a straight line}} to the westernmost tower of the Richards building. A research library is located in Goddard's upper floors with reading carrels that cantilever from the building's face.|$|R
50|$|Keeling House is a 16-storey {{block of}} flats located on Claredale Street in Bethnal Green, London, England. It was {{designed}} by Denys Lasdun and completed in 1957 as a cluster of four blocks of maisonettes arranged around a central <b>service</b> <b>tower.</b> A radical renovation in 2001 added a penthouse storey and concierge service.|$|R

50|$|Between February 1962 and October 1963 the pad was {{converted}} {{for use by}} Atlas-Agena. The modifications were more extensive than the conversions of LC-12 and LC-14 with the mobile <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> being demolished and replaced with a new, larger tower. The first launch from the renovated pad was Vela 1 on October 17, 1963.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the end of}} Atlas {{testing at}} Cape Canaveral, LC-11 {{was the only one}} of the four Atlas pads to not be used for space launches, and hence was first of the four pads to be deactivated. Following deactivation, the mobile <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> and support {{equipment}} were dismantled, and the site is no longer maintained.|$|R
50|$|LP-0B became {{operational}} in 1999,and {{was subsequently}} upgraded in 2003 {{with the construction}} of a mobile <b>service</b> <b>tower,</b> which was completed in 2004.It is active, and is currently used by Minotaur rockets. The first launch from LP-0B was of a Minotaur I in December 2006, and was the first launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the launch complex featured one Mobile Service Structure {{which could be used}} to service or mate a rocket on either LC-37A or 37B, but not on both simultaneously. The Delta IV Mobile <b>Service</b> <b>Tower</b> is 330 ft tall, and fitted to service all Delta IV configurations, including the Delta IV Heavy.|$|R
50|$|Home Federal Building is a {{historic}} bank building located at Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. It was built in 1967, and is a seven-story, reinforced-concrete, International Style building with an eight-story concrete-block <b>service</b> <b>tower.</b> Also on the property are a contributing fountain and pool (1967) and walkway bridge (1967). The building has been converted to condominiums.|$|R
50|$|The PSLV {{launch complex}} was {{commissioned}} during 1990. It has a 3,000 tonne, 76.5 m high Mobile <b>Service</b> <b>Tower</b> (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room. The solid propellant motors for the PSLV are processed by SHAR, which also carries out launch operations. The first {{launch of the}} PSLV took place on 20 September 1993.|$|R
50|$|Within {{six months}} of {{construction}} some of the mosaic tiles on the <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> became detached owing to cement failure and lack of expansion joints in the concrete. Although the tower was granted listed building status in 1995, falling tiles were an ongoing problem. English Heritage had to be consulted as alterations could change the building's appearance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{glass and}} {{aluminium}} construction continues around {{the sides and}} back giving the building a stand-alone integrity unusual for factory offices. A cantilevered, [...] "floating" [...] staircase enclosed by the glass wall forms the prominent entrance feature. A <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> stands above the roof line as a projecting geometric form originally carrying the ETA brand name.|$|R
5000|$|LC-6 was {{deactivated}} in 1961. The blockhouse and a 61.96 m square concrete pad are {{the only}} parts of the complex that remain intact, although the mobile <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> was under restoration as of 2011. The complex {{is part of the}} [...] "Cape Canaveral: Then and Now" [...] tour, available from the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.|$|R

5000|$|The seven-storey {{building}} has a flat roof {{and consists of}} pale brown brick. A noticeable <b>service</b> <b>tower</b> exists {{to the north of}} the building. Architecture critic Clare Hartwell writes, [...] "It is a pity that this building does not enjoy a better site - its impact is partly lost due to its towering neighbours and its relationship with the adjoining Holyoake House." ...|$|R
