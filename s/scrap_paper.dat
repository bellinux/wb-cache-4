Often, charcoal lighters like hexamine fuel tablets or ethyl alcohol {{will be used to}} start the fire, as well as various types of <b>scrap</b> <b>paper.</b> With the proliferation of packaged food, it is quite likely that plastics will be incinerated as well, a practice that not only produces toxic fumes but will also leave polluted ashes behind because of incomplete combustion at too-low open fire temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Paper {{recycling}} became common abroad {{during the}} 1980s and subsequently the Ministry of the Environment initiated proceedings {{to secure a}} source for domestic paper reuse. This led to an agreement in 1992 between Norske Skog and the ministry, in which the company obliged themselves to build a recycling plant for 100,000 tonnes, in exchange {{for access to the}} <b>scrap</b> <b>paper.</b> There was an internal consideration of which mill to build the recycling plant at, and ultimately Skogn was preferred over Follum in a board decision made in August 1993. Skogn was selected because it created mostly standard newsprint and exported to the European market which demanded high deinked pulp (DIP) content.|$|E
500|$|Marable {{studied the}} Autobiography {{manuscript}} [...] "raw materials" [...] archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical {{element of the}} collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on <b>scrap</b> <b>paper,</b> in-depth interviews, and long [...] "free style" [...] discussions. Marable writes, [...] "Malcolm also {{had a habit of}} scribbling notes to himself as he spoke." [...] Haley would secretly [...] "pocket these sketchy notes" [...] and reassemble them in a sub rosa attempt to integrate Malcolm X's [...] "subconscious reflections" [...] into the [...] "workable narrative". This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the Autobiography, indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{our society}} demands the {{manufactured}} goods which are effective to reclaim, because natural resources are tendency to deccrease. So {{we should not}} noly reinvestigate the materials of goods, but also originate a new design method and a product system. Then we have investigated the srtucturing method and the strength about the beams whose material are <b>scrapped</b> <b>paper.</b> When the beam by <b>scrapped</b> <b>paper</b> is loaded, the deformation is large and moreover the cross section dose not mentaine flat. Therefore we cannot apply the traditional 'theory of elasticity' to the analysis and estimation of the deformation and strength. In this paper, we propose a new estimation method by analyzing the swelling caused when the papercraft beam is bended...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define the level of {{recycling}} standards and its process in <b>paper</b> <b>scrap.</b> As pollution is increased by improperly treated <b>paper</b> <b>scrap,</b> the government has recently strengthened the management of the <b>paper</b> <b>scrap.</b> Methods: In this study, the current status of <b>paper</b> <b>scrap</b> recycling was investigated through a 2012 field survey, and the classification and recycling standards for <b>paper</b> <b>scrap</b> in developed countries and institutions were also investigated through a literature review in order to introduce optimal recycling standards. Results: As a result, the contents of contaminants were identified as the most important recycling standard, and the contents of contaminants in <b>paper</b> <b>scrap</b> was measured at less than 1. 0 % at most companies. The recycling standard for <b>paper</b> <b>scrap</b> was determined to be below 3 % contaminants in the case of paper and 5 % in the case of board. In this study, recycling stage was determined by considering regulations on resources and practices in the field. Conclusions: The recycling standard for <b>paper</b> <b>scrap</b> was determined to be below 3 % and 5 % contaminants fo...|$|R
2500|$|Konstantin Melnikov {{was born}} and died in Moscow. [...] He was the fourth child of the family. His father, Stepan Illarionovich Melnikov, {{originally}} from Nizhny Novgorod region, was a road maintenance foreman, employed by the Moscow Agricultural Academy. Mother, Yelena Grigorievna (née Repkina), came from the peasants of Zvenigorod district. The whole family occupied a single room of a state-managed working class barrack in Hay Lodge (Соломенная Сторожка), then a quiet northern suburb of Moscow. Melnikovs tried hard to rise above bitter poverty, to return to farming and eventually relocated to their own small house and set their own dairy farm. Konstantin Melnikov later praised his father, who noticed the little boy's addiction to drawing and regularly brought him <b>scrap</b> <b>paper</b> for drawing from the Academy. However, all the education they could afford was a two-year parish school (completed in 1903).|$|E
