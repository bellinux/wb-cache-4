40|$|The present {{work has}} two aims. The first {{aim is to}} {{introduce}} the method <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> to New Testament scholars and we attempt {{to do this in}} Part One. <b>Narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> the Bible has been practised since the early 1980 's, but since that time no one has established the nature and the aims of the method. This thesis is the first work to define what a comprehensive narrative-critical approach to the gospels might entail. It is also the first work to include historical concerns in the narrative-critical programme. The examples <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> we do have in New Testament studies all assume that <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> must be an a-historical method. We point out the fallacy of this view by drawing attention to the recent sociological studies <b>of</b> the <b>narrative</b> form and to the narrative history debate in History Faculties during the 1960 's and 1970 's. These two movements in scholarship necessitate an historical dimension to <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> if the <b>narrative</b> form is not to be greatly restricted and over-simplified. In Part One we provide an apology for <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> and we show how future Johannine scholars might examine JOHN as narrative Christology (chapter one), narrative performance (chapter two), community narrative (chapter three) and narrative history (chapter four). In Part Two we provide an illustration of the method at work. Taking the Johannine passion narrative as our text (John 18 - 19), we show how this part of JOHN might be examined as narrative Christology (chapter five), narrative performance (chapter six), community narrative (chapter seven) and narrative history (chapter eight). This thesis is the first to expose these chapters to a thorough and rigorous literary approach. Our analysis reveals that the fourth evangelist has constructed his passion story with great artistry. We draw particular attention to narrative echo-effects, characterization, tragic mood, the reader's response of "home-coming" and time-shapes in John 18 - 19. These, and many other narrative strategies, contribute towards the classic, disclosing power of JOHN's story of the death of Jesus...|$|R

Based on the preliminary observation done in MAN 2 Yogyakarta, there were some problems related to students’ writing namely those of ideas, grammatical features, and organization. Those problems were influenced by students’ motivation, teaching techniques, and learning media. This research consisted of two cycles with two meetings in each cycle. The subjects of this research were the students of XI IPA 1, the English teacher as the collaborator, and the researcher herself. The techniques of collecting data were by filling observation checklist forms, observing {{the teaching and learning}} process, interviewing the English teacher and students, taking photographs, collecting documents, and scoring students’ writing. Hence, the data were in the forms of observation checklist forms, field notes, interview transcripts, photos, samples of students’ writing, and students’ writing scores. In analyzing those data, the researcher used two methods namely qualitative and quantitative methods. In analyzing the qualitative data, the researcher did three steps namely data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing/verification. In analyzing the quantitative data which were in the form of students’ writing performance task scores, the researcher used a writing rubric. The results of this research show that the use of animation movie is able to improve students’ writing <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> in terms <b>of</b> ideas, grammatical features, and organization.

As a preunderstanding <b>of</b> <b>narrative,</b> meaning-as-correspondence eclipses the power <b>of</b> <b>narrative.</b> The enervating effect of meaning-as-correspondence on {{the interpretation of the}} gospels is demonstrated. The work of the Mythical School, D. F. Strauss and R. Bultmann is assessed. All employed a concept of myth to the gospels which presupposed that the meaning of the gospels was a separate entity from the <b>narrative.</b> Members <b>of</b> the Mythical School conceived of meaning as an ideal or historical content.

The concept of meaning-as-performance is presented as a way to re-conceive meaning as an event which occurs through narrative performance. The critical tools <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> are employed to understand the way gospel narratives are structured for the experience of reading/hearing.

40|$|The present {{work is a}} new {{attempt to}} {{interpret}} on the episode in Genesis 18 : 1 - 15 by the method <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism.</b> The general tendency on the narrative had focused on the exemplary act of Abraham’s hospitality interpreting it as his righteousness by the perspective of NT (Heb 13 : 2) or by the test motive of Greek Myth (the birth of Orion). The retributive theology was considered too much in interpreting the Fellowship narrative (Gn 18 : 1 - 15). These interpretations conflict with the narrator’s own theological views: (1) righteousness by faith (Gn 15 : 6), (2) God’s mercifulness to save Lot (Gn 19 : 29), and (3) God’s being gracious to make Sarah conceive (Gn 21 : 1). This study attempts {{to find out the}} author’s own interpretative view indicated in the whole Abraham narrative (Gn 11 : 27 - 25 : 11) {{as well as in the}} Fellowship Narrative itself (Gn 18 : 1 - 15). The present work is an attempt to interpret on the narrative by the method <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism.</b> This study pays attention to the narrator’s various literary skills: “linking structure with preceding episode” (Gn 18 : 1 a); “Sandwiched structure” of the larger context (Gn 18 : 1 - 21 : 7); Unique Plot Sequence; and Repeated Clue word and phrase (“laugh,” “Sarah,” ”this time next year”). These literary skills are understood to indicate the faithfulness of the Lord who tries to fulfill what he promised. The conclusion of this study overturns the traditional interpretations on the Fellowship Narrative. This work attests that Abraham showed his righteousness not by doing hospitality but by obeying God’s new command of circumcision out of willing heart as he used to obey the Lord’s commands having faith in the promise of the Lord (ch. 5. 3. 2. 2). The motive of God’s visit is to have the covenantal fellowship with obedient Abraham (ch. 2. 1. 6; 2. 1. 6. 1). Abraham’s first moment recognition of deity is attested by interpreting of the technical pair verb, “And he lifted up his eyes and he saw and Lo!” (Gn 18 : 2 a), which depicts prophetic experience of Abraham (ch. 3. 3). Abraham’s manner for the visitors is relevant to the higher ones (ch. 3. 3. 2. 1). The futile human endeavor without having faith is considered as the reason of being delayed of fulfillment of God’s promise (Gn 16). The fulfillment of the promised son was not attained by any human effort, but only by God’s merciful intervention in the Abraham narrative (ch. 4. 4. 4 and 4. 4. 5).

40|$|Our thesis unfolds through {{dialogue}} with N. T. Wright’s concept of ‘story’ {{and offers a}} critique of his methodology and specifically his exegesis of the ‘coming of the son of man’ saying in Mark 13 and parallels. In Part A, we explore with Wright {{the potential of the}} concept of ‘story’ to unify historical, theological, and literary enquiries with respect to biblical studies, and consequently refine the concept independently of Wright by drawing upon Jan Assmann’s idea of ‘mnemohistory’, the postfoundationalist theology and revised theological hermeneutic of Kevin J. Vanhoozer, and Michael Fishbane’s work in ‘inner-biblical exegesis’. In Part B, it is argued that the traditions that emerged concerning Jesus of Nazareth are deliberately intertwined with Israel’s ‘story’ so as to assert Jesus’ central role in bringing this narrative to a climax. Together with James Dunn, each Gospel is viewed as a unified performance of the received traditions, where each selectively draws from the sources available, both literary and oral, to provide a fresh improvisation of the tradition for its own context. Our exegesis of the eschatological discourse {{in each of the three}} Synoptic Gospels employs the tools <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> and a chastened redaction criticism to demonstrate the explicatory power that the hermeneutic of ‘story’ provides in reading what have been notoriously challenging passages for New Testament scholars. Our particular focus is to examine the nexus between the destruction of the temple and the ‘coming of the son of man’ saying in order to evaluate Wright’s conclusion that the ‘coming of the son of man’ expression must be read as a metaphor with the destruction of the temple as its referent. Our own findings agree with Wright that the expression is to be read as a metaphor, but, contrary to Wright’s conclusion, we determine that the referent is Jesus’ vindication at the eschaton...|$|R
40|$|In several texts the Gospel of John {{presents}} {{the relation between}} Jesus and his disciples in parallel to {{the relation between the}} Father and Jesus. Most well-known of these parallels is perhaps John 20 : 21 b (“As the Father has sent me, so I send you”), but several other texts follow the same pattern. In this thesis I will examine the parallels between the Father/Son and Son/disciple relations in John. I will take an “in-the-text” approach to the Gospel, using elements <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> and discourse analysis. The interpretation of comparisons will be of particular importance, as I seek to identify the tertium comparationis and direction of the comparisons John makes between the Father/Son and Son/disciple relations. In the main section of my thesis I will first present the textual material which suggests that John regards these relations as parallel to one another. I will then, through the study of four selected texts (15 : 9 – 11; 17 : 20 – 23; 17 : 18 and 20 : 21), examine how these relations are parallel to one another, and seek the answer to my questions of research: How is the Father/Son relation illuminated by the parallels to the Son/disciple relation? And how is the Son/disciple relation illuminated by the parallels to the Father/Son relation? My primary contention is that the tertium comparationis of the parallels between the Father/Son and Son/disciple relations {{is to be found in}} the love which marks both relations. This love is the basis for the relations, and is the foundation for both unity and sending. By seeing the Father/Son and Son/disciple relations as parallel and founded on the same love, several aspects of these relations are illuminated, and we can see how discipleship and Christology are interconnected themes in John’s Gospel...|$|R

Framed in the theoretical literature of Goffman’s presentation of the self, and Burke’s conception of rhetoric, the study’s primary concern is to explain and understand how Facebook users construct identities using narrative fragments on their profiles and the offline effects <b>of</b> these <b>narrative</b> performances. Specifically, this study argues that narratives are a type of rhetorical performance, and that both narratives and identities have symbolic meaning and rhetorical components. While the effects of online identities occur at the macro-level, the actual process of construction and presentation occur at the micro-level. The method <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism</b> informs the primary framework, called the Narrative Performance Model (NPM), that I created and used to analyze 100 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students at a large, southwestern university to understand the micro-level process {{of the performance of}} identities and to answer the following research questions: (1) What features are used in the <b>narrative</b> performance <b>of</b> identities on Facebook? (2) What types of identities result from the narrative performances on Facebook profiles, and (3) What role does cultural capital play in the <b>narrative</b> performance <b>of</b> self? Focus groups discussions of undergraduate college students added a depth dimension to the <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism,</b> helped answer questions that could not be answered in the analysis of Facebook profiles, and answered the following research question: What are the offline consequences of communicating online identities on Facebook? 	The micro-level analysis of 400 pages of text from Facebook profiles reveal that students use both linguistic and paralinguistic features in their <b>narrative</b> performance <b>of</b> identity. Students challenge and alter traditional conventions of grammar, writing, and narratives to present specific <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> self. Students use these features to communicate five types of identities on their profiles: (1) the essential self; (2) the desired self; (3) the preferential self, (4) the dynamic self; and (5) the demanding self. Cultural capital makes possible the above mentioned narrative selves, and in effect, perpetuates the hierarchical arrangement of society by highlighting class differences. 	A thematic analysis of focus group discussions reveal that offline consequences fall within four general themes: (1) keeping it real; (2) Facebook official; (3) friending; and (4) relationship boundaries—family as friends. In addition to an in-depth discussion of macro and micro-level findings, the practical, theoretical, and methodological contributions are discussed. CommunicationDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Narrative {{tasks are}} often {{used to examine the}} {{language}} development of children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). These tasks are complex, due to both linguistically and cognitively demands. Earlier studies show that age matched typically developing children (TD) outperform children with SLI on both content (semantic-pragmatic skills) and form (morphosyntactic <b>skills)</b> <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> and that children with SLI show a dissociation between form and content skills. However, there is less information about <b>narrative</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> children with SLI in comparison to younger, language matched TD children. Therefore, this study compares <b>narrative</b> ability <b>of</b> children with SLI (age 6 & 7) to that of younger TD children (age 4 & 5) matched on passive vocabulary. Both a story generation and a story retelling task were conducted and analyzed for content and form (morphosyntactical complexity and correctness). The results show that children with SLI in the domain <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> content only differ from younger TD children for variety of content words during story retelling. There are no differences found for morphological complexity, but significantly more morphosyntactic errors were made in the SLI group. Thereby, the children in the SLI group show most often a dissociation in which form is relatively less developed than content, where the TD children show a balanced development. Task effects were found in favor of story retelling for content variables. The results indicate that children with SLI show a delay for both content and form, but that realizing adequate morphosyntactic sentences seem to be most vulnerable during narration. With these results clinical linguists and speech therapists have more information about the narrative development in young children and in children with SLI which can guide their diagnostic and therapeutic work...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 John Brown Gordon was {{committed}} to the mission of national reconciliation. He knew that the South would have to embrace the North to repair the devastation of the Civil War. Driven by dedication to public service after the war, he worked through his positions in governmental offices to help the South. As his public life slowed he began work on a lecture aimed at making him a peacemaker, a missionary for reconciliation. His purpose {{was to provide a}} broad, nationalistic perspective which created a common vantage point that would allow both Northerners and Southerners to derive pride and honor from their participation in the Civil War. The lecture, "The Last Days of the Confederacy," became very popular {{in a short period of}} time, and made Gordon one of the most requested speakers of the Southern Lyceum Program and Slayton Lyceum Program. The purpose of this critical interpretation of Gordon's lecture is to account for the effectiveness of the rhetorical elements and strategies in the work. The analysis will be based on Walter Fisher's narrative paradigm. Narratives dominate the content and structure <b>of</b> speech; <b>narratives</b> provide a way of ordering and presenting a view of the world through descriptions of a situation - -the act of storytellingthe format Gordon chose in creating the lecture. After drawing conclusions from application <b>of</b> the <b>narrative</b> paradigm I will focus on identifying and evaluating Gordon's rhetorical vision, which is based in Ernest Bormann's fantasy-theme theory. Finally, due to the synecdochal nature <b>of</b> the <b>narratives</b> I will use Kenneth Burke's four master tropes literature to fully interpret the various aspects <b>of</b> the <b>narrative,</b> which complements the initial mission <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism.</b> In "The Last Days of the Confederacy," Gordon masterfully uses anecdotes from his experiences in the Civil War to create narrative sequences, which construct a strategy of transformative discourse. A typical sequence would start with an ingratiary tactic in which Gordon, in his eloquent manner, would describe a Northern character, scene, or theme and juxtapose it to another story from the South. The purpose of this sequence is to generate irony, creating a dialectic between the two stories, which, at the surface, seem to be opposed. His third step, then, was to use that dialectic to point to the commonalities between the North and the South. This he would do by illustrating an American trait, skill, or value. The result would be a major theme demonstrating a national value or belief to add strength to his existing compendium of themes, such as unity, fraternity, and brotherhood - -all tools to salve the process of reconciliation of conflict with face-saving for both...|$|R

She argues that fiction organizes, shapes, and ultimately creates perception, stating in her introduction that, [...] "our fictions have power, they shape our {{memories of the}} past and they create memories of pasts we have never had, of experiences not even remotely like anything that has ever happened to us. And these <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> exotic experiences may have the most power over us of all, because we can't challenge their authenticity with the evidence of our own senses." [...] She thus begins her text with a critique of Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory (1975) as too narrow in its vision of war (focusing primarily on the experiences of male combatants). In contrast, through the juxtaposition <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> and <b>criticism</b> (in particular, analysis of Virginia Woolf's Three Guineas and works by Joan Didion and Doris Lessing), Hanley offers portraits of women which she argues will [...] "displace the soldier as the mouthpiece of war ... the stories assume that women, children, noncombatants, and the enemy have an experience of war as much worth telling and remembering as is the story of any soldier." ...|$|R
40|$|Initial Teacher Education (ITE) {{occurs in}} a {{predominantly}} analytic space, in common with most higher education provision. Creating and legitimising narrative learning community spaces {{would result in the}} foregrounding of professional identity formation across the ITE curriculum. The resulting systematic attention to the impact of teacher identity on professional practice will develop teachers who are more resilient and better able to negotiate the theory-to-practice shifts required of classroom-ready teachers (Johnson, Down, Le Cornu, Peters, Sullivan, Pearce & Hunter, 2010; Hooley, 2007). I present this case for narrative pedagogies by offering two stories from my own journey of increasing commitment to narrative pedagogies. Each story is paired with a preservice teacher narrative from a significant stage in their identity development. And each pair is followed by an analytic interlude that frames the accounts in the literature on <b>narrative</b> ways <b>of</b> knowing and professional identity development. I contend that three things need to occur to establish effective and sustainable narrative learning community spaces. First, teacher educators need to embrace the use <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> ways <b>of</b> knowing in our pedagogical practice. Second, we need to recognise the embodied complexity of the teaching context, and how narrative can be used to develop preservice teachers’ capacity to navigate these ‘swampy lowlands’ of practice (Schon, 1983, p. 42). Third, we need to teach the <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> writing and interpretation across the ITE curriculum to equip preservice teachers to negotiate their teacher identity and become resilient and creative practitioners. In presenting this series of vignettes about storying in teacher learning, I intend to offer new insights and raise new questions about how narrative can respond to the current needs of initial teacher education (Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group, 2014; Sellars, 2014) ...|$|R
40|$|Dialogue is {{the main}} {{building}} block of Mark’s Gospel. Unlike Matthew with its extended blocks of teaching, unlike Luke with its multiple use and systematic arrangement of parables, and unlike John or even Thomas, where imbalanced dialogues afford Jesus {{the opportunity to make}} extended pronouncements, Mark’s Gospel does not give Jesus a platform for lengthy teaching and preaching. Although Jesus speaks the vast majority of spoken verses in the text, there are few long speeches, and most pronouncements take place within clearly defined dialogue contexts. The portrait of Jesus is built up by a series of encounters with supplicants, demons, opponents, disciples and the Father. As a text-centred approach, this thesis sits within the orbit <b>of</b> <b>Narrative</b> <b>Criticism.</b> Yet, in spite of the suitability of the discipline, dialogue studies in Mark have received little attention. This omission is rectified in this thesis by drawing on the tools of linguistic disciplines, principally speech-art theory and conversational analysis. The marriage of these allows us to take seriously the nature, shape and progression of the interactions, and to use them to uncover a portrait of Mark’s Jesus, which goes beyond simply what he is called (i. e. traditional Christological titles), what he says or what he does. The portrait is enriched by the form, as the dialogue encounters demonstrate a tension between authority and disempowerment, control and risk, confidence and uncertainty. Jesus’ agenda is controlled by supplicants who require action from him, by disciples who require enlightenment from him, by spirits who confront him, and by opponents who challenge him. Jesus is frequently put on the back foot in potentially difficult position, but, by the use <b>of</b> dialogue <b>skill</b> and personal authority, he emerges unscathed and victorious from the encounter. Nevertheless victory is not total as characters still have the freedom and volition to disobey him outside the confines of the dialogue. The dialogue form as presented by the implied author of Mark’s Gospel is an integral component of the presentation of Jesus as the servant who opens himself up to risk and challenge. It is as Jesus manoeuvres through these at times complex interactions that the implied author builds up the portrait of one who achieves victory through vulnerability. The implied reader encounters Jesus only as Jesus encounters others. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The Acts of the Apostles can fruitfully {{be studied}} as persuasive narrative. This thesis {{develops}} {{and uses a}} new method to investigate what {{we can learn from}} the way Acts has been constructed about the persuasive influence the text would have exerted on its early audiences. Acts is a narrative and purposes suggested for it often involve persuasion. The proposed method for addressing the persuasiveness <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> is a development <b>of</b> both <b>narrative</b> <b>criticism,</b> which has traditionally neglected persuasion, and rhetorical criticism, which is based on persuasive techniques in speeches, whereas rather different techniques are employed in narrative. The method employs a taxonomy of techniques of persuasion relevant to narrative. Speeches, events and asides each contribute. A character’s influence depends on trust – whether they are accredited or discredited. Respect and empathy have different persuasive effects. Before considering Acts, the method is demonstrated by applying it to: Philo’s Embassy to Gaius, which is more overtly polemical than Acts; Josephus’s Jewish War, addressing a more hostile audience than Acts; the Letter of Aristeas, which is more of an encomium than Acts; and Joseph and Aseneth, with a more overt ‘journey of discovery’ than Acts. In Acts, accrediting and discrediting are provided in many ways, most forcefully through the Holy Spirit. Ananias and Sapphira provide a cautionary tale. The hearer accompanies Peter on his ‘journey of discovery’ about Gentiles. The approach of persuading by gentle steps suggests that some among the implied audience were unconvinced about mission to Gentiles and about Paul. Overall, the persuasiveness of Acts is not unsuitable for presentation to interested outsiders alongside believers. Persuasiveness is evident, especially in favour of the Jesus movement, Gentile mission and Paul. This research proposes a method and, by using it, shows how Acts can, itself, be considered an act of persuasion...|$|R
