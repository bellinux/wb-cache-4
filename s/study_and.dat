5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge.

That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in <b>study</b> <b>and</b> writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
