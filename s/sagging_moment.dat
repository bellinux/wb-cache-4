40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of steel-concrete composite beams {{depends on}} {{the interaction between the}} steel beam and the concrete slab. Therefore, the connection largely influences the global behaviour of the beam and its modelling is a key issue in the analysis of these structures. An effective model requires the introduction of an explicit relationship between slip and interaction force given by each connector, which is strongly non-linear.

40|$|Nowadays, modern {{codes and}} {{standards}} such as the (Eurocode 4, 2004) deal with the characterisation of steel–concrete composite joints in building structures, mainly under hogging bending moments in the beam. However, in sway composite frames or when the composite structure is subjected to an accidental/exceptional event such as earthquake or column loss, the beam-to-column joint may be subjected to <b>sagging</b> bending <b>moment,</b> a loading situation which is not yet covered by the codes. This paper deals with the behaviour of composite beam-to-column external joints under <b>sagging</b> bending <b>moments,</b> mainly focusing on the specific joint component “concrete slab in compression”.

The mechanical behavior of minor-axis connections for bare steel joints and composite joints has been investigated by experiments. A comparison of the experimental results between the bare steel joints and composite joints shows that the mechanical behavior of the minor-axis composite joint is obviously effected by the reinforcing concrete slab, which is transversely reinforced for bending and is connected to the steel beam via shear studs, this is more in line with the mechanical behavior of the frame joint. The investigation indicates that: (1) Minor-axis joints with flush end-plate connections and seat angle with double web angles connections are all typical semi-rigid joints.

40|$|Integral {{abutment}} bridges {{are becoming}} rather common, {{due to the}} durability problems of bearings and expansion joints. At the same time, among short- and medium-span bridges, multi-beam steel-concrete composite deck with hot-rolled girder is an economical and interesting alternative to traditional pre-stressed concrete solutions. The two concepts can be linked together to design integral steel-concrete composite bridges with the benefits of two typologies. The most critical aspect for these bridges is usually the joints between deck and piers or abutments.

Prestressing effects on a concrete structure {{can be categorized}} as Primary and Secondary effects. The analysis of an indeterminate prestressed structure is complicated {{due to the fact}} that it involves Secondary Moment which develops at intermediate supports when prestressing is applied. Primary Moment can be determined by P x e, where P is the axial force in the tendon and e is the eccentricity between the tendon location and neutral axis of the section. However, it is not an easy task to determine the Secondary Moment for a continuous structure. This study focuses on the influence line method where the prestress Secondary Moment can be determined by simple calculation using an excel spreadsheet. The 5 span prestressed Segmental Box Girder Bridge of Penang Second Crossing has been selected for the study. This bridge was constructed using span by span method. Based on the provided prestressing layout, it was found that the prestress Secondary Moment for this bridge is about 30 % to 35 % of the prestress Primary Moment.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of a continuous prestressed concrete bridge, Dead Load (selfweight of bridge), Superimposed Dead Load (Surfacing and Parapet) and Live Load (HA, HB or combined) are considered as major loadings for bridge structure. However, {{there are other factors}} that should be considered in {{the analysis}} such as Parasitic Moment. The effect from parasitic moment can contribute a significant value in designing a continuous prestressed concrete bridge. This study focuses on the effect of parasitic moment for a three spans continuous prestressed concrete bridge. An analysis of a continuous bridge using Staad Pro software is carried out to determine the parasitic moments of the bridge. The parasitic moments obtained from Staad Pro are slightly higher compared to the parasitic moments from Adapt software with a difference less than 10 percent. The parasitic moment is sagging throughout the whole bridge and the maximum moment is at the second span. A positive value of the parasitic moment will increase the value of the <b>sagging</b> <b>moment</b> at the mid span but will reduce the hogging moment at the support. For the case when parasitic moment effect is considered, the stress at bottom of beam is lower than the stress at top of beam. Whereas, the situation is reverse for the case when parasitic moment effect is not considered. If the same dead load, superimposed dead load and live load proportions are to be considered, the resultant stress at bottom of the beam will exceed the tensile stress limit when the parasitic moment proportion is more than 55 % of the total moment. Hence, the parasitic moment effect should be considered in the design of a continuous prestressed concrete bridge {{especially when it comes to}} the value of moment at the mid span of the bridge...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{research}} on dynamic amplification factors (DAFs) caused by traffic loading from simply supported to continuous (highway and railway) bridges. DAF is defined here as the ratio of maximum total load effect to maximum static load effect at a given section (mid-span). Another dynamic amplification factor FDAF {{can be defined as}} the ratio of the maximum total load effect throughout the entire bridge length to the maximum static load effect at a given section (mid-span). For continuous beam DAF/FDAF can be determined for both sagging and hogging bending moments. Noticeable differences appear among DAF/FDAF of mid-span bending moment in a simply supported beam, DAF/FDAF of the mid-span bending moment in a continuous beam and the DAF/FDAF of the bending moment over the internal support in a continuous beam. Three span lengths are tested in the simply supported beam models as well as three continuous beams made of two equal spans. Each model is subjected to a moving constant point load that travels at different velocities. The location of the maximum total moment varies depending on the speed. FDAF and DAF are plotted versus frequency ratio. The results showed that FDAF is often greater than DAF in simply supported and continuous beams. Also, FDAF of <b>sagging</b> bending <b>moment</b> in continuous beam is about 12 % greater than that the simply supported case.

40|$|The study investigates {{experimentally}} and theoretically the behaviour of {{an internal}} precast concrete beam-column connection, where both the column and beam are discontinuous in construction terms. The aim was to modify the behaviour mechanisms within the connection zone by introducing a beam hogging moment resistance capacity under dead loads and limiting the damage within the connection. This is to offer permanent dead load hogging moments that could counterbalance any temporary <b>sagging</b> <b>moment</b> generated under sway loads, enhance the rotational stiffness, balance the design requirements for the beam-end and beam mid-span moments, provide efficient continuity across the column, and reduce the deflection at the beam mid-span. Three full-scale beam-column connection tests subjected to gravity loads were conducted taking the connection reinforcement detail as the main variable. The configuration of the three main interfaces within the connection {{was based on the}} experimental results of small-scale tests. The results of the full-scale tests showed that, by using the strong connection concept, it was possible to produce equivalent monolithic behaviour, control the crack width within the connection zone, and force the final damage to occur outside of this zone, which comprises the interfaces and parts of the adjoining elements. The strong connection consisted of using additional short steel bars crossing the connection {{at the top of the}} beam, horizontal U-shaped links at the beam-ends, and additional column links. In addition, the experimental programme included two full-scale tests to investigate the behaviour of the connection under sway loads using two different connection reinforcement details. The results of this study showed that the proposed modification in the reinforcement details was able to mobilise the beam <b>sagging</b> <b>moment</b> through the dowel action of the column main bars but it was also accompanied by large relative beam-column rotations (low rotational stiffness). The evaluation of the behaviour of the connections was carried out by incorporating the experimental rotational stiffnesses in semi-rigid frame analyses using the ANSYS software package and a Visual Basic program based on the conventional semi-rigid analysis approach. In addition, a simplified technique has been validated against these two methods to replicate the semi-rigid behaviour. In the same respect, the study is proposing a new approach for classifying precast concrete beam-column connections as rigid by relating the connection fixity factor with the moment redistribution. It has been shown that the connection could be classified as rigid if the fixity factor is not less than 0. 73 and the available moment redistribution from the midspan to the supports is not less than the required moment redistribution resulting from semi-rigid frame analysis. In the theoretical part, an analytical tool has been calibrated to predict the rotational stiffness of the specimens with semi-rigid behaviour under gravity loads. The model showed a reasonable agreement with the experimental results. To help the modelling, two pull-out tests were conducted to determine the bond-slip relation of steel bars embedded in cement-based grout. Moreover, a finite element numerical simulation model using the ANSYS software package was carried out to replicate the experimental results of the semi-rigid specimens tested under gravity loads. In spite of providing results close to experimental values prior to yielding, the FE model was not able to predict the failure mode and consequently the correct ultimate load. This is due to the simplified way of modelling the interaction between the corrugated sleeves and the surrounding concrete as perfect bond. The research concludes that the precast beam-column connection investigated in the current study can be treated as an emulative monolithic connection under gravity loads through using the strong connection concept; however, it is not suitable to resist beam net sagging moments. Besides, the study concludes that to consider a precast concrete beam-column connection as rigid, it is required to correlate the fixity factor with the moment redistribution.

40|$|Four {{types of}} {{integral}} bridges were modelled using the Midas Civil software; {{analysis of the}} results in terms of displacement, deflection, moments and torsion were considered. Creep and shrinkage, traffic and temperature loadings are taken into account. Skew angles were increased and sizes of abutments varied. The skew bridge had the majority of displacement on the short term of 40 days; a considerable percentage of displacement takes place on the long term up to 25 %. The abutment angle affects the displacement of the skew bridges; the abutment with the acute angle had horizontal displacement of 27. 2 mm while the abutment with the obtuse angle had less horizontal displacement of 13. 2 mm on the long term when the abutment size is 0. 5 m. For deflection, skew bridges has more deflection than the square bridges. Increasing the skew angle, the deflection increases. On the long term, {{it was discovered that}} about 5 % of the deflection takes place. Comparing the result of the skew to the square bridge, the 8. 60 bridge had 73 % displacement more than the prestress bridge and 44. 5 % more than the non prestress bridge. The 130 skew bridge has higher deflection comparing with the non-prestress and prestress respectively. There were hogging moments because of the traffic loading that was considered during the modelling of the bridges.

40|$|The main {{aspects that}} have to be {{considered}} in the analysis of composite structures are presented and discussed. Most of composite structures concern floors of buildings and bridges, so that in this lecture the attention is mainly devoted to composite beams. To correctly evaluate stresses in the concrete slab an effective width is considered to account for shear lag and moreover, to account for local buckling phenomena, the sections are divided in four classes according to the slenderness of the parts in compression. The moment of resistance of sections is calculated through plastic analysis in sections belonging to class 1 or 2, whereas the elastic analysis is used for sections in class 3 or 4. In case of plastic analysis a partial shear connection may be provided in <b>sagging</b> <b>moment</b> regions; in this case the section moment of resistance is governed by the resistance of the shear connection. In the elastic analysis of sections the effects of creep and shrinkage have to be considered because they cause significant redistribution of section stresses. At serviceability limit states, besides the check on the values of stresses, the deflection and the crack width need to be limited. The tension stiffening of concrete in tension among two consecutive cracks needs to be considered to evaluate correctly the deflection in continuous composite beams. The global analysis may be carried out using elastic analysis. At ultimate limit state some moment redistribution to account for the inelastic behavior of materials and for cracking has to be applied to optimize the sections. The limits of moment redistribution are related to the maximum rotation capacity of the sections subjected to maximum hogging moments. A broad numerical study was carried out by the author to determine the permissible moment redistribution domain that satisfies at the same time both the rotation compatibility and the crack width in service. Propped cantilevers and fixed-end beams with different types of class 1 sections were considered in the study. Moreover a low ductility reinforcing steel (elongation at maximum load 2. 5...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for {{sustainable}} constructions, composite structures become more important and lead to slim and economic solutions. The determination of moment resistance for composite beams follows the rules for composite structures according to EN 1994 - 1 - 1. For the plastic design it is still assumed, that each cross-sectional fibre can plastify without any limitation of strains. For normal composite beams in case of <b>sagging</b> <b>moments</b> and a high-lying plastic neutral axis, the real moment resistance is slightly higher than the plastic resistance. This {{is based on the}} large strains at the bottom side of the section, so that the lower steel flange reaches the solidification range. In case of sections with a large compression zone height xpl, a concrete failure in the compression zone can happen before reaching the plastic moment resistance. In these cases a strain limit design, based on the strain-stress relationships of concrete and steel, becomes decisive. EN 1994 - 1 - 1 provides only for cross-sections of classes 1 and 2 in steel grades S 420 and S 460 a limitation of plastic design. It is to point out, that the rotation capacity of a composite section is not only conditioned by the b/t ratio of the steel section, but also the concrete part has a significant impact. This applies not only for high steel grades. Though, in Eurocode 4 there are no further regulations given for sections with lower steel grades. Especially, the more and more upcoming integrated and compact composite sections underline the importance of such requirements. Therefore, the objective of the recent research is concentrated on the development of additional regulations, to consider the influence of concrete compression zone height onto the moment resistance of composite beams...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with local buckling and lateral distortional buckling, two aspects of instability that govern the design of composite beams in hogging regions. Local buckling in hogging regions of a continuous composite beam was modelled by moment curvature characteristics of a cantilever, modified by two curvature ratios, K 1 and K 2. Test based expressions for K 1 and K 2, {{in terms of a}} combined slenderness λc, were developed, and subsequently used in numerical analyses of 50 two-span composite beams to assess moment redistribution allowed for Class 2 beams by draft Eurocode 4. The analyses include effects of non-linear material properties, residual stresses and local buckling. The parametrical studies include adverse values, in relation to practice, of relative length of adjacent spans, span-to-depth ratio, and ratio of hogging to <b>sagging</b> <b>moment</b> of resistances. It is concluded that the redistribution of elastic bending moments allowed by the draft Eurocode 4 is safe and economical. Distortional lateral buckling of composite beams with both continuous and discrete U-frame actions was studied experimentally. Distortional lateral buckling was found in the tests of two composite beams with inverted U-frame actions. Web distortion was effectively reduced by vertical web stiffeners, which form a part of discrete U-frames together with the slab and the connection of U-frame. The work provides background to assess lateral buckling strength for composite beams with both continuous and discrete U-frame actions. A further theoretical approach on the topic of discrete inverted U-frame action was presented. Strength and stiffness of discrete U-frame connections were also studied. The strength of a discrete U-frame connection was found to be influenced by both the shear failure of concrete, and the yielding of steel top flange in the connection. A simple rule to assure strength of U-frame connections is proposed by checking these two failures separately. The prediction of shear failure of a U-frame connection is based on a truss model, and the prediction of failure in the steel top flange is based on a rigid plastic mechanism. A semi-empirical formula for flexibility of a U-frame connection was derived. They were all checked against test results. Interactive U-frame force and U-frame stiffness were also studied.

40|$|Multi-span precast {{concrete}} segmental bridges are commonly constructed using the balanced cantilever method, which essentially involves sequentially extending precast segments outwards from each pier in a balanced manner. A gap of 100 to 200 mm wide is usually provided around the mid-span location between {{the last two}} approaching segments to facilitate erection. In-situ concrete is then cast to ‘stitch’ the segments together, thus making the bridge deck continuous. In the current practice, the in-situ concrete stitches are usually designed {{to be capable of}} sustaining considerable <b>sagging</b> <b>moment</b> but only minimal hogging moment. Failure of stitches may occur under exceptional circumstances that may potentially trigger a progressive collapse. However, relatively little research in this area has been carried out. In view of this, the author is motivated to undertake an extensive study of the behaviour of in-situ concrete stitches and the effects of their performance on the robustness of typical segmental bridges. Experimental study is carried out to examine the behaviour of in-situ stitches under different combinations of internal forces. Series of stitch specimens of different configurations are tested. Subsequent parametric studies are conducted numerically {{to examine the effects of}} various parameters on the load-displacement characteristics of the stitches. Formulae for strength estimation are proposed based on the results. A study of robustness involves analyzing the collapse behaviour of a structure in an extreme event and the analysis should be carried out up to and then well beyond the state of peak strength of structural members. A finite element programme for post-peak analysis is therefore developed for the present study. As the ability of a member section to sustain large inelastic deformation can ultimately affect the robustness of a structure, an investigation is conducted to examine the effects of steel content, yield strength and prestressing level on the ductility and deformability of prestressed concrete sections. Using the programme developed, the formation of collapsing mechanisms of a multi-span segmental bridge deck in an extreme event is examined. A typical bridge deck is subject to prescribed accidental load on its span in order to analyze the sequence of failure. Substantial redistribution of internal forces along the deck is observed as failures initiate, thus causing subsequent failures of other deck sections even though they have been designed to resist the internal forces at the ultimate limit state. The results indicate that any span of a multispan bridge may become a temporary end-span in the event of collapse of an adjacent span and the strength of the sections must be designed accordingly to prevent progressive failure. As a span becomes a temporary end-span, the in-situ concrete stitches may experience substantial moment and shear, and their failure could potentially trigger progressive collapse of the entire bridge deck. Towards the end of the thesis, important design considerations that can enhance the performance of in-situ concrete stitches and robustness of {{precast concrete}} segmental bridges are presented. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{predictive}} model is adopted for quantifying the stochastic variability {{of the global}} static bending load acting on a tanker ship in sagging. The purpose of the investigation is to provide quantitative information on the uncertainties affecting the prediction of still water load effect to be possibly utilised in a reliability evaluation of the hull girder strength. The various sources of variability in bending loads are reviewed, then the attention is focussed {{on the influence of}} the uncertainties affecting the cargo weight distribution on board. Loading modes corresponding to uniform filling levels are analysed in particular, based on the note that such conditions are both the most frequent and those inducing the highest <b>sagging</b> <b>moments.</b> The loading process is simulated by a stochastic variation of the filling levels in the various tanks around the nominal values. The characteristics of the probability distributions for filling levels are derived from a specific analysis carried out on the detailed reports of two sister ships, compiled {{at the end of the}} loading process. These data reflect also geometrical and operational constraints of the specific ships. The fluctuation of filling levels represents a disturbance in input to the loading process that is partially controlled by means of a feed-back based on trim checks. The corresponding variations in the still water bending moment (SWBM) are identified, with retro-actions triggered by different levels of deviation from the predicted trim conditions. The advantages of the predictive procedure are seen in a direct modelling of physical quantities subjected to uncertainties and of the control process put in place by the crew, allowing a better understanding of the reasons for the variability of the bending loads. Further, the model allows to focus on a specific loading condition that can be adopted as reference situation for the structural checks. The results in terms of mean values and coefficients of variation are compared with those provided by other procedures proposed in literature and considerations are made on a possible improvement in the stochastic model of SWBM in reliability evaluations...|$|R

40|$|In Eurocode 4, {{design rules}} are {{suggested}} {{for the evaluation}} of the mechanical properties of structural steel-concrete composite joints (rotational stiffness, resistance and ductility). These rules cover situations where the joints are subjected to moments and shear forces, but in hogging regions only. Recently, researches have been conducted on the behaviour of composite joints subjected to <b>sagging</b> bending <b>moments</b> and to combined bending moments and axial loads, types of loadings which appear in composite frame further to a column loss. In the present paper, recent developments allowing to extend the EC 4 design rules to joints in sagging regions (loading which can occur, for instance, in sway composite frames) are presented and the proposed method is validated through comparisons with experimental test results. Also, an easy-to-apply design software (which will be freely available), applying the rules recommended in Eurocode 4 in a safe and easy way, is described. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Suspension bridges are long-span {{flexible}} structures {{susceptible to}} {{various types of}} wind-induced vibrations such as buffering actions. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model formulated to deal with suspension bridges under turbulent wind with effective attack angle is presented. In this model, all sources of geometric non-linearity such as cable <b>sag,</b> force-bending <b>moment</b> interaction in the bridge deck and towers as well as changes in bridge geometry due to large displacements are fully considered. The wind loads which include buffeting loads and self-excited loads are converted into the time domain by using a computer simulation technique to form aerodynamic damping and stiffness matrices as well as element loading vectors. Furthermore, a more refined model of wind loads is constructed in order to investigate the effect of an instantaneous change in effective attack angle of turbulent wind on bridge buffeting response. By comparing the results with those obtained by classic buffeting theory through an example bridge, {{the validity of the}} presented method is verified. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
