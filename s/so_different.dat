Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause decompression sickness.

5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells.

Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, <b>so</b> <b>different</b> methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty.

The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E

5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered <b>so</b> <b>different</b> that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they {{saw no reason to}} join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E
5|$|With this {{widespread}} appeal, {{the myth}} appears in more ancient texts {{than any other}} myth and in an exceptionally broad range of Egyptian literary styles. These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail. Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration. Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, may adapt the myth to suit its particular purposes, <b>so</b> <b>different</b> texts can contain contradictory versions of events. Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, different versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive story than most Egyptian myths.|$|E

5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, <b>so</b> <b>different</b> molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, are <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from Efe's {{that it is}} highly {{unlikely}} that they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins can be used to demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E
5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are <b>so</b> <b>different</b> that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E

Managing this complexity is difficult, expensive, and inefficient.|$|R
5|$|Wallace, {{following}} {{on earlier}} work by de Candolle, Humboldt and Darwin, made major contributions to zoogeography. Because of {{his interest in}} the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in South America and then in the Malay archipelago. While in the archipelago he identified the Wallace line, which runs through the Spice Islands dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a New Guinea/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be <b>so</b> <b>different,</b> could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote The Geographical Distribution of Animals, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, Island Life, in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by Philip Sclater for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.|$|E
