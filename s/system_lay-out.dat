40|$|This study {{aimed at}} gaining {{insight into the}} main factors {{that have to be}} taken into account when {{designing}} a planning system for the co-ordination between cells in a cellular manufacturing system. In the last decades, the application of cellular manufacturing systems has become increasingly popular, both in production and service industries. The concept is known under various names: team based production, semi-autonomous groups, group technology, and so on. A change towards cellular manufacturing has important consequences for both the design and organization of the production <b>system</b> (<b>lay-out,</b> technology, and the allocation of tasks, responsibility and authority with respect to the transformation process in the system). However, the transformation process has to be planned and controlled in order to obtain the logistical benefits of a change towards cellular manufacturing. In this study, we investigate the consequences of applying cellular manufacturing for the design of a planning system. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{gasification}} {{of biomass}} wastes deriving from certain industrial processes {{is an interesting}} option for cogenerating heat and power. The utilization of the syngas in a high temperature fuel cell {{could lead to the}} improvement of electrical efficiency in comparison with traditional CHP plants. In this paper the performance of various Biomass Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell (BIGFC) plants are investigated. In particular an atmospheric down-draft gasifier has been considered for syngas production. The fuel cell used for power generation is a 250 kW solid oxide fuel cell, which has been simulated through a zero-dimensional steady-state model and integrated in Aspen Plus® software for evaluating the performance of the entire plant. Various <b>system</b> <b>lay-outs</b> have been investigated to analyze the effect on plant efficiency of the following parameters: (i) gasification air pre-heating; (ii) use of 90 % pure oxygen for gasification; (iii) use of enriched air (55 % 02) for gasification; (iv) recirculation of anodic gas flow; (v) installation of a SOFC/GT hybrid cycle for power production. BIGFC plants show an electrical efficiency in the range 20 - 27 %, and a thermal efficiency of 39 - 59 %. If a SOFC/GT hybrid cycle is installed electrical efficiency grows up to 39 %...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In several {{countries}} patients {{are assumed to}} choose a health care provider and an insurer, both as a worthwhile effort for patients and as an instrument to encourage competition between providers and insurers. In the end, patient choice is assumed to result in more choice opportunities for patients and more efficient health care of higher quality in general. It needs to be investigated, however, whether the promotion of patient choice indeed is a worthwhile effort for patients, whether they take up their role by actively choosing a health insurer and care providers and whether the goals of more efficient and better quality of care are reached. The workshop will cover the choices that patients are expected to make in different countries {{in the context of}} these countries’ healthcare systems. Objective: The objective of the workshop is to learn about the role of patient choice in health care systems of different countries. The added value of this workshop is that patient choice is discussed in the broader context of the health care systems. In this way, this workshop contributes to sharing knowledge between countries’ policies on patient choice. Consequently, differences between countries in the outcomes and mechanism of patient choice can be explained. Additionally, this will give insight in evidence based policy and might have implications for policy measures in different countries and different health care <b>systems.</b> <b>Lay-out</b> of the workshop The workshop contains four presentations on patient choice, from three different countries. The first presentation will be from the German perspective. This presentation includes conceptual remarks, an overview on research on patient choice in Germany and comparative comments on research in other countries. The second and third presentations are from the Dutch perspective. One presentation will shed light on the influence of health insurers on enrolees’ care provider choice and the other presentation about the relationship between patient choice of health care providers (both as an instrument and a goal) and patient experiences. In the fourth presentation the impact of choice reforms for key stakeholders and the current revival and potential broadening of choice policies in Norway will be discussed. The workshop will end with a discussion on the impact of patient choice on the goals that are supposed to be reached by promoting this in health care systems, namely more choice opportunities for patients and more efficient health care of higher quality. Key messages Patient choice is discussed in the broader context of three countries’ health care systems. Differences in outcomes between countries are discussed and explained. This may have implications for policy measures in different countries and different health care systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirements}} on process {{monitoring and control}} are always increasing and, in relation to this, {{there is also an}} increase of the complexity of monitoring and control applications. Therefore advanced and more powerful concepts for monitoring and control systems are needed. The 32 -bit-computer-generation (PCs, Workstations), standardized communication systems/networks as well as object-oriented modelling and programming are substantial elements in this field. The object oriented approach should be a general feature, so that the object oriented modelling of the application, the object oriented representation of the monitoring and control system and the object oriented design of the man-machine-interfaces (engineering, process control) are harmonized. In order to get this aim a large scope of design facilities can be used to establish the class tree, which is the basis for object oriented information processing.

40|$|Flow {{control by}} fluidic devices- without moving parts- offers {{advantages}} of reliability and low cost. As {{an example of}} their automobile application based on authors ’ long time experience the paper describes a fluidic valve for switching exhaust gas flow in a NOx absorber into a by-pass during regeneration phase. The unique feature here is the fluidic valve being of monostable and of axisymmetric design, integrated into the absorber body. After development in aerodynamic laboratory, the final design was tested on engine test stand and finally in a car. This proved that the performance under high temperature and pulsation existing in exhaust systems is reliable and promising. Fluidic valves require, however, close matching with aerody-namic load. To optimize the exhaust <b>system</b> <b>lay-out</b> for the whole load-speed range and reaching minimum counter-pressure, both the components of exhaust system and control strategy have to be properly adopted.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} some of {{the most}} recent activities in Germany in the technical assessment of future European launcher architecture. In focus is a joint effort of DLR-SART with German launcher industry in the definition of a next generation upper-medium class expendable TSTO with an initial operational capability after 2020. Involved companies are EADS astrium and MT Aerospace. This DLR-agency funded study WOTAN investigates fully cryogenic launchers as well as those with a combination of solid and cryogenic stages, fulfilling a requirement of 5000 kg single payload into GTO. Solid strap-on boosters should allow both versions further payload growth capability.

40|$|This paper deals {{about the}} {{application}} of MILP for economic optimization of complex cogenerative systems. In particular, it optimizes both the size and operating strategy of CHP <b>systems</b> and the <b>lay-out</b> of micro district heating networks applied to a urban contest. The proposed model considers the possible adoption {{of a set of}} micro-cogeneration gas turbines located in different buildings, and of a centralized cogeneration system thus allowing part of the required thermal energy to be produced in a single site. In addition, thermal and photovoltaic panels can be integrated into the system to improve thermal and electrical energy production, respectively. Each site can be connected to the others through district heating micro-grids. Hence thermal energy can be distributed inside the system. A further objective of the paper is to evaluate the effect of different economic support policies on the optimal solution, and to relate the economic effort implied in each support policy with the expected results in terms of CO 2 emissions reduction and primary energy savings...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of the Garden City’s idea during the Twentieth Century and to present some of it’s expressions in contexts far apart from those in which the idea was initially conceived (Europe and Great Britain particularly). The aim is to demonstrate the hypothesis that this influence can be conveniently described in terms of four basic elements: the central parts of the city, the lay-outs of the streets; the “minimum units”; the open mainly natural space. Each of these four elements is declined according to a certain aspect: the central parts of the city according to the multiplication of the centres; the layouts of the streets are presented as <b>systems</b> of free <b>lay-outs,</b> that can be re-conducted to a character of fluidity of design and constructed shape; the neighbour-hood units organized following a hierarchical sequence; the open mainly natural space generally assuming a double role, as element of separation between the parts of the city and, at the same time, of connection of the parts.

40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of reliability}} of systems has, for decades, {{been based on}} the structure function, which expresses functioning of a system given the states of its components. One problem of the structure function is that, in its simplest form, for a system with m components it must be specified for 2 m combinations of component states, which is impossible for most practical systems and networks. Recently, the authors have introduced the survival signature, which is {{a summary of the}} structure function that is meaningful if the system’s components can be divided into groups with exchangeable failure times. The survival signature takes all the aspects of the <b>system</b> <b>lay-out</b> into account and is sufficient for a range of inferences, in particular, to derive the system’s failure time distribution given the components’ failure time distributions. In this paper, we provide a brief introductory overview of the survival signature, including recent advances. We then suggest a fundamental change {{to the nature of the}} structure function, namely from being a binary function to a probability, or even an imprecise probability. This provides a generalized tool for realistic quantification of system reliability and can straightforwardly be incorporated into the survival signature. We discuss opportunities these concepts provide for practical reliability assessment, and challenges for their application to real-world systems...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{cell systems}} are always said to show high {{electrical}} efficiency. The results achieved up to now, however, differ considerably, especially {{between the various}} fuel cell types all using natural gas as fuel. With the presented study {{the reasons for the}} different results and general potentials for fuel cell systems are highlighted. For that purpose several <b>system</b> <b>lay-out</b> concepts were elaborated for PEFC, PAFC and SOFC. The performed energy balance calculations for eight different plant concepts (three PEFC, two PAFC and three SOFC) for steady state operation with methane revealed that because of external reforming PEFC and PAFC systems are limited to about 67 % and 70 %, respectively, for the fuel utilisation. High temperature fuel cells can achieve at least 80 % because of the possibility of internal reforming, or even over 90 % in case of anode off-gas recycling. In combination with a cell voltage which is about 100 mV lower than that of MCFC and planar SOFC, PEFC can only achieve 38 % of electrical net efficiency, PAFC 42 % and tubular SOFC 54 %. The latter is similar to MCFC, which is operated at higher cell voltage but lower fuel utilisation. The highest efficiency with up to 63 % can be achieved with planar SOFC systems, because this concept allows high fuel utilisation together with high cell voltages.

40|$|Based on the booster {{stage of}} the DSL TSTO-concept with {{separation}} Mach number range 2. 7 to 3. 5, {{the results of a}} parametrical investigation of air-breathing engine types will be described in this paper. Basic demand for the propulsion system is full operability from take-off to separation. Same air mass flow at sea-level conditions and similar levels of cycle temperatures are assumed for all investigated types. Due to the overall <b>system</b> <b>lay-out</b> hydro carbon fuels will be used. Investigated engines include turbojet and turbofan with afterburner in a single or two spool configuration. Additionally a turbo-rocket with storable propellants is considered. The influence of engine pre-cooling by water injection or CH 4 -heat exchanger is moreover examined. An expander cycle simular to Japanese ATREX-type is finally evaluated. In a separate approach the efficiencies of the main propulsion components air-intake and thrust nozzle are regarded. The number of intake ramps is varied for external and mixed compression character. Axial-symmetric and 2 D-nozzle configurations are modified in mechanical complexity and for the maximum exit area. A combined numerical engine performance calculation, and a simulation of the, for all engine types fixed DSL-trajectory, deviver the propellant mass. This procedure is followed by a preliminary design of the complete air-breathing engine, including the air-intake and the nozzle. Using a fast analytical design-tool built on structural mechanical as well as empirical relationships, an engine mass estimation is performed, enabling the application of advanced material technology. Evaluation of concepts regards the sum of fuel and engine mass normalized by the system take-off weight...|$|E
40|$|Large {{areas of}} {{globally}} important tropical peatland in Southeast Asia {{are threatened by}} land clearance, degradation and fire, jeopardising their natural functions as reservoirs of biodiversity, carbon stores and hydrological buffers. Many development projects on tropical peatlands have failed {{because of lack of}} understanding of the landscape functions of these ecosystems. Utilisation of these peatland resources for agriculture or other land use requires drainage which, unavoidably, leads to irreversible loss of peat through subsidence, resulting in severe disturbance of the substrate, CO 2 -emissions and problems for cultivation. To assist planners and managers in wise use of these tropical peatlands a decision support system (DSS) has been developed. This DSS, which is based on a GIS application, combines the Groundwater Modelling Computer Programme PMWIN with expert knowledge on subsidence, land use and water management. The DSS can be used to predict the long-term effects of different types of land use, e. g. peat swamp forest, sago or oil palm plantations, on the lifetime and associated CO 2 release of these tropical peatlands. The type of land use dictates the required depth of the groundwater table, which on its turn has a significant effect on the sustainability of the peatland. Therefore, special attention should be paid when deciding which type of land use to pursuit. The Decision Support System (DSS) will help to improve the decision-making process. The groundwater model PMWIN was selected because it maintains a good balance between the complexity of the model (esp. regarding to its input data requirements) and the availability of input data. The groundwater model was calibrated using data from the Balingian Area, Central Sarawak, Malaysia. The model was used to predict, based on a given land use scenario, the ratio between surface and groundwater runoff, the depth of the groundwater table and recharge and discharge zones of the peat dome. Various land use scenarios, each with its own specific water management requirements, were developed and used to predict the long-term changes in ground level and associated CO 2 release. For each scenario the following outcome was generated: time span after which the water management systems have to be deepened, time span after which gravity drainage is no longer possible, time span for peat disappearance. Final results are presented in the form of maps generated by the GIS application. These maps serve as a communication tool with stakeholders to demonstrate what the hydrological effects are on for instance a certain land use type and drainage <b>system</b> <b>lay-out...</b>|$|E
