5|$|The {{reality of}} Domitian's autocracy was further {{highlighted}} by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of {{time away from the}} capital. Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was. Until the completion of the Flavian Palace on the Palatine Hill, the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three years of his reign in Germania and Illyricum, conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald {{managed to escape}} {{with the aid of}} Rögnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds, and {{thereafter}} (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus' (referred to in the sagas as Garðaríki or Svíþjóð hin mikla). He likely <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg), arriving there {{in the first half of}} 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and Morkinskinna says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.|$|E

40|$|International {{competitions}} require {{football teams}} to travel across multiple time zones. In some circumstances these competitions are held at altitudes {{of up to}} 3600 m. This presents football players with challenges associated with transmeridian travel and altitude exposure, which {{have been shown to}} impair sleep quantity and quality (Reilly, 2009; Roach et al., 2013). Specifically, youth football players’ at altitude obtain less deep sleep and less rapid eye movement sleep (Sargent et al., 2013). Given that muscle recovery takes place during deep sleep, the reduction in deep sleep at altitude may limit athletes’ postexercise processes (Dattilo et al., 2011, Samuels, 2008). Sleep disturbances in athletes has been shown to decline with the amount of time <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> altitude, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> in the absence of jet-lag (Roach et al., 2013, Sargent et al., 2013). Yet, international competition at altitude is often accompanied by transmeridian travel, which causes a temporary misalignment between the internal body clock and the local destination time. Although transmeridian travel and altitude exposure are known to disrupt sleep, their combined effects have not been examined. To address this oversight, this study examined the longitudinal changes in the extent of sleep disruption, in response to, the combination of transmeridian travel and ascending to altitude...|$|R

50|$|Once {{there is}} a clear picture of the economy through the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and Multipliers, its {{behavior}} can be predicted for a defined event: if DEMCO spent 20% of its earnings on bananas in 2006, then received an additional $1,000,000 of income from a new project in 2007, the banana industry could expect to make approximately $200,000 more that year. If 5% of the banana grower’s industry is spent on fertilizer, the fertilizer industry could expect $10,000 more; and so on. However, at each of these steps, each company will source some products out of the region of the economy of study. These are the losses that occur and eventually drive the cycle to zero. The total increase in economic activity from that million dollar project is the economic impact of the project; $1,000,000 <b>spent</b> became <b>at</b> <b>least</b> $1,210,000 of economic activity giving the DEMCO a multiplier of 1.21 - Every dollar spent on DEMCO creates 1.21 dollars of economic activity.|$|R

Palmerston passed the Reformatory Schools Act 1854 which gave the Home Secretary powers to send juvenile prisoners to a reformatory school instead of prison. He was forced to accept an amendment which ensured that the prisoner had to have <b>spent</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three months in jail first.

40|$|Purpose: Public health {{strategies}} {{attempt to}} stimulate participation in physical activity, aiming at permanent behavior change.

Their current level of physical activity was assessed by the Modified Baecke Questionnaire.
