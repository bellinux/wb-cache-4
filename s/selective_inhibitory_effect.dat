The compounds inhibit the replication of RSV and influenza A virus in HeLa and MDCK cells, at concentrations of 0. 16 and 4. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and are nontoxic to growing cells at concentrations of > 100 micrograms/ml. The mode of antiviral action of the sulfonic acid polymers can be ascribed to inhibition of virus-cell fusion (for influenza A virus) or inhibition of both virus-cell binding and fusion (for RSV). The sulfonic acid prototype PAMPS [poly(2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic acid) ], when administered intranasally to mice as a single dose of 10 or 50 mg per kg of body weight {{at the time of}} infection, completely inhibited influenza A virus replication (in lungs) and virus-associated lung consolidation in immunocompetent mice and completely protected NMRI and SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) mice against influenza A virus-associated mortality. When administered 1 h before or after virus inoculation, no protective effect was observed at a dose of 10 or 100 mg/kg.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} effects of sulphasalazine (SASP) on the {{systemic}} and mucosal humoral immune systems in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS [...] Serum concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL- 6), class and subclass specific IgG, IgA and IgM, IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies and rheumatoid factors (RF) of IgG, IgA (including IgA 1 and IgA 2 subclasses) and IgM isotypes were measured before and 16 weeks after sulphasalazine (SASP) therapy in 15 female and three male patients with RA. Amounts of immunoglobulins in saliva and jejunal fluid were measured as estimates of mucosal humoral immunity. RESULTS [...] Serum concentrations of IgA and IgG decreased significantly during SASP therapy and correlated with reduced concentrations of IL- 6. In addition, levels of circulating IgA RF, IgA anti-gliadin antibodies and IgM RF decreased significantly after the treatment. In contrast, immunoglobulin levels in saliva and jejunal fluid were unaltered. CONCLUSION [...] SASP exerts powerful but <b>selective</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> on systemic immunoglobulin production, whereas no effects on mucosal immunoglobulin production were observed. The decreased systemic B cell activity may be mediated by downregulation of the production of IL- 6, a cytokine with Ig switching properties...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) and {{estrogen}} receptor (ER) {{are both}} important mediators of signal transduction in cardiovascular and reproductive tissues. In this study, we evaluated NO-mediated S-nitrosylation of ER and assessed {{the effect of}} this structural modification on transcription-related functions of ER. We have found <b>selective</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of NO on specific binding of ER to specific estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) that can be reversed {{in the presence of the}} reducing agent, DTT, thus suggesting that S-nitrosylation of thiolate–zinc centers may occur within the ER molecule. Furthermore, we examined <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of NO on ER-dependent transcriptional activity by using an ERE-driven reporter gene system. By monitoring biophysical changes in the structure of NO-treated or untreated human recombinant ERα,we obtained evidence for the formation of S-nitrosothiols in the ER molecule. In addition, we have detected specific S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues within the ER molecule by immunodetection of S-nitrosocysteine moieties in ER. Collectively, these findings suggest an important physiological role for NO in modification of human ER structure by S-nitrosylation, an effect that leads, in turn, to impaired DNA-binding activity of ER and subsequent blockade of estrogen-dependent gene transcription. Thus, NO-induced S-nitrosylation of ER can occur at cysteine residues that coordinate Zn 2 + within the two major DNA-binding Zn-finger domains of ER, resulting in selective inhibition of DNA-binding at specific ERE. This cross-communication between NO and ER may favor activation of rapid (nongenomic) signaling pathways and subsequent modulation of downstream genomic activity...|$|R
