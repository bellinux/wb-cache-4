40|$|Introduction: There is {{a growing}} demand for {{non-invasive}} methods with no down time and minimal risk for facial skin rejuvenation and treatment of wrinkles. The Maximus system, based on TriLipo technology, combines radiofrequency and Dynamic Muscle Activation (DMA). We evaluate d the safety and efficacy of the Maximus TM system {{for the treatment of}} facial wrinkles. Methods: Twenty women received 8 weekly treatments for facial wrinkles using the Maximus system. Treatment efficacy was assessed by comparing pre- and post-treatment photographs, assessing skin characteristics using the 3 D Visioscan system, assessing skin microtopography using the DUB ultrasonic scanning sys tem, assessing microcirculation conditions of facial skin using Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) and subjective evalua tion of skin improvement. Results: No adverse events were observed. Following the treatments, positive changes in skin flakiness (scaliness), roughness, smoothness and wrinkles were demonstrated using Visioscan. A thickening of the epidermal-dermal layer and increased structural homogeneity were observed by ultrasound, hyperechogenicity was in creased and areas of hypoechogenicity reduced. Microcirculation was improved, corresponding with a positive trend for improved skin characteristics. Conclusions: The Maximus system powered by the TriLipo technology is a non-invas ive, effective, <b>safe,</b> <b>and</b> virtually <b>painless</b> treatment for reduction of wrinkles and facial skin rejuvenation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cervical {{dilation}} using mechanical dilators {{is associated}} with various complications, such as uterine perforation, cervical laceration, infections and intraperitoneal hemorrhage. To achieve <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> cervical dilation, we constructed a new medical device to achieve confident mechanical cervical dilation: a continuous controllable balloon dilator (CCBD). Methods Controlled pumping of incompressible fluid into the CCBD increases the pressure and outer diameter of the CCBD, continuously dilating the cervical canal. The reliability of the CCBD was confirmed in vitro (testing for consistency and endurance, with no detected risk for breakage) and in vivo. A multi-center clinical study was conducted,with 120 pregnant women {{randomly assigned to one}} of three groups: Group I,control group, no dilation;Group II,mechanical dilation, Hegar dilator (HeD); and Group III,CCBD. The tissue material for histological evaluation was obtained from the endocervical mucosa before and after dilation using the HeD or CCBD. Results The CCBD dilations were successful and had no complications in all 40 patients of Group III. The cervical tissue was markedly less damaged after CCBD dilation compared with HeD dilation (epithelium damage: 95 % (HeD) vs. 45 % (CCBD), P P P Conclusions The CCBD should be used as a replacement for mechanical dilators to prevent uterine and cervical injury during cervical dilation.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is {{considerable}} uncertainty over the diagnosis, treatment {{and management of}} upper limb pain, which has implications for patient care. Research into patient experiences and evaluation of health-care has been neglected and the study presented here aims to fill this gap. METHODS: A two-staged, mixed methodology was adopted. Phase 1 involved a postal survey of a random sample (n = 2781) of the working age population (25 - 64) of an area in south-west England. Phase 2 consisted of follow-up, informal face-to-face interviews with a purposive sample of 47 informants identified, according to pre-defined criteria, from the survey sample. RESULTS: Our data showed that concerns {{about the effectiveness of}} treatments for alleviating pain were fundamental to users' evaluations of both orthodox and non-orthodox health-care. This took priority over the need for a diagnosis and other information. There was a general recognition that the treatments available were, at least, only partially effective and the pragmatic approach led some to eventually withdraw from both orthodox care and complementary and alternative medicines (CAM). CONCLUSION: Patients' priorities for health-care, in this context, were perceived to involve the provision of treatments which alleviated pain and were <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>painless.</b> Orthodox and non-orthodox care needed to be more closely integrated into primary care services. ...|$|E

Breath VOCs were assayed in 51 asymptomatic women with abnormal mammograms and biopsy-proven breast cancer, and 42 age-matched healthy women. A fuzzy logic model predicted breast cancer with accuracy superior to previously reported findings. Following random assignment to a training set (64) or a prediction set (29), a model was constructed in the training set employing five breath VOCs that predicted breast cancer in the prediction set with 93. 8 % sensitivity and 84. 6 % specificity.

40|$|Intradermal {{delivery}} of antigens for vaccination {{is a very}} attractive approach since the skin provides a rich network of antigen presenting cells, which aid in stimulating an immune response. Numerous intradermal techniques {{have been developed to}} enhance penetration across the skin. However, these methods are invasive and/or affect the skin integrity. Hence, our group has devised zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-rods for non-destructive drug delivery. Chemical vapour deposition was used to fabricate aligned nano-rods on ZnO pre-coated silicon chips. The nano-rods’ length and diameter were found to depend on the temperature, time, quality of sputtered silicon chips, etc. Vertically aligned ZnO nano-rods with lengths of 30 – 35 µm and diameters of 200 – 300 nm were selected for in vitro human skin permeation studies using Franz cells with Albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) absorbed on the nano-rods. Fluorescence and confocal studies on the skin samples showed FITC penetration through the skin along the channels formed by the nano-rods. Bradford protein assay on the collected fluid samples indicated a significant quantity of Albumin-FITC in the first 12 h. Low antibody titres were observed with immunisation on Balb/c mice with ovalbumin (OVA) antigen coated on the nano-rod chips. Nonetheless, due to the reduced dimensions of the nano-rods, our device offers the additional advantage of excluding the simultaneous entrance of microbial pathogens. Taken together, these results showed that ZnO nano-rods hold the potential for a <b>safe,</b> non-invasive, <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> intradermal drug delivery...|$|R

The MN delivery of DNA vaccines to the dermis {{may result in}} a superior immune response and/or an equivalent immune response at a lower vaccine dose (dose-sparing). This could be of special interest for immunization programs against neglected tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis. In this work, we loaded a MN device with 60 μg of a plasmid DNA cocktail encoding the Leishmania infantum nucleosomal histones H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3 and H 4 and compared its immunogenicity and protective capacity against conventional s. c. or i. d. injection of the plasmid. Mice immunized with MNs showed increased ratios of IFN-γ/IL- 10, IFN-γ/IL- 13, IFN-γ/IL- 4, and IFN-γ/TGF-β in the spleens and lymph nodes compared with mice immunized by s. c. and i. d. routes. Furthermore, CCXCL 9, CXCL 10 and CCL 2 levels were also higher. These data suggest that the nucleic acid immunization using MNs produced a better bias towards a Th 1 response. However, none of the immunizations strategies were able to control Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice, as illustrated by an increase in lesion size and parasite burden...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{compression}} of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms {{is a time}} consuming, painful, and sometimes unsuccessful procedure. Thrombin injection has been advocated as a superior alternative. In this study, we compare our experiences with both techniques. Methods: All the records of femoral artery false aneurysms that were treated in the vascular laboratory from January 1996 to April 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment with ultrasound scan–guided compression was compared with treatment with dilute thrombin injection (100 U/mL). Results: Both groups had similar demographics and aneurysm sizes (P >. 2). Of the pseudoaneursyms, 88 % were caused by cardiac catheterization {{and the others were}} the results of femoral artery access for cardiac surgery (6 %), arteriography (5 %), and renal dialysis (1 %). Compression was successful in 25 of 40 patients (63 %). Nine persistent aneurysms necessitated operation, and six were treated successfully with thrombin injection. Primary thrombin injection successfully obliterated 21 pseudoaneurysms in 23 patients. Overall, 27 of 29 pseudoaneurysms were treated successfully with thrombin injection (93 %). Thrombosis occurred within seconds of the thrombin injection and required, on average, 300 units of thrombin (100 to 600 units). The patients who underwent successful compression required an average of 37 minutes of compression (range, 5 to 70 minutes) and required analgesia on several occasions. No patients in the thrombin group required analgesia or sedation. Neither group had complications. A cost analysis shows that thrombin treatment results in considerable savings in vascular laboratory resource use but not in overall hospital expenditures. Conclusion: Ultrasound scan–guided thrombin injection is a <b>safe,</b> fast, <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> procedure that completely obliterates femoral artery pseudoaneurysms. The shift from compressive therapy to thrombin injection reduces vascular laboratory use and is less expensive, although it does not significantly impact hospital costs.

40|$|Retinal and choroidal {{vascular}} diseases, {{with their}} associated abnormalities in vascular permeability, {{account for the}} majority of patients with vision loss in industrialized nations. VEGF is upregulated in ischemic retinopathies such as diabetes and is known to dramatically alter vascular permeability in a number of nonocular tissues via Src kinase–regulated signaling pathways. VEGF antagonists are currently in clinical use for treating the new blood vessels and retinal edema associated with neovascular eye diseases, but such therapies require repeated intraocular injections. We have found that vascular leakage following intravitreal administration of VEGF in mice was abolished by systemic or topical delivery of what we believe is a novel VEGFR 2 /Src kinase inhibitor; this was confirmed in rabbits. The relevance of Src inhibition to VEGF-associated alterations in vascular permeability was further substantiated by genetic studies in which VEGF injection or laser-induced vascular permeability failed to augment retinal vascular permeability in Src–/– and Yes–/– mice (Src and Yes are ubiquitously expressed Src kinase family members; Src–/– and Yes–/– mice lacking expression of these kinases show no vascular leak in response to VEGF). These findings establish a role for Src kinase in VEGF-mediated retinal vascular permeability and establish a potentially <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> topically applied therapeutic option for treating vision loss due to neovascular-associated retinal edema...|$|E

Objectives: Our objective was to evaluate whether neuromuscular electrostimulation is useful for improving peroneal muscle strength in post-operative congenital clubfoot in children. Patients and Methods: An experimental, prospective, longitudinal, and comparative study was carried out on 10 patients with congenital clubfoot in the experimental group, and on 10 for historical controls. Initial and post-treatment clinical evaluations were conducted on patients in both groups. Surface electromyography (SEMG) {{was used for the}} experimental group; each patient received 30 sessions of treatment with neuromuscular electrostimulation in order to obtain muscular contraction. Results: In both groups, there were more males with the average age or 5. 5 years (ranging from 3 to 8 years of age). Peroneal muscular strength evaluated through the Daniels and Worthingham’s test increased post-treatment only in the experimental group, and comparing these results to those of the historical group, a significance level of P = 0. 001 was obtained. The motor unit potential amplitude in the SEMG increased in the experimental group with a significance level of P < 0. 05.

Methods/MaterialsA novel, three-needle delivery device (Peregrine™) {{was used to}} denervate the renal arteries of adult swine (n= 17) and in a first-in-man feasibility study (n= 18). In the pre-clinical testing EtOH was infused bilaterally with one infusion per renal artery into to the perivascular space, using EtOH doses of 0. 3 ml/artery (n= 8), and 0. 6 ml/artery (n= 9), and with saline sham control (0. 4 ml/artery n= 3). Renal parenchymal norepinephrine (NE) concentration (performed blindly), and safety were the primary endpoints. Data from the first-in-man study (n= 18) to evaluate device performance, safety and peri-procedural pain are reported. ResultsIn the pre-clinical testing renal function was unchanged at 3 -month follow-up. Angiography at 90 days (n= 34 arteries) demonstrated normal appearing renal arteries, unchanged from baseline, and without stenosis or other abnormalities. The reductions in mean renal parenchymal NE reductions at 3 months were 68 % and 88 % at doses of 0. 3 and 0. 6 ml, respectively (p< 0. 001 vs. controls). In the first-in-man study, there was 100 % device success, no complications, a mean treatment time of 4. 3 ± 3 minutes/artery, and minimal or no patient discomfort during treatment. Angiography at 6 -months showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis, and evidence of a reduction of blood pressure from baseline.

The Radiographers' skills in ultrasound differ according to the country and the basic formations. And throught this study we want to emphasize about the role of radiographer. Aim: The porpuse of this study is determine the volume and morphological characteristics of normal thyroid order to get reference values for young adults. Material and Method: We selected 204 students consist of male and female from Danang University of Medical Technology And Pharmacy were studied. Mean age of our subjects was 22 (range 18 - 25) all of them were healthy and with normal thyroid gland status. Descriptive statistics and analytic statistic was used. Results: In our study, the thyroid volume between female and male is different. The total thyroid volume significantly correlated with individual’s height, weight, body surface area and body mass index. The mean of total thyroid volume was 7. 44 ± 2. 09 ml (range 3. 51 - 14. 57). The thyroid volume was best correlated with height (r = 0. 44; p = 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{vasodilatation}} achieved by various diagnostic methods (arterial occlusion, ganglionic block established by certain agents, lumbar sympathetic block, spinal anesthesia, and indirect heating) was studied {{by means of}} the pneumo-plethysmogram as well as through readings of skin temperature and skin resistance. The data obtained were interpreted as to their value in determining the type of patient with vascular disease for whom lumbar sympathectomy would be of noticeable benefit. Arterial occlusion proved itself a rapid and simple method which in most patients produced satisfactory results. As a rule, lumbar sympathectomy was effective in patients who preoperatively had shown a positive response upon release of arterial occlusion. A negative response, that is, absence of significant increase in blood flow, does not necessarily indicate organic disease, and cannot be taken to mean that lumbar sympathectomy would always be ineffective. Ganglionic block, using 2. 6 dimethyl piperidinium bromide or tetraethylammonium ion, was generally less reliable in indicating the probable results of sympathectomy than lumbar sympathetic block or indirect heating. Lumbar sympathetic block with procaine was followed by a greater increase in skin temperature and blood flow than spinal anesthesia, and permitted far more accurate conclusions as to the probable outcome of sympathectomy. Subsequent to indirect heating the plethysmogram showed characteristic differences depending on the degree of vascular disease present. From the effect of this simple, <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> method upon the relative blood flow to the toe it becomes possible to arrive at a comparatively accurate estimate of the clinical benefit to be expected from lumbar sympathectomy...|$|E

While minor bleeding {{at the site}} of sampling is a common condition, uterine hematoma is a rare complication. An endometrial biopsy was routinely performed on an unsedated 17 year-old welsh pony mare in estrus during a research protocol. From the next day on and during the following 7 days, a large amount of sanguineous fluid was observed in the uterine cavity during the daily ultrasound examination performed according with the protocol. No fever or any other systemic symptoms were noticed. Two weeks later, the ultrasound examination revealed an organised hyperechogenic mass compatible with a hematoma within the endometrial lumen. The mare was regularly controlled {{during the rest of the}} breeding season and no abnormalities in her cyclicity were observed. The size of the hematoma only began to decrease from the 3 rd month after the biopsy onward and it disappeared completely 2 months later. This was the only complication following a biopsy in this study protocol that included a total of 70 biopsies on 49 mares and the very first case the authors got to see while biopsies have been common practice in their clinical and research activities for years. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the appearance of this condition is documented. The hematoma took 5 months to disappear at the ultrasound examination.

Writing for the Court's majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor concluded that [...] "the state did not directly compel respondent to refuse the test" [...] and that a [...] "simple blood-alcohol test is so <b>safe,</b> <b>painless,</b> <b>and</b> commonplace" [...] a suspect would not feel coerced to refuse the test. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall, in which he argued that the Court in Schmerber intended to adopt a broad and liberal interpretation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.|$|R

40|$|Background: Capsule {{endoscopy}} (CE) {{is a new}} {{diagnostic tool}} {{for the study of}} patients with suspected small bowel pathology. The aim {{of the study was to}} clarify the usefulness of CE in the group of patients with obscure (overt / occult) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Patients and methods: Thirty patients (14 men, 16 women, mean age 50 years, range 9 - 79 years) were enrolled in the study. All of them undergone non-diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and barium follow-through of the small bowel. All patients underwent capsule endoscopy. Fourteen patients had overt and sixteen occult bleeding. The single senior endoscopist interpreted CE findings in an unblended manner. Results: CE identified a source of bleeding in 14 / 30 patients (46, 6 %). Lesions identified were: tumors in five pts, vascular lesions, Crohn's disease and Meckel's diverticulum in two pts and fresh bleeding, segmental celiac disease and colonic diverticulosis in one patient each. CE identified a source of bleeding in 9 / 14 (64, 3 %) of patients with ongoing overt bleeding and in only 5 / 16 (31, 3 %) of patients with occult bleeding. The positive suspicious findings were seen in 6 / 30 (20 %) of patients (2 / 14 with overt bleeding and 4 / 16 with occult bleeding. In 3 / 14 (21, 4 %) with overt and 7 / 16 (43, 7 %) with occult bleeding findings on CE were negative. All patients with negative findings on follow-up remained asymptomatic for one year. Capsule retention because of unsuspected stenosis occurred in a single patient and required surgery, which resolved the problem. Conclusion: CE is an effective diagnostic tool for patients with obscure GI bleeding. It is <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> technique which can diagnose the bleeding site beyond the reach of conventional endoscopy. The best candidates for the procedure are those with ongoing and overt bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Lead (Pb) {{poisoning}} is preventable but {{continues to}} be a public health problem in several countries. Measuring Pb in the surface dental enamel (SDE) using microbiopsies is a rapid, <b>safe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> procedure. There are different protocols to perform these microbiopsies, but the reliability of dental enamel lead levels (DELL) determination is dependent upon biopsy depth (BD). It is established that DELL decrease from the outermost superficial layer to the inner layer of dental enamel. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine DELL obtained by two different microbiopsy techniques on SDE termed protocol I and protocol II. Two consecutive enamel layers were removed from the same subject group (n = 138) for both protocols. Protocol I consisted of a biopsied site with a diameter of 4 mm after the application of 10 l HCl for 35 s. Protocol II involved a biopsied site of 1. 6 mm diameter after application of 5 l HCl for 20 s. The results demonstrated that there were no significant differences for BD and DELL between homologous teeth using protocol I. However, there was a significant difference between DELL in the first and second layers using both protocols. Further, the BD in protocol II overestimated DELL values. In conclusion, SDE analyzed by microbiopsy is a reliable biomarker in protocol I, but the chemical method to calculate BD in protocol II appeared to be inadequate for measurement of DELL. Thus, DELL could not be compared among studies that used different methodologies for SDE microbiopsies.

40|$|Description of the condition: Chronic pain is {{a common}} problem. When defined as pain of {{greater than three months}} duration, {{prevalence}} studies indicate that up to half the adult population suffer from chronic pain, and 10 to 20 % experience clinically significant chronic pain (Smith 2008). In Europe 19 % of adults experience chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity with serious negative implications for their social and working lives and many of these receive inadequate pain management (Breivik 2006). Chronic pain is a heterogenous phenomenon that results {{from a wide variety of}} pathologies including chronic tissue injury such as arthritis, peripheral nerve injury, central nervous system injury as well as a range of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia. It is likely that different mechanisms of pain production underpin these different causes of chronic pain (Ossipov 2006). Description of the intervention: Brain stimulation techniques have been used to address a variety of pathological pain conditions including fibromyalgia, chronic post-stroke pain and complex regional pain syndrome (Cruccu 2007; Fregni 2007; Gilula 2007) and clinical studies of both invasive and non-invasive techniques have produced preliminary data showing reductions in pain (Cruccu 2007; Fregni 2007; Lefaucheur 2008 b). Various types of brain stimulation, both invasive and non-invasive are currently in clinical use for the treatment of chronic pain (Cruccu 2007). Non invasive stimulation techniques require no surgical procedure and are therefore easier and safer to apply than invasive procedures. They include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES). rTMS involves stimulation of the cortex by a stimulating coil applied to the scalp. Electric currents are induced in the brain directly using rapidly changing magnetic fields (Fregni 2007). Trains of these stimuli are applied to the target region of the cortex to induce alterations in cortical excitability both locally and in remote cortical and subcortical brain regions (Leo 2007). A recent meta-analysis suggested that rTMS may be more effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions with a central compared to a peripheral nervous system origin (Leung 2009). tDCS and CES involve the <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>painless</b> application of low intensity (commonly ≤ 2 mA) electrical current to the cerebral cortex of the brain (Fregni 2007; Gilula 2007). tDCS has been developed as a clinical tool for the modulation of brain activity in recent years and uses relatively large electrodes that are applied to the scalp over the targeted brain area to deliver a weak constant current (Lefaucheur 2008 a). Recent clinical studies have concluded that tDCS was more effective than sham stimulation at reducing pain in both fibromyalgia and spinal cord injury related pain (Fregni 2006 a; Fregni 2006 b). CES was initially developed in the USSR as a treatment for anxiety and depression in the 1950 s and its use later spread to Europe and the USA where it began to be considered and used as a treatment for pain (Kirsch 2000). The electrical current in CES is commonly pulsed and is applied via clip electrodes that are attached to the patients earlobes. A Cochrane review of non-invasive treatments for headaches (Bronfort 2004) identified limited evidence that CES is superior to placebo in reducing pain intensity after 6 to 10 weeks of treatment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the short- and {{long-term}} results of treatment for haemorrhoids by prospectively comparing two techniques, namely, stapled rectal prolapse mucosectomy according to Longo and open hemorrhoidectomy. One hundred consecutive patients were randomised to stapled (50 patients) or manual hemorrhoidectomy (50 patients). We analysed postoperative pain, preoperative and postoperative anorectal function, intraoperative and postoperative complications, time needed to return to work and to normal social activities, and costs. Long-term follow data were obtained by means of an outpatient visit. The operative time of the stapled technique was less than that of open haemorrhoidectomy (22 vs 35 minutes). Two cases of early postoperative bleeding occurred after the stapled technique. The mean pain score on a visual scale was significantly less in patients undergoing the stapled technique. In addition, the time needed to return to work and to normal social activities was significantly less after the stapled technique, which, however, proved to be a more expensive procedure. Stapled mucosectomy of the prolapsed rectal mucosa is a <b>safe,</b> rapid, <b>and</b> relatively <b>painless</b> technique, which has a low incidence of complications. It can be performed in a day surgery unit. Patient satisfaction, early return to normal activities and good long-term results counterbalance the high cost of the procedure...|$|R
