40|$|Recently BLDC motors {{have been}} popular in various {{industrial}} applications and electric mobility. Recently BLDC motors have been popular in various industrial applications and electric mobility. In most {{brushless direct current}} (BLDC) motor drives, there are three hall sensors as a position reference. Low resolution hall effect sensor is popularly used to estimate the rotor position because of its good comprehensive performance such as low cost, high reliability and sufficient precision. Various possible faults may happen in a hall effect sensor. This paper presents a fault-tolerant operation method that allows the control of a BLDC motor with one faulty hall sensor and presents the hall sensor output fault-tolerant control strategy. The situations considered are when the output from a hall sensor stays continuously at low or high levels, or a short-time pulse appears on a hall sensor signal. For fault detection, identification of a faulty signal and generating a <b>substitute</b> <b>signal,</b> this method only needs {{the information from the}} hall sensors. There are a few research work on hall effect sensor failure of BLDC motor. The conventional fault diagnosis methods are signal analysis, model based analysis and knowledge based analysis.

Compared to detection agencies the result may, however, be both, crowding out and crowding in of business ethics. The crucial feature is the bank's ability to discriminate between trustworthy and unreliable debtors which, in our model, is formally captured by the probability difference of accepting their respective credit applications...|$|R
30|$|The {{perception}} of visual signals {{is determined by}} two components: the physical characteristics of a habitat and the sensory properties of a receiver (Endler 1990); therefore, a change {{in one of these}} two components tends to drive the development of <b>substitute</b> <b>signals</b> in response to variable habitats (Chunco et al. 2007; Endler 1980), which has been demonstrated by several studies (Dalton et al. 2010; Fuller et al. 2005; Gray et al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2007). Based on the observation that the two aforementioned and closely related bitterlings exhibit distinct nuptial colorations, it is hypothesized that the differences in their nuptial colorations may be related to variations in photic properties of its habitats and/or spectral sensitivities of the fish. To test this hypothesis, the spectral sensitivities of these two bitterlings were recorded with electrophysiological method and the light spectra of their habitats were measured and compared.|$|R

40|$|Condorcet (1785) {{proposed}} {{that a majority}} vote drawn from individual, independent and fallible (but not totally uninformed) opinions provides near-perfect accuracy {{if the number of}} voters is adequately large. Research in social psychology has since then repeatedly demonstrated that collectives can and do fail more often than expected by Condorcet. Since human collective decisions often follow from exchange of opinions, these failures provide an exquisite opportunity to understand human communication of metacognitive confidence. This question can be addressed by recasting collective decision-making as an information-integration problem similar to multisensory (cross-modal) perception. Previous research in systems neuroscience shows that one brain can integrate information from multiple senses nearly optimally. Inverting the question, we ask: under what conditions can two brains integrate information about one sensory modality optimally? We review recent work that has taken this approach and report discoveries about the quantitative limits of collective perceptual decision-making, {{and the role of the}} mode of communication and feedback in collective decision-making. We propose that shared metacognitive confidence conveys the strength of an individual's opinion and its reliability inseparably.

Today's rapid development in packaging technologies allows additional downscaling of self-sufficient wireless sensors from some cubic centimetre {{to less than}} 1 cm 3. Ongoing system miniaturization at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration (IZM) targets an edge length of 6 mm. These wireless sensors reduce the wiring complexity and mounting costs in the automotive industry while <b>substituting</b> <b>signal</b> wires by radio communication. They allow efficient solutions for applications like {{tire pressure monitoring system}}s, which requires low weighted self-sufficient sensors to reduce out-of-balance forces. Furthermore the lowering of substrate area reduces mechanical stress applied to the electronic device. Tiny wireless ultrasonic sensors and cameras mounted on external rear mirrors are further instances to monitor blind angles and to be integrated into parking distance control systems. Innovative packaging technologies and power aware design enable system shrinking considering automotive requirements. During the design process the coupling of very narrow positioned components have to be addressed. The counter measures can be selected either by software, hardware or technology. The methodologies of an ultra low power design are fundamental during the development of tiny wireless sensors to allow ultra dense system integration with innovative packaging technologies for automotive applications.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide further evidence on the association between the IPO signaling mechanisms (i. e. retained ownership, auditor choice, and earnings forecast) by using a less restrictive sample and by performing additional empirical tests. Design/methodology/approach – Single equations are used as the baseline approach to estimate the three models. In addition, Copley and Douthett's 2002 simultaneous equation systems are applied to examine whether the results remain the same. Moreover, ranked values of the risk proxies of IPOs are derived and general least squares are run on these ranked variables. Findings – Findings indicate that auditor reputation and retained ownership are not <b>substitute</b> <b>signals.</b> It is observed that as firm risk increases, entrepreneurs are more likely to retain higher ownership to signal firm value. In addition, contended that positive earnings disclosure before IPO is not associated with retained ownership in a significant manner. An analysis of the economic implication of the results suggests that findings are more representative. Research limitations/implications – In this study the risk measures used (as well as those used in other studies) may not adequately proxy for offering firm risk. Additionally, the sample is restricted by missing values of the retained ownership variable. Further study can expand the sample using retained ownership obtained from other data sources. A study employing alternative approaches to control for the supply-side effect of firm risk could be also productive. Practical implications – Findings are of particular interest to firms that are planning to go to the public. They need to evaluate the benefit and cost of selecting a particular information system in signaling firm value to the market. Originality/value – Using a larger sample, comprehensive testing periods, and ranked risk proxies contribute to the literature on evaluating singling mechanisms of IPOs.

40|$|Studies of the {{genetics}} of nodulation by Bradyrhizobium japonicum have revealed many similar features with Rhizobium and Azorhizobium species, but also apparent differences. The regulation of nod gene expression in B. japonicum is complex, involving {{the interplay of}} the positive regulator, NodD,, {{as well as a}} repressor, NolA. A unique feature of B. japonicum is the involvement of a two-component regulatory system, NodV and NodW, in the control of nod gene expression. It is not clear why B. japonicum requires this level of complexity to control nod gene transcription. The nod gene products encode the biosynthesis of <b>substituted</b> lipo-chitin Nod <b>signals</b> that induce many of the early nodulation events. B. japonicum and B. ekanii produce a large variety of such Nod signals. The basic structure of the Nod signal, an acylated oligomer of N-acetylglucosamine, is synthesized through the action of NodA, NodB, and NodC. Various substitutions of this basic structure confer host specificity to the molecule. For example, in B. japonicum, the nodZ gene product is essential for fucosylation of the terminal, reducing N-acetylglucosamine residue. These observations argue for the interaction of a <b>substituted</b> Nod <b>signal</b> with a specific plant receptor molecule. However, structure/function studies using chemically synthesized Nod signal molecules suggest a more complex interaction between chain length and specific substitution. These findings leave open the possibility that a general chitin receptor may function in a unique way to elicit nodule formation. The novel features discovered through the study of B. japonicum contribute to our general understanding of nodulation and to the larger question of plant cell signal transduction...|$|R

In addition, STE 2 expressed in a MATα ste 3 mutant allowed the cell to conjugate with a cells but at an efficiency lower than that of wild-type α cells. This result indicates that signal(s) generated by a-factor in α cells can be <b>substituted</b> by <b>signal(s)</b> generated by the interaction of α-factor with the expressed STE 2 product. When STE 2 or STE 3 was expressed in a matα 1 strain (insensitive to both α- and a-factors), the cell became sensitive to α- or a-factor, respectively, and resulted in morphological changes. These results suggest that STE 2 and STE 3 are the sole determinants for α-factor and a-factor sensitivity, respectively, in this strain. On the other hand, expression of STE 2 in an a/α diploid cell did not affect the α-factor insensitive phenotype. Haploid-specific components may be necessary to transduce the α-factor signal.
