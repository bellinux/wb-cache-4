5|$|Dickinson played pubs with Shots on {{a regular}} basis to small audiences. One {{particular}} night, Dickinson suddenly stopped {{in the middle of a}} song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention. He got such a good response he <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company was {{the first}} {{management}} consultancy to hire recent graduates instead of experienced business managers, when it <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> so in 1953. Many of its recruits are Baker Scholars, Fulbright Fellows, Rhodes scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates-Cambridge scholars, or White House Fellows. Less {{than half of the}} firm's recruits are from business majors, while others have advanced degrees in science, medicine, engineering or law. Prestigious business colleges may have McKinsey consultants assigned to cultivating relationships with upcoming graduates.|$|E
5|$|I <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination}} of 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

5000|$|He {{released}} {{two books}} containing his unique view of doing business. People admire his unique view {{which he called}} [...] "Stupid Learning", {{that we do not}} need to be smart to <b>start</b> <b>doing</b> business, instead we can use our dullness to <b>start</b> <b>doing</b> business. He illustrates a stupid man will <b>start</b> <b>doing</b> business as soon as an idea pops into his head, while an educated man will spend his time thinking which ideas need to be applied, and then at the end none of his ideas become reality. Sadino also emphasizes that theory without practice is nothing. Furthermore, he also has a unique trademark that he usually wears short-sleeved shirts and shorts on most occasions. Even when he met Suharto, a former Indonesian president, he stuck with his style of dress.|$|R

25|$|Congolese bands <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> Cuban {{covers and}} singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were {{creating}} their own original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Congolese called this new music rumba, although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted {{in the establishment of}} several different distinct regional genres, such as soukous.|$|E

The subtlety of the new distinctions on the World Teacher issue was lost on many of his admirers, who were already bewildered or distraught because of the changes in Krishnamurti's outlook, vocabulary and pronouncements–among them Besant and Mary Lutyens' mother Emily, who had a very close relationship with him. He soon disassociated himself from the Theosophical Society and its teachings and practices, yet he remained on cordial terms with some of its members and ex-members throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|When I first <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> {{the stain}} paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E
