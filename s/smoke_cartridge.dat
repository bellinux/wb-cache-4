5000|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>Cartridge</b> (WP): Designation M722. Used as a screening, signaling, or marking munition.|$|E
50|$|Older {{cartridges}} {{designed specifically}} for the M79 grenade launcher or the AN/M8 pyrotechnic pistol also remain in inventory. The XM675/M675 is a red <b>smoke</b> <b>cartridge</b> used primarily for training {{in the use of}} the XM674/M674 riot control cartridge mentioned later in this article.|$|E
50|$|It {{can fire}} either 26.5 mm or 25 mm flares, or <b>smoke</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Adapters are {{available}} to use commercial 12 gauge flares available at sporting goods stores.|$|R
40|$|Smoke-generating {{system used}} to {{identify}} vortex-core and vortex-core-breakdown locations in flights. Housed in forebody of airplane, includes multiple pyrotechnic <b>smoke</b> <b>cartridges</b> fired simultaneously or in sequence. Firing of cartridges controlled from cockpit, and smoke produced ducted to desired locations on or near surface of aircraft. Useful for other aerodynamic flight research in which necessary to visualize local flows. Nonaerospace applications include research in reduction of aerodynamic drag on vehicles and reduction of turbulence related to structures or other obstacles...|$|R
50|$|Preloaded <b>Smoke</b> Pot - <b>Cartridges</b> {{designed}} {{to release a}} mushroom cloud of smoke.|$|R
40|$|A smoke {{generator}} system {{was developed for}} in-flight vortex flow studies on the F- 18 high alpha research vehicle (HARV). The development process included conceptual design, a survey of existing systems, component testing, detailed design, fabrication, and functional flight testing. Housed in the forebody of the aircraft, the final system consists of multiple pyrotechnic <b>smoke</b> <b>cartridges</b> which can be fired simultaneously or in sequence. The smoke produced is ducted to desired locations on the aircraft surface. The {{smoke generator}} system (SGS) has been used successfully to identify vortex core and core breakdown locations as functions of flight condition. Although developed for a specific vehicle, this concept may be useful for other aerodynamic flight research which requires the visualization of local flows...|$|R
40|$|Wildland fire {{suppression}} personnel {{employed by the}} CDF do not currently have the equipment {{to protect themselves from}} the short-term acute affects of smoke from wildland fires. In addition, no regulations exist that specify appropriate respiratory protection and the current air-purifying respirator technology and carbon monoxide monitoring has not been adapted to fit wildland {{fire suppression}} requirements. This three-year limited study evaluated the ability of wildland fire fighters to perform their normal job function while wearing full-face air-purifying respirators. In {{the first two years of}} this study we designed, developed and field tested a prototype ``smart`` air-purifying respirator which incorporated a real-time carbon monoxide monitor into a commercial full-face respirator. ` Data on carbon monoxide exposure while fighting wildland fires was collected. During the third year of this study we evaluated eight different commercially available full-face air-purifying respirators equipped with a variety of cartridges. Apparatus to aid the fire fighter in carrying the respirator and carbon monoxide personal monitor was designed and fabricated. A smoke exposure test method was developed and a laboratory study on the penetration of <b>smoke</b> through respirator <b>cartridges</b> was conducted...|$|R
