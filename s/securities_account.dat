50|$|Derivative {{agreements}} such {{as those}} embodied in International Swaps and Derivatives Association contracts may also fall {{within the scope of}} the decision. Unlike in the United States, Canadian security interests in cash deposits are not perfected by control, as is allowed under Article 9 of the US Uniform Commercial Code. Registration is the only option, which can expose a counterparty to the risk of subordination to prior registered interests. It has been argued, however, {{that in the case of}} title transfers of securities (or cash in a <b>securities</b> <b>account),</b> provincial Securities Transfer Acts or other laws similar to UCCs Article 8 would ensure that the collateral taker should be perfected by control.|$|E
50|$|If Article 8 is {{set aside}} and the {{brokerage}} account is considered purely under principles of common law, {{there is a}} possibility of construing the collection of brokerage accounts in the intermediated custodial holding chain as a collection of directed agency nominee trusts. According to this legal theory, each securities position with respect to a particular class of securities which appears in the brokerage firm's omnibus <b>securities</b> <b>account</b> is a trust fund for the benefit of customers sharing participation in that position. To exactly what extent the operation of such a theory would be restricted by Article 8 and the Securities Investor Protection Act in future litigation is not obvious, and is perhaps irrelevant as a practical matter because of the level of detail in the legislation mentioned.|$|E

40|$|The paper proposes two {{significant}} modifications of Japan’s Act on Transfer of Bonds, Shares, etc. (BETA). First, it suggests the control agreement method of transferring {{an interest in}} securities that is effective against third parties. Under the BETA, {{the creation of an}} effective interest in book-entry securities requires book entries in the securities accounts of the transferor and the transferee. Under the control agreement approach, the transferor, transferee, and the transferor’s securities intermediary would agree that (i) the intermediary would act on the instructions of the transferee with respect to securities credited to the transferor’s <b>securities</b> <b>account</b> or (ii) the intermediary would not act on the instructions of the transferor or (iii) both (i) and (ii). No book entries would be necessary. Second, it proposes to permit the creation of an effective transfer of an interest in a securities account—i. e., in any securities that from time to time are credited to a securities account—again, without book entries with respect to specific securities. The paper explains the historical origins of the control agreement and <b>securities</b> <b>account</b> concepts as they evolved in the revisions of UCC Articles 8 and 9 and as subsequently adopted by the GSC, providing inspiration for our proposals. It describes the transfer of securities under the BETA and it explains how the BETA could be revised to adopt the proposals. It also identifies some troublesome aspects of the BETA’s treatment of title transfer security interests (jōto tanpo) {{in the context of a}} transferee’s insolvency proceeding. The core of the paper is a policy analysis of the proposals. We conclude that the revisions would fit well with the underlying policies and the basic structure of the BETA and that on balance the revisions would be beneficial, such as by providing flexibility in financing and potentially lowering transactions costs...|$|E

40|$|The {{difficult}} {{question of where}} financial losses are directly sustained has been (partly) solved by the European Court of Justice on 28 January 2015.

The Rome II Regulation prescribes that the law applicable to tort claims is the law of the country in which the direct losses are sustained.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} private {{law of the}} United States and Japan that applies to the holding of {{securities}} through intermediaries, such as securities firms and banks. In particular, it focuses on Articles 8 and 9 of the United States Uniform Commercial Code and the Japanese Book-Entry Transfer Act. That act is now in effect in Japan for most securities other than equity securities and it will become operative for equities in January 2009. The paper also examines the proposed UNIDROIT Draft Convention on Substantive Rules regarding Intermediated Securities. The Convention will be discussed at a diplomatic conference {{to be held in}} Geneva in September 2008, with the goal of adopting a final text. It considers the Convention on alternative assumptions that the non-Convention law is the law of the United States or the law of Japan. It generally concludes that the functional approach (i. e., result- oriented, as opposed to doctrine- or theory-oriented) adopted by the Convention is successful and appropriate. Finally, the paper considers differences between United States law and Japanese law in the context of similarities and differences in the principal systems and practices for clearance and settlement of securities transactions in the United States and Japan. book-entry, central securities depository, intermediary, securities, <b>securities</b> <b>account,</b> security interest, settlement...|$|E
40|$|The Cross-Border Market Practices Sub-Group (XMAP) has {{conducted}} {{an analysis on}} optional matching fields with objectives to analyse of impact of T 2 S market practice on (a) maximisation of settlement matching rates and (b) minimisation of cross-matching. The analysis consists of an introduction of different concepts related to matching and a theoretical analysis on how the matching rate and cross-matching are impacted by different combinations of Matching Fields. In the analysis the three T 2 S Optional Matching Fields-Common Trade Reference, Client of CSD Participant, <b>Securities</b> <b>Account,</b> have been evaluated against three criteria of uniqueness, standardisation and availability. Further, impact of changing the Optional Matching Fields into mandatory, optional with a default value or additional has been assessed. Based {{on the fact that}} the use of Optional Matching Fields would not prevent cross-matching and the fact that making mandatory fields that are not available in all cases creates an operational burden, the XMAP acknowledges that the most appropriate change would be to define the Optional Matching Fields as additional. However, the XMAP considers that with no experience on the usage of the matching fields in T 2 S there is not sufficient information available to propose a change that would help achieving the objective to reduce cross-matching without affecting matching efficiency. In this situation, the XMA...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis of}} this essay, written as {{a chapter in}} a {{forthcoming}} book, {{is that in the}} mutual fund context, the specifics of fiduciary duty reflect the distinctive qualities of this form of investment in securities. The particular contours that shape fiduciary duty reflect many factors, including the highly prescriptive regulatory context distinctively applicable to mutual funds. To sharpen its depiction of the fiduciary distinctiveness of mutual funds, I draw contrasts with two other avenues through which an investor may delegate investment choice: (1) 2 ̆ 2 private 2 ̆ 2 funds, that is, vehicles for pooled investments that are not subject to the full regulatory regime applicable to mutual (or 2 ̆ 2 public 2 ̆ 2) funds; and (2) non-fund investment relationships through which an investment adviser undertakes to manage an investor 2 ̆ 7 s individual <b>securities</b> <b>account.</b> The essay also argues that mutual funds represent a distinctively hybrid form of investment. Interposing the fund between investors and the fund 2 ̆ 7 s assets implicates questions of entity governance, however the fund is organized; the fact that regulation requires mutual fund shares to be redeemable causes them to resemble products that may be sold into secondary markets. And the ongoing tri-partite relationship between a mutual fund 2 ̆ 7 s manager, its assets, and its investors at least by analogy constitutes an agency relationship, in which managers owe fiduciary duties on an ongoing basis. Contrasts between mutual funds and private funds are timely, in part because the population of investment advisers now registered with the SEC includes many who advise at least one private fund. Newly-available information about private funds 2 ̆ 7 practices calls into question whether they are always consistent with fund managers 2 ̆ 7 duties to investors, as do data concerning practices of hedge fund managers during the financial crisis. Investments in private funds are not (unlike mutual funds) subject to a redeemability requirement. Even when investors in private funds met criteria for investor sophistication, they made investment decisions in an environment of informational opacity, including how fund managers might use the discretion they retained. Crisis-era data suggest that discretion was not always used {{in a manner consistent with}} the fiduciary duties that private fund managers owed to investors...|$|E
