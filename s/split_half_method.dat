50|$|Reliability {{refers to}} how {{consistent}} a measuring device is. A measurement {{is said to}} be reliable or consistent if the measurement can produce similar results if used again in similar circumstances. For example, if a speedometer gave the same readings at the same speed it would be reliable. If it didn't it would be pretty useless and unreliable. Importantly reliability of self-report measures, such as psychometric tests and questionnaires can be assessed using the <b>split</b> <b>half</b> <b>method.</b> This involves splitting a test into two and having the same participant doing both halves of the test. If the two halves of the test provide similar results this would suggest that the test has internal reliability.There are a number of ways to improve the reliability of self-report techniques. For example ambiguous questions could be clarified {{or in the case of}} interviews the interviewers could be given training.|$|E

40|$|TRADITIONALLY, the {{reliability}} of a test {{is defined as the}} ratio of the variance of true test scores to the variance of the observed test scores. Numerous articles have been written on the concept of reliability and the ways of estimation. The three typical techniques of estimation are (1) the Kuder-Richardson formula 20 (Kuder and Richardson, 1937), (2) the Hoyt analysis of variance method (Hoyt, 1941), and (3) the Rulon <b>split</b> <b>half</b> <b>method</b> (Rulon, 1939). It has been shown that the Kuder-Richardson formula 20 and Hoyt’s method are algebraic equivalents. The reliabilities of many tests have been computed by these methods since their introduction some 30 years ago. Unfortunately, from the theoretical point of view, each of these methods suffers from a certain amount of impurity. Consequently, these methods arrive at the correct estimates only when the im-purities are accidentally absent from the data. For instance, Hoy...|$|E

50|$|The {{second major}} {{improvement}} is increased azimuth accuracy. With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth {{of the aircraft}} {{is determined by the}} <b>half</b> <b>split</b> (centroid) <b>method.</b> The <b>half</b> <b>split</b> <b>method</b> is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the radar beam sweeps past its position.

With MSSR (monopulse secondary surveillance radar) and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse.

Cronbach’s alpha of the Portuguese MOS was 0.95 for the overall scale, ranging from 0.78 to 0.87 for the five subscales proposed by the original instrument (Soares et al. 2012). The results of the French MOS indicated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranged from [...]. 90 to [...]. 97) and composite reliability (ranging from [...]. 93 to [...]. 97) for all dimensions of functional social support (Robitaille et al. 2011). Likewise, a study done in Malay by Rushidi, who validated a Malay version of the MOS survey, demonstrated a high internal consistency (r =  0.98) (Mahmud et al. 2004). In the same way, Sherbourn and Stewart (1991) study illustrated that the English version had high internal consistency. The validation of the questionnaire in Greek language showed that all domains had Cronbach’s a value greater than the 0.9 indicating high internal consistency (Nicolaou et al. 2014). This indicates that all items are homogenous and measure the same characteristics even among the different languages.|$|E

Also, the reliability coefficient was obtained from 20 community heads in 20 towns in Enugu State of Nigeria. <b>Split</b> <b>half</b> <b>method</b> was adopted based on odd and even number items of the instrument. The data collected was analysed using Pearson product moment correlation coefficient and the coefficient alpha obtained was 0. 86. The population of the study consists of 147 town union presidents from the 147 towns in Anambra state. A sample of 100 town union presidents was selected...|$|E
