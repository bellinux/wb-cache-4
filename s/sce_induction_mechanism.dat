Baseline (noninduced) SCE values differ significantly among strains, 129 /ReJ having the lowest and DBA/ 2 having the highest mean SCE per cell values. In general, the baseline SCE {{of a given}} F 1 is {{within the range of}} its corresponding parental strains or near the lower parental value. Furthermore, there is a genotype-dependent increase in mean SCEs per cell with CP dose. Strain differences in <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> are noted particularly at the two higher CP doses (4. 50 and 45. 0 mg/kg). In general, F 1 hybrids involving a strain with high induced SCEs and a strain with low induced SCEs exhibit mean SCE values that are closer to the value of the lower strain. F 1 s involving two strains with high SCEs or two strains with low SCEs yield SCEs not different from parental strains.

Previous work in this area, with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, has shown the (6 - 4) lesion to be more important than the (5 - 6) lesion in affecting cell survival, DNA synthesis, mutation and sister chromatid exchange (<b>SCE)</b> <b>induction.</b> We used CHO cells AA 8 (repair-proficient in removing both lesions), UV 61 (removes only the (6 - 4) and not the (5 - 6) lesions) and UV 5 (removes neither lesion). Cell survival studies showed UV 5 cells were more sensitive to ultraviolet light (UV) than UV 61 cells. DNA synthesis studies showed a fluence dependent effect. The (6 - 4) lesion played a greater role than the (5 - 6) in decreasing DNA synthesis at 2. 5 J/m². At 5 and 10 J/m², the (5 - 6) lesion played a greater role in inhibiting DNA synthesis than seen at 2. 5 J/m². DNA chain elongation was studied by using DNA fiber autoradiography. Our results indicated the (5 - 6) lesion did not form long-term blocks to DNA chain elongation. DNA fiber autoradiography was also used to detect and measure the activation of alternative sites of initiation. The (5 - 6) lesion did activate alternative sites. This activation remained longer than that seen in AA 8 cells but was removed by 5 hrs. SCE studies showed the (6 - 4) lesion {{played a major role in}} <b>SCE</b> <b>induction.</b> Mutation results indicated the (5 - 6) lesion caused mutations more frequently than the (6 - 4), especially at fluences less than 1 J/m².

40|$|Technical {{variables}} in lymphocyte culture, harvest and differential staining were investigated for {{their effect on}} baseline sister chromatid exchange (SCE) levels. The culture medium, 5 Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) concentration and method of differential staining all influenced SCE frequency, whereas the method of lymphocyte separation, the mitogen utilized and the timing of BrdUrd addition did not. Repeat cultures scored for SCE at varying time intervals {{during the course of}} this study showed that for most individuals, baseline SCE levels were constant over time. <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> was studied using a range of chemical and physical agents differing in their interactions with DNA. The results suggested that a variety of DNA interactions culminated in SCE formation. SCE analysis appeared a useful technique for assessing many, but not all, classes of chromosome damaging agents and therefore is best used in conjunction with other test systems in assessing DNA damaging agents. Different experimental protocols were utilized to investigate <b>SCE</b> <b>induction.</b> Induced exchange levels varied considerably between resting (Go) lymphocytes and replicating lymphocytes, and between replicating lymphocytes that had incorporated BrdUrd prior to chemical or physical challenge and those lymphocytes that had not. It appeared that incorporation of BrdUrd into chromosomal DNA increased lymphocyte sensitivity to damage by most agents. These factors should be considered when assessing induced SCEs and a testing schedule is described which would take these {{variables in}}to account. The effect of X irradiation on baseline SCE frequency was studied in detail. X irradiation caused a small but significant increase in SCEs. Although incorporation of BrdUrd sensitizes chromosomes to damage by ionizing radiation, increased BrdUrd concentrations in the culture medium did not lead to an increase in X-ray induced SCEs. Results from post irradiation holding experiments suggested that SCEs represent a form of DNA repair. This SCE repair was thought to operate on residual damage not repaired by other DNA repair mechanisms. A comparison was made between the frequency of induced SCEs in human lymphocytes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

They also exhibited three- to fourfold increases in spontaneous frequency of chromosome aberrations (CAs). To {{determine whether the}} high level of SCE frequency in AC 12 is caused by 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) used for visualizing SCEs, the effect of BrdUrd incorporated into DNA on <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> was analyzed. The SCE frequencies in AC 12 remained constant at BrdUrd incorporation levels corresponding to 2 – 90 % substitution for thymidine in DNA. In addition, the small amount of BrdUrd incorporated into both daughter and parental DNA strands in AC 12 had minimal effect on <b>SCE</b> <b>induction.</b> Furthermore, AC 12 and AC 41 were slightly resistant to BrdUrd with respect to the induction of CAs, the inhibition of cell-cycle progression and the decrease in mitotic activity. These findings suggest that the high incidence of SCEs in AC 12 and AC 41 is formed by their intrinsic defects, not by the effects of BrdUrd used. The analysis of SCE frequencies in hybrid cells between these mutants and the parental L 5178 Y revealed that the genetic defects in AC 12 and AC 41 appear to be recessive, and that these two mutants belong to the same complementation group. Furthermore, AC 12 belonged to a different complementation group from ES 4, which was isolated previously from L 5178 Y as an SCE mutant with a twofold higher frequency of spontaneous SCEs. This finding indicates that at least two different genetic defects participate {{in the formation of the}} high incidence of spontaneous SCEs in mouse cells.

Ethyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl- and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea produced com-parable concentrations (3. 3 to 3. 5 /tmol product/mol DNA phosphate) of O 6 -alkylguanine.

Phage lambda {{was not able to}} lysogenize this mutant, whereas a noninducible mutant of lambda, lambdacIind-, known to synthesize a repressor that is insensitive to the <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> lysogenized it normally. This result suggested that normal phage repressor was synthesized in the STS mutant but was then inactivated by the <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The STS strain also had mutator characteristics, and showed spontaneous, error-prone repair of UV-damaged phage lambda. Derived from a lexA tif sfiA parent strain, the STS mutant carried an additional mutation spr at the lexA locus that resulted in a high level of expression of the induction pathways. The properties of this and related strains provide additional evidence that induction of phage and induction of error-prone DNA repair occur by a similar mechanism, and further suggest a model for the regulation of these pathways...|$|R
40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} {{described}} the community unit {{as one of the}} indirect and implicit means we employ in specifying the behavior of a proposed learning system. It has been pointed out that, for complex problems, the community unit's vision tends to be too narrow and restricted because of its piecemeal manner of attacking problems. This second part of the paper describes a planning mechanism which attempts to overcome this difficulty by taking a larger view of a given task. After surveying the task in general, the planning mechanism subdivides the task into a hierarchy of subtasks each by itself presumably easier to perform than the original task. This hierarchy of subtasks comprises a rough sketch of a possible course of action which guides the community unit. To manage classes of problems and to make efficient use of past experience, an <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed. The <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism</b> will take a still larger view by considering the system's past experience with various problems and by attempting to apply that experience to related problems which have not previously been encountered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cell {{interactions}} that specify the spatial pattern of vulval precursor cell (VPC) fates differ between the nematodes Oscheius tipulae CEW 1 and Caenorhabditis elegans. In the former, the centered pattern of fates is obtained by two successive inductions from the gonadal anchor cell, {{whereas in the}} latter, a single inductive step by the anchor cell (EGF–Ras–MAP kinase pathway) {{can act as a}} morphogen and is reinforced by lateral signaling between the vulval precursors (Notch pathway). We performed a genetic screen for vulva mutants in O. tipulae CEW 1. Here we present the mutants that specifically affect the vulval <b>induction</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Phenotypic and epistatic analyses of these mutants show that both vulval induction steps share common components, one of which appears to be MEK kinase(s). Moreover, the inductive pathway (including MEK kinase) influences the competence of the vulval precursor cells and more strikingly their division pattern as well, irrespective of their vulval fate. Finally, a comparison of vulval mutant phenotypes obtained in C. elegans and O. tipulae CEW 1 highlights the evolution of vulval <b>induction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> between the two species...|$|R
40|$|LmrR is a PadR-related {{transcriptional}} repressor {{that regulates}} {{the production of}} LmrCD, a major multidrug ABC transporter in Lactococcus lactis. Transcriptional regulation is presumed to follow a drug-sensitive <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism</b> involving the direct binding of transporter ligands to LmrR. Here, we present crystal structures of LmrR in an apo state and in two drug-bound states complexed with Hoechst 33342 and daunomycin. LmrR shows a common topology containing a typical beta-winged helix-turn-helix domain with an additional C-terminal helix involved in dimerization. Its dimeric organization is highly unusual with a flat-shaped hydrophobic pore at the dimer centre serving as a multidrug-binding site. The drugs bind {{in a similar manner}} with their aromatic rings sandwiched in between the indole groups of two dimer-related tryptophan residues. Multidrug recognition is facilitated by conformational plasticity and the absence of drug-specific hydrogen bonds. Combined analyses using site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence-based drug binding and protein-DNA gel shift assays reveal an allosteric coupling between the multidrug- and DNA-binding sites of LmrR that most likely has a function in the <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R
