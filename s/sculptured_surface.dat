50|$|The spire is raised, {{with a very}} {{slightly}} concave outline. The apex, {{which consists}} of the minute smooth embryonic whorl and a half, is itself a little flattened, but rises sharply above the <b>sculptured</b> <b>surface</b> of the succeeding whorls. The 5½ whorls show a slow and regular increase till the last, which begins to enlarge rapidly. They are slightly rounded above, very sharply angulated at the keel, and flattened on the base, with a bluntlyangulated umbilical edge. The suture is distinct, and slightly impressed. The square aperture is perpendicular. The sharp outer lip is thickened by a slight internal remote callus, not patulous, not descending, advancing at its junction with the body whorl and then slightly retreating so as to form the very shallow open sinus. It is right-angled at the periphery, flat on the base, where it retreats so as to form two rounded sinuses, making with the columella an angle that is scarcely obtuse. The columellar lip is straight, a little thickened and reverted, so as to leave a slight groove behind it. It advances on the body whorl, then retreats so as to form a feeble sinus, bending {{at the same time}} shortly but sharply to the right into the umbilicus and then advancing straight forward, but a little toward the left, to its junction with the outer lip at the base. The funnel-shaped umbilicus is open-mouthed, oblique edged, straight-sided, deep and contracted internally. Its edge is sharply defined by a spiral thread, and is obliquely scored by the longitudinal ribs. Farther in, its walls are marked by hair-like lines of growth and faint spirals.|$|E
5000|$|Designers {{have long}} used {{computers}} for their calculations. Digital computers {{were used in}} power system analysis or optimization as early as proto-"Whirlwind" [...] in 1949. Circuit design theory, or power network methodology would be algebraic, symbolic, and often vector-based. Examples of problems being solved in the mid-1940s to 50s include, Servo motors controlled by generated pulse (1949), The digital computer with built-in compute operations to automatically co-ordinate transforms to compute radar related vectors (1951) and the essentially graphic mathematical process of forming a shape with a digital machine tool (1952). These were accomplished {{with the use of}} computer software. The man credited with coining the term CAD. Douglas T. Ross stated [...] "As soon as I saw the interactive display equipment," [...] used by radar operators 1953 it would be just what his data reduction group needed. With the Lincoln Lab people, they were the only ones who used the big, complex display systems put in for the pre-SAGE, Cape Cod system. But [...] "we used it for our own personal workstation.". [...] The designers of these very early computers built utility programs so that programmers could debug programs using flow charts on a display scope with logical switches that could be opened and closed during the debugging session. They found that they could create electronic symbols and geometric figures to be used to create simple circuit diagrams and flow charts. They made the pleasant discovery that an object once drawn could be reproduced at will, its orientation, Linkage flux, or scale changed. This suggested numerous possibilities to them. It took ten years of interdisciplinary development work before SKETCHPAD sitting on evolving math libraries emerged from MIT's labs. Additional developments were carried out in the 1960s within the aircraft, automotive, industrial control and electronics industries in the area of 3D surface construction, NC programming and design analysis, most of it independent of one another and often not publicly published until much later. Some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by Robert Issac Newton from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Robert A. Heinlein in his 1957 novel The Door into Summer suggested the possibility of a robotic Drafting Dan. However, probably the most important work on polynomial curves and <b>sculptured</b> <b>surface</b> was done by Pierre Bézier, Paul de Casteljau (Citroen), Steven Anson Coons (MIT, Ford), James Ferguson (Boeing), Carl de Boor (GM), Birkhoff (GM) and Garibedian (GM) in the 1960s and W. Gordon (GM) and R. Riesenfeld in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Part with <b>sculptured</b> <b>surfaces</b> is {{obtained}} in three stages: roughing, semi-finishing and finishing. The roughing operation consists in using flat end tools or fillet end tools on sequential horizontal cutting planes {{to remove the}} most material from the raw part {{as rapidly as possible}} using “Parallel Planes” or “Offset Contours ” machining strategy. When roughing deep parts, radial cutting forces, vibrations and tool bending are important. To avoid these disadvantages, the “Plunge Milling ” strategy is developed. The complex geometry of <b>sculptured</b> <b>surfaces</b> makes the tool path generation without interferences and collisions a very difficult task. In this paper, an automated methodology is proposed for roughing any part with <b>sculptured</b> <b>surfaces</b> from its STL model using “Plunge Milling ” strategy on 3 -axis CNC milling machines. After the specification of the principal parameters (stock allowance, radial cutting depth, radial step, tool diameter and sweeping mode), the methodology determines: 1) intersection contours, 2) machined segments, 3) plunging positions without interferences, 4) plunge depth for each valid plunging position, 5) minimum tool length avoiding collision and finally tool path in « One-Way » or « Zig-Zag » mode...|$|R

40|$|Assigning a {{constant}} feedrate for a ball-nosed cutter {{in the manufacturing}} of <b>sculptured</b> <b>surfaces</b> cannot achieve an optimum material removal rate (MRR).

40|$|In {{rough milling}} of <b>sculptured</b> <b>surface</b> parts, {{decisions}} on process parameters concern feedrate, spindle speed, cutting speed, width of cut, raster pattern angle {{and number of}} machining slices of variable thickness. In this paper three rough milling objectives are considered: minimum machining time, maximum removed material and maximum uniformity of the remaining volume {{at the end of}} roughing. Owing to the complexity of the modelled problem and the large number of parameters, typical genetic algorithms cannot achieve global optima without defining case-dependent constraints. Therefore, to achieve generality, a hierarchical game similar to a Stackelberg game is implemented in which a typical Genetic Algorithm functions as the leader and micro-Genetic Algorithms as followers. In this game, one of the leader's parameters is responsible for creating a follower's population and for triggering the optimisation. After properly weighing the three objectives, the follower performs single-objective optimization in steps and feeds the leader back with the objective values as they appear prior to weighing. Micro-Genetic Algorithm (follower) chromosome consists of the distribution of machining slice thickness, while the typical Genetic Algorithm (leader) consists of the milling parameters.
