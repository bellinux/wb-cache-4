25|$|Fugazi's {{style has}} been {{described}} as post-hardcore, art punk, alternative rock, indie rock and experimental rock. Fugazi's music was an intentional departure from that of the hardcore punk bands the members had played in previously. Fugazi combined punk with funk and reggae beats, irregular <b>stop-start</b> song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as Led Zeppelin and Queen, bands that the punk community of the time largely disdained.|$|E

The engines will feature more advanced technology such as direct injection, cylinder deactivation and <b>stop-start</b> idling, and will meet the highest Euro 6c emissions regulations. On 18 January 2016, Proton fired up a prototype in a live broadcast from Ricardo's facility in Shoreham, England. Mass production of the all-new Proton engines will commence in late 2017.|$|E
25|$|Graham Neil Yallop (born 7 October 1952) is {{a former}} cricketer who played for Victoria and Australia. He captained Australia briefly during the tumultuous era of World Series Cricket (WSC) in the late 1970s. A {{technically}} correct left-handed batsman, Yallop invariably batted {{near the top of}} the order for Australia during a <b>stop-start</b> international career that began in 1975–76 against the West Indies. In 1978, Yallop made history as the first player to wear a full helmet in a Test match. He also enjoyed a long and successful career with his home state Victoria, leading them to two Sheffield Shield titles.|$|E
25|$|New wave {{represented}} {{a break from}} the blues and rock & roll sounds of late 1960s to mid-1970s rock music. According to Simon Reynolds, the music had a twitchy, agitated feel to it. New wave musicians often played choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos, and keyboards were common as were <b>stop-start</b> song structures and melodies. Reynolds noted that new wave vocalists sounded high-pitched, geeky and suburban. A nervous, nerdy persona was a common characteristic of new wave fans and acts such as Talking Heads, Devo and Elvis Costello. This took the forms of robotic dancing, jittery high-pitched vocals and clothing fashions such as suits and big glasses that hid the body.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1990s, the {{reliability}} of the fleet became a problem again. By this time, the class was solely used on the West of England route, having been replaced on the Oxford route by Class 47/4 locomotives, displaced from Railfreight Distribution after the collapse of Speedlink in 1991. Arguably, the Class 50s were not suitable for the <b>stop-start</b> service pattern of Waterloo-Exeter services, nor to the extended single-line sections of this route, where a single locomotive failure could cause chaos. Therefore, the decision was taken to retire the fleet, temporarily replacing them with Class 47/7 locomotives, which were in turn replaced by new Diesel Multiple Units. From 1992, the Oxford route was worked by Class 165 and Class 166 units, whilst Class 159 units were introduced onto the West of England route in 1993.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{praised the}} music, calling it [...] "a {{step in the}} right direction – it's more ambitious, dramatic, and aggressive, built on pummeling verses and <b>stop-start</b> choruses." [...] However, he felt that the band was being [...] "held back" [...] by Durst, whom he called [...] "the most singularly unpleasant, absurd frontman in rock." [...] IGN writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review, as he felt that the album lacked direction, but that showed potential for the band's musical growth.|$|E
500|$|Sonically, the Pixies are {{credited}} with popularizing the extreme dynamics and <b>stop-start</b> timing {{that would become}} widespread in alternative rock; Pixies songs typically feature hushed, restrained verses, and explosive, wailing choruses. Artists including David Bowie, Matt Noveskey, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, U2, Nirvana, The Strokes, Alice in Chains, Weezer, Bush, Arcade Fire, Pavement, Kings of Leon and Matthew Good have cited admiration of or influence by the Pixies. Bono of U2 has called the Pixies [...] "one of America's greatest bands ever", and Radiohead's Thom Yorke has said that, while at school, [...] "the Pixies had changed my life".

500|$|Dave Heaton of PopMatters {{described}} the song as a [...] "song of rebirth" [...] with a [...] "fairly complex" [...] narrative. He summarized {{the content of}} the lyrics, writing [...] "t starts in the past, {{at the start of a}} relationship, and then lets us know it’s a flashback. They’re sitting on the couch reminiscing. It then jumps back to the beginning and steps us through the couple’s years together, but all the while shifting perspective, jumping between their separate memories." [...] James Dinh of MTV noted that the song [...] "features an uplifting country/pop melody and a big chorus" [...] and it talks about [...] "the wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past." [...] Priya Elan of The Guardian believed that [...] "Mine" [...] depicts [...] "a <b>stop-start</b> relationship between a normal guy and girl". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly interpreted the song's message to be about [...] "young love blossoming — in this specific case, young college love." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics felt Secret Rings was {{a general}} {{improvement}} over recent Sonic games, whose popularity and critical reception had declined. According to Empire, which gave the game 3/5 stars, Secret Rings [...] "reclaims the bewildering blend of platforming and racing that made the series famous" [...] while [...] "fixing the erratic <b>stop-start</b> gameplay that marred recent editions" [...] and showcasing [...] "the best graphics the Wii has to offer this side of Zelda." [...] However, [...] "the occasionally sluggish controls and spasmodic in-game camera mean Sonic's Wii debut is far from perfect." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that it [...] "does a decent job at stopping the bleeding caused by the recent 360/PS3/PSP Sonics", and 1UP.coms Shane Bettenhausen wrote that the Sonic series was [...] "definitely on the mend" [...] after suffering progressively-worse games {{after the release of}} Sonic Adventure. GameSpys Patrick Joynt agreed, writing that Sonic had been [...] "reanimated to a lurching existence". IGNs Matt Casamassina, Nintendo Powers Chris Shepperd, and GameSpots Greg Mueller named Secret Rings the best 3D Sonic game, but criticized the 3D titles in general. Eurogamers Rob Fahey praised the game for employing Sonic as the only playable character.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the <b>stop-start</b> {{sessions}} for The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs, pre-production for Mother's Milk went smoothly. Many {{of the songs}} were already written, some even recorded ("Taste the Pain" [...] was recorded prior to Chad joining and featured Philip [...] "Fish" [...] Fisher on drums) {{by the time the}} band started pre-production in January 1989. [...] The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake; songs like [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] were formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: [...] "We played hard and fast more than [...] any other time in our career, I think. A lot of chops were going down [...] we played constantly, got to know each other, {{and came up with a}} record." [...] Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante's presence had become a significant influence on the band's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that [...] " [...] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us." ...|$|E

Colly {{said that}} Robyn is [...] "an encouraging den mother" [...] on the song, singing [...] "Little star, I got you. You'll be okay." [...] Luke O'Neill of The Boston Globe {{said that the}} song showcases [...] "the tension-and-catharsis approach Robyn is capable of achieving with her vocals." [...] The second track, [...] "Include Me Out" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "digitised <b>stop-start</b> funk". The song begins with the line, [...] "It is really very simple, just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval", which according to O'Neill described [...] "the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance-ready songs." [...] On the song, Robyn plays a party-starter that is [...] "repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike" [...] with the line [...] "This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click your heels for me." [...] "Hang with Me", carries a [...] "fierce, club-wrecking beat", with [...] "relentlessly energetic bass" [...] and synth arpeggios. Lyrically, the song speaks of trust in a relationship, with lines such as [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views [...] "the perspective of someone who's a bit too tightly buttoned-up to let her defences down." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Love Kills" [...] was described as a [...] "discofied, sharp-edged" [...] song, with fierce vocals and [...] "haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes." [...] "We Dance to the Beat" [...] is a techno song, with an [...] "apocalyptic, big-beat". It features a [...] "sort of spoken-word hype-up jam" [...] that was compared to [...] "Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do". The song features lines such as [...] "We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough" [...] and [...] "We dance to the beat of bad kissers clicking teeth." ...|$|E

2500|$|A fuel {{efficient}} two-cylinder diesel was prototyped {{in the mid}} 1980s with a G40 supercharger to overcome its small capacity, although this {{did not make it}} to production. A high fuel efficiency model which did make production was the petrol-engined Formel E (E for Economy), introduced at the launch in 1981 with a 1.1 litre engine and from 1983 with a 1.3 litre engine, overdrive top-gear ratio and an early <b>stop-start</b> ignition system (called [...] "SSA") which would cut the engine when idle for more than two seconds to save fuel whilst temporarily stopped in traffic, and restart the engine on moving the gear lever to the left in neutral.|$|E

Critics described the sound of the album as it being [...] "unique". Jim Raggi wrote [...] "If you're wanting the more deathy and song oriented Opeth, skip down to My Arms, Your Hearse and go from there. If you're looking for a unique journey of music built alternately around dual guitar harmonies knocking into sequences when the two guitars and the bass are all playing different parts, <b>stop-start</b> transitions at times and smooth here-to-theres at others, here you go."

Forget that there's no proof, that their marriage was collaborative and that it's a nasty thing to say, Live Through This is clearly a woman's work [...] far more swaggering than any album any grunge man ever came up with. When Love sings, [...] "I went to school in Olympia / Where everyone's the same," [...] it's obvious she thinks she's not, and that she's right." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the main reason Live Through This is a drastic sonic departure from Pretty on the Inside is [...] "Love's desire to compete in the same commercial alternative rock arena as her husband, Kurt Cobain." [...] He acknowledged the rumors of Cobain ghostwriting, stating that [...] "while that's unlikely, there's no denying that his patented <b>stop-start</b> dynamics, bare chords, and punk-pop melodies provide the blueprint for Live Through This.
