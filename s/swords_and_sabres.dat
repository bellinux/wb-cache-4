60|$|Such was the scanty force {{which the}} {{imagination}} of the panic-stricken army had magnified into a great host, and from which they had fled in breathless terror, abandoning the whole frontier. No one could be more surprised than the French commander himself, when the ambuscading party returned in triumph with a long train of packhorses laden with booty, the savages uncouthly clad in the garments of the slain, grenadier caps, officers' gold-laced coats, and glittering epaulettes; flourishing <b>swords</b> <b>and</b> <b>sabres,</b> or firing off muskets, and uttering fiendlike yells of victory. But when De Contrecoeur was informed of the utter rout and destruction of the much dreaded British army, his joy was complete. He ordered the guns of the fort to be fired in triumph, and sent out troops in pursuit of the fugitives.|$|E

60|$|There were a {{great many}} {{specimens}} of ancient arms and armor, hung up in various halls in the castle, all of the most quaint and curious forms, but yet of the most elaborate and beautiful workmanship. There were swords, and daggers, and bows and arrows, and spurs, and shields, and coats of mail, and every other species of weapons, offensive and defensive, that the warriors {{of the middle ages}} were accustomed to use. Rollo was most interested in the bows and arrows. They were of great size, and were made in a style of workmanship, and ornamented with mountings and decorations, which Rollo had never dreamed of seeing in bows and arrows. Among the other articles of armor, the schloss-vogt showed the party a gauntlet, as it is called; that is, an iron glove, which was worn in ancient times to defend the hand from the cuts of <b>swords</b> <b>and</b> <b>sabres.</b> The inside of the glove--I mean the part which covered the inside of the hand--was of leather; but the back was formed of iron scales made to slide over each other, so as to allow the hand to open and shut freely, without making any opening in the iron. Mr. George tried this glove on, and so, in fact, did Rollo and Minnie. They were all surprised to find how well it fitted to the hand, and how freely the fingers could be moved while it was on. The schloss-vogt said that a man could write with it; and Mr. George placed his hand, with the glove upon it, in the proper position for writing, and then moved his fingers to and fro, as {{if there had been a}} pen between them.|$|E

Officer rank insignia also changed from the colourful old Russian-style shoulderboards to a more subdued, British-style system. In 1938 a new pattern of forage cap was also introduced which was similar to the contemporary British, but with the Greek royal cockade in metal. By this time <b>swords</b> <b>and</b> <b>sabres</b> were limited to ceremonial use and a pistol was the main sidearm.|$|E
