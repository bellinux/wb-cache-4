5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} <b>systemic</b> signal that activated <b>systemic</b> acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate <b>systemic</b> acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the <b>systemic</b> signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E

5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than <b>systemic</b> medication, with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. <b>Systemic</b> treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single <b>systemic</b> intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the <b>systemic</b> circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the <b>systemic</b> circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
50|$|After using {{in-depth}} <b>systemics</b> in stationary {{drug therapy}} since 1992, {{the model was}} extended in 2001 and first applied {{to the field of}} case management interventions (particularly high cost cases).

Later, in-depth <b>systemics</b> was applied to business leadership as well as the coaching of sport prodigies (competitive athletes). In 2010, a day center for youths and young adults was established, based on the principles of in-depth <b>systemics,</b> with the goal of offering clients a structure to motivate them to work on a long-term professional perspective.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundLittle data {{exist on}} {{real-world}} treatment patterns in psoriasis, especially from European settings. ObjectiveTo estimate, for topicals, <b>systemics</b> and biologics, {{the time to}} non-persistency, switching, augmentation and insufficient treatment result (only for biologics), {{as well as to}} estimate the time to restart, in patients treated with each treatment class in Sweden based on registry data. MethodsThis database analysis utilized data from patients with psoriasis from several Swedish administrative registers. Patients were identified through combinations of diagnoses from two regional registers and filled prescriptions for relevant treatments from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event (survival') functions were estimated with relevant treatment events as failure and the proportions of patients having experienced an event at specific time-points were derived from the failure rates. ResultsFor topicals, <b>systemics</b> and biologics the number of indexed treatment episodes were 25396, 2963, and 628 respectively. One year after treatment initiation, the proportion of patients who were classed as non-persistent with topicals, <b>systemics</b> and biologics were estimated at 88. 3 %, 47. 9 % and 43. 2 % respectively. Among patients who remained persistent, within 1 year of treatment start the proportions of treatment episodes in which patients were augmented were estimated at 56. 0 % for topicals, 45. 3 % for <b>systemics</b> and 58. 9 % for biologics. In addition, within 1 year of non-persistence, 49. 0 % of topicals, 60. 8 % of <b>systemics</b> and 80. 2 % of biologics treatment episodes were re-initiated, with 35. 4 - 52. 5 % re-initiated on the non-persistent treatment depending on treatment class. In addition, among patients on biologics, 29. 2 % of treatment episodes had an insufficient treatment result within 1 year of treatment start. ConclusionPersistency to psoriasis treatments may be sub-optimal and patients who remain persistent relatively frequently receive augmentation therapy or switch to another therapy. Therefore, current treatment options in psoriasis may be insufficient...|$|R

5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing <b>systemic</b> reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a <b>systemic</b> reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or <b>systemic</b> symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or <b>systemic</b> symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or <b>systemic</b> pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or <b>systemic</b> disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a <b>systemic</b> illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
