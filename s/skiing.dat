5|$|Competitive {{cross-country}} <b>skiing</b> {{is one of}} the Nordic <b>skiing</b> sports. Cross-country <b>skiing</b> and rifle marksmanship are the {{two components}} of biathlon, ski-orienteering is a form of cross-country <b>skiing,</b> which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} <b>skiing</b> {{is similar}} to the original form of <b>skiing,</b> from which all <b>skiing</b> disciplines evolved, including alpine <b>skiing,</b> ski jumping and Telemark <b>skiing.</b> Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate <b>skiing),</b> aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the largest}} form of winter {{recreation}} is <b>skiing.</b> As of 1994, of the estimated 65–75 million skiers worldwide, there were approximately 55 million who engaged in Alpine <b>skiing,</b> the rest engaged in cross-country <b>skiing.</b> Approximately 30 million skiers (of all kinds) were in Europe, 15 million in the US, and 14 million in Japan. As of 1996, there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas, operating 26,000 ski lifts and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year. The preponderant region for downhill <b>skiing</b> was Europe, followed by Japan and the US.|$|E
40|$|The yeast superkiller (<b>SKI)</b> genes were {{originally}} identified from mutations allowing increased production of killer toxin encoded by M "killer" virus, a satellite of the dsRNA virus L-A. XRN 1 (<b>SKI</b> 1) encodes a cytoplasmic 5 '-exoribonuclease {{responsible for the}} majority of cytoplasmic RNA turnover, whereas <b>SKI</b> 2, <b>SKI</b> 3, and <b>SKI</b> 8 are required for normal 3 '-degradation of mRNA and for repression of translation of poly(A) minus RNA. <b>Ski</b> 2 p is a putative RNA helicase, <b>Ski</b> 3 p is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein, and <b>Ski</b> 8 p contains five WD- 40 (beta-transducin) repeats. An xrn 1 mutation in combination with a <b>ski</b> 2, <b>ski</b> 3, or <b>ski</b> 8 mutation is lethal, suggesting redundancy of function. Using functional epitope-tagged <b>Ski</b> 2, <b>Ski</b> 3, and <b>Ski</b> 8 proteins, we show that <b>Ski</b> 2 p, <b>Ski</b> 3 p, and <b>Ski</b> 8 p can be coimmunoprecipitated as an apparent heterotrimeric complex. With epitope-tagged <b>Ski</b> 2 p, there was a 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the proteins in the complex. <b>Ski</b> 2 p did not associate with <b>Ski</b> 3 p in the absence of <b>Ski</b> 8 p, nor did <b>Ski</b> 2 p associate with <b>Ski</b> 8 p in the absence of <b>Ski</b> 3 p. However, the <b>Ski</b> 3 p/Ski 8 p interaction did not require <b>Ski</b> 2 p. In addition, <b>ski</b> 6 - 2 or <b>ski</b> 4 - 1 mutations or deletion of <b>SKI</b> 7 did not affect complex formation. The identification of a complex composed of <b>Ski</b> 2 p, <b>Ski</b> 3 p, and <b>Ski</b> 8 p explains previous results showing phenotypic similarity between mutations in <b>SKI</b> 2, <b>SKI</b> 3, and <b>SKI</b> 8. Indirect immunofluorescence of <b>Ski</b> 3 p and subcellular fractionation of <b>Ski</b> 2 p and <b>Ski</b> 3 p suggest that <b>Ski</b> 2 p and <b>Ski</b> 3 p are cytoplasmic. These data support the idea that <b>Ski</b> 2 p, <b>Ski</b> 3 p, and <b>Ski</b> 8 p function in the cytoplasm in a 3 '-mRNA degradation pathway...|$|R

40|$|The yeast <b>Ski</b> complex assists the exosome in the {{degradation}} of mRNA. The <b>Ski</b> complex consists of three components; <b>Ski</b> 2, <b>Ski</b> 3, and <b>Ski</b> 8, believed {{to be present in}} a 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry. Measuring the mass of intact isolated endogenously expressed <b>Ski</b> complexes by native mass spectrometry we unambiguously demonstrate that the <b>Ski</b> complex has a hetero-tetrameric stoichiometry consisting of one copy of <b>Ski</b> 2 and <b>Ski</b> 3 and two copies of <b>Ski</b> 8. To validate the stoichiometry of the <b>Ski</b> complex, we performed tandem mass spectrometry. In these experiments one <b>Ski</b> 8 subunit was ejected concomitant with the formation of a <b>Ski</b> 2 /Ski 3 /Ski 8 fragment, confirming the proposed stoichiometry. To probe the topology of the <b>Ski</b> complex we disrupted the complex and mass analyzed the thus formed subcomplexes, detecting <b>Ski</b> 8 –Ski 8, <b>Ski</b> 2 –Ski 3, <b>Ski</b> 8 –Ski 2, and <b>Ski</b> 8 –Ski 8 –Ski 2. Combining all data we construct an improved structural model of the <b>Ski</b> complex...|$|R
5|$|Cross-country <b>skiing</b> {{is a form}} of <b>skiing</b> where skiers rely {{on their}} own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country <b>skiing</b> is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country <b>skiing</b> are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E

5|$|Freestyle <b>skiing</b> {{is one of}} the six <b>skiing</b> {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, {{the first}} Winter Olympics featured Nordic <b>skiing</b> disciplines (cross-country <b>skiing,</b> ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine <b>skiing</b> was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle <b>skiing</b> events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle <b>skiing</b> was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle <b>skiing</b> medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Alpine <b>skiing</b> is an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games.

A combined event was held {{for both men and}} women in 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were meant for amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Ski</b> {{complex is}} a conserved multiprotein {{assembly}} {{required for the}} cytoplasmic functions of the exosome, including RNA turnover, surveillance, and interference. <b>Ski</b> 2, <b>Ski</b> 3, and <b>Ski</b> 8 assemble in a tetramer with 1 : 1 : 2 stoichiometry.

The C-terminal arm of <b>Ski</b> 3 and the two <b>Ski</b> 8 subunits position the helicase core of <b>Ski</b> 2 centrally within the complex, enhancing RNA binding.
