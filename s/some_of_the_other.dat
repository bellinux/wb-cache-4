5|$|After {{the first}} match between NSW and the tourists, the Metropolitan Union made its {{selection}} {{for the team}} to play the tourists on 29 June, Verge amongst them; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> eligible NSW players were not picked. On the day, however, it was Maund, not Verge, who played at fullback.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{massacre}} a detachment led by Colonel Henry Dodge buried {{the bodies of}} St. Vrain and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> victims. Though Dodge and his men recovered the remains of St. Vrain, Hale and Fowler, the body of Aaron Hawley was never recovered.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Ulama {{had more}} secular power than Karamokho Alfa, who {{directly}} ruled only the diwal of Timbo.|$|E
50|$|Human: Resources such as labor, experience, {{skills and}} {{expertise}} {{in a certain}} field. More tangible than <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> (moral, cultural and social-organizational) and easier to quantify.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hundred Years' War, many bastides {{that had}} no city walls were destroyed. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> quickly built stone walls, to protect the city.|$|R
50|$|Each type of {{ship has}} {{particular}} scope of missions it can only perform that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> cannot. Example: Battleships/Battlecarriers/Carriers {{are not allowed to}} carry most anti-submarine weaponry.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, the World Monuments Fund began {{a program}} to restore the lead sculptures by British {{sculptor}} John Cheere, as well as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> features of the garden. The project is ongoing.|$|E
5|$|All of the 22nd Battalion, bar Elliott's platoon, {{were killed}} or {{captured}} during the fighting at Ruweisat Ridge. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> battalions that participated in the battle also incurred heavy losses. Elliott managed to link up with elements of the 21st Battalion, the commander of which recommended him for the VC. Elliott was evacuated to hospital where he spent three months recovering from his various wounds before {{he returned to his}} battalion in September.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At {{this point in time}} a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
2500|$|Sinclair Oil [...] "Dinoland" [...] spent {{a period}} of time as a {{traveling}} exhibit. The Stegosaurus model was eventually donated to Dinosaur National Monument. <b>The</b> Stegosaurus and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> still remain in displays at various locations.|$|R
2500|$|At {{least one}} letter in each place of {{articulation}} comes from international use ( [...] f, [...] ti, [...] l, [...] k, [...] xi, [...] zh), {{with at least}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> derived from these (cf. [...] k h g and [...] ch sh zh).|$|R
50|$|Billy, {{armed with}} a M-1 Garand rifle, captures the gang, shoots the leader (Jeremy Slate) between the eyes, and forces <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> to take Vicky, who's been badly beaten, to the hospital. As the police finally arrive, Billy {{abruptly}} rides away on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gang's motorcycles.|$|R
5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became evident that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> inbound flights were performing missed approaches, {{as they had}} been unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Sweden Calling DXers on Radio Sweden in 1948 (there was a {{slightly}} earlier short-lived program from Radio Australia), many shortwave radio stations began programs providing news. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> prominent DX programs were Radio Netherlands' DX Jukebox (which became Media Network), the SWL Digest on Radio Canada International, and the Swiss Shortwave Merry-go-round on Swiss Radio International.|$|E
5|$|Few of the {{original}} windows survive in the tower, but those that remain are larger than in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> older peles, suggesting {{it may have been}} built with defence less in mind than in some earlier pele towers. The originals have mainly been replaced by 17th- and 18th-century versions. The original roof would have resembled that at nearby Yanwath Hall, but was replaced at a later date with the current hipped-roof design, probably during the late 16th or 17th centuries. The current roof was further restored in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|After 1933, Nazi {{proponents of}} [...] "Aryan physics," [...] {{led by the}} Nobel Prize-winners Johannes Stark and Philipp Lenard, {{attacked}} Einstein's theory of relativity as a degenerate example of Jewish materialism in <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> science. Many scientists and humanists emigrated; Einstein moved permanently to <b>the</b> U.S. but <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> returned after 1945.|$|R
25|$|Having {{concluded}} the meeting, they dispersed. Collins, Clancy and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> went to Vaughan’s Hotel. While {{they were in}} the hotel, the porter, Christy Harte, became suspicious <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests, a Mr Edwards. Edwards had made a late-night telephone call, and then left the hotel. Harte informed the Volunteers, who then quickly left the building.|$|R
50|$|In 1900, {{many who}} died in <b>the</b> fire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS Saale and SS Bremen on the North River (Hudson River) at Hoboken were interred at <b>the</b> cemetery. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> who perished in the massive fire on the Hoboken piers in 1900 were buried at the {{adjacent}} cemeteries in gravesites purchased by the shipping company.|$|R
5|$|Gravel was in {{the next}} several debates, in one case after CNN {{reversed}} a decision to exclude him. Gravel, as with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> second-tier candidates, did not get as much time as the leaders; during the June 2, 2007, New Hampshire debate, which lasted two hours, he was asked 10 questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and 37 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} on <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> characters seen not in isolation {{but as they}} interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful {{that we do not}} even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Yahoo! Sports {{reported}} that Braun's name appeared {{three times in}} records of Biogenesis of America, a Coral Gables clinic alleged to have distributed performance-enhancing drugs {{to a number of}} Major League Baseball players who tested positive for banned substances. One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic.|$|E
25|$|Can {{this list}} be made shorter yet? Again {{the answer is}} yes. To begin with, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above laws are implied by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> A {{sufficient}} subset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above laws consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pairs <b>of</b> associativity, commutativity, and absorption laws, distributivity of ∧ over ∨ (or <b>the</b> <b>other</b> distributivity law—one suffices), and the two complement laws. In fact this is <b>the</b> traditional axiomatization <b>of</b> Boolean algebra as a complemented distributive lattice.|$|R

2500|$|William Mason, {{director}} emeritus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lyric Opera <b>of</b> Chicago, described Tallchief as [...] "a consummate professional... She realized who {{and what}} she was, but she didn't flaunt it. She was unpretentious." [...] Fellow dancer Allegra Kent remarked [...] "She didn’t seem to be frightened <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, like <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> She had in iron will inside... She phrased her curls and extensions as delicately or as strongly as the music itself." ...|$|R
5|$|On January 29, 1913, Calvin Shelverton {{applied for}} a {{building}} permit to construct the Piedmont Park Apartments. The apartments were designed by Leila Ross Wilburn and were decidedly middle-class unlike <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> developments in the area. The apartments remained middle-class up until about 1960, and residents included such prominent Atlantans as accounting company president T. C. Dunlap and lawyer J. B. Stewart. In 1913, seven clay courts were built where the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition's Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building once was. Eight more courts were added in 1914 to accommodate the overwhelming demand.|$|E
5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{lost the}} {{governorship}} that fall, and in 1856 the Democrats {{combined with the}} remaining Whigs {{in the state legislature}} to repeal the Maine law entirely. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> states that had passed Maine laws followed suit as they learned that the promised benefits were not forthcoming and enforcement was difficult, if not impossible. Dow continued to travel the country (and the United Kingdom) speaking in support of prohibition, but to little legislative effect. Maine passed a new, much milder Maine law in 1858, which Dow disliked but defended as better than nothing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi dominated <b>the</b> RCC, although <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> {{attempted to}} constrain {{what they saw}} as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with <b>the</b> identities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|R
25|$|The {{inspiration}} {{provided by}} these events produced many literary works, {{far more than}} can be listed here. <b>The</b> siege <b>of</b> Troy provided inspiration for many works of art, most famously Homer's Iliad, set in <b>the</b> last year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siege. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> include Troades by Euripides, Troilus and Criseyde by Geoffrey Chaucer, Troilus and Cressida by William Shakespeare, Iphigenia and Polyxena by Samuel Coster, Palamedes by Joost van den Vondel and Les Troyens by Hector Berlioz.|$|R
25|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, {{the school}} {{drop-out}} rate among girls was very high (almost 50 percent), even though <b>the</b> educational achievements <b>of</b> female students {{were higher than}} male students {{at different levels of}} education. Since then, education for women has improved rapidly. In Lahore there are 46 public colleges out of which 26 are female colleges and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are co-educational. Similarly <b>the</b> public universities <b>of</b> Pakistan have female enrollment than male.|$|R
5|$|Rockslide and X-23 later try to {{convince}} Anole to cut off his other arm in order to generate a stronger replacement. When he refuses, Rockslide calls him a sissy, which Anole finds offensive {{enough for him to}} reveal his sexual identity to Rockslide and attack him. Rockslide apologizes, swearing that he did not know. Later, in a misguided attempt at group bonding, Rockslide voices his acceptance of Anole's sexuality, outing him to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> students, though Loa states that she was already aware and that everyone already knew.|$|E
5|$|Smart's Hymns {{are one of}} {{the first}} works of hymns {{dedicated}} to children, and they are intended to teach Christian virtues. Unlike <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum, such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs, this work was a success and went into many immediate editions. Part of the success of this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text. However, Smart died before he ever saw the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book's success.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> issues {{involving}} Hamilton were bypassing the rising issue {{of slavery in}} Congress after Quakers petitioned for its abolition (though {{he returned to the}} issue the following year), Duer having resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and the vote of assumption being voted down 31 votes to 29 on April 12.|$|E

Soon afterwards he learns that this second girl, Thomasina Tuckerton, has died. At dinner with a friend, a woman named Poppy Stirling mentions something called the Pale Horse that arranges deaths, but is suddenly scared at having mentioned it and will say no more.|$|R
