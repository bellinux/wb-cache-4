The West Virginia Fish Commission's [...] "first and most expensive efforts" [...] involved the hatching and stocking {{of the salmon}} in West Virginia's streams. To accomplish this feat, White designed and built charcoal raceways to culture the salmon. The salmon were released into the South Branch Potomac River where they flourished and were caught by fishermen from Romney to Washington, D.C. The salmon introduced by White and the commission migrated to the Chesapeake Bay, but {{did not return to}} West Virginia's streams to spawn. Between 1877 and 1882, the West Virginia Fish Commission successfully hatched and distributed salmon, trout, black bass, shad, carp, gray bass, pike perch, silver perch, jack, and blue catfish, as well as mill pond roach as food for the bass.

Experiments were conducted in five different contact times (0. 5, 2, 12, 24 and 48 h) between soil sediment and mercury on Cyprinus carpio var communis. It was observed that contact time with soil sediment had significant effect in reducing the toxicity of mercury. Higher the time of contact, greater the effect. Medium hard water (150 mg/L CaC 0 sub(3) of total hardness) had the highest effect as compared to other water in reducing the toxicity of mercury when combined with underlying soil sediment. With the increase in contact time, complexation and adsorption of inorganic mercury ions with the dissolved and particulate phases of water and soil sediment were increased; thereby bioaccumulation of mercury ions by <b>scale</b> <b>carp</b> was more.

Methodology. A PCR (ISSR-PCR) method with appropriately selected primers {{has been used to}} investigate the genetic structure specificity. Findings. The genetic structure analysis of Ukrainian <b>scaled</b> <b>carp</b> has been carried out using three microsatellite DNA loci: (AGC) 6 G, (AСC) 6 G, (AGC) 6 С. In total, 55 amplicons were detected for all primers. Fifteen primers were detected when using (AGC) 6 G primer, 17 for (AСC) 6 G primer and 23 for (AGC) 6 С primer. The molecular weight on electropherograms had maximum values when using (AСC) 6 G primer (500 n. p. – 3500 n. p.) in Nyvky carp. The detected specific differences between the examined populations of <b>scaled</b> <b>carp</b> depend on their genetic origin. Variations of the detected amplicons are sufficient for separating individual fish or, if works are carried out with a group of broodfish, for selecting parental pairs for increasing genetic diversity.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} of two strains (Scaled and Mirror) of six hatchery populations of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was studied using three microsatellite loci (MFW 13, MFW 17 and MFW 28). The loci were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The PCR products were electrophoresed on 6 % polyacrylamide gel and the alleles were visualized by silver nitrate staining. All the three loci were found polymorphic. The {{average number of}} alleles was {{the highest in the}} population *SC-SMK (5. 00) and lowest in **MC-SMK (4. 00). Total number of null allele was more in mirror carp populations (6) than <b>scaled</b> <b>carp</b> populations (4). The average observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0. 54 to 0. 67. The average observed heterozygosity (Ho) was lower than the average expected heterozygosity (He) in case of all the populations. The population ***SC-BCH had high level of genetic variation in comparison to other five populations because this population had negative 1 -Ho/He values in case of two loci out of three analyzed. The rest five populations had negative 1 -Ho/He values only in one locus. In 6 of a total of 18 tests, significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (HWE) were detected. Pairwise Fst values were used to detect the genetic distance between the pairs of populations. The Fst value was highest (o. 153) between the population MC-AFF and MC-SMK. Nei’s genetic distance value was also highest (0. 462) between these populations. The Fst value of 0. 153 represents a high level of population differentiation.

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} fish diseases is; increasingly, being reported as a limiting factor in the future development of aquaculture. The control of fish disease is largely performed in retrospect through curative chemotherapy. However, the development of resistant strains of fish places the emphasis on preventative, rather than the curative, control of disease. The freshwater parasite Icthyophthirius multifiliis causes the disease known as ichthyophthiriasis or white spot. Losses of fish due to this parasite are believed to total over one million dollars per annum worldwide. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the genetics of resistance to I. multifiliis, Comparisons were made between four stocks of the tropical livebearing fish Xiphophorus maculatus. One of these stocks, the blue platyfish, was found to be less susceptible to white spot than the yellow comet tail, red or red wag tail platyfish, Comparisons with four other tropical spades of fish found significant differences between X. maculatus, X. variatus, Ameca splendens and Ilyodon xanthusi in levels of susceptibility. A. splendens was the most susceptible species, with the blue platy (X. maculatus) and sunset platy (X. variatus) forming the most resistant group. All the remaining stocks and species formed an intermediate group. Examination of resistance to white spot infection in four scale types of related common carp (Cyprinus auratus) also found variation in resistance, with the fully <b>scaled</b> <b>carp</b> being the most resistant phenotype (scattered mirror, linear mirror and leather carp being similar in infection level). More detailed analysis of the genetics of disease resistance was performed with heritability determinations in stocks of A. splendens, X. maculatus (yellow comet tail) and X. maculatus (Vera Cruz). The highest heritability value, based on sire components only, was that for Vera Cruz platyfish of 0. 75, with a value of 0. 23 for X. maculatus (yellow comet tail) and 0. 00 for A. splendens. A breeding programme was also performed between X. maculatus (red platy) and X. variatus (sunset platy) to evaluate the presence of any heterosis. Such was observed, with a heterosis value, based on actual parasite counts, of 16. 2 %. Several factors of the infection process are also discussed, especially the fluctuating yearly trends in infection levels and parasite strain differences. Finally, the future potential of genetic manipulation of fish stocks for increased disease resistance is discussed in the light of this study. It is considered that a useful foundation has been laid for the further development of this approach to disease prevention in aquaculture.

30|$|The single species {{test with}} {{predator}} (control agent) does not accrue same results in nature {{because of the}} presence of vast arrays of prey species. Therefore removals of target populations’ depend on dietary niche breadth and preferences of the biocontrol agent. In the present study, environmentally relevant organisms were chosen and realistic concentrations were tested in our experimental set-up. The prey combinations used in the experiment are frequently occurring in natural mosquito breeding habitats and Gambusia are introduced for mosquito control. So, the laboratory results of our study can immediately be translated to the field. The mosquitofish form schools that may contain hundreds of fish. The schooling behaviour of mosquitofish leaves predation-free patches. Hence, predation risks may vary locally, depending on overall predator densities and the location of schools (Werner et al. 1983). Female carp could avoid mosquitofish at several spatial <b>scales.</b> Adult <b>carp</b> could use the strength of fish chemicals and exudates to identify areas in ponds where dense mosquitofish schools are present (Griswold and Lounibos 2005) and avoid these areas in selecting their breeding sites. In addition to seasonal and between-site variations, mosquitofish show an ontogenetic diet shift from diatoms, crustacean nauplii and microcrustaceans (particularly cladocerans) to larger prey, such as adult nematocerans (Mansfield and McArdle 1998, Garcίa-Berthou 1999). These attributes should be taken into account when extrapolating these laboratory results to natural conditions. In nature, mosquitofish decimate the larvae of their native counterparts not only directly, by predation, but also indirectly, through competition for food (Bence 1988, Arthington 1991, Bøhn and Amundsen 2001, Blaustein and Chase 2007, Leprieur et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fish scale {{contains}} rich collagen. Collagen is {{an important}} material which is widely used in many kind of industries. Extracting collagen from fish scale not only reduces the pollution but also obtains new raw material of commercial collagen. In this paper, single factor test method was firstly used to investigate the effects of liquid/solid ratio, concentration of hydrochloric acid, extraction time and extraction temperature on collagen extraction yield from bighead <b>carp</b> <b>scale</b> and their optimal values were determined. Based on which, the response surface method was used to establish the process and kinetic models for the collagen extraction process. The {{results show that the}} two models in the form of multiple regression are basically identical with the actual values and can be used to predict the collagen extraction yield and collagen extraction velocity under different operation conditions, and to adjust the operation parameters for obtaining the expected collagen extraction velocity with high collagen extraction yield in order to realize the ideal utilization efficiency and production intensity of the collagen in fish scale...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{faced with}} {{stressful}} stimuli launch an endocrine stress response through {{activation of the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI-) axis to release cortisol into the blood. Scientifi-cally validated biomarkers to capture systemic cortisol exposure over {{longer periods of time}} are of utmost importance to assess chronic stress in governmental, wildlife, aquaculture and scientific settings. Here we demonstrate that cortisol in <b>scales</b> of common <b>carp</b> (Cypri-nus carpio L.) is the long-sought biomarker for chronic stress. Undisturbed (CTR) and daily stressed (STRESS) carp were compared. Dexamethasone (DEX) or cortisol (CORT) fed fish served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Scale cortisol was quantified with a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry meth-od. An increase in scale cortisol content was found in STRESS and CORT but not in CTR and DEX fish. Scale cortisol content reflects its accumulation in a stressor and time depen-dent manner and validates the scale cortisol content as biomarker for chronic stress. Plas-ma analyses confirmed that (i) CTR, DEX and CORT treatments were effective, (ii) plasma cortisol of STRESS fish showed no signs of chronic HPI-axis activation, and (iii) plasma cor...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{possibilities}} of extending the shelf-life of fish products by dipping containing seven commercial additives. ANTIBAK, MIC STAB, Bakont, SEA-F 75, Misocarine LR, SAFE A Plus and AMX liquid. The effectiveness of these substances on the extending of shelf-life was evaluated on the basis of tests of TVC (total viable count), level of fat and protein oxidation, determination of nutritional parameters of muscle, and finaly sensory analysis. Experimental species were 2 important commodities for the Czech aquaculture rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The project was divided into 6 sub-stages. During testing was the initial number of aditives (7) limited by stepwise selection for 2 preparations. Namely Bakont and AMX liquid, which were tested further on trout (filet with skin and <b>scales)</b> and <b>carp</b> (filets with skin without scales) chilled bulk and chilled packaged under vakuum. For trout was studied antimicrobial effect of dipping on eviscerated fish with the head with- or without gills. Treated trout fillets in bulk and vakuum-packed showed significantly less abundance of muscle mikroflora. In the case of carp fillets chilled bulk we can not say that the bath had influence on the CMP in meat. However, the combination of dipping and vakuum packaging was singnificantly different between the control and product Bakont. AMX liquid was not applied in this case in sufficient dose or in sufficient time to carp muscle. A positive finding is that the application of the aditives to the product "eviscerated trout with head" it does not matter, whether the gills are left in fish or not. However, in all cases the analysis of the presence of pathogens Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes were negative. From the results of sensory analysis can be concluded, that the substances contained in aditives are not reflected in the sensory properties of tested fish...|$|R
40|$|A {{scanning}} electron microscopic {{study was}} performed on the surface ultrastructure of metacercariae and adults of Metagonimus takahashii. Metacercariae were collected from the <b>scale</b> of crucian <b>carp</b> (Carassius auratus), and adult flukes were harvested 1 - 4 weeks after infection to rats. In excysted metacercariae, the oral sucker had type I (numerous) and type II (seven in total) sensory papillae. Tegumental spines were dense and digitated into 5 - 7 points on the surface anterior to the ventral sucker, but became sparse and less digitated posteriorly {{toward the end of the}} body. In adults, seven type II sensory papillae were characteristically arranged around the lip of the oral sucker, and on the inner side of the lip four small and two large type I sensory papillae were symmetrically seen on each side (12 in total). Tegumental spines on anterior two-thirds of the body, were digitated with 9 - 12 tips ventrally and 8 - 13 tips dorsally. Sperms entering into the Laurer's canal were observed. The results show that the surface ultrastructure of M. takahashii is generally similar to those of M. yokogawai and M. miyatai except for the digitation of tegumental spines...|$|R
50|$|Grass carp have elongated, chubby, torpedo-shaped body forms. The {{terminal}} {{mouth is}} slightly oblique with non-fleshy, firm lips, and no barbels. The complete lateral line contains 40 to 42 scales. Broad, ridged, pharyngeal teeth {{are arranged in}} a 2, 4-4, 2 formula. The dorsal fin has eight to 10 soft rays, and the anal fin is set closer to the tail than most cyprinids. Body color is dark olive, shading to brownish-yellow on the sides, with a white belly and large, slightly outlined <b>scales.</b> The grass <b>carp</b> grows very rapidly. Young fish stocked in the spring at 20 cm will reach over 45 cm by fall. The average length is about 60 - 100 cm. The maximum length is 1.4 m and they grow 40 kg. The grass carp's maximum weight is 99 lbs. According to one study, they live an average of five to 9 years, with the oldest surviving 11 years. In Silver Lake Washington there is a thriving population of grass carp passing the 15 year mark. They eat up to three times their own body weight daily. They thrive in small lakes and backwaters that provide an abundant supply of freshwater vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Although pleiotrophic {{effect on}} N gene in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are well know and quite {{significant}} in some papers even better performances of <b>scaled</b> and mirror <b>carps</b> are reported. In {{order to determine}} possible pleiotropic effects of S gene, the four population from Croatian fish-farms and one from aquaria (full brothers and sisters), where analysed. The frequency of recessive s gene on the farms was between 0, 58 and 1, 00. That was partly conditioned by simple estimate of the market demand and partly probably at random. The difference in penotypic expressions of the following parameters was investigated among te nereast relatives: mass, standard lenght, maximum height, number of soft spines in dorsal, anal and ventral fins and number of gill rakers. Statistically significant difference (p< 0, 05) was determined only in one case - the number of soft spines in anal fins of carps from Končanica farm. However, that probably occurred just by accident and low variation of this parameter for this difference was revised or didn't exist at all on other farms. It can be concluded that at these fish-farms the pleiotropic effects of Ss genes were not deterroined and therefore {{are not to be}} taken into account in breeding procedures...|$|R
5000|$|In 1898, {{more than}} 200 years after Leewenhoek’s {{original}} insights of scale age structure, this subject {{was given a}} thorough review by C. Hoffbauer. [...] Hoffbauer studied commercially grown <b>carp</b> <b>scale</b> growth patterns throughout the year. He noted that during the season of growth, the concentric rings were easily discernible and widely spaced; however, as growth slowed and ceased {{during the winter months}} the rings were very compact then resumed normal spacing as the growth season began again. His work convinced other researchers that these aging techniques could be used on marine species. Shortly after Hoffbauer's findings were published, structures other than scales were examined for utility of aging fish. Johannes Reibisch, working for the Commission of Scientific Investigation of German Seas at Kiel, attempted to use Hoffbauer’s techniques to age plaice (Plueronectes platessa) but found it difficult to accurately discern annuli. He decided to study a different structure and in 1899 he published the first procedures using otoliths as an aging structure. [...] A fellow scientist also with the German Commission at Kiel, Friedriche Heincke, also frustrated with difficult scale annuli, further studied other structures to age fish. He discovered annuli in the vertebrae, opercula, and pectoral girdle and published his findings in Heicke 1905.|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of deep skin lesions is a pressing issue in modern medicine. Using chinchilla rabbits, {{we examined the}} effect of multilayer dressings with ordered periodic structure on the regeneration of skin covered with deep skin lesions. On the back of all animals, fascias (size up to 40 × 40 mm) were dissected. In rabbits (from experimental group I), the wound dressing was composed of a plate of fish (<b>carp)</b> <b>scales</b> (multilayer biogenic structure). In rabbits (from experimental group II), the wound dressing was composed of 50 lavsan films metallized by a nanodimensional layer of aluminum. In the control group, wound dressings were composed of a thin plate of Teflon or aluminum (one layer). In all rabbits of the control group, purulonecrotic processes were developed within 1 – 2 weeks. In all rabbits of the experimental groups, the repair of the wound proceeded without any clinical signs of inflammation during the whole period of observation. In the experimental animals, within 6  weeks, the deep skin lesions had fully healed, and {{the area of the}} skin defects had a thickness and structure characteristic of normal skin. The multilayer principle may be promising for the development of dressings for the {{treatment of}} deep but small skin wounds of different etiology in cases when high quality dermal regeneration is needed...|$|R
