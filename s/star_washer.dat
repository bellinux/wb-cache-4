40|$|The use {{of vision}} systems for {{industrial}} robot guidance and quality control becomes much harder when the manufactured products and their components {{are small and}} possess reflective surface. To assure an effective automated visual inspection of such components, novel solutions are required, able to perform more advanced image analysis and tackle noise and uncertainty. This paper proposes a concept of multi-camera/multi-pose inspection station for star washers inspection, and presents the first results of a functional prototype implementation {{of it in a}} robotic cell. The processes of vision-guided part picking from a flexible feeder and close-range inspection in a dedicated rig are described. Solutions for the vision-based tasks of parts identification, machine learning-based classification, circular objects image analysis and <b>star</b> <b>washer</b> teeth segmentation are presented, and further directions are outlined...|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} utility cash rebates on the market share of ENERGY STAR appliances by exploiting the variation in timing and size of rebates across US states. We find that a dollar increase in the population-weighted utility rebate raises the share of ENERGY <b>STAR</b> qualified clothes <b>washers</b> by 0. 4 %, but does not affect dishwasher and refrigerator shares. Using information on energy saved by an ENERGY STAR appliance and assuming a redemption rate of 40 %, the cost per tonne of carbon saved is about $ 140 for the clothes washers rebate program. The corresponding cost of a megawatt hour saved, about $ 28, {{is lower than the}} estimated cost of building and operating an additional power plant and the average on-peak spot price. We conclude that the ENERGY <b>STAR</b> clothes <b>washers</b> rebate program is, on average, a cost-effective way for utilities to reduce electricity demand...|$|R
40|$|Vision-based {{robotics}} is an {{ever-growing field}} within industrial automation. Demands for greater flexibility and higher quality motivate manufacturing companies to adopt these technologies for such tasks as material handling, assembly, and inspection. Manufacturing systems, {{as well as}} their control mechanism, are typically modeled as discrete event systems, and off-the-shelf PLC hardware is used for realization of sequential control systems. However, with introduction of robots and machine vision solutions, it becomes harder to reason about the combined systems collectively. Vi- sion algorithms require complex processing, and imaging setups have to be accurately calibrated with respect to other active systems such as robots, sensors, and material handling equipment. This thesis considers the application area of machine vision, and particularly vi- sual metrology systems, from the perspective of being a part of larger cyber-physical systems. This includes, in addition to the traditional computer vision algorithms and estimation methods, considerations of distributed system architecture and behavioral characteristics expressed with discrete event semantics. The ultimate goal is to make the first steps towards a theory backing control of visually-guided event-based be- haviors in industrial robotic and automation systems. The thesis approaches the goal by a combination of laboratory results, case study of an industrial company, and formalization of modeling abstractions and archi- tectural solutions. The practical results include a method for image analysis of <b>star</b> <b>washers</b> (small automotive parts), a feature engineering technique and machine learning experiments for classification of star washers’ orientation on a feeder, and a probabilistic analysis of the camera calibration process. In addition, to model and implement industrial vision systems in event-driven environment, a formalism of Discrete Event Data Flow is formulated, and the EPypes software framework is developed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the increase in}} the market share of ENERGY STAR-qualified appliances that can be attributed to targetted cash rebates offered by utility companies. To estimate the impact of these incentives we use the variation in timing and size of the utility rebates across the US states. We then use these estimates along with information on the average energy saved by using an ENERGY STAR appliance relative to a non-ENERGY STAR appliance to provide an estimate on the cost per tonne of carbon saved by the rebate program. Our results show that a dollar increase in the rebate leads to a 0. 3 % increase in the share of ENERGY STAR-qualified clothes washers while the effect of rebates is not significant for dishwashers and refrigerators. Assuming a redemption rate of 40 %, we calculate the cost of saving a tonne of carbon through the clothes washer rebate program to be around $ 158. The corresponding cost of a megawatt hour saved (about $ 32), is lower than the estimated cost of building and operating an additional power plant and the average on-peak spot price. We conclude that the ENERGY <b>STAR</b> clothes <b>washers</b> rebate programs are a cost-effective way for utilities to reduce energy demand.

5000|$|Washing laundry is a {{significant}} use {{of water in the}} average home; accounting for 17% of the average indoor use. [...] The average size family washes 5.4 loads of laundry each week. Each load uses on average 29.3 gallons (111 liters) of water. According to EPA, a full-sized Energy <b>Star</b> certified clothes <b>washer</b> (CW) (with [...] "water factor" [...] - WF ≤ 8.0 gal/cycle/ft^3) should use on average 15 gallons (57 liters) of water per load, compared to at least two times that volume used by a standard machine. Currently, about one fourth of American homes use less than 20 gallons (76 liters) per load with the average volume of 15 gallons (57 liters) per load. A widespread use of the most efficient clothes washers would reduce water use for washing by 6.4 gphd (or by 35.5 percent).|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{detailed}} water end use data registry {{generated from the}} South East Queensland Residential End Use Study (SEQREUS) to examine (a) peak hourly and daily demand, and (b) water-related energy demand. The impact of water-efficient fixtures and appliances, as required by current building codes in Queensland, is also explored. The four peak demand days selected had increasing peak day factors of 1. 3, 1. 5, 1. 6 and 1. 7. The range of these values is slightly lower than those used in the Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) guidelines where the peak day factors range from 1. 5 to 2. 3, suggesting that the frequency and volume of peaking factors may be lower than those that are currently being used for network distribution design; due likely to the high penetration of water-efficient technology and growing water conservation awareness by consumers. This type of knowledge can facilitate the optimisation of infrastructure design and sizing and inform the subsequent deferral of such assets. In terms of water-related energy demand, {{it was found that}} the hot water components of showers, and to a lesser extent, taps and clothes washers were the most influential. Shower energy consumption for electric cylinder hot water systems (HWS) and solar electric-boosted HWS was 810 and 351 kWh/p/year, respectively. The type of hot water system was significant in dictating the volume of energy-related carbon emissions, with the results confirming the significant impact that electric storage water heating has on total household energy consumption and related carbon emissions. Substantial savings can be achieved by substituting water (eg, high <b>star</b> rating clothes <b>washers</b> and shower heads) and energy (eg, solar hot water system) efficient appliances in the home. Knowledge on the end uses that are influencing peak water and energy demand can: 1) facilitate the optimisation of infrastructure design and sizing and inform the decision process regarding subsequent deferral of these expensive assets; and 2) underpin future sustainability codes for new buildings.
