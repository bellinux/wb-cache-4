On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the Norris Hall Engineering Building and opened fire on {{classroom}}s. Librescu, who taught a <b>solid</b> <b>mechanics</b> class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held {{the door of his}} classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a shot to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E

2500|$|Aero {{elasticity}} [...] is {{the branch}} of physics and engineering that studies the interactions between the inertial, elastic, and aerodynamic forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a fluid flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as energy harvesting [...] and understanding snoring. The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or steady response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body’s dynamic (typically vibrational) response. Aeroelasticity draws {{on the study of}} fluid mechanics, <b>solid</b> <b>mechanics,</b> structural dynamics and dynamical systems.|$|E

2500|$|Soil {{mechanics}} is {{a branch}} of soil physics and applied mechanics that describes the behavior of soils. It differs from fluid mechanics and <b>solid</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{in the sense that}} soils consist of a heterogeneous mixture of fluids (usually air and water) and particles (usually clay, silt, sand, and gravel) but soil may also contain organic solids and other matter. Along with rock mechanics, soil mechanics provides the theoretical basis for analysis in geotechnical engineering, a subdiscipline of civil engineering, and engineering geology, a subdiscipline of geology. Soil mechanics is used to analyze the deformations of and flow of fluids within natural and man-made structures that are supported on or made of soil, or structures that are buried in soils. Example applications are building and bridge foundations, retaining walls, dams, and buried pipeline systems. Principles of soil mechanics are also used in related disciplines such as engineering geology, geophysical engineering, coastal engineering, agricultural engineering, hydrology and soil physics.|$|E
