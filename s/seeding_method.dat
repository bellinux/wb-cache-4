Soils low in fertility should be fertilized with manure or a chemical fertilizer, but correction of pH is particularly important.

Although the initial selection in the algorithm takes extra time, the -means part itself converges very quickly after this seeding and thus the algorithm actually lowers the computation time.

In these simulations the new method almost always performed at least as well as vanilla -means in both speed and error.|$|E

50|$|When {{aerial seeding}} a cover crop one must seed {{them at least}} 7 to 10 days before drilled cover crops. The {{reason for this is}} because the aerial <b>seeding</b> <b>method</b> is slower than that of the drilled method. Seeding rates for most plants should be 25% to 50% higher with aerial seeding when {{compared}} to other more conventional methods like drilling. These higher seeding rates are needed to establish same yields as other methods. This is mostly because with aerial seeding the seed can be often on the soil surface longer making the seed more susceptible to predation by birds, insects and other animals.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} has been greatly perturbed by human activity, but remnant patches remain. The most intact area is the Hardy's Scrub section of the reserve. 160 years of livestock grazing, timber harvesting and cropping has cleared most of the reserve of native understorey species and in many areas invasive grasses are the main vegetation type. Remnant eucalypts are the most noticeable native species in the reserve. Eucalyptus microcarpa (grey box), Eucalyptus fasciculosa (pink gum), Eucalyptus porosa (mallee box), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (red gum), and Eucalyptus leucoxylon (blue gum) all occur in the reserve. The European olive (Olea europaea) is a noxious weed in South Australia and has invaded the park, although generally individuals are not as large as in older parks in the Mount Lofty Ranges like Belair National Park but {{will continue to be}} a problem unless managed. Over the last twenty years accessible areas of the gorge have been revegetated by contractors working for National Parks SA. The oldest area of revegetation in the park was conducted with tubestock, predominantly of eucalypts. Recent efforts have focused on the direct <b>seeding</b> <b>method</b> where seed of native species is ploughed into a scraped trench.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the best method of planting for two varieties of watermelon in Varamin (Charleston Gray and Mahbube) through the three methods of planting (direct sowing of seeds, germinated seeds and transplanting of seedlings), a factorial experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates during two years (2007 - 2008) at the Agricultural Research Center, Varamin. The results indicated that planting methods and cultivars had significant effects on all traits including fruit yield, fruit weight and fruit yield of first cutting. Al though the method of transplanting resulted in fruit maturation of 14 days earlier than the direct planting, the mean fruit yield in this method was significantly lower than other methods. Among the various methods of cultivation, the highest mean yield was obtained from the using germinated seed with 30890 kg ha. In the germinated <b>seed</b> <b>method,</b> average fruit weight was significantly higher than the other two methods. The highest number of fruits per plant and the lateral branches were produced in the transplanting method but due to the low weight of fruit, it had the lowest fruit yield per hectare. The highest concentrations of dissolved solids in the fruit (8. 2 %) were obtained in direct planting. Mahbube cultivar with 28, 310 kg ha- 1 of fruit yield, out yielded the Charleston Gray cultivar with 26250 kg ha- 1. For the latter cultivar, first cutting yield and mean fruit weight were also superior compared to the cultivar Charleston Gray.

Winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover cropping as a best {{management practice}} {{aimed at improving}} surface water quality by providing more ground cover, retaining nutrients, and preventing movement of surface water that carries nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment to rivers, lakes, and streams. These four studies evaluated winter rye effects on surface water quality using different <b>seeding</b> <b>methods</b> {{in a variety of}} cropping systems. The first study (chapter 1) evaluated surface water quality under a one hour simulated rainfall event using different <b>seeding</b> <b>methods</b> of establishing winter rye following soybean (Glycine max L.) in fall and spring. Aerial, airflow, and broadcast <b>seeding</b> <b>methods</b> provided optimal winter rye ground cover to reduce surface runoff, NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, phosphorus, and sediment compared to fallow. The second study (chapter 2) evaluated surface water quality under a one hour simulated rainfall event using different management practices of winter rye following corn (Zea mays L.) stover removal for silage in spring of 2010 and 2011. Standing and harvested rye treatments reduced surface runoff, NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, phosphorus, and sediment compared to fallow, with standing rye being superior to harvested rye. Harvesting the rye for forage or bedding still provided exceptional environmental benefits for improving water quality compared to fallow. The last two studies (chapters 3 and 4) monitored and evaluated surface runoff in a paired watershed design. The longitudinal limitations of these studies provided insufficient results to conclude if winter rye was effective at reducing surface runoff and improving water quality at the field edge. Overall, simulated rainfall studies showed that winter rye was effective at reducing surface runoff and improving water quality, but the results of field scale studies were less clear...|$|R
