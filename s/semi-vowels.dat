25|$|Warndarang has a {{consonant}} inventory {{similar to}} that of many Australian languages. There are five main places of articulation – bilabial, apico-alveolar, retroflex, lamino-alveolar, and velar – with a stop and a nasal in each, {{with the addition of a}} rarely used interdental stop. There are also two laterals, two rhotics, and two <b>semi-vowels.</b> The presence of a glottal stop is debatable; the glottal stops that Heath heard were unstable and appeared to be optional.|$|E
25|$|The biggest bone of {{contention}} between {{the advocates of}} the 'modern' orthographies and the 'traditionalist' orthographies {{is the use of}} w and y to show the <b>semi-vowels.</b> In general native speakers in literacy classes seem to find y and w very difficult to learn, and that u and i are the 'logical' letters to use. Syllabification of words by untrained speakers suggests that u and i are really the underlying sounds. Thus, a word like dhaudhai 'mainland, continent' syllabifies as dha-u-dha-i, not dhau-dhai. In songs, the glide-u/i can also be given full syllable status. Historical considerations also point to the <b>semi-vowels</b> often being vocalic rather than consonantal. Thus, lagau, the genitive of laag 'place' is in underlying form +ngu>; the full form of the genitive ending -ngu is only retained where the nominal has a monosyllabic stem (see the section on Nominal Morphology). Similarly, verbal nouns end in -i, e.g. lumai, stem luuma- 'search, look for, seek, hunt'. The mid-19th century to early 20th century records of Kauaraigau Ya show that the verbal noun ending was previously -ri (thus lumari), where the -r- was presumably the rhotic glide rather than the rhotic tap/trill.|$|E

2500|$|Vowels are {{constructed}} from {{only a handful}} of basic symbols, but they can be combined with other vowel forms and <b>semi-vowels</b> to represent the full repertoire of diphthongs and triphthongs used in the language. Vowels cannot stand alone or begin a syllable, so the silent consonant, ອ, which can function as a vowel in its own right, is used as a base when spelling a word that begins with a vowel sound. The names of the vowels are just as easy as saying sala (ສະຫລະ, [...] ) before the vowel sign. Some vowels have unique names, and these are ໃ- (ໄມ້ມ້ວນ, , rolled stem), ໄ- (ໄມ້ມາຽ, , unwound stem), [...] -ົ (ໄມ້ກົງ, [...] , straight stem), -ັ (ໄມ້ກັນ, [...] , ear stem), -ຽ (ວິຣາມ, [...] ), and -ໍ (ນິກຄະຫິດ, [...] ). [...] Although a short dash is used on this page to represent the consonant, in standard Lao orthography a small x symbol is used for this purpose. Traditionally this was a simple, stylized, sans-serif x and it was included in Lao fonts before unicode became widespread. Unicode does not make it available as part of the Lao alphabet set, and a lower-case sans-serif x is often used instead.|$|E
2500|$|Visarga ḥ [...] is an {{allophone}} of r and s, and anusvara ṃ, Devanagari [...] of any nasal, both in pausa (i.e., the nasalised vowel). The exact pronunciation of {{the three}} sibilants may vary, but they are distinct phonemes. An aspirated voiced sibilant [...] was inherited by Indo-Aryan from Proto-Indo-Iranian but lost shortly before {{the time of the}} Rigveda (aspirated fricatives are exceedingly rare in any language). The retroflex consonants are somewhat marginal phonemes, often being conditioned by their phonetic environment; they do not continue a PIE series and are often ascribed by some linguists to the substratal influence of Dravidian or other substrate languages. The nasal [...] is a conditioned allophone of [...] ( [...] and [...] are distinct phonemes—aṇu 'minute', 'atomic' [...] is distinctive from anu 'after', 'along'; phonologically independent /ŋ/ occurs only marginally, e.g. in prāṅ 'directed forwards/towards' [...] ). There are thus 31 consonantal or semi-vocalic phonemes, consisting of four/five kinds of stops realised both with or without aspiration and both voiced and voiceless, three nasals, four <b>semi-vowels</b> or liquids, and four fricatives, written in IAST transliteration as follows: k, kh, g, gh; c, ch, j, jh; ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh; t, th, d, dh; p, ph, b, bh; m, n, ṇ; y, r, l, v; ś, ṣ, s, h or a total of 36 unique Sanskrit phonemes altogether.|$|E
