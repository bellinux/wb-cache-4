5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material,</b> shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E

25|$|The {{damage was}} {{greatest}} both near, and well {{north of the}} surface faulting, {{as well as at}} the foot of the mountains. The hospital buildings, the freeway overpasses, and the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility were situated on coarse alluvium that overlaid thousands of feet of loosely consolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material.</b> Underground water, sewer, and gas systems did not fare well in the city of San Fernando where the breaks were too numerous to count, and some sections were so badly damaged that they were abandoned. Ground displacement damaged sidewalks and roadways, with cracks in the more rigid asphalt and concrete often exceeding the width of the shift in the underlying soil. Accentuated damage near alluvium had been documented previously during the investigation of the effects of the 1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes. A band of similarly intense damage further away near Ventura Boulevard at the southern end of the valley was also identified as having been related to soil type.|$|E

In <b>sedimentary</b> <b>materials,</b> {{the dependence of}} the thermal conductivity on pressure varies from sample to sample. Sediment fabrics and water content, as well as porosity, seem to be key factors controlling the pressure dependence, although we cannot definitely identify yet which {{of them is the}} most important factor for determining this property. Ratcliffe's estimate of pressure correction (1960) seems to be valid on average. In view of the small effect of pressure on the thermal conductivity within pressure ranges of this study, the heat flow values obtained so far from this area of the Japan Sea {{do not need to be}} corrected significantly...|$|R
500|$|The races {{themselves}} {{were held in}} the hippodrome, which held both chariot races and riding races. The single horse race {{was known as the}} [...] "keles" [...] (keles, Greek: κέλης). The hippodrome was situated at the south-east corner of the sanctuary of Olympia, on the large flat area south of the stadium and ran almost parallel to the latter. Until recently, its exact location was unknown, since it is buried by several meters of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material</b> from the Alfeios River. In 2008, however, Annie Muller and staff of the German Archeological Institute used radar to locate a large, rectangular structure similar to Pausanias's description. Pausanias, who visited Olympia in the second century AD, describes the monument as a large, elongated, flat space, approximately 780 meters long and 320 meters wide (four stadia long and one stadefour plethra wide). The elongated racecourse was divided longitudinally into two tracks by a stone or wooden barrier, the embolon. All the horses or chariots ran on one track toward the east, then turned around the embolon and headed back west. Distances varied according to the event. The racecourse was surrounded by natural (to the north) and artificial (to the south and east) banks for the spectators; a special place was reserved for the judges {{on the west side of}} the north bank.|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} of this honors thesis was {{to define the}} boundaries of the basins responsible for feeding <b>sedimentary</b> <b>materials</b> to the core sites taken for the 2007 OSU Sumatra Cruise. These boundaries were defined with the specific use in mind of tracking potential sources of material that would likely be incorporated into earthquake induced turbidites found at the sites that were cored. The approximate basin and subbasin boundaries were ascertained via two separate methods. The resultant stream system was then used to produce a geometric network capable of tracking connectivity, upstream accumulation, direct pathways, {{and a variety of other}} functions between a specified core site and any other chosen location that retains viable connectivity with the core site in question. These analysis capabilities, as well as the mapped basin and subbasin boundaries, will hopefully be useful in the further understanding of the transport of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>materials</b> at this study site...|$|R
40|$|One way {{to observe}} the human changes on the Earth surface is by {{studying}} the technogenic deposits. Concerning Presidente Prudente - SP, two technogenic formations in altered floodplains, surrounding the urban perimeter, in the following settlements were studied: Parque Residencial Francisco Belo Galindo and Vila Nova Prudente. Beside the fieldworks to recognition of the social environmental aspects, samples of technogenic deposits were collected using six-inch-PVC tubes, with one meter in length. Through the fieldworks and physical analyses (textural) performed in laboratory, it was identified the presence of urbic artifact (holdover of concrete, plastics, etc.) and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>materials</b> in Parque Residencial Francisco Belo Galindo, whose predominant textural class is “sandy loam”. In Vila Nova Prudente, whose predominant textural class is “sandy”, urbic artifacts (holdover of concrete, plastics, etc.) <b>sedimentary</b> <b>materials</b> were also identified. With the data obtained in the field survey and laboratorial analyses, {{it was possible to}} understand the direct and indirect presence of factors in the formation of technogenic deposits...|$|R

It was published in May 1839 as the Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle, in four volumes, including Darwin's Journal and Remarks, 1832—1836 as the third volume. FitzRoy's account includes a section of Remarks with reference to the Deluge in which he admits that, having read works [...] "by geologists who contradict, by implication, if not in plain terms, the authenticity of the Scriptures" [...] and [...] "while led away by sceptical ideas," [...] he had remarked to a friend that the vast plain of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material</b> they were crossing [...] "could never have been effected by a forty days' flood." [...] He wrote that in his [...] "turn of mind and ignorance of scripture," [...] he was willing to disbelieve the Biblical account. Concerned that such ideas might [...] "reach the eyes of young sailors," [...] he explains in detail his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible, with arguments that rock layers high in the mountains containing sea shells are proof of Noah's Flood and that the six days of creation could not have extended over aeons because the grass, herbs and trees would have died out during the long nights.|$|E

50|$|Jack Souther {{described}} the geology of Whistler Mountain for the Whistler Naturalists Society on May 11, 2001. He speculated that its shale originated as mud on the seafloor of a prehistoric ocean. Granular material, such as clay, sand and silt, was carried into the ancient ocean by rivers that existed during the Cretaceous period. As the Cretaceous rivers continuously sent granular material into the former ocean, it was deposited yearly to eventually form layers of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material.</b> Once the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material</b> was compressed, it created the shale that now forms portions of Whistler Mountain.|$|E

Both geophysical and geological interpretations of data suggest a complex series of Cretaceous grabens extending from the Benue Trough to the southwest.

This granite type forms by the reworking of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>materials</b> by mantle-like magmas instead of by remelting ancient metamorphosed igneous rocks as widely believed.
