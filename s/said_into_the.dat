60|$|They had pushed, as I have <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{still unknown}} {{regions of the}} West.

[...] "I hope you will never regret that you came out of your friendless mystery to speak to me, King Tom. How many days ago it was! And here is another day gone. Tell me how many more of them there must be? Of these blinding days and nights without a sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|At school, and {{at college}} at Edinburgh, the boy's heart was never [...] in his books, unless perchance they {{contained}} {{something of the}} [...] tradition of Scotland. After college he worked in his father's law [...] office, became an advocate, and for twenty years followed the law. [...] His vacations were spent [...] "making raids," [...] as he <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> [...] Highlands, adding to his enormous store of old tales and ballads.

"It is your duty, you know, {{to support}} {{yourself}}," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ear {{of the young}} mother; [...] "there's more than yourself depending on it;" [...] and thus she coshered up Eleanor with cold fowl and port wine. How it is that poor men's wives, who have no cold fowl and port wine on which to be coshered up, nurse their children without difficulty, whereas the wives of rich men, who eat and drink everything that is good, cannot do so, we will for the present leave to the doctors and the mothers to settle between them.|$|E

60|$|Meantime {{there was}} a council of the gentlemen about {{outbidding}} the Salvation Army. Lord Rotherwood was spending already {{as much as he}} could afford, in the days of agricultural depression, on the improvements planned with Mr. White. That individual was too good a man of business to fall, as he <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trap, and make a present to that scamp Richard of more than the worth of the houses, and only Mr. Flight was ready to go to any cost to keep off the Salvation Army; but the answer was curt. Richard knew he had no chance with Mr. White, and did not care to keep terms with him.|$|E
60|$|Meantime they {{continued}} their pilgrimage, Quentin now riding {{abreast of the}} ladies, into whose society {{he seemed to be}} tacitly adopted. He did not speak much, however, being filled by the silent consciousness of happiness, which is afraid of giving too strong vent to its feelings. The Countess Isabelle spoke still less, so that the conversation was chiefly carried on by the Lady Hameline, who showed no inclination to let it drop, for, to initiate the young Archer, as she <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> principles and practice of chivalry, she detailed to him at full length the Passage of Arms at Haflinghem, where she had distributed the prizes among the victors.|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} day the little party made for the Wady Aynúnah, and, {{striking}} {{to the left of the}} straight line, crossed the maritime country, here a mass of Wadys, including our old friend the Afál. This highway to the northern Hismá falls, I have <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mínat el-Ayánát, a portlet useful to Sambúks: its sickle-shaped natural breakwater, curving from west to south, resembles that of Sinaitic Marsá el-Ginái, and those which are so common in Western Iceland. On February 22nd, a very devious path, narrow and rocky, lasting for one hour, led them, about noon, to the northern Jebel el-Kibrít. The distance from El-Muwaylah is about sixty-six miles; and the country west of a line drawn from Aynúnah to Makná was, before this march, utterly unknown to us, consequently to all the civilized world.|$|E

60|$|They had pushed, as I have <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{still unknown}} {{regions of the}} West. For some time they {{followed}} the track of Mormon caravans, guiding themselves in that vast and melancholy desert by the skeletons of men and animals. Then they inclined their route {{a little to the}} north, and, losing even these dire memorials, came into a country of forbidding stillness. I have often heard my father dwell upon the features of that ride: rock, cliff, and barren moor alternated; the streams were very far between; and neither beast nor bird disturbed the solitude. On the fortieth day they had already run so short of food that it was judged advisable to call a halt and scatter upon all sides to hunt. A great fire was built, that its smoke might serve to rally them; and each man of the party mounted and struck off at a venture into the surrounding desert.|$|E
60|$|I spoke earnestly, and the Onondago {{interpreted}} what I had <b>said</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{language of}} the Hurons. I had made this somewhat hardy request, under an impulse that I found ungovernable, and was surprised, as well as pleased, to find it granted. These savages confided in my word, and trusted to my honour with a stately delicacy that might have done credit to the manners of civilized kings, giving themselves no apparent concern about my movements, although they occurred in their own rear. It {{was too late to}} retract, and, leaving Herman Mordaunt endeavouring to drive a bargain with Muss and his two companions, I proceeded, unconcerned myself, boldly towards the armed men who held Guert and Jaap prisoners. I thought my approach did cause a slight movement among these savages, and there was a question and answer passed between them and their leaders. The latter said but a word or two, but these were uttered authoritatively, and with a commanding toss of a hand. Brief as they were, they answered the purpose, and I was neither molested nor spoken to, during the short interview I had with my friend.|$|E
6000|$|We came, as I <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town {{by several}} ways, {{and so we}} went out; but about three miles from the town we met again exactly where we had agreed. I being {{about a quarter of}} a mile from the rest, I meets three country fellows on horseback; one had a long pole on his shoulder, another a fork, the third no weapon at all, that I saw. I gave them the road very orderly, being habited like one of their brethren; but one of them {{stopping}} short at me, and looking earnestly calls out, [...] "Hark thee, friend," [...] says he, in a broad north-country tone, [...] "whar hast thou thilk horse?" [...] I must confess I was in the utmost confusion at the question, neither being able to answer the question, nor to speak in his tone; so I made as if I did not hear him, and went on. [...] "Na, but ye's not gang soa," [...] says the boor, and comes up to me, and takes hold of the horse's bridle to stop me; at which, vexed at heart that I could not tell how to talk to him, I reached him a great knock on the pate with my fork, and fetched him off of his horse, and then began to mend my pace. The other clowns, though it seems they knew not what the fellow wanted, pursued me, and finding they had better heels than I, I saw there was no remedy but to make use of my hands, and faced about.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do, I think," [...] she <b>said,</b> {{stepping}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{hole and}} regarding it critically. [...] "Now you’d better go straight off home, and, mind, {{not a word}} to a soul about this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is my neighbor, Sir George Duncombe," [...] Lord Runton <b>said,</b> looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carriage, [...] "who {{will shoot}} with us to-morrow. Miss Fielding and Mr. Fielding, Lady Angrave and the Baron Von Rothe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane," [...] <b>said</b> Archie, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> telephone, [...] "is {{a pot of}} poison. The waiter is here now, {{setting out}} a rich banquet, and I shall have to eat two of {{everything}} by myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Fourth. It {{is called}} a river, {{to show that it}} yields a continual supply, as I may call it, of new and fresh grace. Rivers yield {{continually}} fresh and new water. For though the channel or watercourse in which the water runs is the same, yet the waters themselves are always new. That water that but one minute since stood in this place or that of the river, is now gone, and new and fresh is come in its place. And thus it is with the river of God, which is full of water; it yieldeth continually fresh supplies, fresh and new supplies of grace to those that have business in those waters. And this is the reason that when sin is pardoned, it seems as if it were carried away. Those waters have, with their continual streams, carried away the filth of the sinner form before his face. It is not so with ponds, pools, and cisterns; they will be foul and stink, if they be not often emptied, and filled again with fresh water. We must then put a difference between the grace that dwelleth in us, and this river of water of life. We are but as ponds, pools, and cisterns, that can hold but little, and shall also soon stink, notwithstanding the grace of God is in us, if we be not often emptied from vessel to vessel, and filled with fresh grace from this river (Jer 48:11). But the river is always sweet, nor can all the filth that is washed out of the world make it stink, or infect it: its water runs with a continual gliding stream, and so carries away all annoyance, as was <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> depth of the sea.|$|E
60|$|Now {{this same}} primary panic that I feel in our rush towards {{patriotic}} armaments I feel also in our rush towards future visions of society. The modern mind is forced towards {{the future by}} {{a certain sense of}} fatigue, not unmixed with terror, with which it regards the past. It is propelled towards the coming time; it is, in the exact words of the popular phrase, knocked into the middle of next week. And the goad which drives it on thus eagerly is not an affectation for futurity Futurity does not exist, because it is still future. Rather it is a fear of the past; a fear not merely of the evil in the past, but of the good in the past also. The brain breaks down under the unbearable virtue of mankind. There have been so many flaming faiths that we cannot hold; so many harsh heroisms that we cannot imitate; so many great efforts of monumental building or of military glory which seem to us at once sublime and pathetic. The future is a refuge from the fierce competition of our forefathers. The older generation, not the younger, is knocking at our door. It is agreeable to escape, as Henley <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Street of By-and-Bye, where stands the Hostelry of Never. It is pleasant to play with children, especially unborn children. The future is a blank wall on which every man can write his own name as large as he likes; the past I find already covered with illegible scribbles, such as Plato, Isaiah, Shakespeare, Michael Angelo, Napoleon. I can make the future as narrow as myself; the past is obliged to be as broad and turbulent as humanity. And the upshot of this modern attitude is really this: that men invent new ideals because they dare not attempt old ideals. They look forward with enthusiasm, because they are afraid to look back.|$|E
60|$|The two amused themselves, {{time and}} again, with talking of the {{attitude}} of the British public as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it; but in fact the British public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to Miss Isabel Archer, whose fortune had dropped her, as her cousin <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dullest house in England. Her gouty uncle received very little company, and Mrs. Touchett, not having cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours, was not warranted in expecting visits from them. She had, however, a peculiar taste; she liked to receive cards. For what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall-table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard. She flattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing. She had played no social part as mistress of Gardencourt, and {{it was not to be}} supposed that, in the surrounding country, a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings. But it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country. Isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the British constitution against her aunt; Mrs. Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument. Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness. She was very critical herself--it was incidental to her age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as well, and there was something in Mrs. Touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing.|$|E

60|$|In {{consequence}} of the union of the Romans and the Sabines, and of {{the rapid growth of}} the city in population and power which followed, the Roman state began soon to rise to so high a position in relation to the surrounding cities and kingdoms, as soon to take precedence of them altogether. This was owing, however, in part undoubtedly, to the character of the men who governed at Rome. The measures which they adopted in founding the city, and in sustaining it through the first years of its existence, as described in the foregoing chapters, were all of a very extraordinary character, and evinced very extraordinary qualities in the men who devised them. These measures were bold, comprehensive and sagacious, and they were carried out with a certain combination of courage and magnanimity which always gives to those who possess it, and who {{are in a position to}} exercise it on a commanding scale, great ascendency over the minds of men. They who possess these qualities generally feel their power, and are usually not slow to assert it. A singular and striking instance of this occurred not many years after the peace with the Sabines. There was a city at some distance from Rome called Cameria, whose inhabitants were a lawless horde, and occasionally parties of them made incursions, as was <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> surrounding countries, for plunder. The Roman Senate sent word to the government of the city that such accusations were made against them, and very coolly cited them to appear at Rome for trial. The Camerians of course refused to come. The Senate then declared war against them, and sent an army to take possession of the city, proceeding to act in the case precisely as if the Roman government constituted a judicial tribunal, having authority to exercise jurisdiction, and to enforce law and order, among all the nations around them. In fact, Rome continued to assert and to maintain this authority over a wider and wider circle every year, until in the course of some centuries after Romulus's day, she made herself the arbiter of the world.|$|E
6000|$|In November, 1707, Swift left Dublin in {{the train}} of the then Lord Lieutenant, Lord Pembroke. His {{travelling}} companion was Sir Andrew Fountaine, who, on landing in England, set out with Lord Pembroke for Wilton, while Swift went on to Leicester to visit his mother. He stayed with her until some time in December, but, {{by the middle of}} the same month, he was in London. During this absence from Ireland Swift corresponded somewhat freely with Archbishop King of Dublin, and with Archdeacon Walls--the letters to the former were first printed in Forster's [...] "Life of Swift." [...] For these Forster was indebted to the Rev. Mr. Reeves (vicar of Lusk, co. Dublin), who discovered them in the record-room of the see of Armagh (see [...] "Life," [...] p. 205 et seq. and note). One of Swift's intentions, while in the metropolis, was to push forward the claim of the Irish clergy for the remission of the First Fruits and Tenths, a grant which had already been conceded to the English clergy; and his letters to King often include requests for the necessary papers by means of which he could lay the matter before either Godolphin or Somers. Walls had written to Swift of the vacancy of the see of Waterford, and, from the reply to the archdeacon, we learn that even at so early a date Swift suffered a grievous disappointment; for in January, 1708, the bishopric, of which Swift had hopes, was presented to Dr. Thomas Milles. In his letter to Walls Swift confesses that he [...] "once had a glimpse that things would have gone otherwise.... But let us talk no further on this subject. I am stomach-sick of it already. ... Pray send me an account of some smaller vacancy in the Government's gift." [...] It was to Somers, and through him to Lord Halifax, that Swift looked for recognition, either for services rendered, or because of their appreciation of his abilities. But, however much he may have been disappointed at their inaction, it may not be argued, as it has been, that Swift's so-called change in his political opinions was the outcome either of spleen or chagrin against the Whigs for their ingratitude towards him. It is, indeed, questionable whether Swift ever changed his political opinions, speaking of these as party opinions. From the day of his entrance, it may be <b>said,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> orders of the Church, his first thought was for it; and on all political questions which touched Church matters Swift was neither Whig nor Tory, but churchman. It was because of the attitude of the Whigs towards the Church that Swift left them; and in his writings he does not spare the Tories even when he finds them taking up similar attitudes. On purely political questions Swift was too independent a thinker to be influenced by mere party views. That he wrote for the Tories must be put down to Harley's personal influence, and to his foresight which saw in Swift a man who must be treated as an equal with the highest in the land. Swift's intercourse with the leading men of his day only served to accentuate his consciousness of his superiority; and a party which would permit him the free play of his powers would be the party to which Swift would give his adhesion. Godolphin, Somers, and Walpole either did not recognize the genius of the man, or their own [...] "points of view" [...] did not permit them to give him the free play they felt he would obtain. Be that as it may, Harley gained not only a splendid party fighter, but a friend on whose affection he could ever rely.|$|E
