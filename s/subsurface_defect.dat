The phase difference between defective areas and non-defective areas illustrates the qualitative analysis of the shape and the boundary of the <b>subsurface</b> <b>defect.</b> In order to accurately estimate the shape, boundary and depth of the defects, the optimal threshold value method is proposed to identify the shape and boundary of the subsurface defects based on the canny operator of image processing.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the quantitative {{determination of the}} size {{and the location of}} a <b>subsurface</b> <b>defect</b> from the phase image of lock-in infrared thermography. Phase (or temperature) difference between a defect area and a sound area indicates the qualitative location and size of a defect. To accurately estimate those, the paper proposes a shearing phase technique in which the inspected image is shifted with a proper pixel size to obtain the shearing image and the subtraction between two images gives a shearing phase distribution. The shearing phase distribution has the maximum, the minimum, and zero point which is a key to quantitatively determine the size and the location of <b>subsurface</b> <b>defect.</b> Experimental results of steel plate with artificial defects show good agreement with actual values. 1...|$|E
40|$|Coating {{spallation}} {{events have}} been observed along the slip-side joggle region of the Space Shuttle Orbiter wing-leading-edge panels. One potential contributor to the spallation event is a pressure build up within subsurface voids or defects due to volatiles or water vapor entrapped during fabrication, refurbishment, or normal operational use. The influence of entrapped pressure on the thermo-mechanical fracture-mechanics response of reinforced carbon-carbon with subsurface defects is studied. Plane-strain simulations with embedded subsurface defects are performed to characterize the fracture mechanics response for a given defect length when subjected to combined elevated-temperature and subsurface-defect pressure loadings to simulate the unvented defect condition. Various <b>subsurface</b> <b>defect</b> locations of a fixed-length substrate defect are examined for elevated temperature conditions. Fracture mechanics results suggest that entrapped pressure combined with local elevated temperatures {{have the potential to}} cause <b>subsurface</b> <b>defect</b> growth and possibly contribute to further material separation or even spallation. For this anomaly to occur, several unusual circumstances would be required making such an outcome unlikely but plausible...|$|E

Experimental studies of eddy current testing have emerged as an important approach alongside numerical. This paper is to design, fabricate and investigate the maximum eddy current testing that can detect <b>subsurface</b> <b>defect</b> in the carbon steel S 45 C block. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The material of the artificial defect block is carbon steel (S 45 C) with dimension of 180 mm (length) × 25 mm (width) × 60 mm (height). There are eight artificial defects which located 20 mm parallel to the length of the block with 0. 5 mm diameter.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, NonDestructive Testing (NDT) {{systems have}} been {{upgraded}} with three-dimensional information.

40|$|Excitation of {{acoustic}} wave modes in a layered solid {{immersed in a}} liquid has been investigated by computing the reflection coefficient of acoustic plane waves at the liquid-layered solid interface. Then, a method to evaluate the sensitivity of various modes supported in the layered structure to <b>subsurface</b> <b>defects</b> is introduced. The method involves insonification of the layered structure with a conical wave whose axis coincides with the defect. Since all the rays in the conical wavefront hit the planar interface at the same angle, {{it is possible to}} excite a single kind of mode in the layer. By adjusting the angle of inclination of the cone, it is possible to excite the modes selectively. Since the conical waves converge to a line focus at the cone axis, the excited mode will focus on the defect. By recording the reflected signal amplitude as the cone angle is varied, a curve is obtained from which it is possible to determine the sensitivity of various modes to the subsurface flaw. The results of such measurements indicate that the generalized Lamb wave modes are more sensitive to <b>subsurface</b> <b>defects</b> than the Rayleigh waves.

40|$|DLC {{films are}} {{beginning}} {{to find their way}} into industrial applications to prolong the life of machine components. Preliminary wear tests on nano-structured DLC coated samples demonstrated an appreciable improvement in pitting resistance and usable life. One of the key parameters that have great impact on the wear resistance of a material is its microstructure. The acoustic microscope was developed as a tool for studying internal microstructure of non-transparent solids and now it is widely used for detection of cracks and <b>subsurface</b> <b>defects.</b> Despite the expedient use of this NDE technique, quantitative characterization of the imaged defects is rarely completed because the theory describing image formation caused by <b>subsurface</b> <b>defects</b> is complicated 1 and it requires knowledge of the material’s elastic properties. In this article, we used scanning acoustic microscopy (Leitz ELSAM) to detect and analyze defects in thin chromium-alloyed DLC (Cr-DLC) films. Our main goal was to investigate the distribution of <b>subsurface</b> <b>defects</b> in Cr-DLC coatings deposited on a steel substrate where the thickness of the films varied from 2 to 3 mm. Two frequencies (200 MHz and 1 GHz) were used to detect and image the defects and for size determination. To locate the depth of the defects, acoustic images were taken at different defocus positions. Velocity of the Rayleigh wave was measured by surface Brillouin scattering and the elastic moduli of the coatings were evaluated by fitting the surface acoustic wave dispersion curve measured by a SAW-laser technique. Elastic moduli were then used in a model developed by Lobkis et al. 1 to simulate the imaged <b>subsurface</b> <b>defects</b> obtained by acoustic microscopy. In this report we discuss the possibility of using this approach for characterization of <b>subsurface</b> <b>defects</b> that are located no deeper than one wavelength of the Rayleigh wave. Our study illustrates that a combination of low (200 MHz) and high (1 GHz) frequency images of the subsurface voids provide sufficient information to uniquely determine their distribution and location. Images at 200 MHz revealed a higher sensitivity to the subsurface voids although they did not provide accurate information about the size and location of the defects. Detection and identification of the defects at high frequency (1 GHz), as a rule, were more difficult; however, the high frequency images were useful for determining the size and position of the defects...|$|R
