50|$|As {{described}} above, the Caps Lock behaviour in most QWERTY keyboard layouts {{differs from}} the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> behaviour in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the Commodore 64, had a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> but no Caps Lock; others, such as the BBC Micro, had both, only one {{of which could be}} enabled at a time.|$|E
50|$|The first {{developments}} {{took place}} around {{the junction of}} the Rash Behari Connector and the E.M. Bypass - the Kasba Golpark area. Ruby Hospital, the office of Siemens {{and a host of}} government-sponsored housing complexes came up in the area. Then the Meghalaya House <b>shifted</b> <b>lock,</b> stock and barrel to this growth region from their old premises at Russel Street, huge amounts of money began pouring into real-estate activities and this resulted in feverish construction activity all along the stretch of the Rash Behari Connector.|$|R

500|$|The United Auto Workers (UAW) {{was founded}} in Detroit on August 26, 1935. The labor union {{struggled}} to gain members until the Flint Sit-Down Strike in 1937. The strike started on December 30, 1936, when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No.1 stopped loading tool dies on the night <b>shift,</b> <b>locking</b> themselves into the plant. The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW-organized plants in Flint. [...] On January 3, 1937, workers at the plant {{sat down on the}} job; Fisher Plant No.2 later joined in the sit-down strike. The heat was shut off at the plants, and on January 11, food deliveries were stopped, sparking a riot. Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4,000National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants. A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No.4 on February 1. The National Guard troops surrounded the 12striking plants in Flint, but the governor never ordered them into action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more, and an agreement was signed, recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country.|$|R

50|$|Along {{the course}} of the canal there are 16 locks with lifting heights of up to 25 m. The 16 locks are managed from four remote control centres (Neuses since 2007, Kriegenbrunn, Hilpoltstein, and Dietfurt from the {{beginning}} of 2007). These centres are manned with one worker on the night shift, and two on the day <b>shift.</b> The <b>locks</b> were modernized from 2001 to 2007, replacing the outdated relay technology with computers and a PLC. The cost was approximately $ 1.3 million per lock.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the shift key while Caps Lock is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already shifted), will also shift keys which are not being <b>shifted</b> by Caps <b>Lock</b> alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>shifts</b> all keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where Caps <b>Lock</b> only <b>shifts</b> alphabet keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if Caps Lock is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the Shift key {{is the most common}} variant on English keyboards.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore phase reset of 3 -dimensional current sources in Brodmann areas located in the human default mode network (DMN) using Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) of the human {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG). Methods: The EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 70 healthy normal subjects ranging in age from 13 to 20 years. A time point by time point computation of LORETA current sources were computed for 14 Brodmann areas comprising the DMN in the delta frequency band. The Hilbert transform of the LORETA time series was used to compute the instantaneous phase differences between all pairs of Brodmann areas. Phase <b>shift</b> and <b>lock</b> durations were calculated based on the 1 st and 2 nd derivatives of the time series of phase differences. Results: Phase shift duration exhibited three discrete modes at approximately: (1) 25 ms, (2) 50 ms, and (3) 65 ms. Phase lock duration present primarily at: (1) 300 – 350 ms and (2) 350 – 450 ms. Phase <b>shift</b> and <b>lock</b> durations were inversely related and exhibited an exponential change with distance between Brodmann areas. Conclusions: The results are explained by local neural packing density of network hubs and an exponential decrease in connections with distance from a hub. The results are consistent with a discrete temporal model of brain function where anatomical hubs behave like a “shutter ” that opens and closes at specific durations as nodes of a network giving rise to temporarily phase locked clusters of neurons for specific durations...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was {{introduced}} so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and {{were meant to}} be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for {{more than two or three}} consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.|$|E
50|$|Automatic Transmission <b>shift</b> <b>lock</b> was {{mechanism}} {{instead of}} an electrical control, a unique method that deregulation was mechanically wire extending from the brake pedal. This was also {{the advantage of being}} unaffected by the battery.|$|E
50|$|In some {{keyboard}} layouts, {{the status}} of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys (verbatim as per capital <b>shift</b> <b>lock),</b> not that of the number row, which then still requires the Shift key to be pressed to reach the alternative key definitions.|$|E

40|$|We have {{observed}} the Fano-Kondo anti-resonance in a quantum wire with a side-coupled quantum dot. In a weak coupling regime, dips {{due to the}} Fano effect appeared. As the coupling strength increased, conductance in the regions between the dips decreased alternately. From the temperature dependence and {{the response to the}} magnetic field, we conclude that the conductance reduction is due to the Fano-Kondo anti-resonance. At a Kondo valley with the Fano parameter q≈ 0, the phase <b>shift</b> is <b>locked</b> to π/ 2 against the gate voltage when the system is close to the unitary limit in agreement with theoretical predictions by Gerland et al.

50|$|In ex-USSR Unix community, Caps Lock key is {{traditionally}} {{used as input}} language switcher, convenient for usage with touch typing. Support for this is present in KDE, GNOME and other desktop environments. Default Russian, Ukrainian layouts for FreeBSD specifies Caps Lock as input language switcher. Additional programs {{can be used for}} this goal in Microsoft Windows,. The original Caps Lock function is reached in such layouts with <b>Shift</b> + Caps <b>Lock.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} Caps Lock that behaves like a {{traditional}} <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> does exist on certain layouts {{such as the}} French AZERTY. Some operating systems and window managers allow Caps Lock {{to be used for}} a similar function. This behavior of the Caps Lock survives, however, in German and Austrian QWERTZ keyboards.|$|E
50|$|A key {{providing}} one of {{the functions}} Capitals lock (usually called “Caps Lock”), Level 2 lock (i. e. “Shift lock”), or Generalized lock shall be present, occupying the position C00. (The function “Generalized lock” is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series). It is to {{be noted that the}} specific way the Caps Lock or <b>Shift</b> <b>Lock</b> works (i. e. swapping the lock state by hitting the key, as it is usually implemented) is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series. Thus, solutions avoiding the status dependency as well as the problem of inadvertent hitting (e.g., the lock key pressed together with Shift turns <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> on, together with AltGr turns Caps Lock on, pressed alone switches off any lock status but has no effect when no lock status is activated) would not prevent compliance to the standard.|$|E
50|$|While {{the typical}} locking {{behaviour}} on keyboards with Caps Lock key {{is that of}} a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> mode.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{stateful}} {{nature of}} ISO/IEC 2022, an identical and equivalent character may be encoded in different character sets, {{which may be}} delegated to any of G0 through G3, which may be accessed using single shifts or by using <b>locking</b> <b>shifts</b> to GL or GR. Consequently, characters can be represented in multiple ways, meaning that two visually identical and equivalent strings can not be reliably compared for equality.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards in Poland {{are laid out}} according to the standard US visual and functional layout. Polish diacritics are accessed by using the AltGr key with a corresponding similar letter from the base Latin alphabet. Normal capitalization rules apply with respect to <b>Shift</b> and Caps <b>Lock</b> keys. For example, to enter [...] "Ź", one can type Shift+AltGr+X with Caps Lock off, or turn on Caps Lock and type AltGr+X.|$|R

50|$|Caps Lock is {{a button}} on a {{computer}} keyboard that, when pressed, causes all letters to be generated in capitals until deactivated. It {{is located in the}} position of a similar <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key (and sometimes a Ctrl key) found in some other keyboard layouts. It is usually a toggle key: each press reverses its action.|$|E
50|$|This input {{is used to}} {{determine}} whether to activate the <b>shift</b> <b>lock</b> solenoid to prevent the driver selecting a driving range with no foot on the brake.

5000|$|For example, in most {{keyboard}} layouts the Shift {{key combination}} [...] {{will produce a}} capital letter [...] "A" [...] instead of the default lower-case letter [...] "a" [...] (unless in Caps lock or <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> mode). A combination of [...] in Microsoft Windows will close the program in the active window; in this instance, Alt is the modifier key. In contrast, pressing just [...] or [...] will probably do nothing unless assigned a specific function in a particular program (for example, activating input aids or the toolbar of the active window in Windows).|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of symmetric-definite {{generalized}} eigenvalue problems, Ax = λBx, it is often required to compute all eigenvalues contained in a prescribed interval. Research in this topic culminated with the paper by Grimes et al. [1], where a robust and efficient procedure is proposed. This technique, usually referred to as spectrum slicing, combines several ingredients: (1) unrestarted block Lanczos method with B-orthogonalization, (2) shift-and-invert spectral transformation, i. e., to solve (A − σB) − 1 Bx = θx for a given shift σ, (3) dynamic shift selection, and (4) use of inertia information {{to determine the number}} of eigenvalues in a given subinterval. Nowadays, robust Krylov methods are based on restarted variants such as the thick-restart Lanczos method [2]. We propose an updated spectrum slicing methodology that relies on such variants, and explore several strategies for <b>shift</b> selection, <b>locking,</b> enforcement of multiplicity, etc. Our aim is t...|$|R

50|$|The Caps Lock key {{originated}} as a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key on mechanical typewriters. An early {{innovation in}} typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of the few}} C64 {{programs}} that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the CAPS LOCK key is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This {{has to do with}} the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the <b>SHIFT</b> <b>LOCK</b> key found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT key, the CAPS LOCK key on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS LOCK key in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|E
