40|$|Tumor-mimicking lesions in the {{musculoskeletal}} {{system can be}} defined as lesions mistaken as tumors due to the presence of palpation upon physical examination or a tumor-like appearance upon radiological examination. Moreover, tumormimicking lesions show diverse etiologies and anatomic locations. We illustrated the various tumor-mimicking lesions involving bone and soft tissue. In this review, the tumor-mimicking lesions were classified into those based on clinical examination and those based on radiological examination in musculoskeletal radiology. Awareness of the various causes of tumor-mimicking lesions, correctly obtaining clinical information, and the proper selection of imaging modality are important for the differentiation of tumor-mimicking lesions from true neoplasms.

40|$|Sports {{radiology}} {{is a new}} radiological subspecialty. Traumatic sports-related injuries can be acute, but {{are more}} frequently caused by over-use. Close collaboration between the treating physician and radiologist optimizes {{the choice of the}} best imaging technique to confirm the tentative diagnosis and to determine the treatment plan. Conventional radiology is indicated when a bone injury is suspected. In the case of discrepancy between the x-ray findings (no abnormality) and the clinical findings (presence of symptoms) additional investigation is, however, indicated. Ultrasound is the indicated technique for lesions of superficial soft tissue, such as tendons and muscles.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) to collagen degradation {{was investigated in}} soft connective tissue explants (periosteum). Immunolocalisation showed faint to intense staining of cells throughout the periosteum. The V-ATPase inhibitors, bafilomycin A 1 and folimycin, decreased overall collagen degradation by 40 and 50 % after 24 and 48 h, respectively. The participation of V-ATPases in intracellular degradation of collagen was demonstrated by the decrease {{of the amount of}} phagocytosed collagen in fibroblasts upon inhibition of pump activity. The inhibition of degradation was not due to a reduction in activity of gelatinase A, an enzyme previously found to mediate collagen degradation, as assessed by zymographic analysis of tissue and conditioned medium. Bafilomycin A 1 even induced an increase of gelatinase A and B levels in both fractions. In conclusion, acidification by V-ATPases may represent an important mechanism in extracellular and intracellular collagen degradation in <b>soft</b> connective <b>tissu...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{data suggest}} that gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase- 2, MMP- 2) plays an {{important}} role in the degradation of collagen of soft connective tissues. In an attempt to investigate its participation in more detail we assessed the digestion of collagen in cultured rabbit periosteal explants and compared this with the level of active MMP- 2 and collagenases. The data demonstrated that both collagen degradation and MMP activity increased with time. Conditioned medium obtained from explants cultured for 72 h showed that the level of active MMP- 2 correlated with collagen degradation (r = 0. 80, d. f. = 23, P < 0. 0001). Such a relationship was not found with collagenase activity (r = - 0. 08, d. f. = 21, NS). The possible involvement of MMP- 2 in collagen degradation was investigated further by incubating explants with selective gelatinase inhibitors (CT 1166, CT 1399 and CT 1746). In the presence of these compounds breakdown of collagen was almost completely abolished (approximately 80 %). Finally we assessed whether periosteal fibroblasts had the capacity to degrade collagen type I that conferred resistance to collagenase activity. Breakdown of this collagen did not differ from degradation of normal collagen. Taken together, our data provide support for the view that MMP- 2 plays a crucial role in collagen degradation of <b>soft</b> connective <b>tissu...</b>|$|R
40|$|Postradiation sarcoma, a sarcoma {{developing}} in a previously irradiated field, {{is a rare}} tumor. Surgery {{appears to be the}} only curative treatment option. In general the prognosis is poor, and new treatments options are needed. One study reported the expression of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase in two postradiation angiosarcomas. Success of inhibition of KIT in malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors with imatinib mesylate seems mutation-dependent, with a favorable response in the presence of exon 11 mutations. We performed a clinical, immunohistochemical, and genetic assessment of postradiation sarcomas, including angiosarcomas. Archival tumor tissue was available from 16 patients diagnosed with a postradiation sarcoma between 1978 and 2001. Data on the first and secondary tumor, treatment, and follow-up was documented.

40|$|The {{authors have}} no {{financial}} conflicts of interest. Purpose: Deciding on treatment {{carcinoma of the}} tongue when the tumor has a thickness of 1. 5 cm or more is difficult. Surgery often requires wide resection and re-construction, leading to considerable functional impairment. A cesium implant is an attractive option, {{but according to the}} Manchester System, a two plane implant is needed. Materials and Methods: According to the textbook, a tumor is sandwiched between the needles, which are implanted {{at the edge of the}} tumor. This may cause an unnecessarily high dose to the outer surface of the tongue, which sometimes leads to a persistent ulcer.

40|$|SUMMARY. -A {{case report}} is {{presented}} of a synovial sarcoma arising in the abdominal wall. This is the seventh such {{case to be}} reported. A brief review of the clinical and pathological features of synovial sarcoma is made. Pre-operative diagnosis of an abdominal wall synovial sarcoma is virtually impossible, but should be considered when a soft tissue swelling is found to show amorphous stippled calcification on X-ray. SYNOVIAL sarcoma is a rare tumour which usually arises in the soft tissues of an extremity, the lower limbs being the most common site (Haagensen and Stout, 1944). In spite of its name the tumour does not often develop from the synovial membrane lining joint surfaces. Very rarely these tumours {{have been reported to}} occur {{in the head and neck}} or torso. Six cases of abdominal wall synovial sarcoma have been reported previously. We wish to report a seventh case, and to review briefly the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of this interesting tumour.

40|$|Background: The {{submental artery}} island flap is a {{reliable}} reconstructive option for lower face defects. Advantages of this flap include suppleness of tissue, excellent {{color and texture}} match to facial skin, a wide arc of rotation, prominent blood supply, and a well-hidden donor site scar. Methods: This article describes a 61 -year-old man with eccrine carcinoma of the chin necessitating extensive excision. A submental artery island flap {{was used for the}} reconstruction of the extended chin subunit. Results: The operation resulted in excellent aesthetic outcome and maintenance of oral competence. Conclusion: The submental artery island flap utilizes loose tissue of the submental area to effectively and reliably reconstruct the soft tissue subunits of the chin and is a superb option for sizable defects. The flap is sufficiently well vascularized to tolerate postoperative radiation therapy without significant fibrosis or retraction. The chin is an aesthetically and functionally important anatomic subunit of the face, bordered by the lower lip superiorly and the mandible/submandibular line inferiorly. The soft tissue formation of the chin includes the vermilion component of the lip, multiple muscle layers, and the gonion with firm muscular and boney attachments. 1 âˆ’ 4 <b>Soft</b> <b>tissu...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{synovial}} sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive soft tissue tumor that classically {{occurs in the}} extremities near, but rarely within large joints, in young adults. Variable symptoms and clinical manifestations may be encountered and a definite diagnosis should depend on pathological results. This poses certain difficulties in arriving at a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Case presentation: We report {{the case of a}} 68 -year-old woman patient who presented an inguinal mass with swelling and pain in the right lower limb. She underwent surgery, and later received systematic intravenous chemotherapy. The pathological studies, especially the specific chromosomal translocation of a t(X; 18) (p 11. 2;q 11. 2), confirmed the diagnosis as a {{synovial sarcoma}}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a monophasic synovial sarcoma in the inguinal region. Conclusion: Besides making the readership aware of the rarity of location and age of this present case, this report distinctly highlights the great value of a molecular analysis of an SYT associated genetic alteration in the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma occurring at rare sites especially when immunochemical results are equivocal.

40|$|Background: The {{reconstruction}} of major burn and other deformities resulting from significant soft tissue deficits {{of the face}} and neck is a continuing challenge for surgeons who wish to reliably restore facial function and aesthetic appearance. A primary problem is deficiency of well-matched donor skin. Other problems include the unique characteristics of facial skin, the fine anatomic nuances, and the unique functional demands placed on the face. This article describes an expanded shoulder transposition flap that can provide {{a large amount of}} both flap and full-thickness skin graft for total and subtotal {{reconstruction of}} the face. Methods: An expanded shoulder transposition flap has been used since 1986 for head and neck resurfacing 58 times in 41 patients ranging in age from 2 to 62 years. The details of the technique and the results of the flap including complications are described. Results: The flap proved remarkably reliable and reproducible in resurfacing the peripheral facial aesthetic units. The pedicle skin is often used for grafting of the central face with its finer features. The donor site of the flap is closed primarily.

40|$|Background: Angiosarcomas {{may develop}} as primary tumours of unknown cause or as {{secondary}} tumours, most commonly following radiotherapy to the involved field. The different causative agents {{may be linked}} to alternate tumorigenesis, which led us to investigate the genetic profiles of morphologically indistinguishable primary and secondary angiosarcomas. Methods: Whole-genome (18 k) c-DNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension and ligation analysis was used to genetically profile 26 primary and 29 secondary angiosarcomas. Key findings were thereafter validated using RTâ€“qPCR, immunohisto-chemistry and validation of the gene signature to an external data set. Results: In total, 103 genes were significantly deregulated between primary and secondary angiosarcomas. Secondary angiosarcomas showed upregulation of MYC, KIT and RET and downregulation of CDKN 2 C. Functional annotation analysis identified multiple target genes in the receptor protein tyrosine kinase pathway. The results were validated using RTâ€“qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Further, the gene signature was applied to an external data set and, herein, distinguished primary from secondary angiosarcomas. Conclusions: Upregulation of MYC, KIT and RET and downregulation of CDKN 2 C characterise secondary angiosarcoma, which implies possibilities for diagnostic application and a mechanistic basis for therapeutic evaluation of RET-kinase-inhibitors in these highly aggressive tumours.

Purpose: To measure knee joint proprioception in healthy subjects before and after exercise and to establish a reference for further comparisons of patients with knee injuries. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: We tested proprioception in the knees of 24 healthy subjects {{with a mean age}} of 24 years and median Tegner score of 5. Subjects were tested to estimate their thresholds for detecting slow passive motion, from starting positions of 20 Â° and 40 Â° before and after cycling on an ergometer bicycle until the pulse rate reached a steady state level and they reached a score of 14 to 17 on Borgâ€™s Ratio of Perceived Exertion scale. Results: After cycling, significantly higher threshold values were found for perception of movement toward flexion from both 20 Â° and 40 Â°. No significant differences were seen in measurements of movement toward extension. Conclusions: Knee joint proprioception seems to be impaired by exercise or training. Clinical Relevance: This impairment may lead to defective dynamic stabilization of the joint, leading to an increased risk of injuries.

40|$|Aims: Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a {{distinct}} sarcoma-type with a specific morphology and immunophenotype. Whereas focal myxoid change does occur, to our knowledge only two cases of ES with diffuse myxoid stroma have been reported previously. To characterize more clearly the myxoid variant of ES, we describe six additional cases and discuss the differential diagnoses. Methods and results: Cases were retrieved from the authors' files and studied histologically, immunohistochemically and by molecular methods. The age of the patients, four females and two males, ranged from 16 to 74 years (median: 33 years). The neoplasms arose in an extremity (two cases), the abdominal wall, groin, perineum and shoulder (one case each). Histologically, four cases were of the conventional type, and two were of the proximal type and the immunophenotype was typical for ES. The tumour stroma, however, revealed prominent myxoid changes, ranging from 50 to 90 % (median: 75 %). Only one of the proximal type ES showed a SMARCB 1 mutation, whereas the other tumours showed no mutation. Conclusions: The myxoid variant of ES represents a diagnostic challenge and may be confused with other benign and malignant myxoid neoplasms.

40|$|ABSTRACTâ€”In this study, {{digital image}} {{correlation}} (DIC) was adopted {{to examine the}} mechanical behavior of arterial tissue from bovine aorta. Rectangular sections comprised of the in-timal and medial layers were excised from the descending aorta and loaded in displacement control uniaxial tension up to 40 percent elongation. Specimens of silicon rubber sheet were also prepared {{and served as a}} benchmark material in the application of DIC for the evaluation of large strains; the elastomer was loaded to 50 percent elongation. The arterial specimens exhibited a non-linear hyperelastic stressâ€“strain response and the stiffness increased with percent elongation. Using a bilinear model to describe the uniaxial behavior, the average minor and major elastic modulii were 192 Â± 8 KPa and 912 Â± 40 KPa, respectively. Poissonâ€™s ratio of the arterial sec-tions increased with the magnitude of axial strain; the average Poissonâ€™s ratio was 0. 17 Â± 0. 02. Although the correlation co-efficient obtained from image correlation decreased with the percent elongation, a correlation coefficient greater than 0. 8 was achieved for the tissue experiments and exceeded that obtained in the evaluation of the elastomer. Based on results from this study, DIC may serve as a valuable method for the determination of mechanical properties of arteries and other soft tissues.

40|$|Abstract: A nine-year-old male beagle dog {{had a white}} spherical mass in the subcutis of {{the left}} lumbar region. Microscopically, spin-dle to oval cells diffusely proliferated in the fibrous and myxoid stroma. Many {{neoplastic}} cells showed rhabdoid features or vacuolated cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin and S 100 and partly positive for neuron-specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein but were negative for von Willebrand factor, desmin and Î±-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastruc-turally, the neoplastic cells had abundant cytoplasmic processes and desmosome-like structures. Cytoplasmic inclusions of rhabdoid-featured cells in HE sections were composed of aggregates of intermediate filaments, and cytoplasmic vacuoles were identified as an invagination of cytoplasm. Although malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor was suggested according to these results, the present case was diagnosed as a soft tissue sarcoma with rhabdoid features {{due to a lack}} of identification of the basal lamina under electron microscopy.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} chlorophenol exposure with soft tissue sarcoma risk independent of phenoxyherbicide exposure, the authors analyzed data from the Selected Cancers Study, a population-based case-control study that included 295 male soft tissue sarcoma cases, aged 32 - 60 years, from eight population-based cancer registries and 1, 908 male controls. Chlorophenol exposure was assigned using both an intensity and a confidence estimate by an industrial hygienist based on verbatim job descriptions. Seventeen percent of the jobs rated as high intensity involved wood preservation, while 82 % involved cutting oils. Soft tissue sarcoma risk, modeled using conditional logistic regression, {{was significantly associated with}} ever having high-intensity chlorophenol exposure (odds ratio = 1. 79, 95 % confidence interval 1. 10 - 2. 88). A duration-response trend was evident among more highly exposed subjects (p for trend < 0. 0001). For subjects with 10 or more years of substantial exposure, the odds ratio was 7. 78 (95 % confidence interval 2. 46 - 24. 65). These results suggest that chlorophenol exposure independent of phenoxyherbicides may increase the risk of soft tissue sarcoma. Because of the large number of machinists in the exposed group and the complex compo-sition of cutting fluids, it is possible that another exposure involved in machining is responsible for the observed excess risk.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to describe unknown bone and soft tissue lesions in adults identified at cancer screening using PET. Methods: A total of 4283 individuals of more than or equal to 40 years of age were enrolled. All individuals underwent scans from the base of the skull to proximal thigh. The images were reviewed and a consensus was reached by two board-certified radiologists and a nuclear medicine specialist for the diagnoses. Diagnoses of the lesions were confirmed by histological examination, typical radiologic findings, obvious progression in number and/or size of the lesion on follow-up examinations, and medical examination of interview. Results: Unsuspected focal abnormality in the bone and soft tissue were found in 62 individ-uals (1. 4 %). The mean size of the lesion was 26 mm (range, 6 â€“ 155 mm). There were 29 bone lesions (47 %) and 33 soft tissue lesions (53 %). A malignant lesion was found in one case (1. 6 %) and histologic diagnosis was primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the vertebra. Other major diagnoses were healing bone (n 11, 18 %) and benign cystic lesions of bone and soft tissue (n 9, 15 %), and brown fat of soft tissue (n 4, 6 %). Conclusion: Unsuspected bone and soft tissue lesions of a wide variation of pathologic and clinical diagnoses were encountered at cancer screening using PET.

40|$|Sharief M Aboelmagd, Paul N Malcolm, Andoni P Toms Department of Radiology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital National Health Service Trust, Norwich, UK Abstract: Recent {{developments}} in metal artifact reduction techniques in magnetic resonance (MR) have, in large part, been {{stimulated by the}} advent of soft tissue complications associated with modern metal-on-metal total hip replacements. Metallic orthopedic implants can result in severe degradation of MR images because ferromagnetic susceptibility causes signal loss, signal pile-up, geometric distortion, and failure of fat suppression. There are several approaches to controlling these susceptibility artifacts. Standard fast spin echo sequences can be adapted by modifying echo times, matrix, receiver bandwidth, slice thickness, and echo trains to minimize frequency encoding misregistration. Short tau inversion recovery and 2 -point Dixon techniques are both more resistant to susceptibility artifacts than spectral fat suppression. A number of dedicated metal artifact reduction sequences are now available commercially. The common approach of these multispectral techniques is to generate three dimensional datasets from which the final images are reconstructed. Frequency encoding misregistration is controlled {{using a variety of}} techniques, including specific resonant frequency acquisition, view-angle tilting, and phase encoding. Metal artifact reduction MR imaging has been the key to understanding the prevalence, severity, and prognosis of adverse reactions to metal debris in metal-on-metal hip replacements. Conventional radiographs are typically normal or demonstrate minimal change and are unable to demonstrate the often extensive soft tissue abnormalities, which include necrosis, soft tissue masses and fluid collections, myositis, muscle atrophy, tendon avulsions, and osteonecrosis. These MR findings correlate poorly with clinical and serological measures of disease, and therefore MR imaging is the principal tool for the diagnosis of soft tissue disease and surveillance in metal-on-metal hip replacements.

Although metastasis rarely occurs, DFSP is a locally aggressive tumor with a high recurrence rate. It accounts for less than 0. 1 % of all malignant neoplasms and approximately 1 % of all soft tissue sarcomas. 1, 2 The annual incidence of DFSP in the United States is reported as 4. 2 cases per million population from nine population-based cancer registries from 1973 to 2002. 3 DFSP {{has been reported in}} persons of all races, and no racial predi-lection seems to exist in previous reports. The neoplasm usually occurs in adults aged 20 to 50 years. 4 Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment. Chemotherapy is rarely used, and radiation therapy can be used as an adjunct to surgery when clear surgical margins are not confident. 5, 6 Case Study A man in his mid- 20 s presented for sonographic evalua-tion of several nontender superficial subcutaneous masses in his left lower quadrant. The firm irregular nodules were several centimeters in diameter. The skin surface varied in color from flesh to reddish brown. There was a large surgical scar inferior to the nodules.
