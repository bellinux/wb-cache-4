40|$|The {{eucalypt}} <b>sulphite</b> spent <b>liquor</b> {{has a very}} acidic pH, with {{an average}} value of 2. 4 at {{the output of the}} process. Increasing the pH to reach a neutral pH would need the consumption of large ammounts of a basic compound, which would be a significant added economic cost, to assume part of working with higher volumes. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the minimal increase in pH required to have a good development of the pentose-fermenting strains. For this purpose, fermentations were performed using the two yeasts and a synthetic growing media containing salts and half of the sugars of a typical eucalypt <b>sulphite</b> spent <b>liquor</b> with pH ranges between 2. 5 and 6 0. The kinetics of the cultures showed very different behaviors at low pHs between Pichia stipitis and Pachysolen tannophilus being the Pachysolen tannophilus strain the best strain to obtain ethanol only increasing the pH of the liquor to pH 3. 0.

40|$|Hardwood spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquors</b> (HSSLs) are {{by-products}} {{from the}} pulping industry rich in pentoses, {{which are not}} yet fully exploited for bioprocessing, namely {{for the production of}} bioethanol. The sustainable fermentation of pentoses into bioethanol is a challenge to overcome. Besides sugars, HSSLs contains inhibitors that decrease the possibility of bioprocessing of these by-products. Nevertheless, recent studies have brought new insights in using HSSLs for bioethanol production. This paper reviews the results of relevant studies carried out with HSSLs towards bioprocessing to bioethanol. The composition of SSLs was compared and related with the wood origin stressing specificity of microbial inhibitors from HSSL and their anti-microbial effect. The different fermentative processes, the microorganisms used, and the strategies to improve yield and productivity used so far were also reviewed. This review allowed concluding that research is still needed in several areas, including optimization of detoxification processes, fermentation strategies and selection of suitable microbial strains in order to achieve the integration of the different steps needed for HSSLs bioconversion into ethanol thus contributing for sustainability of pulping mills within biorefinary concept.

40|$|Spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor,</b> {{the major}} {{byproduct}} from the sulphite pulp production process, was diluted to 50 % {{and used for}} production of an edible zygomycete Rhizopus sp. The focus was on production, yield, and composition of the fungal biomass composition. The fungus grew well at 20 to 40 °C, but 32 °C {{was found to be}} preferable compared to 20 and 40 °C in terms of biomass production and yield (maximum of 0. 16 g/g sugars), protein content (0. 50 - 0. 60 g/g), alkali-insoluble material (AIM) (ca 0. 15 g/g), and glucosamine content (up to 0. 30 g/g of AIM). During cultivation in a pilot airlift bioreactor, the yield increased as aeration was raised from 0. 15 to 1. 0 vvm, indicating a high demand for oxygen.

40|$|BACKGROUNDThe {{development}} of sustainable industrial processes demands the recovery and transformation of their by-products. The production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) by mixed microbial cultures (MMC) {{is one of}} the available routes. This study evaluated the possibility of applying a two-step PHAs production process using an industrial by-product, hardwood <b>sulphite</b> spent <b>liquor</b> (HSSL), as feedstock for a MMC. The first step consisted in the selection of PHAs-storing microorganisms using an aerobic dynamic feeding strategy followed by a second step, accumulation. RESULTSThe selected MMC, despite not being able to use the main carbon source of HSSL, lignosulphonates, revealed the capacity to consume acetate and xylose to accumulate poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) and glucose biopolymer. The maximum PHAs content was relatively low, 6. 6 %, with a maximum production yield of 0. 49 C-mmol HA C-mmol S- 1 during the selection stage. CONCLUSIONA MMC was able to adapt to HSSL by consuming acetate and xylose. The imposed operational conditions resulted in a partial selection of the culture, since only acetate-consuming organisms experienced a real feast/famine regime, resulting in low PHAs production.

40|$|There are {{tremendous}} {{quantities of}} waste from the wood pulping industry. In Canada alone 2, 027, 532 tons (1) of sulphite pulp were produced in 1947 from {{which there was}} approximately 2, 500, 000 tons of unused solids in the <b>sulphite</b> waste <b>liquor.</b> Although a number of means of utilizing this material have been suggested, the only promising outlet for large quantities at present is as fuel and the economics of even this procedure are not yet proven for conditions as they exist on this continent. Most of the liquor is at present discharged into streams. The absence of a practical use for the great bulk of these spent liquors, {{and the absence of}} a recovery cycle for the chemicals therein, have been major reasons why the sulphite pulp industry has lost its position relative to competitive processes. Similarly, this handicap has prevented the development of the neutral sulphite pulping process which otherwise has many virtues. Apart from the absolute waste of half the wood used, there is the additional disadvantage that the sugars and other carbohydrates in the waste liquor, with their high biological oxygen demand, constitute a serious pollution of waterways with an attendant adverse effect upon fish life, upon further industrial development and upon the beauty of the country.

40|$|A catalyzed chemimechanical-anthraquinone pulping {{of black}} spruce wood was {{investigated}} in this study. The effect of liquor pH on anthraquinone performance, AQ and mass transfer limitations on chemimechanical pulp properties {{and the effects of}} AQ, liquor pH and sulphite concentration on pulping kinetic were studied. It was observed that AQ was not an effective redox catalyst when added to the <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> at pH 4, but it was very effective at pH 7 and higher. When chemical treatment of chemimechanical pulping was done with the presence of AQ, the sulphur content of pulp was reduced due to preferential reaction of AQ with wood components. AQ, as a pulping agent, is much effective in increasing the delignification rate {{and at the same time}} protecting the degradation of carbohydrates. Pulps produced from wood wafers with cooking liquor at pH 7 containing 0. 1 % of AQ on oven dry wood, exhibited the following improved properties when compared with those prepared without addition of AQ: increased pulping rate, higher pulp yield and carbohydrates yield at the same level of residual lignin in pulp, and in addition, the strength properties such as breaking length and burst strength improved by 15 % even with a minimum AQ charge (0. 05 % and 0. 01 %). With regular wood chips, the penetration of sulphite seems to be superior to that of AQ. It was observed that AQ was not uniformly distributed in the impregnated wood chips even when the compression ratio was increased from 3. 5 : 1 to 5 : 1. The penetration of AQ into wood chips remains to be a major factor affecting the pulping rate and pulp properties (strength and brightness) in chemimechanical-AQ pulping. The rate of delignification in the initial phase of both sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking at pH 7 shows the second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The order with respect to sulphite concentration for sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking were estimated to be 0. 24 and 0. 31, respectively. The activation energies of delignification of the initial phase in sulphite and sulphite-AQ pulping were 90. 2 and 97. 5 kJ/mole which was valid up to 30 % lignin removal within the temperature range of 160 °C and 175 °C. AQ as a pulping additive introduced to the <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> increased the rate of delignification 1. 5 times in the initial phase of delignification during the sulphite cooking process. At initial pH of <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> ranging from 7 to 10, the rate of delignification in the initial phase during sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking appears to be a second order reaction in the remaining lignin.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} uses pulping chemicals for the treatment of bagasse, straw and wood chips. Spent liquor or effluent liquor, with high carbon content is produced and sent to chemical recovery to recover pulping chemicals. In addition, energy from the spent liquor is recovered and utilised to generate steam for electricity supply, thereby reducing fossil fuel power consumption. Spent liquor is destroyed using conventional incineration technology, in a recovery furnace or recovery boiler, which is the heart of chemical recovery. These units have {{over the past few decades}} been prone to numerous problems and are a major concern to the {{pulp and paper}} industry. They pose a threat to the environment, are expensive to maintain and constitute a safety hazard. Thus the {{pulp and paper industry}} is now looking at a replacement technology; an alternative that will effectively regenerate pulping chemicals and recover energy for generating electricity, ultimately to make the plant energy self-sufficient. Gasification technology may be the chosen technology but is yet to be applied to the pulp and paper sector. However, this technology is not new. It has been integrated and used successfully in the petroleum industry for decades, with applications in coal mining and the mineral industry. The overall objective of tills study is to develop a better understanding of gasification using a pilot-scale fluidised bed reactor which was designed and developed at the University of Natal. The reactor, "the Gasifier", is operated at temperatures below the smelt limits of inorganic salts (< 750 °C) in the spent liquor. In this investigation, spent liquor is injected directly into an inert bed of alwninium oxide grit, which is fluidised by superheated steam. The atomized liquor immediately dries when it contacts the grit in the bed, pyrolyses and the organic carbon is gasified by steam. Pyrolysis and steam gasification reactions are endothennic and require heat. Oxidised sulphur species are partially reduced by reaction with gasifier products, which principally consist of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The reduced sulphur is said to be unstable in the gasifier environment, and reacts with steam and carbon dioxide to form solid sodium carbonate and gaseous hydrogen sulphide. (Rockvam, 2001). The focus of this study will be to determine the Gasifier's ability to gasify spent liquor, from soda and sulphite pulping of bagasse, at different operating conditions. In addition, the fate of process and non-process elements will be investigated. The product gas generated in the gasification of spent soda and <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquors</b> consisted of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. In the gasification of spent sulphjte liquor, hydrogen sulphide was also produced. The water-gas shift reaction, which was the main reaction, was found to be temperature dependent. In adilition, organic carbon conversion increased with temperature. Furthermore, most of the sulphur in the bed predominated in the form of hydrogen sulphide with very little sulphur in the form of sulphate. This indicated that gasification would reduce sulphate levels, which are responsible for dead load in a chemical recovery cycle. Finally, an important result was that the aluminium oxide grit was successfully coated. It was previously speculated that this would not be possible...|$|R
40|$|Saccharification {{of various}} kinds of {{cellulose}} materials, including woods and barks of mulberry tree, cotton plant, bog-moss in the tundra of Saghalien, rice and barley straws, rice hulls etc., was carried by dilute sulphuric acid under pressure with an apparatus of Scholler's type which was planned by the author. It was found that saccharification of cellulose materials, especially of bog-moss is well achieved, if they are removed of humic acid beforehand with diluted ammonia and hydrolysed fractionally. Among various strains of yeasts, a kind of distilley yeast suitable for fermentation of saccharified solution was selected, and no inhibitting substance to the yeast was detected, though 0. 82 g of furfurol, 0. 021 g of hydroxymethylfurfurol and 3. 25 g of volatile acids were produced by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree in the saccharified solutions. Sugars in the solutions were investigated by the method of paper chromatograph {{and the presence of}} glucose, mannose, arabinose and xylose was verified. Thus, in decomposing 100 g of bog-moss by dilute acid at 130 ℃ and 150 ℃, about 30 g of sugars was obtained and then about 9 g of alcohol was produced by fermentation of saccharified solution. About 33 g of sugar and then about 10 g of alcohol were obtained by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree with dilute acid at 180 ℃. Production of yeast from the saccharified solutions was investigated, especially pentose-assimilable yeasts (isolated by the author and named Torulopsis xylinus). In saccharified solutions from 100 g of bog-moss or mulberry tree, about 9. 5 g or 8. 9 g of yeast was produced respectively. In order to know the availability of constituents of the spent wash, distilly waste liquor of the alcohol solution obtained from the saccharified solution of mulberry tree, experiments were carried out. During 120 hours ordinary culture, 1 / 3 parts of reducing sugars, including more than 2 / 3 parts of pentose, were consumed. It was pointed out that small amount of organic matters other than sugars was assimilated. No remarkable multiplication of yeasts took place with <b>sulphite</b> pulp waste <b>liquor</b> from which most of SO_ 2 was expelled by aeration and the remaining SO_ 2 was precipitated by adding calcium hydroxide to pH to 5. 6 by sulphuric acid, while noticeable crop yields of the yeasts were obtained. The chemical compositions of Torulopsis xylinus (7 - 9 % of ash, 43 - 47 % of crude protein and 0. 69 mg% of vitamin B_ 1) thus obtained were found to be very much the same with Torula utilis obtained from spent washes or pulp waste liquors. Production of fat with the saccharified solution of mulberry tree was carried out by the yeast (isolated by the author and named Rhodotorula mucilaginosa var.). It was found that at the first stage of fermentation (72 hours incubation) the immediate yeast population was larger in xylose or saccharified solutions as sources of carbon than in other sugars and at the second stage of fermentation (subsequent 24 hours incubation and the stage of fat production from glucose added) fat yield was also greater in the former. The fat-coefficient was more than twenty and the characteristic of fat looked like coconut...|$|R

To this end, the fermentation performance, energy status and fermentation capacity of the strains were measured under different growth conditions. Results: Nutrient supplementation with yeast extract increased sugar uptake, cell growth and ethanol production in all tested fermentation conditions, but had little or no effect on the energy status, irrespective of media. Nutrient-supplemented medium enhanced the fermentation capacity of harvested cells, indicating that cell viability and reusability was increased by nutrient addition.

40|$|Spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) is {{the main}} {{byproduct}} of acid sulphite pulping. Its main components are lignosulphonates (LS) and monomeric sugars. SSL is typically intended as binder, emulsifier or additive in concretes due to its high amount of LS.

However, a separation step to remove the compounds that can act as fermentation inhibitors, as LS, is needed. Membrane technology allows the separation of sugars and LS from the SSL because of their different size of molecular weight. In the present study, ceramic membranes with different cut-offs (15 kDa, 5 kDa and 1 kDa) were used. 15 kDa membrane offered the best results according to LS concentration in the retentate stream, 5 kDa membrane the highest LS removal in permeate stream, and 1 kDa membrane the minimum sugar losses in the permeate stream.

40|$|The {{development}} of tolerant microorganisms {{is needed for}} the efficient fermentation of inhibitory lignocellulose hydrolysates. In the current work, the fermentation performance of six selected strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in dilute-acid spruce hydrolysate was compared using two different modes of fermentation; either single pulse addition of hydrolysate to exponentially growing cells or continuous feeding of {{the same amount of}} hydrolysate in a controlled fed-batch fermentation was made. All strains performed better in fed-batch mode than when all hydrolysate was added at once. However, the difference between strain performances varied significantly in the two fermentation modes. Large differences were observed between strains during the fed-batch experiments in the in vitro ability to reduce the furan compounds furfural and 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). A common feature among the strains was the induction of NADPH-coupled reduction of furfural and HMF, with the exception of strain CBS 8066. This strain also performed relatively poorly in both batch and fed-batch fermentations. Strain TMB 3000 [...] previously isolated from spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> fermentation [...] was by far the most efficient strain with respect to specific fermentation rate in both pulse addition and fed-batch mode. This strain was the only strain showing a significant constitutive NADH-coupled in vitro reduction of HMF. The ability to induce NADPH-coupled reduction together with the level of the apparently constitutive NADH-coupled reduction appeared to be key factors for selecting a suitable strain for fed-batch conversion of lignocellulose hydrolysate...|$|E

The main sugar monomer contained in the medium was xylose (72. 6 %) with galactose (12. 2 %), glucose (10. 9 %), mannose (4. 2 %) and arabinose (0. 1 %) making up the remaining sugar content. The growth inhibition caused by metabolic products (succinic, lactic, acetic, formic and mixed acids) and initial mixed sugar concentration was determined. The highest obtained succinic acid yield, final concentration and productivity in fermentations carried out in Duran bottles were 0. 76 g/g, 26. 0 g/L and 0. 66 g/L/h for B. succiniciproducens and 0. 69 g/g, 27. 4 g/L and 0. 60 g/L/h for A. succinogenes, respectively (the units in yield calculations are referred to grams of succinic acid produced per gram of total sugars consumed). The kinetic parameters for both strains were estimated from experimental results. The obtained R 2 values for the fitted models were 0. 96 for A. succinogenes and 0. 94 for B. succiniciproducens. A sensitivity analysis on the obtained parameters showed that the maximum specific growth rates (μmax) and the growth associated substrate consumption parameters (γ) are the most influential model parameters for both microorganisms. The model was validated by fermentations conducted in lab-scale bioreactors showing good agreement between experimental data and model simulations...|$|E
40|$|Low-molecular weight {{aliphatic}} acids, furaldehydes and a {{broad range}} of different aromatic compounds are known to inhibit the fermentation of lignocellulose hydrolysates by yeasts. In this work, a cocktail of different lignocellulose-derived inhibitors was used to compare the inhibitor resistance of eleven different industrial and laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and two Zygosaccharomyces strains. The inhibitor cocktail was composed of two aliphatic acids, formic and acetic acid, two furaldehydes, furfural and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and two aromatic compounds, cinnamic acid and coniferyl aldehyde. Fermentations were performed under oxygen-limited conditions and with different levels (100, 75, 50, 25 and 0 %) of the inhibitor cocktail present. The ethanol yield on initial glucose, the volumetric and specific ethanol productivity, the biomass yield and the glucose consumption rates were used as criteria for the performance of the strains. The results revealed major differences in inhibitor resistance between yeast strains within the same species. The ethanol yield of the S. cerevisiae strain that was least affected decreased only with 10 % at an inhibitor cocktail concentration of 100 %, while the decrease in ethanol yield for the most sensitive S. cerevisiae strain was more than 50 % already at an inhibitor cocktail concentration of 25 %. Ethanol formation was generally less affected than growth and ethanol yield less than ethanol productivity. The two most resistant strains were an S. cerevisiae strain isolated from a spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> plant and one of the laboratory S. cerevisiae strains. Additional fermentations with either HMF or coniferyl aldehyde revealed that the degree of resistance of different yeast strains was highly dependent on the inhibitor used. A mutant strain of S. cerevisiae displaying enhanced resistance against coniferyl aldehyde compared with the parental strains was identified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Flocculation {{is often}} {{utilised}} as means {{of separation of}} yeast cells from the product in alcoholic beverage production. Brewery type strains generally start to flocculate {{towards the end of}} the fermentation process, when sugars in the wort are depleted. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, flocculation is governed by the FLO gene family, with FLO 1 generally being the main contributor to strong, Flo 1 phenotype, flocculation. S. cerevisiae CCUG 53310, isolated from a spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> plant, has high tolerance to fermentation inhibitors typically present in lignocellulose hydrolysates (Westman et al. 2012). Furthermore, CCUG 53310 flocculates constitutively with a Flo 1 phenotype that is only marginally affected by the presence of high concentrations of mannose (see figure: circles). Using primers designed for FLO 1, we isolated a flocculin gene from the genome of CCUG 53310. However, constitutive expression of the gene in the otherwise non-flocculating S. cerevisiae CEN. PK 113 - 7 D, resulted in a strain with NewFlo phenotype flocculation, being inhibited by various sugars (see figure: squares, triangles, diamonds and stars). Nonetheless, the protein was phylogenetically closely related to Flo 1 p and by inverse PCR we could also show that the gene is a paralog of FLO 1. Homology modelling of the N-terminal part of the protein structure revealed high structural similarities to the reported structure of the Flo 5 p N-terminal domain. Closer examination revealed differences in certain positions that have been reported to be important for carbohydrate binding by flocculins. Not previously reported, but of special interest due to its position in a loop flanking the carbohydrate binding site, was a glutamate residue that in the corresponding position in Flo 1, 5 and 9 p is a glycine. We hypothesise that this glutamate residue contributes to the observed NewFlo phenotype flocculation...|$|E
40|$|Progressive {{depletion}} {{of oil and}} conventional fossil fuels, an increased energy demand and an increased struggle for national energy security {{has led to the}} development of alternative biobased fuels, bioethanol being one of them. Bioethanol can be made from many different raw materials, and based upon this are classified as 1 st generation and 2 nd generation. This research work dealt with 2 nd generation bioethanol using lignocellulosics as raw material. Lignocellulosic material is an abundant, non-edible raw material that can be converted to ethanol using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Due to the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosics, it is a harsh substrate to ferment. Despite this, bacterial contaminations do occur. This research work aimed to identify potential methods to combat bacterial contamination in industrial fermentations and to identify physiological reactions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon fermentation of lignocellulosic material. The raw material used was spruce processed in a commercial biorefinery and a demonstration plant; spent sulphite liquor; and high-gravity dilute-acid spruce hydrolysate, respectively. Two potential methods to combat bacterial contaminations were identified. The cultivation procedure of a pitching agent was proven to influence bacterial concentration and is suggested as a potential antimicrobial activity. Treatment with sodium chloride and ethanol also turned out to selectively support the viability of yeast and reduce the number of bacterial cells. As lignocellulosics are rich in metabolic inhibitors, additional antimicrobial activities may be deleterious for the ethanol production potential of the yeast. By comparing physiological effects and the level of energy of two strains of S. cerevisiae, in the two substrates mentioned above, it was found that a commercially-available strain developed for industrial fuel ethanol production performed poorly in fermentations of spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> while a strain originally harvested from a spent sulphite liquor-based fermentation performed well both short-term and long-term. Using high-gravity dilute-acid spruce hydrolysate changed the scenario, demonstrating the importance of strain selection...|$|E

They are easily separated using sedimentation and can thus be recycled to the bioreactors. Some of these strains are also better than non-flocculating strains at tolerating the possible inhibitors in the cultivation media, such as furan aldehydes, organic acids and phenolic compounds.

It has been shown that this strain can successfully ferment lignocellulosic hydrolyzates, where freely suspended reference strains failed to assimilate any sugar. In order to understand and get the possibility to improve the fermentation, a phenotypic and physiological characterization of the yeast strain has been performed. The effect of different inhibitor classes present in hydrolyzate as well as of complete hydrolyzate, on the macromolecular composition of the yeast has been investigated. Different responses {{can be seen from the}} different inhibitor classes, providing evidence for differences in metabolism between yeast cells grown in the different media. The phenotypical studies have shown that the strain, that is constitutively flocculating, belongs to the Flo 1 phenotype, meaning that its flocculation is inhibited only by mannose. It has also been shown that the flocculation is dependent on cell wall proteins, and Ca 2 +, suggesting calcium ion dependent proteins binding to carbohydrates in neighboring cells. The flocculating cells also exhibit a significantly higher hydrophobicity than the non-flocculating reference strain; this is a factor that might also contribute to the flocculation...|$|E
40|$|Spent <b>Sulphite</b> <b>Liquor</b> (SSL) derived {{mainly from}} hardwoods, {{was used as}} {{enrichment}} to isolate microorganisms able to utilize the liquor for SCP production. Among the seven types of yeasts and ten types of fungi isolated, two strains of Candida krusei, two strains of Candida rugosa and an unidentified fungus (F- 20) were characterized further. Optimal conditions of biomass production were obtained (pH 6. 0, 28 (DEGREES) C, SSL diluted with water 1 : 1, addition of 0. 2 % NaH(, 2) PO(, 4)). As a result of optimization, efficiencies of conversion ranged from 25 % for C. krusei, to 44 % for C. rugosa. The yeast species grown in mixed cultures increased the biomass production to 52. 8 %. Intraspecific hybridization by protoplast fusion of auxotrophic mutants of C. rugosa produced fused variants able to increase biomass production to efficiencies of conversion up to 55. 9 %. The cells of the fused variants were larger {{than those of the}} parental types, resulting in faster sedimentation during centrifugation. The regeneration of protoplasts from C. rugosa was affected by the length of incubation in the protoplasting solution. Optimal regeneration was found after 30 min of incubation. Mannitol was shown to be a better osmotic stabilizer than sorbitol for the regeneration of protoplasts from C. rugosa in MMA supplemented with amino acids. The protein content of C. krusei, C. rugosa and its fused variants and the fungus F- 20 was 44 - 55 %; carbohydrate content, 15. 7 - 21. 5 %; nucleic acid, 3. 6 - 5. 8 %; and lipid, 0. 8 - 3. 8 %. A good amino acid profile was obtained with one of the fused variants, except for the low content of methionine.

It has been shown that this strain can successfully ferment lignocellulosic hydrolyzates, where the freely suspended reference strain, CBS 8066, failed to assimilate any sugar. However, upon encapsulation in Ca-alginate capsules, the strain CBS 8066 was able to successfully withstand the effect of the inhibitors and ferment lignocellulosic hydrolyzate. 1 There are similarities between yeast cells living in large flocs and yeast living inside a capsule, such as a high local cell concentration. It is hypothesized that this greatly enhanced local biomass concentration strongly contributes to this increased tolerance, since more cells will be able to survive. That high biomass leads to a greater number of living cells have also been known for a long time. 2 Further it is thought that the cells {{on the outside of the}} floc, as well as in the outer layer inside the capsule, will convert most of the inhibitors and partly die, protecting the inner lying cells. The effect of different inhibitor classes, furan aldehydes, organic acids and phenolic compounds, present in the hydrolyzate on the flocculating strain as well as the freely suspended strain was also investigated, finding that the flocculating strain was indeed a lot better at withstanding the effect of furan aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Interestingly though, the CBS 8066 strain could tolerate the presence of phenolic compounds in the growth medium significantly better. This shows that higher biomass cannot help against all inhibitors, but there are also other underlying reasons, i. e. differences in the strains, yet to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{production of}} ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass requires {{the combination of}} efficient hydrolysis and complete fermentation of all the monomeric sugars present in the raw material. The present work was aimed at tackling {{some of the major}} challenges that will be encountered in commercial-scale ethanol production using Baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the preferred microorganism for the fermentation step. During biomass pretreatment, several inhibitory compounds are released, including weak acids, furaldehydes and phenolics. The presence of these compounds in the hydrolysate reduces the ethanol yield and productivity, prolongs the lag phase, and reduces the growth rate of the yeast during fermentation. S. cerevisiae is naturally unable to utilise the pentose sugars xylose and arabinose. Evolutionary engineering was used to improve the conversion of these pentoses to ethanol in a recombinant industrial strain of S. cerevisiae expressing heterologous genes for the xylose and arabinose utilisation pathways. The evolved strain showed a higher rate of consumption of xylose and arabinose under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, which was attributed to an increase in the transport of pentoses and the activities of xylose converting enzymes. The introduction of a short-adaptation process enabled aerobic growth at low pH in the presence of inhibitory levels of acetic acid and led to a significant reduction in the fermentation time under anaerobic conditions. In parallel, the possibility of using indigenous yeasts present in the spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) ethanol plant as a source of S. cerevisiae strains with a naturally acquired tolerance to inhibitory compounds was also investigated. The isolated strain, TMB 3720, exhibited a higher ethanol yield and production rate than the commercial baker’s yeast strain, regularly used as inoculum. It was hypothesised that the tolerance of this strain was related to its flocculation behaviour and its high capacity to reduce furaldehyde inhibitors. As ethanol plants are run under non-sterile conditions, S. cerevisiae must compete with other microorganisms for sugar utilisation. Therefore, competition experiments were performed with the contaminant yeast Dekkera bruxellensis and the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus pentosus isolated from the SSL ethanol plant. Glucose limitation, achieved by sparging a mixture of nitrogen and air (~ 5 % oxygen) through the system, was identified as a parameter enabling D. bruxellensis to outcompete S. cerevisiae, probably due to the higher nutrient affinity of D. bruxellensis under these conditions. In parallel, reducing the pH was also found to be a possible means of reducing the levels of lactate produced by the L. pentosus strain...|$|E
40|$|Zygomycetes is a {{class of}} fungi living {{worldwide}} as saprobes, as part of mycorrhizae, and as parasites. Humans have used some zygomycetes for centuries {{in the production of}} traditional foods, e. g. Indonesian tempe. In the present thesis, the experimental focus was on two zygomycetes strains, Mucor indicus CCUG 22424 and Rhizopus sp. IT. One of the distinguishing features of M. indicus is its dimorphism. The different cell forms were influenced by the culturing conditions. After inoculation, when the initial spore concentration was high (6 - 8 × 106 spores/ml), yeast-like growth dominated under anaerobic conditions. With a smaller inoculum, yielding 1 - 2 × 105 spores/ml, and access to oxygen, filamentous forms dominated. Only negligible differences in ethanol yield (390 - 420 mg/g hexoses), productivity (3 - 5 g/l/h), and inhibitor tolerance were observed. Differential expressions of probably four genes were observed between the yeast-like and filamentous growth forms. Lignocelluloses are a suitable substrate for cultivating zygomycetes, as they occur in abundance, particularly since zygomycetes, unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can utilise pentoses. Lignocelluloses require pretreatment to achieve efficient hydrolysis of the cellulose. N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) was tested for pretreatment of spruce and birch. Reducing wood chip size and/or prolonged pretreatment, promoted hydrolysis yield. Best yields were achieved from < 2 mm chips and 5 h pretreatment. The hydrolysate was used for fermentation with M. indicus, resulting in 195 and 175 mg ethanol/g wood, and 103 and 86 mg fungal biomass/g wood, from spruce and birch respectively. Orange peel is another potential substrate. However, the hydrolysate contained 0. 6 % (v/v) D-limonene, ten times higher than the concentration inhibiting S. cerevisiae. M. indicus was more resistant and successfully fermented the hydrolysate, producing 400 mg ethanol/g hexoses and 75 mg fungal biomass/g sugars. Both M. indicus and Rhizopus sp. grew in 1. 0 % and 2. 0 % D-limonene, although the latter was unable to grow in the hydrolysate. A third substrate was also used, spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL), which is a by-product from sulphite paper pulp mills. The SSL was diluted to 50 % and used for airlift cultivations of Rhizopus sp. In 1. 0 vvm aeration, up to 340 mg biomass/g sugars was produced. Prolonged cultivations generally decreased the protein (from 500 to 300 mg/g) and lipid (from 70 to 20 mg/g) contents. In contrast, the cell wall fraction, measured as alkali-insoluble material (AIM), increased (160 - 280 mg/g), as did the glucosamine (GlcN) content (220 - 320 mg GlcN/g AIM). The produced fungal biomass could serve as animal feed, e. g. for fish.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to further {{understand}} the fouling and cleaning mechanisms of synthetic membranes used to filter an industrially relevant feed. The main focus {{of this study was to}} understand the fouling layer properties during pressure driven filtration. A relatively new technique known as Fluid Dynamic Gauging (FDG) was applied to examine the fouling layer thickness. This work comprised of four main themes with overlapping objectives: (i) the optimisation of Spent <b>Sulphite</b> <b>Liquor</b> fouling and cleaning conditions, (ii) the optimisation of molasses fouling and cleaning conditions, (iii) the investigation of the effect of a simple pre-treatment upon the membrane separation performance, and (iv) the application of the FDG in the study of polymeric membranes. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in fouling and cleaning of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes used to filter molasses and SSL has been attained. The variables affecting permeate flux and quality were optimised and mechanistic information concerning the synergistic effects between fouling and cleaning was gathered. The application of a simple NaOH pre-treatment was found to affect both the type of foulant species attaching to the membrane surface, and resulted in an altered separation and cleaning performance. Zeta potential measurements, FTIR and AFM demonstrated that both in-pore and surface fouling was present. The data collected indicated that for both membranes evaluated, different fouling species were found to have attached, depending upon the pre-treatment protocol used. These findings are significant, as they offer support to the recommendations made by some polymeric membrane manufacturers that conditioning protocols should include a NaOH step. However, in the SSL system examined, the effect of NaOH pre-treatment resulted in an improvement in the subsequent performance only over the first two or three complete filtration cycles. It is therefore necessary to study membrane systems over multiple fouling and cleaning cycles before a recommendation can be made. An improved understanding of the interaction between the surface chemistry and surface physics during membrane filtration of complex food based material will benefit both membrane manufactures and food industry based users. The technique of Fluid Dynamic Gauging was incorporated into an existing system and validated to monitor the development of cake layers over time. The FDG was also used to optimise conditions and track the thickness of the cake layer during multiple fouling cycles and its removal rate during cleaning, as an aid to understanding removal mechanisms. It has been shown that operating conditions have to be carefully chosen to minimise the effect of membrane fouling. The results show that FDG is a versatile and powerful technique for characterising the dynamics and mechanical behaviour of fouling layers on membrane surfaces. A particular advantage of the FDG technique is its ability to determine the thickness of fouling layers where other techniques would find difficulty. For example, the layers formed in this study were opaque, and consequently the determination of the development of deposit thickness with time would have been very challenging using conventional optical microscopy techniques.

40|$|Biogas, {{a mixture}} of methane and carbon dioxide, is {{produced}} by microorganisms upon degradation of organic matter in an anaerobic environment. It has been realised that by utilising anaerobic processes the organic pollutants in wastewater and organic solid waste from anthropogenic sources can be converted into a renewable source of energy. However, to fulfil the potential of anaerobic digestion in a sustainable society several measures must be taken. Anaerobic digestion {{has the potential to}} be applicable to waste and effluents which are currently not being utilized provided that suitable reactor concepts are developed. For example, within the pulp and paper industry, there is a potential to treat more inhibitory and less degradable effluents to realise energyproduction provided that suitable methods and processes can be found. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASBs) have been used for anaerobic treatment of effluents from the pulp and paper industry. Treatment of {{a mixture of}} sulphite evaporator condensate (SEC) and caustic extraction liquor (CEL) in a UASB compared favourably to treatment in a full-scale contact-process (CP). The UASB reactor showed a higher reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) (74 - 84 %) at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 2. 3 kg COD (m 3 d) - 1 than the CP (65 % COD reduction, 1. 4 kg COD (m 3 d) - 1). However, the CP effluent contained lower concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) than the UASB effluent. Upon treatment of spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) in a UASB the maximum influent COD concentration and OLR leading to stable reactor performance were 78 g COD l- 1 and 51 g COD (l d) - 1, respectively. In batch reactors the biogas production was totally inhibited at COD concentrations above 40 g COD l- 1. This adaptation of a granular community to increased levels of toxic substrate illustrates one advantage of the granular process when dealing with toxic effluents. Low-rate systems commonly applied today are normally loaded far below their capacity to prevent overloading and instability. The utilization of these systems can be increased by applying new monitoring systems that provide information for control so that the loading of the process can be optimised without jeopardizing the stability. A spectrophotometric method for monitoring alkalinity in anaerobic digestion processes was developed. The method is based on measurements of pH-indicators in mixtures of an acid and samples from the reactor system. Good correlation was found between the traditional titration method for alkalinity measurement and the spectrophotometric method when measuring samples from an anaerobic digester. An on-line monitoring system based on the method was designed and applied to a UASB. A pulse organic overload to the reactor lead to a decrease in the partial alkalinity, which was registered by both methods. The response of the monitoring system correlated well with the traditional titration method. A fully automated device based on the spectrophotometric method was used for on-line monitoring a full-scale anaerobic digester operating on a mixture of municipal wastewater sludge and potato-processing waste. The system was found to respond to an overload situation in which the bicarbonate concentrations in the reactor decreased. Such an on-line monitoring system is of value with regards to increasing the efficiency of certain anaerobic processes...|$|E
