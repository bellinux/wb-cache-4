5|$|The Capitol Limited {{received}} streamlined heavyweight {{sleeping and}} dining cars in 1938. A typical consist included the following: baggage-dormitory, 8-section 1-drawing room 1-compartment <b>sleeping</b> <b>car,</b> dining car, {{three to four}} 8-section 5-double bedroom sleeping cars, 14-section <b>sleeping</b> <b>car,</b> two 12-section 1-drawing room sleeping cars, and a sleeper-buffet-lounge with a drawing room and three compartments. In 1941 these cars were augmented by several lightweight 10-roomette 5-bedroom sleeping cars.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Amtrak {{announced}} {{several possible}} {{changes to the}} Mountaineer, including a later schedule through West Virginia and combined operation west of Cincinnati with both the Riley and an unnamed (and never implemented) WashingtonDenver train. Under this plan the Mountaineer would receive new Amfleet equipment but lose its <b>sleeping</b> <b>car.</b> The schedule changes never took place, but Amtrak was forced to re-equip the Mountaineer after a harsh winter damaged many of its old steam-heated coaches and locomotives. The Mountaineer was one of eight routes suspended in January 1977, and it returned with an all-Amfleet consist, minus the <b>sleeping</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mountaineers typical consist (at first) {{was five}} cars: a baggage-dormitory, two coaches, a grill diner and a 10-roomette 6-bedroom (10-6) <b>sleeping</b> <b>car.</b> When available, {{one of the}} coaches was a dome car. Starting in January 1977 Amtrak ran a consist of three new Amfleet cars, {{typically}} two coaches and a cafe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> {{acquired}} by Auto-Train included six ex-Santa Fe Regal series <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> (4 bedrooms, 4 compartments, 2 drawing rooms), five ex-Union Pacific Ocean series <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> (5 bedrooms, 2 compartment, 2 drawing rooms), and three ex-Seaboard sleepers (5 bedrooms, 1 compartment, 4 sections, 4 roomettes).|$|R
50|$|The train ran {{overnight}} with opulent Mann Boudoir <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars.</b> From 1907, new E type {{side corridor}} sitting and <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> of Victorian Railways design were introduced. More cars of these designs were added until 1923, and in 1928 two all-steel <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> and a dining car were imported from Pullman Company in the United States, these being the heaviest carriages ever used in Australia.|$|R
50|$|The CFR {{operates}} {{several different}} types of <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> in EuroNight and other night trains. In international trains, the <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> built by Deutsche Waggonbau AG around 1990 are preferred as these have a good level of comfort and showers. They are undergoing serious refurbishment to comply with international standards. In addition, several older types of <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> (WLAB33, T2S) were recently bought second hand from Germany; these are being modernized and mostly used inside Romania and to the neighbour countries (as shown in the picture). They have replaced the archaic OSShD-B/Y <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> previously used in these services.|$|R
5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, a troop sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve {{as something of a}} mobile barracks (essentially, a <b>sleeping</b> <b>car)</b> for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency.|$|E
5|$|An {{economic}} {{boom in the}} south {{following the end of}} World War I greatly increased Southern's revenues. Harrison {{spent a good deal of}} time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a <b>sleeping</b> <b>car</b> and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.|$|E
5|$|Led by incorporator Norma Elizabeth Boyd, the {{sorority}} {{created the}} National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights (NPC) in 1938, later renamed the National Non-Partisan Council on Public Affairs. It {{was the first}} full-time congressional lobby for minority group civil rights. Throughout the organization's life, the Non-Partisan Council worked with the NAACP, National Urban League, The United Office and Professional Workers of America, The National Association of Graduate Nurses, the American Federation of Churches, the Colored Women's Club, the Brotherhood of <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Car</b> Porters and Auxiliary, and the New York Voter's League. The NPC was dissolved on July 15, 1948, by twelfth Supreme Basileus Edna Over Gray-Campbell. A year later, Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to apply for life membership in the NAACP.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Car</b> Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sleeping</b> <b>car</b> or sleeper is a {{railroad}} passenger car that can accommodate passengers in beds, primarily to make nighttime travel more restful. The first such cars saw sporadic use on American railroads in the 1830s {{and could be}} configured for coach seating during the day. The pioneer of this new mode of traveling transcontinental was the Cumberland Valley Railroad which introduced service of the first <b>sleeping</b> <b>car</b> {{in the spring of}} 1939. The <b>sleeping</b> <b>car</b> did not become commercially practical until 1857 when George Pullman invented the Pullman <b>sleeping</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

50|$|Richard Edmondson {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} The Queen of Scots from traffic, remove the steel-bodied <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Cars</b> and store the three vintage vehicles {{at a private}} site in Sussex. The <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Cars</b> travelled far and wide, being moved around the various heritage railways, mostly to provide staff sleeping accommodation. Three years would pass before the Train would re-enter traffic but this time, minus the <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Cars,</b> it's intended use now being to offer single day charters to bespoke intineraries as dictated by the customer.|$|R

5000|$|Streamlined, all-room <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> {{appeared}} on the Pioneer Limited in 1948. With streamlining, the Milwaukee Road considered changing {{the name of the}} train to Pioneer Hiawatha but deferred to passenger preferences to retain the older name. The Pioneer Limited was unusual in that its streamlined cars were home built in the Milwaukee Road's Milwaukee Menomonee valley shops. For various periods in the Pioneer Limiteds career the train employed Milwaukee Road <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> and attendants rather than Pullman operated cars. After 1927 the train's <b>sleeping</b> <b>cars</b> were operated by the Pullman Company ...|$|R

The government sought {{to separate the}} company's <b>sleeping</b> <b>car</b> operations from its manufacturing activities. In 1944, the court concurred, ordering Pullman Incorporated to divest itself of either the Pullman Company (operating) or the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company (manufacturing).
