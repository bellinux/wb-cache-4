5000|$|Magnetization {{transfer}} (MT), in NMR and MRI, {{refers to}} the transfer of nuclear spin polarization and/or spin coherence from one population of nuclei to another population of nuclei, and to techniques that make use of these phenomena. There is some ambiguity regarding the precise definition of magnetization transfer, however the general definition given above encompasses all more specific notions. NMR active nuclei, those with non-zero spin, can be energetically coupled to one another under certain conditions. The mechanisms of nuclear-spin energy-coupling have been extensively characterized and are described in the following articles: Angular momentum coupling, Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, J-coupling, Residual dipolar coupling, Nuclear Overhauser effect, <b>Spin-spin</b> <b>relaxation,</b> and Spin saturation transfer. Alternatively, some nuclei in a chemical system are labile and exchange between non-equivalent environments.

50|$|The <b>spin-spin</b> <b>relaxation</b> time, {{also called}} the {{transverse}} relaxation time, is related to homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. An inhomogeneous broadening results {{from the fact that}} the different spins experience local magnetic field inhomogeneities (different surroundings) creating a large number of spin packets characterized by a distribution of Δω. As the net magnetization vector precesses, some spin packets slow down due to lower fields and others speed up due to higher fields leading to a fanning out of the magnetization vector that results in the decay of the EPR signal. The other packets contribute to the transverse magnetization decay due to the homogeneous broadening. In this process all the spin in one spin packet experience the same magnetic field and interact with each other that can lead to mutual and random spin flip-flops. These fluctuations contribute to a faster fanning out of the magnetization vector.|$|E
50|$|So far the {{magnetization}} was tipped {{into the}} xy-plane and it remained {{there with the}} same magnitude. However, in reality the electron spins interact with their surroundings and the magnetization in the xy-plane will decay and eventually return to alignment with the z-axis. This relaxation process is described by the spin-lattice relaxation time T1, which is a characteristic time needed by the magnetization {{to return to the}} z-axis, and by the <b>spin-spin</b> <b>relaxation</b> time T2, which describes the vanishing time of the magnetization in the xy-plane. The spin-lattice relaxation results from the urge of the system to return to thermal equilibrium after it has been perturbed by the B1 pulse. Return of the magnetization parallel to B0 is achieved through interactions with the surroundings, that is spin-lattice relaxation. The corresponding relaxation time needs to be considered when extracting a signal from noise, where the experiment needs to be repeated several times, as quickly as possible. In order to repeat the experiment, one needs to wait until the magnetization along the z-axis has recovered, because if there is no magnetization in z direction, then there is nothing to tip into the xy-plane to create a significant signal.|$|E
