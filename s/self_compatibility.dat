Plantios sucessivos de crotalária comum foram efetuados em área altamente infestada pelo patógeno. Em cada ciclo foram selecionadas plantas que chegaram a produzir sementes, sendo estas plantadas no ano seguinte. Após quatro anos, o {{material}} resultante foi cruzado com linhagens autocompatíveis, visando reunir o caráter resistência à condição de autocompatibilidade. A geração F 1 desse cruzamento foi retrocruzada com pais resistentes e com pais autocompatíveis. As populações assim obtidas foram levadas até a geração F 4, sendo que em cada geração eram feitas inoculações e seleção de plantas resistentes e autocompatíveis. A geração F 5, com 1. 030 plantas, foi selecionada para produção e qualidade de sementes, resultando em 111 plantas com as características desejadas. As linhagens dessas plantas, após inoculação com isolados do fungo, mostraram alta porcentagem de plantas autocompatíveis, com resistência à murcha.

30|$|Reproduction is {{the life}} process which ensures the perpetuation of life and genetic {{diversity}} is mainly generated through recombination processes in sexual reproduction, which is, hence, a process of fundamental importance for population and species biology (Maynard 1978). For successful cultivation and conservation of plants a detailed knowledge of their reproductive biology is required (Moza and Bhatnagar 2007). Reproductive biology mainly focuses on flowering phenology, floral biology, pollen-pollinator interaction, breeding systems and gene flow through pollen and seeds. The task of plant phenology is to observe and record the periodically recurring growth stages and to study the regularities and dependency of the yearly cycles of development on environmental conditions. In plants phenological events such as bud-burst, leaf-expansion, leaf-abscission, flowering, fertilisation, seed set, fruiting, seed dispersal and seed germination all take place in due season. Plant breeding systems extent from full <b>self</b> <b>compatibility</b> to full self incompatibility. Self incompatibility {{reduces the risk of}} inbreeding depression by limiting the number of compatible mating pairs, while <b>self</b> <b>compatibility</b> eliminates mate limitation by allowing each individual to self-fertilize. In some plants the fruit set in open pollinated flowers will be very low. This phenomenon is usually observed in hermaphroditic plants (Sutherland, 1986) which exhibit self-incompatibility. Low fruit set in nature may be largely due to a high incidence of self-pollination and a high level of selfincompatibility, but several other causes, such as resource limitation and position of fruit within inflorescences, may also be involved (Bawa and Webb, 1984).|$|E

40|$|This paper studies dynamic, {{endogenous}} institutional change. We {{introduce the}} class of dynamic political games (DPGs), dynamic games in which future political aggregation rules are decided under current ones, and the resulting institutional choices do not affect payoffs or technology directly. A companion paper (Lagunoff (2005 b)) establishes existence of Markov Perfect equilibria of dynamic political games. The present paper examines issues of stability and reform when such equilibria exist. Which environments tend toward institutional stability? Which tend toward reform? We show that when political rules are dynamically consistent and private sector decisions areinessential,reform never occurs: all political rules are stable. Roughly,private sector decisions are inessential if any feasible ``social' continuation payoff can achieved by public sector decisions alone. More generally, we identify sufficient conditions for stability and reform in terms of recursive self selection and recursive <b>self</b> denial,incentive <b>compatibility</b> concepts that treat the rules themselves as ``players' who can strategically delegate future policy-making authority to different institutional types. These ideas are illustrated in an example of dynamic public goods provision.

Even if society is not {{directly}} interested in children, intervention may still be justified for re-distributive reasons.

40|$|Patterns of {{reproductive}} isolation between species may {{provide insight into}} the mechanisms and evolution of barriers to interspecific gene exchange. We used data from published interspecific hybridization experiments from 14 genera of angiosperms in order to test for the presence of asymmetrical barriers to gene exchange. Reproductive isolation was examined at three life-history stages: the ability of interspecific crosses to produce seeds, the viability of F 1 hybrids, and the fertility of F 1 hybrids. Statistically significant asymmetries in the strength {{of reproductive}} isolation between species were detected in all genera and at each of the three life-history stages. Asymmetries in seed production may be caused by a variety of mechanisms including differences in stigma/style lengths, <b>self</b> <b>compatibility</b> and differential fruit abortion. Asymmetries in post-zygotic isolation are probably caused by nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Asymmetrical reproductive isolation between plant taxa may have important implications for the dynamics of hybrid zones, the direction of genetic introgression and the probability of reinforcement...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves [156]- 161. xiii, 161 l illus., tablesExperiments were {{conducted}} to study floral biology, cross compatibility, heterosis, cytogenetics and inheritance of several morphological characteristics among nine Carica species: Carica cauliflora, C. goudotiana, C. monoica, C. parviflora, C. pennata, C. pubescens, C. papaya, C. horovitziana and Index number 203. All species studied except C. parviflora showed maximum anthesis between 4 and 10 p. m. C. parviflora showed maximum anthesis between 8 to 10 a. m. The hybrid, C. parviflora (8 - 10 a. m. anthesis time) x C. goudotiana (4 - 6 p. m.) showed maximum anthesis between 10 to 12 noon. Pollen was successfully germinated at six pH levels ranging from 4. 5 - 9. 5. A gradual rise in percentage germination of pollen from pH 4. 5 - pH 7. 5 followed by a sharp drop at pH 8. 5 and pH 9. 5 was observed in all the species. Results also showed significant differences between species. Pollen of C. goudotiana and C. papaya showed lower germination percentages than pollen of other species. All species were <b>self</b> compatible. Cross <b>compatibility</b> studies showed crosses that were fertile, crosses which set fruit but produced empty seeds, crosses that set parthenocarpic fruits and crosses that failed to set fruit. C. papaya was cross incompatible with all species used in this study. A new hybrid C. parviflora x C. goudotiana was produced. A description of ten hybrids developed in this work was presented. All hybrids were fertile. Heterosis for vegetative growth and productivity was conclusively shown in two crosses. Comparisons were made between the means of hybrids and those of their high parents. Stem color and petiole color were each shown {{to be under the}} control of a single gene pair, red being dominant to green in both cases. Variations in the intensity of red color in stems and petioles were attributed to the possible influence of modifier genes. Monogenic control was established for flower color with purple-blush and white, both dominant to pale yellow flower color. Red ripe skin color of the fruit was dominant to yellow. A cross between plants of red fruit color with those of orange fruit color produced F 1 hybrids with pink colored fruits, indicating lack of dominance between red and orange. Fruit ridges were dominant to wide grooves which in turn were dominant to narrow grooves. Mode of inheritance was monogenic in both cases. Spiny and non-spiny seed coats were simply inherited with dominance lacking. A single-gene difference between succulent fruit pulp and dry pulp with recessiveness for the latter was shown. A dominant monogenic control of profuse branching over sparse branching was observed. Crosses between dioecious and monoecious species using pollen from the latter produced only monoecious F 1 plants. The reciprocal cross produced F 1 plants in an approximate ratio of 1 male: 1 monoecious. Differential suppression of androecium observed in crosses between C. monoica and C. goudotiana requires further investigation. Cytological observations confirmed nine pairs of chromosomes for all species and hybrids investigated. Occasional partial pairing and subsequent precocious anaphasic separation involving one pair of homologues were observed in all species and hybrids studied. Heteromorphism between these two homologues was detected in three species and three hybrids. These findings seem to support the hypothesis that sex chromosomes do exist in these species and hybrids. Chromosome lagging sometimes observed at anaphase I in two of the hybrids was a new phenomenon in the genus. This feature could result in the evolution of aneuploids in the genus. High fertility of hybrids was attributed to regularity of bivalent formation. This is suggestive of close genetic affinity between the parent species. Speculations into the potentials of the wild Carica species were discussed...|$|R

No Brasil, está representada por 101 gêneros e 1010 espécies, distribuídas por diversas formações vegetacionais. Está representada por um grande número de espécies nos sub-bosques das florestas tropicais, exercendo grande influência na estrutura da vegetação. Essas plantas apresentam diversas estratégias reprodutivas, como por exemplo, a distilia, cujo morfos, brevistilos e longistilos, diferem quanto à altura dos órgãos sexuais, caracterizando a hercogamia recíproca. O presente estudo foi desenvolvido no Parque Estadual das Várzeas o Rio Ivinhema (PEVRI) e objetivou estudar florísticamente as espécies de Rubiaceae que ocorrem nessa área, bem como verificar a fenologia reprodutiva, morfologia e biologia floral, sistema reprodutivo, distribuição espacial e relações alométricas de algumas espécies distílicas reconhecidas. As excursões mensais para coleta de {{material}} botânico e observações foram realizadas no período de 09 / 2003 a 10 / 2006. Os espécimes foram determinados com base na bibliografia especializada e confronto com materiais depositados em herbários. Para o estudo a fenologia reprodutiva, morfologia e biologia floral e o sistema reprodutivo foram analisadas oito espécies: Coussarea hydrangeifolia (Benth.) Benth. & Hook., C. platyphylla Müll. Arg., Palicourea croceoides Desv. ex Ham., P. fastigiata Kunth, Psychotria capillacea (Müll. Arg.) Standl., P. carthagenensis Jacq., P. deflexa DC. e P. leiocarpa Cham. & Schltdl. A distribuição espacial e as relações alométricas foram observadas em Coussarea hydrangeifolia e Palicourea croceoides. Foram identificados no PEVRI, 45 espécies reunidas em 24 gêneros. Os gêneros mais representativos foram Psychotria com dez espécies, Palicourea com quatro, Borreria com três, Alibertia, Chomelia, Coccocypselum, Coussarea, Diodela, Galianthe, Guettarda com duas, e os demais gêneros com uma única espécie. Foram apresentadas chaves para identificação dos gêneros e espécies, além de descrições e comentários sobre caracteres importantes para o reconhecimento, bem como, distribuição dos mesmos. A floração das espécies estudadas ocorreu na estação chuvosa, período que coincide com os meses mais quentes do ano. A floração das espécies estudadas foi seqüencial, sem sobreposição nos picos de floração excetos entre as espécies de Coussarea. A frutificação das espécies estudadas ocorreu principalmente na estação chuvosa. Houve diferenças significativas entre as alturas dos estames e do estilete em flores brevistila e longistila, confirmando assim, a hercogamia recíproca entre os morfos florais de cada espécie, além disso, as espécies estudadas apresentaram dimorfismo no comprimento da corola, lobos do estilete e anteras. Das espécies estudadas somente Coussarea hydrangeifolia apresentou populações isopléticas, ou seja, razão equilibrada entre os morfos florais. Os testes de polinização manual realizados nas espécies estudadas demonstram que estas são incompatíveis auto e intramorfos, exceto em Palicourea croceoides, Psychotria cappilacea e P. deflexa nestas espécies todos os cruzamentos realizados resultaram em frutos. P. cappilacea além da compatibilidade auto e intramorfo também apresentou frutos nos testes de agamospermia e autopolinização espontânea. Coussarea hydrangeifolia e Palicourea croceoides apresentaram um padrão agregado de distribuição entre os morfos florais. Os morfos florais não apresentam relações alométricas entre altura e diâmetro características, não sendo possível reconhecer os morfos brevistilos e longistilos a partir dessas relações;;Abstract: The Rubiaceae {{family is}} comprehended by almost 637 genera and 12. 000 species distributed {{mainly in the}} tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In Brazil there are 101 genera and 1. 010 species, distributed in several formations vegetation. It is represented by {{a great number of}} species in the understory of the tropical forests, exercising great influence {{in the structure of the}} vegetation. Those plants present several reproductive strategies, as for instance, the distyly, which morphs of pin and thrum, differ as to the height as sexual organs, that is, there is a reciprocal hercogamy. The present work was developed in Parque Estadual das Várzeas do Rio Ivinhema (PEVRI), and its objective was to study the floristic of the Rubiaceae species occurring in this area and, in additions observe the reproductive phenology, morphology and floral biology, reproductive system, spatial distribution and allometry relationships of some dystylous alreacely known species. The monthly trips for collecting the botanical material and observations were accomplished in the period the 09 / 2003 to 10 / 2006. The specimens were determined based on specialized references and visiting to herbaria. The study of reproductive phenology, morphology and floral biology, reproductive system eight species were analyzed: Coussarea hydrangeifolia (Benth.) Benth. & Hook., C. platyphylla Müll. Arg., Palicourea croceoides Desv. ex Ham., P. fastigiata Kunth, Psychotria capillacea (Müll. Arg.) Standl., P. carthagenensis Jacq., P. deflexa DC. and P. leiocarpa Cham. & Schltdl. The spatial distribution and allometry relationships were observed in Coussarea hydrangeifolia e Palicourea croceoides. In the PEVRI 45 species in 24 genera were identified. The most representative genera were Psychotria with ten species, Palicourea with four species, Borreria with three species, Alibertia, Chomelia, Coccocypselum, Coussarea, Diodela, Galianthe, Guettarda with two species each and the other genera with only one species each. Key for genera end species identification were presented, besides descriptions, illustrations and comments on important features for their recognition and distribution. The flowering of the studied species occurred in the rainy season, which coincides with the warsnest months of the year. The flowering the studied species was seqüencial, without superposition on the flowering peaks. The fruiting of the studied species occurred mainly in the rainy season. There were significant differences among the heights of the stamens and styles in pin and thrum flowers, thus confirming the reciprocal hercogamy among the floral morphs of each species and the species studied showed dimorphism in the length of the corolla, of the style lobes and of the anthers. From the species studied only Coussarea hydrangeifolia presented isoplethic populations, that is, balanced rate among the floral morphs. The tests of manual pollination accomplished in the studied species demonstrate that these are incompatible self and intramoph, except in Palicourea croceoides, Psychotria cappilacea and P. deflexa in these species all of the accomplished crossings resulted in fruits. P. cappilacea besides the <b>compatibility</b> <b>self</b> and intramoph also presented fruits in the agamospermia tests and spontaneous self-pollination. Coussarea hydrangeifolia and Palicourea croceoides presented clumped distribution among the floral morphs.

40|$|Aspects of {{the genetic}} and {{physiological}} barriers to hybridisation have been assessed for the genus Verticordia which contains many species with significant potential for ornamental horticulture. The chromosome numbers of 52 species were analysed using flower buds and root tips. Previously published reports on chromosome numbers were confirmed for 21 species and new numbers reported in a further 31. <b>Self</b> <b>compatibility</b> was present in 20 species and only three species were shown to possess barriers to self pollination. Seed set occurred in two of six interspecific crosses carried out within sections. In 21 wider crosses the degree of pollen tube development was increasingly repressed with taxonomic distance. The chromosome counts also support the reclassification of the genus Verticordia into three subgenera: Chrysoma, Verticordia and Eperephes. Species within each section of a subgenus generally had the same chromosome number. Exceptions occurred in the subgenus Verticordia, sections Verticordia, Intricata and Micrantha. In species {{with one or two}} ovules, the chromosome number was also low (6, 7, 8 or 9) while species with six or more ovules had a higher chromosome number (11 or 22). There was, however, no relationship between chromosome number and chromosome size, nor between chromosome number and any observed feature which might be attributable to polyploidy or allopolyploidy. With the possible exception of V. grandis, which displayed loss of seasonality in flowering, all putative polyploids behaved developmentally as diploids and displayed a high level of male fertility. © 1991, CSIRO...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableThe area {{in which}} the ranges of Nicotiana longiflora and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia overlap {{presents}} an ideal system for studying the interaction and hybridization of a selfing and an outcrossing species. N. longiflora is characterized by long corollas and <b>self</b> <b>compatibility</b> but sets little fruit on its own due to anther stigma separation. N. plumbaginifolia exhibits shorter corollas and self pollinates almost all of it's flowers. A third morph with medium length corollas is found in populations comprised of both species. It seems likely that this morph is a hybrid. In order to better understand how hybridization occurred and the genetic consequences of species interaction, we plan to perform pollen races in which we will allow self, out crossed, and inter-specific pollen to compete on the same style. Pollen competes and is selected through a variety of mechanisms including stigma and/or style clogging, pollen tube germination success and speed of growth, and differential seed abortion. The winners of the races will be determined through paternity tests of the resulting off spring. Using this method allows us to examine the genetic consequences of all the stages of pollen competition. We will test for paternity using molecular markers in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms in restriction enzyme recognition sites (CAPS markers). We used DNA sequences of randomly chosen genetic loci to develop CAPS markers. We found a high degree of variability within our population, however only loci at which an individual is heterozygous are useful, so most of the polymorphisms we found cannot serve as markers. At this point the most promising marker seems to be SNPs in the recognition site for Taq I on the gene for Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase. NSF-REU Program in Biological Sciences & Biochemistr...|$|E
