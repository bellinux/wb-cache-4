5|$|Moore {{was ranked}} {{as the number}} eight high school {{basketball}} <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> in the nation by Scout.com. Rivals.com ranked him as the number seven <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> in the nation, the second best player in Indiana (to Gordon) and the 35th {{best player in the}} nation. Hoopmaster.com ranked him as the 26th best player in the nation, sixth best <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> and second best hoosier. ESPN evaluated him as a point guard and rated him as the 4th best point guard and 20th best player in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Considered a four-star recruit by Scout.com, Roy {{was listed}} as the No. 6 <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> and the No. 36 player {{in the nation in}} 2002.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Kentucky's December 15 matchup against Chattanooga, Pitino {{publicly}} contemplated starting Farmer {{in place}} of Sean Woods at point and either Carlos Toomer or Jody Thompson at <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> instead of Brassow. The day of the game, he announced Farmer would make the second start of his career at <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> alongside Woods at point. Although he tied with Pelphrey for a team-high 17 points, Farmer returned to the bench for the following game against Indiana because Pitino felt he didn't have the size to defend the Hoosiers' bigger guards.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> are {{taller than}} point guards. Height at the {{position}} varies; many bigger <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> also play small forward. <b>Shooting</b> <b>guards</b> should be good ball handlers {{and be able to}} pass reasonably well, though passing is not their main priority. Since good <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> may attract double-teams, they are frequently the team's back-up ball handlers to the point guard and typically get a fair number of assists.|$|R
50|$|As a senior, he {{was ranked}} 40th overall and 12th among <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> by Rivals.com and rated the 55th-top {{prospect}} (16th among <b>shooting</b> <b>guards)</b> by Scout.com. Pocius was also {{named to the}} World Select team for the 2005 Nike Hoops Summit, where he scored a game high 20 points in a 98-106 loss to the USA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shooting</b> <b>guards</b> {{must be able}} {{to score}} in various ways, {{especially}} late in a close game when defenses are tighter. They need to have a good free throw percentage too, to be reliable in close games and to discourage opposing players from fouling. Because of the high level of offensive skills <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> need, they are often a team's primary scoring option, and sometimes the offense is built around them.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} 15 {{games of the}} 2013–14 NBA season, Nelson started at point guard for the Orlando Magic, but on November 29, he missed the game due to injury. Victor Oladipo moved from <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> to point guard, while Moore became the {{starting}} <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> against the San Antonio Spurs. Moore missed some action due to injury with the game against Sacramento on December 21. He returned to the lineup three games later on December 29. On February 18 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Moore had 17 points and 2 blocks, which were season highs. Moore tied his season high of 17 points on 6-for-6 shooting, including 5-for-5 on three point shots on April 9 against the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best in NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> in Jim Paxson and a young <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9points and 7.5rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139games in 5years with the Blazers.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the NBA {{as a free agent}} in 2006, Parker was the Toronto Raptors' starting <b>shooting</b> <b>guard.</b> In his first season with the Raptors, Parker helped the team clinch their first ever division title, first NBA Playoffs berth in five years, and best regular season record in franchise history. He helped the Raptors reach the playoffs again in the 2007–08 season, before becoming a free agent in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Other key {{contributors}} for the East included, <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> Louis Williams and Eric Devendorf (Syracuse), who recorded 14 and 13 points respectively.|$|R
50|$|On July 13, 2013, Mayo {{signed a}} three-year, $24 million {{contract}} with the Milwaukee Bucks. The signing was essentially a trade of starting <b>shooting</b> <b>guards,</b> as Monta Ellis departed Milwaukee to sign with Dallas.|$|R
50|$|Harris {{was rated}} {{among the top}} players in the nation by ESPNU100 (No. 11), Scout.com (No. 16) and Rivals.com (No. 25). He was also ranked among the nation's top <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> by ESPNU100 (No. 2), Scout.com (No. 4) and Rivals.com (No. 7).|$|R
5|$|Evan Marcel Turner (born October 27, 1988) is an American {{professional}} basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was drafted second overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2010 NBA draft and played for them {{until he was}} traded in February 2014 to the Indiana Pacers. Turner plays the point guard, <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> and small forward positions.|$|E
5|$|Ginóbili is a 6ft 6 in (1.98 m), 205lb (93kg) left-handed <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> who {{has been}} {{deployed}} either as a sixth man or starter for the Spurs. He has {{established himself as a}} reliable and versatile back court presence, and was a relatively late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period when entering the NBA as a teenager was very common.|$|E
5|$|Johnson further {{established}} himself as a quality player in Phoenix. In his three years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 14–20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in two All-Star Games, was voted into three consecutive All-Defensive First Teams and earned his only All-NBA First Team appearance. In this period Johnson, like in Seattle, played <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> and became the main scorer on the team, as opposed to being the second or third option as a Sonic.|$|E
50|$|Cooper {{attended}} Russell County High School {{where he}} averaged 31.3 points and 10.4 rebounds as a senior. When he graduated, {{he was considered}} a three-star recruit by all three major recruiting services, being rated by Rivals.com No. 35 among <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> and No. 117 overall nationally.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{the five}} basic positions, some teams use {{non-standard}} or hybrid positions, such as point forward, {{a hybrid of}} a small forward and a point guard; swingman (hybrid small forward-shooting guard); the big (hybrid power forward-center); and the stretch four, a power forward with the shooting range of typical <b>shooting</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jones {{played all}} of his 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association NBA with the Celtics. He {{was known as a}} clutch scorer, with more than 15,000 points in his career. He participated in five All-Star Games, and is usually {{recognized}} as one of the best <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> of his generation.|$|R
5|$|Parker {{played a}} variety of roles in the {{following}} season. First, Kapono was temporarily moved to the starting <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> spot after the Raptors fired head coach Sam Mitchell. When Calderón was injured, Parker had to fill in {{as the starting point}} guard. After struggling in December, he hit good form in January and helped the Raptors inch towards a better record after the team went 16–28. Although Parker eventually regained his starting spot, Toronto fell further behind the playoff race as a result of changing rosters and inconsistent performances, dropping to 21–34 just before the All-Star break. The shooting guard's offensive output was also erratic throughout the season, and the Raptors all but fell out of the playoffs picture by March. The Raptors eventually concluded the regular season with only 33 wins, with Parker suffering a significant drop in his numbers (shooting percentage and points per game). His future remained uncertain as he was due to become a free agent, but he expressed a desire to return to Toronto for the next season. With Toronto selecting <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> DeMar DeRozan in the 2009 NBA draft, that uncertainy was compounded.|$|E
5|$|Rice {{was ranked}} as the 13th, 32nd and 35th best high school {{basketball}} <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> in {{the country as a}} senior in 2009 by Rivals.com, Scout.com, and ESPN, respectively. His father's alma mater, University of Michigan did not recruit him for their basketball team until after he had already committed to Georgia Tech. Rice was part of a Georgia Tech recruiting class that was ranked 21st in the nation and included Derrick Favors.|$|E

5000|$|The club {{changed its}} name to the Adelaide 36ers from the 1983 NBL season, though the club failed to make the playoffs until 1984 where they were {{defeated}} in the Elimination Finals by the Nunawading Spectres. By this time [...] "The Iceman" [...] had cemented his place as one of the premier <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> in the league.|$|R
5|$|The 2006–07 season {{represented}} a watershed {{year for the}} Raptors franchise. The roster was overhauled, including the selection of 2006 NBA draft number one pick Andrea Bargnani, the acquisition of point guard T. J. Ford in exchange for Villanueva, and the signing of <b>shooting</b> <b>guard</b> Anthony Parker and small forward Jorge Garbajosa. Bosh was given a three-year contract extension, while Maurizio Gherardini of Benetton Treviso was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{participation}} {{of children and}} adolescents in sports, including basketball, is becoming increasingly common, and this increased involvement raises concerns about the potential risk of sports injuries. Objective. To analyze the occurrence of sports injuries among young basketball players according to their position on the court and to associate these injuries with risk factors. Method. A retrospective, epidemiological study. A sample consisting of 204 basketball players {{with a mean age of}} 14. 33 ± 1. 19 years participated in the study. The players were interviewed using a reported condition questionnaire containing anthropometric and training data as well as information on injuries during the previous 12 months. Results: The frequency of injury was highest among the <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> (47. 8 %), followed by the centers (34. 8 %) and point guards (17. 4 %). Among the 204 participants, 40 players reported a total of 46 injuries, representing 0. 22 injuries per participant and 1. 15 injuries per injured participant. For the <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> and centers, statistically significant differences between injured and non-injured players were found related to age, weight, height, length of time in training and number of weekly practice hours (p < 0. 05). For point guards, a statistically significant difference between injured and non-injured players was found based on weight alone (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: The occurrence of injuries among basketball players was low. Injuries were associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors among <b>shooting</b> <b>guards</b> and centers, whereas injuries were only associated with weight among point guards. © 2013 Vanderlei et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
5|$|Stauskas {{committed}} {{to represent the}} Sacramento Kings in 2014 NBA Summer League. Although Stauskas {{is expected to be}} an NBA <b>shooting</b> <b>guard,</b> he will be vying with 2013 NBA Draft number 8 overall selection Ben McLemore for playing time. Since the two may be on the court at the same time, Stauskas is expected to play some point guard in the Summer League as preparation for regular season possibilities. He posted a video of his preparation for the 2014 NBA Summer League.|$|E
