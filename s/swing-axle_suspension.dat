2500|$|Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader, {{published}} in 1965, is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features, and reluctant {{to spend money}} on improving safety. The subject for which the book is probably most widely known, the rear-engined GM Chevrolet Corvair, is covered in the first chapter. It relates to the first (1960–1964) models that had a <b>swing-axle</b> <b>suspension</b> design which was prone to [...] "tuck under" [...] in certain circumstances. In substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar), Corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15psi front, 26psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was a dangerous oversteer.|$|E
50|$|The rear-engined 1960-69 Chevrolet Corvair Z-body up to 1964 used a {{variation}} of the rear <b>swing-axle</b> <b>suspension</b> and a transaxle similar to that found on the 1961-63 Pontiac Tempest. The 1961-62 Corvair station wagons even shared the same roofline as the 1961-63 Y-body wagons. Chevrolet's front-engine compact, introduced as the Chevy II for 1962 had some dimensions similar to the Y-body cars, but had a two-inch shorter wheelbase and was also shorter in length and width, its own X-body platform which featured unit-body construction, single-leaf rear suspension and conventional in-line four- and six-cylinder engines.|$|E

25|$|Journalist David E. Davis, in a 2009 {{article in}} Automobile Magazine, noted that despite Nader's claim that <b>swing-axle</b> rear <b>suspension</b> were dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle {{concepts}} during that era.|$|R
50|$|Journalist David E. Davis, in a 2009 {{article in}} Automobile Magazine, criticized Nader for purportedly {{focusing}} on the Corvair while ignoring other contemporary vehicles with <b>swing-axle</b> rear <b>suspensions,</b> including cars from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, notwithstanding the fact that Nader's Center for Auto Safety had published a book critical of the Beetle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subject for}} which the book is {{probably}} most widely known, the rear-engined Chevrolet Corvair, is covered in Chapter 1—"The Sporty Corvair-The One-Car Accident". This relates to the first (1960-1964) models that had a <b>swing-axle</b> <b>suspension</b> design which was prone to [...] "tuck under" [...] in certain circumstances. To {{make up for the}} cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar), Corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers' recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15psi front, 26psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was a dangerous oversteer. [...] Despite the fact that proper tire pressures were more critical than for contemporaneous designs, this was not clearly stated to Chevrolet salespeople and Corvair owners. According to the standards laid down by the relevant industry body, the Tire and Rim Association, the pressures also rendered the front tires overloaded when there were two or more passengers on board.|$|E
5000|$|M151 (1960) - Initial version. Because of {{its rear}} {{suspension}} design {{it had a}} dangerous tendency to flip over when cornered too aggressively by unaware drivers. The coil spring and <b>swing-axle</b> rear <b>suspension</b> lay-out (similar to the rear suspension of the early-model Chevrolet Corvair) could result in large rear wheel camber changes, causing drastic oversteer and a subsequent roll-over.|$|R
5000|$|The 170 was {{the first}} Mercedes with all-round {{independent}} suspension. There was no full width axle at the front, the wheels being suspended from two transverse leaf springs. At the back there were two half <b>swing-axles.</b> The <b>suspension</b> lay-out, which minimized unsprung mass and provided {{a high level of}} stability, was subsequently introduced across the entire Mercedes-Benz range, giving the cars a quality of comfort and safety that competitors using the then common combination of rigid axles and leaf springing could not match.|$|R
50|$|The Škoda 105/120 {{went into}} {{production}} in August 1976. Despite being {{basically the same}} as the previous S100/110 under the skin, the new cars featured a lot of improvements, such as a front-mounted radiator with a thermostatic fan. The heating unit was now inside the dashboard, and the fuel tank was now underneath the rear seat. All models had much the same mechanical specification as the previous models, with a 4-speed gearbox, independent suspension, worm-and-drive steering, and <b>swing-axle</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> An interesting feature found on the 105/120 was the side-hinged bonnet, which opened up like the top of a concert piano.|$|R
50|$|Journalist David E. Davis, in a 2009 {{article in}} Automobile Magazine, noted that despite Nader's claim that <b>swing-axle</b> rear <b>suspension</b> were dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Tatra, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle {{concepts}} during that era. (The handling of other rear-engine swing-axle cars, particularly the Volkswagen Type I and II, {{has been criticized}} as well.) Some contend that Nader's lack of an automotive engineering degree or a driver's license {{at the time he}} wrote Unsafe at Any Speed disqualifies him as a critic of automotive safety. In response to Nader's book, Mechanix Illustrated reviewer Tom McCahill tried to get a 1963 Corvair to flip, at one point sliding sideways into a street curb, but could not turn over the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 the Herald was remodelled (redesigned body, new suspension, and new {{different}}ial) by Nasir Hussein as the Standard Gazel, with {{a different}} grille and headlights set far apart, purportedly inspired from the Triumph Herald 13/60. It received a new, more sober rear end with low horizontal rectangular tail-lights and without the characteristic tailfins of the Herald designed by Michelotti. It also received a live rear-axle suspended on two leaf springs copied from the Triumph Toledo instead of the Herald's <b>swing-axle</b> independent <b>suspension,</b> replacement of the Herald's front bucket seats with a bench, and underwent the retrograde move of replacing the shifter with a long-crank version (as found in the Standard Ten). However, the engine was the same 948 cc single carb.|$|R
5000|$|... in 1923, {{as a young}} {{mechanical}} engineering student, Ganz made his first auto sketches for a car for the masses. This was a small lightweight car {{along the lines of}} the Rumpler Tropfenwagen with a mid-mounted engine, independent wheel <b>suspension,</b> <b>swing-axles</b> and an aerodynamic body. Lacking the money to build a prototype, he began publishing articles on progressive car design in various magazines and, shortly after his graduation in 1927, he was assigned as the new editor-in-chief of Klein-Motor-Sport. Josef Ganz used this magazine as a platform to criticize heavy, unsafe and old-fashioned cars and promote innovative design and his concept of a car for Germany's general population. The magazine gained in reputation and influence and, in January 1929, was renamed Motor-Kritik. Contributors to the magazine included Béla Barényi, a young engineering student who designed cars with similar design.|$|R
5000|$|The German {{automotive}} industry was {{devastated by the}} second World War, but in the post-war period {{a small number of}} firms brought it to prominence again. The emergence of the classic Porsche 356 is covered in the accompanying sports car article. In 1957 author John Stanford wrote: [...] "The post-war Mercedes sports cars are in a way even more remarkable than those of Porsche. The firm was particularly badly hit by the war and it was several years before anything but a nominal production of cars could be undertaken. In 1951 appeared the [...] "300", a luxurious and fast touring car with a single-camshaft six-cylinder engine of 2996 c.c. and chassis derived from the pre-war cars with <b>swing-axle</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> The [...] "300S" [...] was a three-carburetor edition, but in 1952 great interest was aroused by the almost invincible performance in sports-car racing of a team of prototype cars of extremely advanced and interesting design. By 1954 these had undergone sufficient development to be placed on the market as the [...] "300SL", one of the costliest and most desirable cars of our time. The conventional chassis has been abandoned on favor of a complex structure of welded tubes, although the coil spring suspension is retained, and exceptionally large brakes are fitted, inboard at the rear. The engine is sharply inclined to the near-side in the interests of a low bonnet-line, and with Bosch fuel injection produces 240 b.h.p. at 6,000 r.p.m. Claimed maximum speed is in excess of 160 m.p.h. and although the car is by no means small, dry weight has been kept to 23 cwt. The depth of the multi-tubular frame prevents the use of conventional side-hinged doors and these cars are fitted with the roof-hinged [...] "gull-wing" [...] doors which characterize an exceedingly handsome and practical car. An open touring version is available. In competition the [...] "300SL" [...] has become a powerful contender, and abetted by the success of the Grand Prix cars [...] "300 SLR" [...] has captured {{a substantial portion of the}} export market." ...|$|R
