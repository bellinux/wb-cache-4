They felt so many eighth-season episodes worked well because [...] "Chris Carter <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> {{an even more}} active role in the series that is most closely identified with him." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that, [...] "it’s a measure of a show’s effectiveness to see how convincingly the writers can threaten a major character, and have that character’s subsequent survival not be a cheat", in regards to Mulder's resurrection. He applauded the fact that the episode is suspenseful, even though the ending has a certain inevitability. Handlen also positively commented on both Anderson's performance—although pointing out that she [...] "is largely pushed to the side for the majority" [...] of the episode—and Lea's reappearance, noting that [...] "it's always fun to see Krycek". However, he argued that the conclusion [...] "makes less sense the more you think about it", but that the final scene with Mulder and Scully [...] "makes up for the contrivance." ...|$|E
500|$|Forbes {{spoke about}} the commendable ticket pricing ensued by Live Nation for the tour. Jesse Lawrence from the {{magazine}} noticed how the ticket prices were lowered {{to an average of}} $68 in Gaga's primary markets and ensuing fast sell-outs, compared to those of her contemporaries, like Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour which had an average ticket price at $86. Conversely, the average price was raised to as high as $269 in Gaga's secondary markets, although with fewer tickets available than Cyrus' tour. This again ensued that the revenue was earned with profit. Lawrence concluded by saying that [...] "Lady Gaga's pricing, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> a longer-term view and is focused on providing access to as many of her fans as possible as opposed to wringing out every last dollar on the current tour." [...] In April 2014, Lawrence reported that following Gaga's performance at Roseland Ballroom, the tour ticket prices in the secondary markets went up by 5.3%, with major increases being visible at Philips Arena in Atlanta. Tickets at Madison Square Garden rose up to $338.81, which was 42.6% higher than the average price. Other locations where ticket prices saw an increase were MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, TD Garden Arena in Boston and United Center in Chicago. A higher price was set for the first of two nights at Staples Center in Los Angeles, resulting in one of the costliest tickets in the show. The pricing was leveled off for the second night and they gradually decreased with the tour's progress. This was evident in the tour date switch up between May 12 and 15 at Washington and Philadelphia, respectively, where the ticket prices fell by 29.5%.|$|E

60|$|Science has {{recently}} {{discovered that the}} ant does not lay up anything for winter use. This will knock him out of literature, to some extent. He does not work, except when people are looking, and only then when the observer has a green, naturalistic look, and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> notes. This amounts to deception, and will injure him for the Sunday-schools. He has not judgment {{enough to know what}} is good to eat from what isn't. This amounts to ignorance, and will impair the world's respect for him. He cannot stroll around a stump and find his way home again. This amounts to idiocy, and once the damaging fact is established, thoughtful people will cease to look up to him, the sentimental will cease to fondle him. His vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect, since he never gets home with anything he starts with. This disposes of the last remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness as a moral agent, since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him any more. It is strange, beyond comprehension, that so manifest a humbug as the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many ages without being found out.|$|E
