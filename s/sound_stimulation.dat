In the present study, we investigated the cellular mechanism of the cortical activity, adopting an in vivo intracellular recording technique, recording from the primary auditory cortex (AI) while presenting an acoustic stimulus to the rat and electrically stimulating its MGB. We found that low-frequency stimuli enhanced the amplitudes of sound-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in AI neurons, whereas highfrequency stimuli depressed these auditory responses. The degree of this modulation depended on the intensities of the train stimuli as well as the intervals between the electrical stimulations and their paired <b>sound</b> <b>stimulations.</b> These findings may have implications regarding the basic mechanisms of MGB activation of auditory cortical plasticity and cortical signal processing...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To study anticonvulsive and antiepileptogenic {{effects of}} singe {{levetiracetam}} (LEV) {{administration in the}} model of audiogenic kindling. Methods: Rats of Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) strain genetically susceptible to severe audiogenic seizures received one intraperitoneal injection of saline, low (6 mg/kg) or high (50 mg/kg) dose of LEV before or after audiogenic kindling. One hour postinjection, an audiogenic seizure was induced to assess anticonvulsive effect of LEV in nonkindled and kindled rats. To examine antiepileptogenic activity of LEV, nonkindled rats injected with the drug or saline were kindled with repeated <b>sound</b> <b>stimulations.</b> Audiogenic kindling development manifested in an appearance and progressive prolongation of an additional seizure phase, post-tonic–clonus. The latency and duration of audiogenic seizures and the duration of every seizure phase (running, tonic, post-tonic–clonic) were measured. Results: One hour posttreatment, LEV dose-dependently lengthened the latency and reduced the duration of audiogenic seizures in both nonkindled and kindled rats. The seizure shortening resulted from selective suppression of tonic and kindled post-tonic–clonic phases. The dose of 50 mg/kg completely blocked tonic and clonic convulsions 1 h postinjection. The anticonvulsive effect of LEV was more pronounced in kindled than in nonkindled rats. Single LEV injection in the dose of 50 mg/kg prior audiogenic kindling significantly suppressed subsequent kindling progression indicating profound antiepileptogenic potency of the drug. Conclusions: The present study shows that LEV exerts both short-lasting anticonvulsive effect on audiogenic seizures and very long-lasting antiepileptogenic effect on audiogenic kindling. Remarkably, a single injection of LEV is enough to significantly suppress kindling progression in KM rats...|$|R
40|$|Auditory {{cortical}} {{processing of}} complex meaningful sounds entails {{the transformation of}} sensory (tonotopic) representations of incoming acoustic waveforms into higher-level sound representations (e. g., their category). However, the precise neural mechanisms enabling such transformations remain largely unknown. In the present study, we use {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and natural <b>sounds</b> <b>stimulation</b> to examine these two levels of sound representation (and their relation) in the human auditory cortex. In a first experiment, we derive cortical maps of frequency preference (tonotopy) and selectivity (tuning width) by mathematical modeling of fMRI responses to natural sounds. The tuning width maps highlight a region of narrow tuning that follows the main axis of Heschl's gyrus and is flanked by regions of broader tuning. The narrowly tuned portion on Heschl's gyrus contains two mirror-symmetric frequency gradients, presumably defining two distinct primary auditory areas. In addition, our analysis indicates that spectral preference and selectivity (and their topographical organization) extend well beyond the primary regions and also cover higher-order and category-selective auditory regions. In particular, regions with preferential responses to human voice and speech occupy the low-frequency portions of the tonotopic map. We confirm this observation in a second experiment, where we find that speech/voice selective regions exhibit a response bias toward the low frequencies characteristic of human voice and speech, even when responding to simple tones. We propose that this frequency bias reflects the selective amplification of relevant and category-characteristic spectral bands, a useful processing step for transforming a sensory (tonotopic) sound image into higher level neural representations...|$|R

Previous {{studies from}} our {{laboratory}} {{have indicated that}} audible sound field stimulation can significantly affect E. coli growth and metabolic action, which can enhance or inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), {{and the effects of}} sound field on E. coli growth depended greatly on the intensity and frequency of sound field. However, very little efforts have been put forth in studying the potential mechanism of bacterial cells responses to audible <b>sound</b> <b>stimulation.</b> In this paper, the potential role of calcium signaling in mediating the response of E. coli to audible <b>sound</b> <b>stimulation</b> was firstly reported. We found that audible sound wave stimulation could evidently enhance total intracellular Ca 2 + content. And the lack of calcium ion in medium significantly alleviated audible sound wave biological effects. Moreover, by adding appropriate level of calcium chloride to the LB medium contained 1. 2 mM EDTA, the promotion effect of audible sound wave to E. coli growth was gradually resumed.

In this work, we compared the impact of <b>sound</b> <b>stimulation</b> in tinnitus patients in the different sleep stages. Ten patients with idiopathic tinnitus were treated with <b>sound</b> <b>stimulation</b> mimicking tinnitus during sleep.

40|$|The neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} Angelman syndrome (AS) {{is characterized}} by intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, distinct behavioral aspects, and epilepsy. AS {{is caused by a}} loss of the maternally expressed UBE 3 A gene, and many of the symptoms are recapitulated in a Ube 3 a mouse model of this syndrome. At the cellular level, changes in the axon initial segment (AIS) have been reported, and changes in vesicle cycling have indicated the presence of presynaptic deficits. Here we studied the role of UBE 3 A in the auditory system by recording synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) through in vivo whole cell and juxtacellular recordings. We show that MNTB principal neurons in Ube 3 a mice exhibit a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, an increased action potential (AP) amplitude and a decreased AP half width. Moreover, both the pre- and postsynaptic AP in the calyx of Held synapse of Ube 3 a mice showed significantly faster recovery from spike depression. An increase in AIS length was observed in the principal MNTB neurons of Ube 3 a mice, providing a possible substrate for these gain-of-function changes. Apart from the effect on APs, we also observed that EPSPs showed decreased short-term synaptic depression (STD) during long <b>sound</b> <b>stimulations</b> in AS mice, and faster recovery from STD following these tones, which is suggestive of a presynaptic gain-of-function.

40|$|Perceiving speech engages {{parts of}} the motor system {{involved}} in speech production. The role of the motor cortex in speech perception has been demonstrated using low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to suppress motor excitability in the lip representation and disrupt discrimination of lip-articulated speech sounds (Möttönen & Watkins, 2009). Another form of rTMS, continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), can produce longer-lasting disruptive effects following a brief train of stimulation. We investigated the effects of cTBS on motor excitability and discrimination of speech and non-speech sounds. cTBS was applied for 40 seconds over either the hand or the lip representation of motor cortex. Motor-evoked potentials recorded from the lip and hand muscles in response to single pulses of TMS revealed no measurable change in motor excitability due to cTBS. This failure to replicate previous findings may reflect the unreliability of measurements of motor excitability related to inter-individual variability. We also measured the effects of cTBS on a listener’s ability to discriminate:(1) lip-articulated speech sounds from sounds not articulated by the lips (‘ba’vs. ‘da’); (2) two speech sounds not articulated by the lips (‘ga’vs. ‘da’); and (3) non-speech sounds produced by the hands (‘claps’vs. ‘clicks’). Discrimination of lip-articulated speech sounds was impaired between 20 and 35 minutes after cTBS over the lip motor representation. Specifically, discrimination of across-category ba–da sounds presented with an 800 -ms inter-stimulus interval was reduced to chance level performance. This effect was absent for speech sounds {{that do not require}} the lips for articulation and non-speech <b>sounds.</b> <b>Stimulation</b> over the hand motor representation did not affect discrimination of speech or non-speech sounds. These findings show that stimulation of the lip motor representation disrupts discrimination of speech sounds in an articulatory feature-specific way...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Repetitive sound-induced seizures, {{known as}} au-diogenic {{kindling}} (AK), gradually induce the transference of epileptic activity from brainstem to forebrain structures along with behavioral changes. The aim {{of our work}} was to corre-late the behavioral changes observed during the AK with possible alterations in neuronal proliferation, cell death, hip-pocampal mossy fiber sprouting and in the EEG pattern of Wistar audiogenic rats, a genetically susceptible strain from our laboratory. Susceptible and non-susceptible animals were submitted to repeated <b>sound</b> <b>stimulations</b> for 14 – 16 days and hip-pocampal mitotic activity was studied through the incorpo-ration of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cell death and mossy fiber sprouting were assessed, respectively, by using Fluoro-Jade and Timm staining, 2 and 32 days after the last kindling stimulation. In addition, we used immunofluorescent double labeling for a glial and a mitotic marker to evaluate newly born cell identity. Some animals had hippocampus and amygdala electrodes for EEG recordings. Our results show that kindled animals with 6 – 11 general-ized limbic seizures (class IV–V) had increased cell prolifer-ation in the dentate gyrus when compared with animals with zero or one to three seizures. BrdU-positive cells labeled on day 2 and on day 32 were both GFAP negative. In the later group, rounded and well-defined BrdU-positive/GFAP-nega-tive nuclei were seen in different portions of the granule cell layer. We did not observe any Fluoro-Jade or differential Timm staining in kindled animals at both killing times. How-ever, EEG recordings showed intense epileptic activity in the hippocampus and amygdala of all animals with limbic seizures. Therefore, our data indicate that AK-induced limbic epi-leptogenicity is able to increase the hippocampal mitotic rate, even though {{it does not seem}} to promote neuronal death or mossy fiber sprouting in the supragranular layer of the den...|$|R

40|$|Background As the {{importance}} of mobile phones as an emotional communication medium is growing, non-verbal behaviors such as facial expressions, touching behaviors and gestures ought to be considered to enhance phone conversations. Among various non-verbal signals, we focus on sharing specific touches {{that could be used}} for exchanging contextual and emotional cues. Along with this, to make the new phone conversation involving touching more natural, we consider maintaining natural audio conversation with phones by keeping the receiver on the ear and the transmitter on the mouth while holding the phone to the cheek. Methods In this paper, we focus on investigating ways to deliver four touches: pat, slap, tickle and kiss with sound and tactile feedback while holding the phone to the cheek as in typical phone calls. The interaction technique is called CheekTouch, and it is based on enabling users to share touches by representing finger gestures on one phone screen to the other party’s cheek using a vibrotactile display and <b>sound</b> <b>stimulations.</b> We asked the 30 students who participated to put the device on their cheek and wear earphones, and we provided them with 24 different stimulations. Results An evaluation was conducted to propose the most appropriate type of stimulation to deliver a pat, slap, tickle and kiss using CheekTouch. We showed that the best way to deliver a pat was to use a vibrotactile display combined with sound; however, a tickle was best delivered with only the vibrotactile display. A kiss and slap, on the other hand, were best delivered when there was only sound. Conclusions Considering the trends in sharing delicate emotions during phone-mediated communications, it is significant to investigate ways to convey touches during phone conversations beyond sharing visual emoticons. Here, we focused on findings ways to pat, slap, tickle and kiss by using existing phone technologies (vibrotactile motors and sound). Through the quantitative evaluation of those four touches, we discovered which stimulation type is best for delivering each of the touches. The results do not show whether those touches can deliver emotions, however, we believe CheekTouch and the findings from the evaluation can be used for sharing different types of non-verbal signals during audio-based phone conversations and enable further studies in the field of remote tactile interaction. clos...|$|R

Similarly, cVEMPs following simulated CHL also showed decreased response rate, elevated thresholds and attenuated amplitudes, with prolonged P 1 latencies compared with those before simulated CHL, although only differences in response rate, threshold and amplitude were significant. Conclusions: Conductive hearing loss affects the response rate and other response parameters in oVEMPs and cVEMPs...|$|R
