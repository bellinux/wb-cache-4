Vaccination against PD is previously shown to reduce mortality and severity of clinical PD.

40|$|Abstract Background For {{more than}} three decades, {{diseases}} caused by <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphaviruses</b> (SAV) have become a major problem of increasing economic importance in the European fish-farming industry. However, experimental infection trials with SAV result in low or no mortality i. e very different from most field outbreaks of pancreas disease (PD). This probably reflects the difficulties in reproducing complex biotic and abiotic field conditions in the laboratory. In this study {{we looked at the}} relationship between SAV-infection in salmon and sub-lethal environmental hypoxia as a result of reduced flow-through in tank systems. Results The experiment demonstrated that constant reduced oxygen levels (60 - 65 % oxygen saturation: 6. 5 - 7. 0 mg/L) did not significantly increase the severity or the progress of pancreas disease (PD). These conclusions are based upon assessments of a semi-quantitative histopathological lesion score system, morbidities/mortalities, and levels of SAV RNA in tissues and water (measured by 1 MDS electropositive virus filters and downstream real-time RT-PCR). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fish population shed detectable levels of the virus into the surrounding water during viraemia; 4 - 13 days after i. p. infection, and prior to appearance of severe lesions in heart (21 - 35 dpi). After this period, viral RNA from SAV could not be detected in water samples although still present in tissues (gills and hearts) at lasting low levels. Lesions could be seen in exocrine pancreas at 7 - 21 days post infection, but no muscle lesions were seen. Conclusions In our study, experimentally induced hypoxia failed to explain the discrepancy between the severities reported from field outbreaks of SAV-disease and experimental infections. Reduction of oxygen levels to constant suboptimal levels had no effect on the severity of lesions caused by SAV-infection or the progress of the disease. Furthermore, we present a modified VIRADEL method which can be used to detect virus in water and to supplement experimental infection trials with information related to viral shedding. By using this method, we were able to demonstrate {{for the first time that}} shedding of SAV from the fish population into the surrounding water coincides with viraemia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pancreas disease (PD) of Atlantic {{salmon is}} an {{emerging}} disease caused by <b>Salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> (SAV) which mainly affects salmonid aquaculture in Western Europe. Although genome structure of SAV {{has been characterized}} and each individual viral protein has been identified, the role of 6 K protein in viral replication and infectivity remains undefined. The 6 K protein of alphaviruses is a small and hydrophobic protein which is involved in membrane permeabilization, protein processing and virus budding. Because these common features are shared across many viral species, they have been named viroporins. In the present study, we applied reverse genetics to generate SAV 3 6 K-deleted (Δ 6 K) variant and investigate the role of 6 K protein. Our findings show that the 6 K-deletion variant of <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> is non-viable. Despite viral proteins of Δ 6 K variant are detected in the cytoplasm by immunostaining, they are not found on the cell surface. Further, analysis of viral proteins produced in Δ 6 K cDNA clone transfected cells using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) and western blot showed a protein band of larger size than E 2 of wild-type SAV 3. When Δ 6 K cDNA was co-transfected with SAV 3 helper cDNA encoding the whole structural genes including 6 K, the infectivity was rescued. The development of CPE after co-transfection and resolved genome sequence of rescued virus confirmed full-length viral genome being generated through RNA recombination. The discovery of {{the important role of}} the 6 K protein in virus production provides a new possibility for the development of antiviral intervention which is highly needed to control SAV infection in salmonids...|$|E

This histopathological and proteomic study, using an established cohabitational experimental model, investigated the correlation between tissue damage during PD {{and a number of}} serum proteins associated with these pathologies in Atlantic salmon. The proteins were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis, trypsin digest and peptide MS/MS fingerprinting. A number of humoral components of immunity which may act as biomarkers of the disease were also identified. For example, creatine kinase, enolase and malate dehydrogenase serum concentrations were shown to correlate with pathology during PD. In contrast, hemopexin, transferrin, and apolipoprotein, amongst others, altered during later stages of the disease and did not correlate with tissue pathologies. This approach has given new insight into not only PD but also fish disease as a whole, by characterisation of the protein response to infection, through pathological processes to tissue recovery. Biological significance: <b>Salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> causes pancreas disease (PD) in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and has a major economic impact on the aquaculture industry. A proteomic investigation of the change to the serum proteome during PD has been made with an established experimental model of the disease.

The concentrations of certain proteins in serum such as creatine kinase, enolase and malate dehydrogenase were shown to correlate with tissue pathology while other proteins such as hemopexin, transferrin, and apolipoprotein, altered in concentration during later stages of the disease and did not correlate with tissue pathologies. The protein response to infection may be used to monitor disease progression and enhance understanding of the pathology of PD. </br...|$|E

Both infection treatment and time after infection were strong predictors of the skin microbial community composition. Skin samples from SAV 3 infected fish showed an unbalanced microbiota characterized by a decreased abundance of Proteobacteria such as Oleispira sp. and increased abundances of opportunistic taxa including Flavobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae and Tenacibaculum sp.

Finally, we demonstrated that the protection is not impaired when the ALV 405 antigen is combined with other viral or bacterial antigens in a polyvalent vaccine.

Multiple samples throughout the seawater production phase from several salmonid populations were included to investigate genetic variation during an outbreak. The analyses were mainly based on partial sequences from the E 2 gene. For some samples, additional partial 6 K and nsP 3 gene sequences were available. Results: The nucleotide divergence for all gene fragments ranged from total identity (0. 0 % divergence) to 0. 45 % (1103 nt fragment of E 2), 1. 11 % (451 nt fragment of E 2), 0. 94 % (6 K) and 0. 28 % (nsP 3). This low nucleotide divergence corresponded well to previous reports on SAV 3 sequences; however the observed divergence for the short E 2 fragment was higher than that previously reported. When compared to SAVH 20 / 03 (AY 604235), amin...|$|E
40|$|Salmon {{pancreas}} disease (SPD) {{is one of}} the most commercially significant viral diseases of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Europe. In this study, the potential for dietary mitigation of the disease using different polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) profiles was assessed in rainbow trout. We experimentally infected fish with <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> subtype 1 (SAV- 1), the causative agent of SPD. These fish were fed two diets with different n- 3 /n- 6 PUFA ratio (high omega 3, 3. 08, and high omega 6, 0. 87). We assessed the influence of the diets on the fatty acid composition of the heart at 0 days post infection (d. p. i.) (after 4 weeks of feeding the experimental diets prior to SAV- 1 infection), and sampled infected and control fish at 5, 15 and 30 d. p. i. Viral E 1 and E 2 glycoprotein genes were quantified by two absolute real-time PCRs in all the organs sampled, and significantly lower levels of the virus were evident in the organs of fish fed with high omega 6. Characteristic pathological lesions were identified in infected fish as early as 5 d. p. i., with no significant differences in the pathology lesion scores between the two dietary regimes. This study shows that decreasing the n- 3 /n- 6 PUFA ratio in experimental diets of rainbow trout changes the fatty acid content of the fish, and is associated with reduced SAV- 1 replication in rainbow trout...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the antiviral activity and gene induction properties of interferon gamma (IFN-) compared to type I IFN (IFNa 1) in Atlantic salmon. IFN- protected salmon cells against {{infectious pancreatic necrosis}} virus (IPNV) -induced cytopathic effect (CPE), reduced virus titers, and inhibited the synthesis of the viral structural protein VP 3. Moreover, IFN- showed potent antiviral activity against <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> 3 (SAV 3) measured as a reduction in virus nsP 1 transcripts. IFN- (a type II IFN) had less specific antiviral activity against IPNV than IFNa 1, showing a half-maximal effective concentration of 1. 6 ng/ml versus 31 pg/ml determined in the CPE reduction assay. Compared to IFNa 1, IFN- was a more effective inducer of the antiviral protein GBP, several interferon regulatory transcription factors (IRFs), and the chemokine IP- 10. The antiviral activity of IFN- may also in part be ascribed to upregulation of Mx, ISG 15, and viperin. These are typical type I IFN-induced genes in mammals and were also more strongly induced by IFNa 1 than by IFN- in salmon cells. Fish and mammalian IFN- thus show strikingly similar gene induction properties. Interest-ingly, the antiviral activity of IFN- against IPNV and SAV 3 {{and its ability to}} induce Mx and ISG 15 markedly decreased in the presence of neutralizing antiserum against IFNa 1. In contrast, antiIFNa 1 had no effect on the induction of IRF- 1 and IP- 10 by IFN-. This suggests that the antiviral activity of IFN- is partially dependent on IFNa induction. However, because antiIFNa 1 could not abolish the IFN [...] mediated induction of Mx an...|$|E
40|$|<b>Salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> (SAV) has {{recently}} become an economically important pathogen in salmonid aquaculture in Europe. Subtype SAV- 1 causes salmon pancreas disease (SPD) in Atlantic salmon in Scotland and Ireland, and was first isolated on Chinook salmon embryo- 214 (CHSE- 214) cells in 1995 in Ireland; several established cell lines {{have since been}} tested for viral growth, although the ability of these cell lines to support primary virus isolation has not being examined. In the present study, CHSE- 214, Chum salmon heart - 1 (CHH- 1) and Salmon head kidney - 1 (SHK- 1) cell lines were evaluated for isolation of SAV- 1 from kidney samples of experimentally infected Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The presence of infection in these samples was confirmed both by cell culture and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Homogenates of kidney from fish 3 days post-infection (p. i.) were inoculated onto the three cell lines {{and the development of}} a cytopathic effect (CPE) recorded. The CHH- 1 cells produced a rapid CPE from Day 6 p. i., while the CHSE- 214 cells showed the presence of a CPE from Day 10 p. i. In comparison, a CPE developed much later in the SHK- 1 cells, from Day 20 p. i. The virus was successfully isolated on all three cell lines in subsequent passages, indicating that CHSE- 214, CHH- 1, and SHK- 1 cells can be used for the isolation and culture of SAV- 1. The CHH- 1 cell line, however, has proven the most useful, since the CPE developed the quickest in this cell line...|$|E
40|$|Fillet {{quality of}} farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{affected}} by {{a broad range of}} preand post-mortem factors. This thesis focuses mainly on the impact of pancreas disease (PD), salt composition and salting method on pigment concentration and colour of raw and coldsmoked salmon fillets, but fillet composition, texture and drip losses are as well considered. The fish material used to study effects of PD on fillet quality was sampled from commercial farming locations to obtain a broad overview and identify potential common properties of PD affected salmon (Paper I). The farming locations participated in a cohort study reported by Jansen et al. (2010), hence the salmon were sampled from populations with a well documented disease history. Salmon from seven farms were diagnosed with PD (diagnosed 0 - 12 months prior to slaughtering); salmon from one farm were infected with salmonid alpha virus (SAV) without an outbreak of PD, whereas salmon from two farms had no records of PD diagnosis and worked as control farms. To obtain knowledge on underlying causes to quality deviations of PD affected salmon, individuals with different PD pathology within a population diagnosed with PD at time of slaughtering was investigated (Paper II). Anecdotal information indicates that PD may cause poor general muscle quality and in particular pale and irregular colouration. Salmon diagnosed with PD at slaughter, or six months prior to slaughter confirmed this. Changes in quality in the order of their appearance were decreased CF, depleted muscle glycogen, increased drip loss of raw muscle, paler colour, depleted protein and finally harder texture in smoked salmon fillets. Salmon infected with <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> (SAV) without a PD outbreak and salmon diagnosed one year before slaughtering, had similar quality as unaffected fish, although paler colour might occur even after one year recovery. Within a population of farmed Atlantic salmon diagnosed with PD at time of slaughtering, a large variation was observed among individuals in pathological profile, gene expression profile in heart tissue, and fillet quality characteristics. Deteriorated quality and dysfunction of the digestive system was most pronounced in fish with severe loss of pancreas. Dry salting significantly reduced the stability of carotenoids in the fillet surface of coldsmoked salmon fillets as compared to injection salting (Paper IV). The salt content in pre rigor injection salted fillets was similar as those salted post rigor (2. 4 % versus 2. 6 %, respectively), whereas the fillet colour was more translucence. However, injection salting of pre rigor fillets can be recommended. Moreover, state of rigor mortis at time of salting had no effect on the carotenoid stability. Low correlations between colorimetric parameters and content of carotenoids in the fillet surface, illustrated that additional factors affects the visual appearance of cold smoked salmon. Nitrite salt curing (Paper III) improved the colour of cold-smoked salmon fillets (more reddish, darker and less yellowish). However, only slight higher carotenoid stability during processing was observed. The improved colour was most probably related to formation of nitrosomyoglobin. Salmon fillets treated with nitrite (fine refined salt added 0. 6 % sodium nitrite) had a relatively high amount of residual nitrite, however higher contents of Nnitrosoamines were not observed. It is concluded that salmon diagnosed with PD at slaughter, or six months prior to slaughter showed deteriorated fillet quality, whereas salmon infected with <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> (SAV) without a PD outbreak and salmon diagnosed one year before slaughtering, had similar quality as unaffected fish. Moreover it is concluded that nitrite salt improved the appearance of cold-smoked salmon fillets and dry salting reduced the stability of carotenoids in the fillet surface as compared to injection salting...|$|E
40|$|A {{cohort study}} was {{initiated}} {{in the spring}} of 2006 to investigate epidemiological aspects and patho-genesis of <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> (SAV) subtype 3 infections and pancreas disease (PD). The aims were to assess involvement of the freshwater pro-duction phase, the extent and frequency of sub-clinical infections and to follow PD-affected populations throughout the entire seawater pro-duction cycle, as well as investigate possible risk factors for PD outbreaks. Fish groups from 46 different Atlantic salmon freshwater sites in six counties were sampled once prior to seawater transfer and followed onto their seawater sites. A total of 51 Atlantic salmon seawater sites were in-cluded, and fish groups were sampled three times during the seawater production phase. SAV subtype 3 was not identified by real-time RT-PCR from samples collected in the freshwater phase, nor were any SAV-neutralizing antibodies or histopathologi-cal changes consistent with PD. In the seawater phase, SAV was detected in samples from 23 of 36 (63. 9 %) studied sites located within the endemic region. No SAV subtype 3 was detected in samples from seawater sites located outside the endemic region. The cumulative incidence of PD during the production cycle amongst sites with SAV detected was 87 % (20 of 23 sites). Average fish weight at time of PD diagnosis ranged from 461 to 5978 g, because of a wide variation in the timing of disease occurrence throughout the production cycle. Mor-tality levels following a PD diagnosis varied greatly between populations. The mean percentage mor-tality was 6. 9 % (7. 06) (range 0. 7 – 26. 9), while the mean duration of increased mortality following PD diagnosis was 2. 8 months (1. 11) (range 1 – 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Pancreas disease {{caused by}} <b>salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) leads to high {{mortality}} rates post infection and histopathological lesions in several organs. As protection against pancreas disease, Novartis developed a prophylactic DNA plasmid-based vaccine {{to be administered}} to salmon as naked plasmid in a single intramuscular injection. In order to assess {{the legal status of}} the fish vaccinated with this new vaccine with regard to the legislation on genetically modified organisms, the European Commission suggested that the company carry out a scientific study on the integration/non-integration of the plasmid DNA into the fish genome. Subsequently, the European Commission requested EFSA to give scientific advice on the study design and the conclusions drawn by the company. PCR based analysis of genomic DNA from muscle samples, taken from at or around the injection site 436 days post vaccination, led the company to conclude that integration of plasmid DNA into the fish genome is extremely unlikely. After an assessment of the study, EFSA considers that the study presented by Novartis Animal Health on the integration/non-integration of DNA plasmid-based vaccine into the salmon genomic DNA provides insufficient information on the potential integration of plasmid DNA fragments into the fish genome due to a limited coverage of the plasmid DNA by the detection method provided, the limited number of samples analysed and an insufficient limit of detection and method validation. Therefore, EFSA is of the opinion that the results from the integration/non-integration study submitted by Novartis Animal Health are not sufficient to support the conclusion of non-integration of plasmid DNA into the fish genome drawn by the company...|$|E
40|$|Sleeping disease virus (SDV) is {{a member}} of the new <b>Salmonid</b> <b>alphavirus</b> genus within the Togaviridae family. The {{single-stranded}} RNA genome of SDV is 11, 894 nucleotides long, excluding the 3 ′ poly(A) tail. A full-length cDNA has been generated; the cDNA was fused to a hammerhead ribozyme sequence at the 5 ′ end and inserted into a transcription plasmid (pcDNA 3) backbone, yielding pSDV. By transfection of pSDV into fish cells, recombinant SDV (rSDV) was successfully recovered. Demonstration of the recovery of rSDV was provided by immunofluorescence assay on rSDV-infected cells and by the presence of a genetic tag, a BlpI restriction enzyme site, introduced into the rSDV RNA genome. SDV infectious cDNA was used for two kinds of experiments (i) to evaluate the impact of various targeted mutations in nsP 2 on viral replication and (ii) to study the virulence of rSDV in trout. For the latter aspect, when juvenile trout were infected by immersion in a water bath with the wild-type virus-like rSDV, no deaths or signs of disease appeared in fish, although they were readily infected. In contrast, cumulative mortality reached 80 % in fish infected with the wild-type SDV (wtSDV). When rSDV-infected fish were challenged with wtSDV 3 and 5 months postinfection, a long-lasting protection was demonstrated. Interestingly, a variant rSDV (rSDV 14) adapted to grow at a higher temperature, 14 °C instead of 10 °C, was shown to become pathogenic for trout. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of wtSDV, rSDV, and rSDV 14 genomes evidenced several amino acid changes, and some changes may be linked to the pathogenicity of SDV in trout...|$|E
