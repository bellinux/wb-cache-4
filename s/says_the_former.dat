60|$|This was {{certainly}} not the idea of those who introduced our freedom. When the old Liberals removed the gags from all the heresies, their idea was that religious and philosophical discoveries might thus be made. Their view was that cosmic truth was so important that every one ought to bear independent testimony. The modern idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant that it cannot matter what any one <b>says.</b> <b>The</b> <b>former</b> freed inquiry as men loose a noble hound; the latter frees inquiry as men fling back into the sea a fish unfit for eating. Never has there been so little discussion {{about the nature of}} men as now, when, for the first time, any one can discuss it. The old restriction meant that only the orthodox were allowed to discuss religion. Modern liberty means that nobody is allowed to discuss it. Good taste, the last and vilest of human superstitions, has succeeded in silencing us where all the rest have failed. Sixty years ago it was bad taste to be an avowed atheist. Then came the Bradlaughites, the last religious men, the last men who cared about God; but they could not alter it. It is still bad taste to be an avowed atheist. But their agony has achieved just his--that now it is equally bad taste to be an avowed Christian. Emancipation has only locked the saint in the same tower of silence as the heresiarch. Then we talk about Lord Anglesey and the weather, and call it the complete liberty of all the creeds.|$|E

5000|$|Economics {{commentator}} Philip Coggan {{holds that}} the world's current monetary system became debt based after President Nixon suspended the link between money and gold in 1971. He writes that [...] "Modern money is debt and debt is money". Since the 1971 Nixon Shock, debt creation {{and the creation of}} money increasingly took place at once. This simultaneous creation of money and debt occurs as a feature of Fractional reserve banking. After a commercial bank approves a loan, it is able to create the corresponding amount of money, which is then acquired by the borrower along with a similar amount of debt. Coggan {{goes on to say that}} debtors often prefer debt based monetary systems such as Fiat money over commodity based systems like the gold standard, because the former tend to allow much higher volumes of money to circulate in the economy, and tend to be more expansive. This makes their debts easier to repay. Coggan refers to Bryan's 19th century Cross of Gold speech as one of the first great attempts to weaken the link between gold and money; he <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> US presidential candidate was trying to expand the monetary base in the interests of indebted farmers, who at the time were often being forced into bankruptcy. However Coggan also says that the excessive debt which can be built up under a debt based monetary system can end up hurting all sections of society, including debtors.|$|E
40|$|Nearly 450 {{students}} will commence studies today at Sydney’s new University, the University of Notre Dame Australia. Students will study across six main Schools: Arts and Sciences, Business, Education, Law, Nursing, and Philosophy and Theology at the rejuvenated and centrally located campus at Broadway. Popular courses include primary teaching, nursing, arts, marketing and public relations, and double degrees in arts/business and law/arts. Notre Dame, a private Catholic university, hails from Western Australia, {{where it has}} developed impressive campuses at Fremantle and Broome over the past 15 years. The University has a current enrolment of 5, 000 students in Western Australia and aims to match this number in Sydney over the next decade. On the Broadway Campus, Notre Dame has transformed a mainly disused site to its rightful position, historically, culturally and as a` significant Sydney city landmark. University spokesman, Damian Gleeson, <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> parish and school buildings and presbytery have been sensitively and beautifully restored to form an exquisite Campus. ‘A core part of the redevelopment is a major facelift to St Benedict’s Church. The first church on the site, built in 1838, serviced the then predominantly Irish colonial community. The historic church – once one of Sydney’s largest parishes – will be reopened this weekend to serve peoples {{from a wide range}} of nationalities and inner-city students in what is now a university precinct. ‘St Benedict’s is also noteworthy for being the parish church of the late Cardinal Gilroy and several generations of his family. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} said that the 2002 "Adelaide Festival" has been misunderstood, that it was too {{innovative}} and far-sighted to be fully comprehended. That its impact will not be realised for years, say some. For a decade, <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> Director. It has been reported that many valuable cultural interchanges took place - in the "Intertwine" project and during other cultural residencies. Among the scheduled performances, "Black Swan’s" "The Career Highlights of Mamu" presented a complex and sometimes rickety mix of oral history, theatre and traditional dance. In "Skin" "Bangarra Dance Company" contrasted an aestheticised tableau of traditional women’s culture with the contemporary trauma of deaths in custody, alcohol addiction and alienation among Aboriginal men. In "Bone Flute", "MAU Dance" directed by Lemi Ponifasio, brought together, ponderously and unsuccessfully, elements of Japanese butoh with Polynesian rituals and traditions. It was obvious that attendances everywhere were thin. The excellent "Shedding Light" program of commissioned films had nearly full houses for "The Tracker" and the controversial "Australian Rules" - although there were only three screenings in each case - but the premiere for Ivan Sen’s superbly understated "Beneath Clouds" was scandalously under-attended, as was the first night of Tony Ayres’ "Walking on Water". Similarly the expanse of empty seats at the latter performances of "El Nino" was an eerie sight. The additional program added by Sue Nattrass {{at the behest of the}} Festival board seems never to have grafted on to the original framework of Peter Sellars’ plan. The Barbara Cook ticket prices were steep and the other solo shows - BJ Ward, Patrick Dickson’s Via Dolorosa, Max Gillies and the dance works by Ros Warby and Helen Herbertson, while individually creditable, seemed forlorn and disconnected...|$|E

40|$|In {{three weeks}} the Sydney Campus of the University of Notre Dame Australia will open {{its doors to}} its 400 {{foundation}} year students. (Classes commence Monday, 27 February 2006). Co-located with the historic St Benedict’s Parish at Broadway, the University has transformed a rundown inner-city site to its rightful position, historically, culturally and as a significant Sydney city landmark. The University’s Sydney Campus spokesman, Damian Gleeson, <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> parish and school buildings and presbytery have been sensitively and beautifully restored to form an impressive Campus. ‘A core part of the redevelopment is a major facelift to St Benedict’s Church.

At the end of January 2006 the Broadway Campus held the first of several enrolment sessions for foundation students. Students enrolled for courses in Arts Business, Education, Law and Nursing – moreover they experienced first hand Notre Dame’s culture of friendship and personal attention. Students and staff alike are looking forward to an important year of fellowship and scholarship. Reflecting the flexible nature of courses, many students have elected for double degrees, such as Arts/Business, Arts/Education and Business/Law.

40|$|Peter Browne and Brian Costar go {{rummaging through}} letterboxes in Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s {{marginal}} seats “MANY MEDIA commentators {{do not see}} much of the real campaign these days,” <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> national director of the Liberal Party, Lynton Crosby. “It does not take place on TV, on radio, {{or even in the}} newspapers. It is the local activity on the ground that counts. Letters to voters, postcards, newsletters, telephone canvassing [...] . ” A team of volunteers in marginal seats around Victoria has been collecting direct mail material and forwarding it to us so we can get a sense of this “real campaign. ” So far, we’ve received material from the first three weeks of the election campaign. Not surprisingly, the volume of material - although it varies from electorate to electorate - has not been enormous. At this stage the Liberal Party has significantly out-mailed Labor, both in the cost and number of brochures reaching households. As Lynton Crosby says, the emphasis is on the local. In Kilsyth, for example, a letter from Labor’s Dympna Beard lists a series of local projects - including Croydon’s “new 5. 1 million Police Station” and a 47 million upgrade of Maroondah Hospital - while her Liberal opponent, David Hodgett, promises projects including 150, 000 for CCTV cameras “to cut down on vandalism and petty crime in Mooroolbark” and 4, 544, 948 - a very precise figure! - for local bridges and roads. In Morwell, the message from sitting Labor MP Brendan Jenkins, is also local, but he devotes an unusually long letter to the government’s support for the Gippsland Water Factory and his own role in securing benefits for the local community. The message here is that a sitting member whose party is likely to remain in power {{is in a position to}} influence policy to the benefit of the local electorate. The same message comes through in other marginals. Running alongside the local detail are brochures appearing across all marginal electorates. From the Liberals, the theme of an eight-page brochure is “Let’s Get Victoria Moving Again” - a slogan that seems to hark back to the dominant theme of the 1992 election. The unusual level of detail in this brochure (it’s hard to imagine too many voters reading it right through) is probably designed to convey a conviction that the Liberals have developed serious policies and are ready to govern. Ted Bailleau - in outdoor gear, hand pointing into the distance - appears on each page. “Waste” is the other big theme in the Liberal material. A brochure distributed in many electorates - clearly inspired by the federal party’s visually arresting interest rate “slide rule” at the 2004 election - is in the shape of a wallet. Headlined “ 494. 00. It’s Your Money,” it claims that this is the amount, per taxpayer, spent by the Bracks government on “self-promotion and budget blow-outs. ”News clipping and quotes from the media - overwhelmingly from the Herald Sun - feature in this leaflet and are a common feature across most of the Liberal material. From Labor, the brochures are generally fewer and smaller, with a few notable exceptions. Typical is a postcard-sized leaflet from the state member for Bayswater, Peter Lockwood, which tells us that “Peter Lockwood and Steve Bracks are standing up for working families” and concentrates on achievements since 1999 rather than policy plans. But Dick Wynne, the Labor member for Richmond, has issued a much more arresting four-page colour brochure featuring Labor achievements in his electorate. This brochure also seems to have been inspired by the “Local Achievements and Strong Plans for Our Areas” brochure used in many electorates by the Liberals during the 2004 federal campaign. And Bob Stensholt in Burwood has letterboxed a DVD - received by one of our collectors - featuring footage of the premier and the local member extolling Labor 2 ̆ 7 s virtues. Down in Southern Metropolitan Region the upper and lower house Labor MPs and candidates have taken a different approach, getting together to set up a sophisticated website, www. yourlaborteam. org, and developed some unusually oblique materials. A series of beautifully designed postcards (a contrast to the general run of election material produced by all the parties) uses quotes from H. L. Mencken, Decca Records, the Chairman of IBM and a French physiologist to underline the differences between Labor and its opponents. The person behind this stylish material is probably the upper house candidate Evan Thornley, a former internet entrepreneur who now runs Pluto Press and is active in the Fabian Society. The material is intriguing but clearly pitched at a segment of these well-heeled inner south-eastern electorates - and may well be targeted to people who the campaign manager see as being most receptive to this approach. Both the Liberals and the Nationals are running negative campaigns against the Greens, both via the media and direct mail. A new brochure, first spotted in this final week of the campaign, warns that the Greens “are likely to win control of the Upper House” and that their policies on drugs, the economy and property “will have a drastic effect on all Victorians. ” But you’ll find no evidence in the brochure that the Greens’ policies will have any impact at all on property - unless you count the proposal to increase charges on commercial carparks. And unless you read the fine print you won’t know it’s from the Liberal Party. For the Nationals, the threat of the Greens is more of a life or death matter, and their material dwells on the sharp differences between the two parties. “While the Nationals have commonsense, practical, family orientated policies, the Greens want to decriminalise drug use, ban recreational hunting, close down Gippsland industries and remove jobs,” according to a brochure from Jim King and Peter Hall, upper and lower house Nationals candidates. None of this - nor the attacks on the Greens from Family First and the Shooters Party - is likely to do too much damage to the Green vote, though it might make supporters of the Nationals, Family First and the Shooters vote for their usual party with more enthusiasm. Material from the Greens has been relatively low-key. In inner urban electorates, the party’s brochures stress two main themes: public transport and the achievements of Green councillors in local government. It’s difficult to tell how much targeting is going on within electorates. We know that the two parties are increasingly using sophisticated databases to store information about individual voters - information gathered within electorate offices from phone and mail contact with the sitting member, local media and other sources. As a former Liberal Party staff member, Christian Kerr, has said, “Voters who phone or write to their members of parliament have no idea they are effectively phoning up the direct mail offices. ” On our evidence, the computer only seems to be choosing between families and others when it decides which letter to send to individuals. In Melbourne, for example, voters seem to be receiving either a letter headed “Standing Up for Local Working Families” or one headed “Getting Results for Our Area” from Labor’s Bronwyn Pike. But we would need hundreds of volunteers collecting material in a single electorate to get a real sense of how the databases are being used. No one outside the political parties knows exactly how much they each spend on direct mail material during election campaigns. After the last federal election, “industry sources” told the Australian Financial Review that Labor and the Liberals had each spent about 5 million on direct mail - which was around half the amount the Liberals had spent on TV, radio, newspapers and cinema, and over half what Labor had spent on those media. In this election, the Liberals are undoubtedly outspending Labor on letters and brochures - by perhaps two to one - which might reflect the fact that they have less money to spend on the more expensive options of radio, TV and newspapers. • Peter Browne is editor of APO and Brian Costar is professor of Victorian parliamentary democracy at the Swinburne Institute for Social Research Photo: Alessandro Lippi/iStockphoto. co...|$|E
