50|$|When {{a pair of}} {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the growth medium, {{the system composed of}} electrodes and electrolyte can be modeled with the electrical circuit of Fig. 1, where Rm and Cm are the resistance and capacitance of the bulk medium, while Ri and Ci are the resistance and capacitance of the electrode-electrolyte interface. However, when frequency of the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> applied to the electrodes is relatively low (lower than 1 MHz) the bulk capacitance Cm can be neglected and the system can be modeled with a simpler circuit consisting only of a resistance Rs and a capacitance Cs in series. The resistance Rs accounts for the electrical conductivity of the bulk medium while the capacitance Cs is due to the capacitive double-layer at the electrode-electrolyte interface. During the growth phase, bacterial metabolism transforms uncharged or weakly charged compounds of the bulk medium in highly charged compounds that change the electrical properties of the medium. This results in a decrease of resistance Rs and an increase of capacitance Cs.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the input}} {{waveform}} is time-sampled, instead of continuous, {{the analysis is}} usually done by applying a window function and then a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). But the DFT provides only a sparse sampling of the actual discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) spectrum. Figure 1 shows {{a portion of the}} DTFT for a rectangularly-windowed sinusoid. The actual frequency of the sinusoid is indicated as [...] "0" [...] on the horizontal axis. Everything else is leakage, exaggerated by the use of a logarithmic presentation. The unit of frequency is [...] "DFT bins"; that is, the integer values on the frequency axis correspond to the frequencies sampled by the DFT. So the figure depicts a case where the actual frequency of the sinusoid coincides with a DFT sample, and the maximum value of the spectrum is accurately measured by that sample. When it misses the maximum value by some amount (up to ½ bin), the measurement error is referred to as scalloping loss (inspired by the shape of the peak). For a known frequency, such as a musical note or a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>test</b> <b>signal,</b> matching the frequency to a DFT bin can be prearranged by choices of a sampling rate and a window length that results in an integer number of cycles within the window.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} contributions for {{a general}} description for the derivation of a non-contacting charge estimation and discharge actuation algorithm for the LISA Pathfinder test masses free-flying in a gravitational field in open space. The estimation principle {{is based on the}} application of forces that depend on the charge present on the mass. The discharge principle is based on the photoelectric emission of surfaces illuminated by UV light. The discharge actuation can be supported via the application of constant bias voltages. The content of this work contributes to the derivation of a linearized time variant model valid for any combination of constant or variable voltages that could be present on the electrodes surrounding the test mass. In particular this thesis investigates the application of constant voltages and <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> voltages simultaneously, such that charge estimation and discharge actuation supported by constant bias voltages is possible. Furthermore, the discharge process is analyzed in order to obtain a model suitable for on-board utilization.

Integral part of this thesis is the identification of a control scheme that is able to perform discharge actuation in the fastest way possible. Therefore, a closed-loop control scheme has been designed which is based on continuously estimating the test mass charge and to apply discharge actuation using constant bias voltages at the same time. Finally, the designed fast discharge closed-loop control scheme is traded against an alternative approach currently used as a baseline. This baseline scheme sequentially estimates the test mass charge and then discharges it. The two strategies are compared in terms of robustness against uncertainties in the plant, afterwards as well as in terms of discharge duration...|$|E
