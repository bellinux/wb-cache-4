50|$|Picture-in-picture {{requires}} {{two independent}} tuners or signal sources {{to supply the}} large and the small picture. Two-tuner PiP TVs have a <b>second</b> <b>tuner</b> built in, but a single-tuner PiP TV requires an external signal source, which may be an external tuner, Videocassette recorder, DVD player, or a cable box. Picture-in-picture {{is often used to}} watch one program while waiting for another to start, or advertisements to finish.|$|E
50|$|StarFire instead uses an {{advanced}} receiver to correct for ionospheric effects internally. To do this, it captures the P(Y) signal that is broadcast on two frequencies, L1 and L2, and compares {{the effects of}} the ionosphere on the propagation time of the two. Using this information, the ionospheric effects can be calculated to a very high degree of accuracy, meaning the StarFire dGPS can compensate for variations in propagation delay. The second P(Y) signal is encrypted and cannot be used by civilian receivers directly, but StarFire doesn't use the data contained in the signal; it only compares the phase of the two signals instead. This is expensive in terms of electronics, requiring a <b>second</b> <b>tuner</b> and excellent signal stability to be useful, which is why the StarFire-like solution is not more widely used (at least when it was being created).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} measurement results of two different MMIC impedance tuners for noise parameter measurements at ambient and at cryogenic temperatures. The first design covers the frequency range from 10 to 20 GHz, while the <b>second</b> <b>tuner</b> performs from 15 to 30 GHz. The performance under cryogenic conditions was validated at 7 K with dedicated test structures...|$|E
50|$|From around 1999 to 2005 (when CT100 {{manufacturer}} Raydex {{went out}} of business), CT100 remained the 75 ohm cable of choice for satellite TV and especially BskyB. It had an air-spaced polyethylene dielectric, a 1 mm solid copper core and copper braid on copper foil shield. CT63 was a thinner cable in 'shotgun' style, meaning that it was two cables moulded together and was used mainly by BskyB for the twin connection required by the Sky+ satellite TV receiver, which incorporated a hard drive recording system and a <b>second,</b> independent <b>tuner.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{what may}} have been attempt to {{frustrate}} reception (in some areas) of ARD some early TV sets manufactured in the GDR only tuned the seven channels used by DFF (rather than the full set of 11 VHF channels). Later (following the launch of the <b>second</b> network) UHF <b>tuners</b> were added but early versions only covered {{the lower part of the}} band.|$|R
40|$|The {{relentless}} {{push for}} high performance in custom dig-ital circuits {{has led to}} renewed emphasis on circuit opti-mization or tuning. The parameters of the optimization are typically transistor and interconnect sizes. The de-sign metrics are not just delay, transition times, power and area, but also signal integrity and manufacturability. This tutorial paper discusses some of the recently pro-posed methods of circuit optimization, {{with an emphasis on}} practical application and methodology impact. Circuit optimization techniques fall into three broad categories. The rst is dynamic tuning, based on time-domain simulation of the underlying circuit, typically combined with adjoint sensitivity computation. These methods are accurate but require the specication of in-put signals, and are best applied to small data- ow cir-cuits and -sections " of larger circuits. Ecient sensitivity computation renders feasible the tuning of cir-cuits with a few thousand transistors. <b>Second,</b> static <b>tuners</b> employ static timing analysis to evaluate the per-formance of the circuit. All paths through the logic are simultaneously tuned, and no input vectors are required. Large control macros are best tuned by these methods. However, in the context of deep submicron custom de-sign, the inaccuracy of the delay models employed by these methods often limits their utility. Aggressive dy-namic or static tuning can push a circuit into a precip-itous corner of the manufacturing process space, which is a problem addressed by the third class of circuit op-timization tools, statistical tuners. Statistical techniques are used to enhance manufacturability or maximize yield. In addition to surveying the above techniques, topics {{such as the use of}} state-of-the-art nonlinear optimization methods and special considerations for interconnect siz-ing, clock tree optimization and noise-aware tuning will be brie y considered. ...|$|R
