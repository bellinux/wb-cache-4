5|$|The striped honeyeater's song is {{described}} as a chirp, chirp, cherry, cherry, its contact call as a sharp chewee and its alarm call as a <b>shrill</b> whistling note.|$|E
5|$|The call {{consists}} of weak staccato, chirping whistles, kleek kik ik ik ik, somewhat similar in cadence to a gull's call. The calls of young birds {{tend to be}} more harsh and <b>shrill</b> than those of adults.|$|E
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a <b>shrill,</b> {{piercing}} quality and {{can be difficult to}} tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
50|$|The {{calls of}} the royal tern are usually short, clear <b>shrills.</b> Some of the <b>shrills</b> sound like kree or tsirr; the royal tern also has a more plover like whistle that is longer, rolling and is more melodious.|$|R
60|$|The {{little man}} smiled a {{suffering}} smile. The twang of his toneless voice sounded a trifle <b>shriller.</b>|$|R
50|$|The American {{black metal}} group Wolves in the Throne Room employ long <b>shrilling</b> screams {{influenced}} by Gorgoroth's early works.|$|R
5|$|Young have a <b>shrill</b> closed-bill call, {{which they}} use in begging and to contact their parents. They {{also have a}} long call used in {{response}} to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The <b>shrill</b> pseep flight call is intermediate between the soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit and the water pipit's short, thin fist.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The New York Times Book Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} <b>shrill</b> hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But this {{shall be}} a great war--a war of eight thousand.' Kim's voice <b>shrilled</b> across the quick-gathering crowd, {{astonishing}} himself.|$|R
6000|$|Whereon, out of {{the stern}} sheets, arose, like an angry ghost, the portly figure of Lucy Passmore, and shrieked in <b>shrillest</b> treble-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3 The snappish cur (the passenger's annoy) [...] Close at my heel with yelping treble flies; [...] The whimpering girl, and hoarser-screaming boy, [...] Join to the yelping treble <b>shrilling</b> cries; [...] The scolding quean to louder notes doth rise, [...] And {{her full}} pipes those <b>shrilling</b> cries confound; [...] To her full pipes the {{grunting}} hog replies; [...] The grunting hogs alarm the neighbours round, [...] And curs, girls, boys, and scolds, {{in the deep}} base are drown'd.|$|R
5|$|Jumpscares {{are present}} {{in all of the}} series' main games, and occur when any animatronic manages to reach and attack the player-{{character}}. Most jumpscares involve an animatronic character suddenly appearing in the player's view, followed by a loud, bellowing sound. Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with <b>shrill,</b> distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or restart the game. The player can utilise the tools listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a <b>shrill</b> kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a <b>shrill</b> whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eighteen {{days in the}} longboat," [...] the Ancient Mariner <b>shrilled,</b> to Daughtry's startlement. [...] "Eighteen days in the longboat, {{eighteen}} days of scorching hell." ...|$|R
60|$|And Torfrida's bold song, coming {{clear and}} sweet across the water, rose louder and <b>shriller</b> till it almost drowned the jabbering of the witch.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hold your tongue,' shrieked Miss Squeers, in her <b>shrillest</b> tone; 'or you'll make me slap you, 'Tilda, and {{afterwards}} I should be sorry for it!' ...|$|R
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a <b>shrill</b> wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the key in the system termination switch, a <b>shrill</b> humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and <b>shrill</b> carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
6000|$|... '"But woe betide the <b>shrilling</b> horn, [...] The chase's surly cheer! [...] And {{ever that}} hunter is forlorn [...] Whom first at morn I hear."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I am Guenevra, {{his lady}} and his love," [...] replied the female, in tones which, being <b>shriller,</b> were yet wilder {{than those of}} her companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three tramps, eh? An' goin' to rob you? Why, I {{never heard}} of sech a thing!" [...] he <b>shrilled.</b> [...] "Mebbe I'd better git my gun." ...|$|R
5|$|The Monks, {{referred}} to by the name monks on record sleeves, were an American garage rock band formed in Gelnhausen, Germany in 1964. Assembled by five American G.I.s stationed in the country, the group grew tired of the traditional format of rock, which motivated them to forge a highly experimental style characterized by an emphasis on hypnotic rhythms that minimized the role of melody, augmented {{by the use of}} sound manipulation techniques. The band's unconventional blend of <b>shrill</b> vocals, feedback, and guitarist David Day's six-string banjo baffled audiences, but music historians have since identified the Monks as a pioneering force in avant-garde music. The band's lyrics often voiced objection to the Vietnam War and the apparently dehumanized state of society, while prefiguring the harsh and blunt commentary of the punk rock movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The band's appearance was considered as shocking as its music, as they attempted to mimic the look of Catholic monks by wearing black habits with cinctures symbolically tied around their necks, and hair worn in partially shaved tonsures.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the <b>shrill</b> pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prominent}} {{forms of}} display among these animals is whistling and bounding. Instead of scent-marking its territory, the reedbuck {{will give a}} <b>shrill</b> whistle to make the boundaries of its territory be known. As it whistles, it expels air through its nose with such a force that the whole of its body vibrates. These whistles, usually one to three in number, are followed by a few stotting bounds. This behaviour {{is also used to}} raise alarm in herds. In this, the reedbuck raises its neck, exposing the white patch on its throat, but keeping the tail down, and leaps in a way similar to the impala's jumps, landing on its forelegs. This is accompanied by the popping of the inguinal glands in the legs. Fights begin with both opponents holding their horns low, in a combat stance; followed by the locking of horns and pushing one another. These fights can even lead to deaths.|$|E
6000|$|... "There he is!" [...] Teenie {{cried in}} his <b>shrillest</b> tones. [...] "Now let's see {{you go for}} him! He's actin' as if he owned the whole town!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are you saying?" [...] she <b>shrilled.</b> [...] "D'ye {{hear the}} filthy fellow, Rotherby? He'll not name the wanton in my {{presence}} {{out of respect for}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An evil day for thee, Abu Hussein," [...] he <b>shrilled</b> {{into the}} mouth of the earth. [...] "A day of {{obstacles}} to thy flagitious returns in the morning." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a <b>shrill,</b> barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E
25|$|The call is a <b>shrill</b> peeping.|$|E
25|$|Marbled polecats {{are most}} active {{during the morning}} and evening. Their {{eyesight}} is weak and they rely on a well-developed sense of smell. Vocalization is limited and consists of <b>shrill</b> alarm cries, grunts and a submissive long shriek.|$|E
6000|$|... "What? What?" [...] <b>shrilled</b> Henry Grisley, {{turning his}} beadlike {{eyes on the}} lawyer. [...] "Twenty-five dollars? Not much! I'll give ye ten dollars and not a cent more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it ain't! It's so!" [...] <b>shrilled</b> the old farmer. [...] "They {{killed the}} cows, an' I'm {{on my way}} to put 'em in the Haven Point lock-up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at them {{low down}} white trash out there!" [...] she <b>shrilled,</b> {{pointing}} toward the Arrow. [...] "They-all's a desecrating us, right here on this here perverted island." ...|$|R
