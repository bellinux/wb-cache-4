This work presents experimental study on conditions for BUE formation and its effects in micro milling of biocompatible 316 L stainless steel. <b>Surface</b> <b>finish</b> and BUE density on a micro milled surface are used to quantify the presence of BUE. A new micro tool is used for each milling condition. A BUE, embedded onto a milled surface, is identified by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the quality of}} <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> when threading titanium-based alloy under dry condition. The quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> was studied at various cutting parameters and at the two extreme stages of the machining process, i. e. {{at the beginning and}} end of the process. The objective is to evaluate the effect of a worn-out tool on the quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> PVD-coated carbide tools were used in this study. Experiments were conducted at two cutting speeds, 35 and 55 m/min, two depths of cut, 0. 2 and 0. 25 mm, and a constant pitch of 2. 0 mm. The tool wear and the quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> were inspected visually by microscope. The tool’s flank wear was measured gradually and machining was stopped when the flank wear reached the rejection criterion of 0. 3 mm. The microstructure beneath the machined surface was also evaluated. It was found that, at the beginning of machining, there was only a feed mark on the <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> When the machining was prolonged until the tools reached the rejection criterion, a bad <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> was produced. Metal debris, surface cavities and a boundary crack were observed. Results show that machining with a worn-out tool can cause microstructure alteration beneath the machined surface. The selection of cutting parameters and monitoring of tool wear are crucial in order to obtain a good <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> Characterization of the <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> with respect to the threading process under a dry condition would ultimately help in the development of suitable parameters for machining titanium-based alloys. <b>Surface</b> <b>finish,</b> microstructure, dry machining...|$|R

Automakers pursue to attain <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> of class A for composite panels, in which they believe class A's <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> should be very smooth and beautiful.

Very often {{one of the}} main objectives of grinding process is to obtain very good <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> The present investigation takes into account the effects of common grinding parameters on <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> obtained in cylindrical grinding. The material selected is mild steel. The grinding wheel dimensions and its specification are kept in-varied.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>finish</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters to be controlled during machining as it affects many functional properties of components. It can be effected by workpiece and cutting tool material, geometry cutting fluid, and cutting conditions. When machining at low cutting speeds a cutting fluid with good lubricant propel ties is often recommended to improve <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> This improvement is often thought to affect built up edge (BUE) formation, which is a major cause of poor <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> This work studies the effect of sulphur; an extreme pressure (EP) additive, in an oil lubricant on the <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> of an AISI 1040 steel machined with a cemented carbide cutting tool. The application of a lubricant, with and without sulphur, does not prevent the formation of BUE but does affect the <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> This work suggests that the BUE is squeezed against the workpiece material close to the tool nose affecting <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> This region is where lubricant acts to improve surface quality and therefore very low volume of lubricant should be sufficient.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>finish</b> is {{the most}} desired {{characteristics}} to be on product surface. This is because <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> is a predictor {{of the performance of}} a mechanical component, since irregularities in the surface may form nucleation sites for cracks or corrosion. In this study, the impact of mold material and coating on <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> in sand casting was investigated. By using different kind of material to make the mold and evaluating whether coating give effect to product <b>surface</b> <b>finish,</b> the experiment had been done in 4 different tests by using sand casting process as a method to make the final product. In sand casting process, mold material and coating are two significant concerns, but they have different impact in <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> In producing part using sand casting, analyzing test is commonly made between these two features to get good quality <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> A result among these two different parameters concerns can be achieved by getting the experiment done which on the other hand, selection of better mold material and use of coating will further provide an improved solution. In this thesis, efforts towards determining good <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> will be decide using different mold properties and coating. The quality of the surface roughness is determined by using visual and analysis. This Surface Roughness is obtained based on the analyzed using MAHR Perthometer s 2. In this present work, the main objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the effect of coating between two patterns and decide which one has a better <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> and to compare mold material whether carbon dioxide, CO 2 molding or Greensand molding with and without coating and their effect in product <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> The standard design approach is implemented in this experimental study where it only consists of 2 factors at one time which are coating and mold material. 2 patterns and 4 final products are produced, whereby the study output is surface roughness, Ra (µm). In this study, MAHR Perthometer s 2 is used to measure the surface roughness. The comparison between pattern and product will be analyzed. From the findings, it is shown that that product that used carbon dioxide CO 2 as mold material and covered with coating has the best <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> Based on the study analysis, it is discovered that using green sand as mold material and not using coating produces poor <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> while carbon dioxide CO 2 with coating produces good <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> products...|$|R
