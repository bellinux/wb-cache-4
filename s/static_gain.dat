40|$|The {{economic}} benefits of trade liberalisation are conventionally divided into two parts: <b>static</b> <b>gains</b> and dynamic <b>gains.</b> <b>Static</b> <b>gains</b> refer to the advantages of increased specialisation arising from easier access to international markets. They lie {{at the core of}} the classical theory of comparative advantage. It was <b>static</b> <b>gains</b> Ricardo had in mind in his famed and much-debated assertion that international trade increases 2 ̆ 7 the mass of commodities and the sum 2 ̆ 7 of enjoyments 2 ̆ 7. Other benefits, however, may accrue. First, freer trade may lead to more exploitation of economies of scale. Secondly, it may create more competitive conditions in national markets thereby increasing productive efficiency. Finally, faster economic growth may ensue on account of enhanced long-run investment opportunities. For example, it is argued that industries producing new technically-sophisticated products will develop only in the context of extremely large integrated markets. These last three types of gain constitute the dynamic gains from international trade...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{to achieve a}} high <b>static</b> <b>gain</b> in nonisolated dc-dc converter is presented in this paper. The conventional boost converter is cascaded to step-up the voltage to higher level and the first boost stage is multi-phased to avoid high input current stress on the switch. The multi-phase configuration significantly reduces the current ripple and the voltage ripple due to {{the operation of the}} parallel paths and hence reducing the filter size. This technique allows the operation with a high <b>static</b> <b>gain</b> and high efficiency, making possible to design a compact circuit.

40|$|Abstract—Motivated by {{increasing}} the scanning performance of the atomic force microscope (AFM), many efforts {{have been made to}} analyze the system behavior of an AFM system, mainly in Z-axis, and then to develop more advanced controllers. However, most of the previously derived models involve complex physical or mathematical analysis, and many parameters need to be identified for actual application. In this paper, an empirical model is obtained for the Z-axis dynamics of an AFM system by utilizing experimental data. Specifically, the model consists of a dynamical component and multiple <b>static</b> <b>gains.</b> As introduced in the paper, the N 4 SID algorithm is first employed to derive the dynamical part based on input-output data.

40|$|This study {{proposed}} a gain scheduled controller for {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) and variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) systems with a model-based gain scheduling strategy to manage strong nonlinearity in diesel engines. The feedback controller uses a gain scheduling strategy to obtain appropriate controller gains of the PI controller under various engine operating conditions. The gain scheduling strategy is designed using the proposed <b>static</b> <b>gain</b> model that predicts varying static gains of EGR and VGT plants. The <b>static</b> <b>gain</b> model uses scheduling variables derived from indirect measurements of the EGR mass flow such as the pressure ratio of the intake and exhaust manifolds and the exhaust air-to-fuel ratio. The scheduling variables are effective to reduce a large <b>static</b> <b>gain</b> dispersion caused by various operating conditions of the EGR and VGT actuators. With the predicted static gains of the plant, a Skogestad internal model control (SIMC) method determines PI gains in runtime. The proposed control algorithm is evaluated through engine experiments. The experimental results proved that the integrated absolute error (IAE) and overshoot of the gain scheduled feedback controller are significantly reduced compared to the fixed gain controller.

40|$|This paper quantitatively {{identifies}} {{the impact of}} trade liberalization on foreign direct investment in Pakistan over the period of 1990 to 2005. The main interest of this study how different variables of trade liberalization affect foreign direct investment in Pakistan. The trade liberalization has been measured through four variables that are custom and other duties, taxes, taxes on income profit and capital gain, and interest payment. The study uses Feasible Generalized Least Squares for estimating the results. The variables custom and other duties and taxes on income and capital gain show the statistically significant impact on foreign direct investment. Taxes and interest payment shows the insignificant impact on foreign direct investment. 1. 1 INTRODUCITON The world economy is globalizing and all the countries are experiencing worldwide trade liberalization because in today’s world no country can afford to remain isolated. Trade liberalizations {{are one of the}} most important incentives for foreign direct investment and it results in inflow of foreign direct reserves.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{computational}} tool to assist power system engineers {{in the field}} tuning of power system stabilizers (PSSs) and Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVRs). The outcome of this tool is a range of gain values for theses controllers within {{which there is a}} theoretical guarantee of stability for the closed-loop system. This range is given as a set of limit values for the <b>static</b> <b>gains</b> of the controllers of interest, {{in such a way that}} the engineer responsible for the field tuning of PSSs and/or AVRs can be confident with respect to system stability when adjusting the corresponding <b>static</b> <b>gains</b> within this range. This feature of the proposed tool is highly desirable from a practical viewpoint, since the PSS and AVR commissioning stage always involve some readjustment of the controller gains to account for the differences between the nominal model and the actual behavior of the system. By capturing these differences as uncertainties in the model, this computational tool is able to guarantee stability for the whole uncertain model using an approach based on linear matrix inequalities. It is also important to remark that the tool proposed in this paper can also be applied to other types of parameters of either PSSs or Power Oscillation Dampers, as well as other types of controllers (such as speed governors, for example). To show its effectiveness, applications of the proposed tool to two benchmarks for small signal stability studies are presented at the end of this paper...|$|R

40|$|This {{study focused}} on a new method to find {{accurate}} performance measures of a mediolateral centre of mass(CoM) -controlled visual tracking task, which might be sensitive enough to detect problems in balance control early on. Visual tracking tasks, controlled by mediolateral CoM displacement, have shown promising results in this respect. The task was performed by twenty-one healthy subjects who had to track an unpredictable horizontally moving target on the screen with a tracker which was controlled by mediolateral CoM displacement. The test was performed under three conditions: The CoM displacement was controlled by either a <b>static</b> <b>gain,</b> an integrator or a double integrator before the displacement of the tracker was displayed on the screen. The results were analysed in the frequency domain. In this study the McRuer crossover-model, which was developed for aviation, was {{used to describe the}} frequency response of the participants while performing a visual tracking task in three test conditions. The three performance measures, the effective time delay, the crossover frequency and the cutoff frequency, were calculated from this estimator. The overall coherence of the double integrator condition was extremely low, so these results were not taken into discussion. Nevertheless, the McRuer crossover model appeared to be a good descriptor for the frequency response of the subjects during balance controlled visual tracking tasks in the <b>static</b> <b>gain</b> and integrator conditions. The test-retest reliability of the parameters was tested among nine of the subjects, {{no significant differences between the}} three tests were found. The crossover frequency and the cutoff frequency, of both the <b>static</b> <b>gain</b> and integrator conditions have their advantages and disadvantages on behalf of the early detection of people at risk of falling. However, the two test conditions should be repeated with a larger subject group, as well as a subject group with known impaired balance, to find out which performance measure is the most accurate and sensitive to detect problems in balance early on.
