This paper {{studies the}} {{chemical}} combustion reaction of {{coke oven gas}} coupled with radiation heat transfer in the <b>slab</b> reheating <b>furnace.</b> Three dimensional temperature distributions of the produced gases and slabs in the combustion furnace are investigates numerically.

Radiative heat flux within the furnace including the effect of furnace walls, combustion gases, skid beams and buttons is calculated using the FVM and is applied as the boundary condition of the transient conduction equation of the slab.

A discrete Kalman filter (KF) is established to estimate the SDM parameters. A covariance control formulation is introduced to split the system closed-loop variance/covariance into two terms, one term to account for the minimum expected quadratic loss bound (equivalent to the minimum variance performance bound but in state space formulation), and another to account for performance deviations from the minimum variance bound. Simulation studies have been conducted on several nonlinear process systems including a cold rolling mill model with roll eccentricity and a steel making system with real time oxyfuel <b>slab</b> reheating <b>furnace</b> control data.

40|$|Steel {{reheating}} is an energy-intensive process requiring uniform {{temperature distribution}} within reheating furnaces. Historically, recuperators have ben used to preheat combustion air, thereby conserving energy. More recent innovations include oxygen enrichment {{and the use}} of regenerative burners, which provide higher preheat air temperatures than recuperators. These processes have limitations such as equipment deterioration, decreasing energy efficiency over time, high maintenance costs, and increased NO{sub x} emissions with increased air preheat temperature, unless special equipment is used. Praxair, Inc., supplier of oxygen and other industrial gases to the steel industry, proposes to introduce an innovative oxy-fuel burner technology (using 100 % oxygen) to the steel reheating industry. Oxy-fuel combustion reduces or eliminates nitrogen in combustion air and substantially reduces waste heat carried out with flue gas. Based on technology currently used in the glass, hazardous waste, and aluminum industries, Praxair has developed and patented low temperature, oxy-fuel burners {{that can be used in}} high temperature industrial furnaces where temperature uniformity is critical and extremely low NO{sub x} emissions are desired. The technical goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of oxy-fuel burners in a <b>slab</b> reheat <b>furnace</b> while reducing energy consumption by 45 % and NO{sub x} emissions by 90 % within the converted furnace zones. Successful implementation of this technology also will eliminate the need to periodically replace recuperators and install NO{sub x} removal equipment...|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{can be used}} as a useful design tool for studying new furnace configurations with different operating conditions. However, this potential cannot be realized until the numerical models that are used in the simulations are fully validated against experimental results. In the present work, the combustion process in an experimental regenerative, <b>slab</b> reheat <b>furnace</b> was simulated in order to validate several numerical models in the FLUENT code. A total of 14 cases employing different numerical models were simulated with a uniform fuel distribution. Out of the 14 cases, only 11 obtained a converged solution. The results from these 11 cases were compared against experimental measurements in terms of the energy input and output rates and the temperature distribution in the center of the slab. The three best cases in terms of both accuracy and computational effort were cases that employed the k-epsilon turbulence model, the Delta Thesis, and a constant absorption coefficient. These three cases were simulated again using a second set of operating conditions in order to evaluate their performance in the case of a non-uniform fuel distribution. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Abstract—A {{mathematical}} {{heat transfer}} {{model for the}} prediction of transient heating of the slab in a direct-fired walking beam type reheating furnace has been developed by considering the nongray thermal radiation with given furnace environments. The furnace is modeled as radiating nongray medium with carbon dioxide and water with five-zoned gas temperature and the furnace wall is considered as a constant temperature lower than furnace gas one. The slabs are moving with constant velocity depending on the residence time through the non-firing, charging, preheating, heating, and final soaking zones. Radiative heat flux obtained by considering the radiative heat exchange inside the furnace as well as convective one from the surrounding hot gases are introduced as boundary condition of the transient heat conduction within the slab. After validating thermal radiation model adopted in this work, thermal fields in both model and real reheating furnace are investigated in terms of radiative heat flux in the furnace and temperature inside the slab. The {{results show that the}} <b>slab</b> in the <b>furnace</b> can be more heated with higher slab emissivity and residence time...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{processes}} have been modeled and controlled, namely the plate thickness {{control and the}} slab temperature control. The classical solution for the thickness control problem can't handle asymmetric hardness variations and the estimation of the controlled output introduces stability problems. A nonlinear multivariable model for the thickness control system is derived. The parameters of {{the model for the}} rolling mill are identified using data from The Danish Steel Works Ltd. and the model is used for designing a nonlinear multivariable thickness control algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations and the new controller is able to handle the asymmetric case and gives a more accurate thickness control compared to the existing control system. The new control strategy is also found to be stable. The task of the slab temperature controller is to ensure a high furnace throughput, and a proper heating quality while minimizing the energy consumption. Models for the <b>slab</b> and <b>furnace</b> temperatures are identified using data collected during normal production at The Danish Steel Works Ltd. A new way of obtaining parameters for the existing slab temperature control system is described. Furthermore, a nonlinear controller is designed which it is shown to be is globally asymptotically stable. The performance of the linear and nonlinear controller are compared using computer simulations which show that the performance of the nonlinear controller is superior to the performance of the linear controller. The linear slab temperature controller design has been implemented in the slab temperature control system at The Danish Steel Works Ltd. The experimental results indicate that the new controller parameters have lead to a 10 % increase in furnace capacity, with unchanged heating quality. Data from the reheat furnace no. 2 indicate that the energy consumption has not been increased by the adjustments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{cooperative}} effort was to evaluate the potential of Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys, such as IC 221 M and IC 396 M, for use as transfer rolls in heating treating <b>furnaces</b> and <b>slab</b> reheating <b>furnaces</b> used during the normal hot processing of steel ingots into rolled products. Rolls consist of three parts: the center tube section which forms the roll surface {{in direct contact with}} the steel, and the sections welded {{at each end of the}} tube, called trunnions, which bear the load. The work in this CRADA focused on weldments and base materials. The transfer rolls in the furnaces used in the hot processing of steel have been made, almost exclusively, from iron-chromium-nickel heat resistant alloys for over 35 years. The iron-based heat resistant alloys experience a variety of problems when exposed to temperatures above 760 C including: cracking, dimensional instability, and excessive oxidation. Many defects in rolled steel products can be traced directly to rolls used in the processing. Also the demand for higher quality products, spurred in part by competition from foreign producers, requires that various avenues for improving overall quality of rolled steel products be pursued. Initial work done by the Contractor and Metallamics indicated that Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys may perform better than existing iron-chromium-nickel alloys do as transfer rolls in heat treating furnaces. The use of Ni{sub 3 }Al may lead to rolls with longer operational life, improved high temperature oxidation resistance and mechanical properties, higher quality rolled steel products, and improved energy and operational efficiencies in the hot processing of steel. The goal of the work was to test Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys for the transfer roll application in order to improve process efficiency, minimize waste by virtue of producing rolled steel of higher quality and to enhance the competitiveness of US-based steel producers...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} aims at {{developing a}} new multiaxial constitutive model for concrete in the fire situation. In addition to validity at the material level, a crucial feature of a constitutive model is the applicability at the structural level; yet for concrete in fire there remains {{a serious lack of}} models combining reliability and robustness. The theoretical aspects and validation of the new model, which rely on a plastic-damage formulation, {{have been the subject of}} a former publication; they are briefly summarized here. This paper explores the capabilities of the concrete model for being used in a performance-based structural fire engineering framework. Several examples of numerical simulations by non-linear finite element method are discussed, with emphasis on practical applications that are demanding for the material model. In particular, it is shown that the simulations using the new concrete model succeed in capturing, at ambient temperature, the crack pattern in a plain concrete specimen and the influence of the loading path on reinforced concrete (RC) slabs. At high temperature, the presented applications include a RC <b>slab</b> subjected to <b>furnace</b> fire and a large-scale composite steel–concrete structure subjected to natural fire. In the numerical analyses, no parameter calibration was required on the particular concrete type, except for the uniaxial strengths and tensile crack energy which are to be defined case-by-case. The results illustrate the reliability and numerical robustness of the model. Also, they suggest that satisfactory prediction of structural behavior in fire can be obtained when no additional data is available on the specific properties of the particular concrete mix that is used in the project, as is often the case in practice, by using standard values of parameters.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{physical}} mechanisms responsible for experimental observations {{that led to}} the definition of "photo-induced hydrogen outgassing of glass". Doped borosilicate glass samples were placed inside an evacuated silica tube and heated in a furnace or by an incandescent lamp. It was observed that hydrogen release from the glass sample was faster and stronger when heated by an incandescent lamp than within a furnace. Here, sample and silica tube were modeled as plane-parallel <b>slabs</b> exposed to <b>furnace</b> or to lamp thermal radiation. Combined conduction, radiation, and mass transfer were accounted for by solving the one-dimensional transient mass and energy conservation equations along with the steady-state radiative transfer equation. All properties were found in the literature. The experimental observations can be qualitatively explained based on conventional thermally activated gas diffusion and by carefully accounting for the participation of the silica tube to radiation transfer along with the spectral properties of the silica tube and the glass samples. In brief, the radiation emitted by the incandescent lamp is concentrated between 0. 5 and 3. 0 μm and reaches directly the sample since the silica tube is nearly transparent for wavelengths up to 3. 5 μm. On the contrary, for furnace heating at 400 °C, the silica tube absorbs a large fraction of the incident radiation which reduces the heating rate and the H 2 release rate. However, between 0. 8 and 3. 2 μm undoped borosilicate does not absorb significantly. Coincidentally, Fe 3 O 4 doping increases the absorption coefficient and also reacts with H 2 to form ferrous ions which increase the absorption coefficient of the sample by two orders of magnitude. Thus, doped and reacted samples heat up much faster when exposed to the heating lamp resulting in the observed faster response time and larger H 2 release rate...|$|R
