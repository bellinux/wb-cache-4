40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of transport operators seeking permits to operate nonstandard or purpose-built vehicle types, information is required to assist road authorities to determine which vehicle types could operate on the road network without compromising the safety of other road users. A project was created by ARRB TR to develop guidelines for determining route access for heavy vehicles. This project was developed in conjunction with the state road authorities, the National Road Transport Commission and the transport industry to obtain an understanding of the road space requirements for a range of common vehicle types. This project {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Two series of field experiments were conducted with six common heavy vehicle types on public roads west of Parkes NSW. Information collected during these full-scale experiments was used to increase the knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of these vehicles and to develop model route access guidelines. Data obtained from these field experiments also provided information to validate computer models and simulation outputs. This thesis showed that: 1) There was experimental evidence to demonstrate that vehicle lateral movement is excited by differences in vehicle wheelpath profiles (point-by-point pavement crossfall), which make a contribution to trailing fidelity (<b>swept</b> <b>width),</b> offtracking and swept path; 2) Vehicle type and speed are prime influences on the lateral movement of the rear trailer and therefore an important input into the model route access guidelines. Notwithstanding the practical and safety implications of applying different speed limits for various vehicle types, speed is a prime contributor to vehicle lateral movement and should be considered when determining route access; 3) Limited lateral position information suggested that one driver of two vehicle types position the vehicles so that the tyres on the rear trailer track on the sealed pavement and not on the pavement shoulder; 4) Based on a statistical analysis of the data obtained from the small sample which only considered the average crossfall of each test section the relative importance of the key parameters was (highest to lowest), IRI, vehicle speed and vehicle type. It was shown that good estimates of lateral movement can be obtained using a double integration technique of the measured lateral acceleration, without applying compensation for the trailer roll or the pavement crossfall. It is recommended that route access guidelines be developed using the lateral performance of a larger sample of vehicles in each class of heavy vehicles operating over a larger range of road types. The route access guidelines should contain a matrix of information on vehicle type/length, pavement condition roughness/profile and lane width. This would provide operators and regulators with a desk-top assessment tool for determining route access...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{articulated}} structures seen {{in train}} or tram applications are being applied in road transportation systems, {{for use in}} mass passenger transit. When articulated vehicles are driven on public roads, they no longer follow a guided track. Therefore, {{there are a lot}} of control elements that need to be considered, such as turning radius, <b>swept</b> path <b>width,</b> off-track-ing, and swing-out. Some of the currently available articulated vehicles on roads are equipped with an independent drive system; a system that has one motor at each wheel. Through this drive system, each wheel can be independently controlled, making precise and quick dynamic stability control possible. In this paper, we propose a torque distribution algorithm tha...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTrucks with {{semi-trailers}} {{are widely}} used for transportation of goods due their low operation cost, but inherent to these vehicles are some problems such as a poor maneuverability. To minimize {{the effects of this}} disadvantage, among other solutions, the incorporation of steerable axles in the semitrailers has been proposed. This paper presents a steering equation, and a fuzzy-logic controller for a semi-trailer automatic forced-steering system to minimize the off-tracking and the total <b>swept</b> path <b>width,</b> resulting in an improvement of vehicle's maneuverability at low speeds. To accomplish this, the suggested control algorithm considers the articulation angle and parameters such as vehicle speed and direction. The system was tested on an instrumented experimental semi-trailer during various predetermined test maneuvers...|$|R
40|$|Rear wheel {{steering}} {{is a well-known}} technology that has been researched for many years but have only had limited market acceptance in niche applications. Increased urbanization {{and the advent of}} autonomous drive could change the impact of rear {{wheel steering}} in favor of greater market acceptance but in what way needs to be better understood. Low-speed maneuverability and highway lateral comfort are two attributes believed to be affected by the introduction of rear wheel steering. Lateral comfort includes comfort in the general sense with vibrations and high-frequency oscillations, but also low-frequency oscillations which may lead to motion sickness. A literature study was conducted in order to better understand the nature of motion which causes discomfort in automobiles, and means of evaluating comfort. A frequency weighting according to ISO-standard was used for comfort and a weighting found in literature was used for motion sickness in the lateral direction as this is still an unexplored area. Maneuverability was assessed using two analytical cases; curvature and <b>swept</b> path <b>width,</b> and two driving scenarios; rear-end parking and driving through a T-crossing. Two control laws were used; one feedforward and one feedback. The feedforward control law was designed to keep the body side slip angle zero at steady state cornering, and the feedback control was taken from literature with the aim of dampening yaw rate. This control law is mainly designed for stability, and was thus not used in low-speed maneuvers and only used for comparison in highway maneuvers. The angle on the rear wheels was limited to +/- 5 Â°. Rear wheel steering performed well at low speeds, improving the maneuverability by increasing the maximum curvature for a given steering wheel angle by 12 % and decreasing the <b>swept</b> path <b>width</b> up to 14 %. The vehicle with rear wheel steering also performed better in the driving scenarios by occupying less space during the maneuver. Overtaking and a sinus steer were the two maneuvers used to assess comfort and motion sickness. Rear wheel steering at high speeds decreased the measures of discomfort by 8. 17 % in the sinus steer maneuver and with 18. 16 % for a passenger in the rear seat, and MSDV is decreased by 7. 32 % in the sinus steer and by 4. 04 % in the overtaking maneuver for a passenger in the rear seat, implying that a vehicle equipped with rear wheel steering is more comfortable. Yaw stability was assessed as a final objective where it was shown that rear wheel steering, both the feedforward and feedback control, improved stability leading to a safer vehicle. To conclude, {{the results of this study}} implies that rear wheel steering can lead to improved maneuverability in low-speeds, improved comfort during highway driving, and improved safety in terms of stability...|$|R
60|$|General Greene, with a {{considerable}} force, was stationed at Brooklyn. He had acquainted himself {{with all the}} localities of the island, from Hell Gate to the Narrows, and made his plan of defence accordingly. His troops were diligently occupied in works which he laid out, about a mile beyond the village of Brooklyn, and facing {{the interior of the}} island, whence a land attack might be attempted. Brooklyn was immediately opposite to New York. The Sound, commonly called the East River, in that place about three quarters of a mile in <b>width,</b> <b>swept</b> its rapid tides between them. The village stood on a kind of peninsula, formed by the deep inlets of Wallabout Bay on the north, and Gowanus Cove on the south. A line of intrenchments and strong redoubts extended across the neck of the peninsula, from the bay to a swamp and creek emptying into the cove. To protect the rear of the works from the enemy's ships, a battery was erected at Red Hook, the south-west corner of the peninsula, and a fort on Governor's Island, nearly opposite.|$|R

From the Sea strategic concept has expanded naval operations from open-ocean, blue-water combat environments to the littoral regions in which naval mines can both {{be an extremely}} menacing threat to U. S. forces and an effective force multiplier for the Fleet. The Navy/Marine Corps must have efficient Mine Warfare (MIW) forces to ensure the Fleet can carry out operations in the open ocean and littorals, including maintaining open sea lanes of communication and supporting Ship-to- Objective Maneuver Warfare from the Sea while denying operating areas to the enemy. Every ship has a magnetic signature, which is caused by its iron and steel components. Additionally, the earth's natural magnetic field induces a magnetization in a ship depending on its latitude, longitude, and heading. Exploitation of surface ship and submarine magnetic field signatures by naval influence mines has occurred throughout time. In order to calculate the <b>swept</b> path <b>width</b> for magnetic minesweeping systems currently in use by the U. S. Mine Warfare (MIW) forces, {{it is necessary to}} calculate the vector components of the magnetic field strength which are generated by each of several possible system configurations. The Navy's Magnetic Model addresses this needed capability. The Navy's N-Layer Magnetic Model (NLMM) is used to predict the expected performance of magnetic minesweeping equipment in a complex environment consisting of N layers, each with arbitrary conductivity and thickness. The model is used to compute the magnetic field strength produced by various U. S. Navy magnetic minesweeping configurations using a random environmental vertical conductivity structure. To better determine which parameters had the greatest effect on the model, and which could be simplified or enhanced, a series of tests were run on actual data sets.
