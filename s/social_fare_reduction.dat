5000|$|The cost of Coaster tickets {{is based}} upon the number of zones {{traveled}} (see map). Fare collection is based on a proof-of-payment system: tickets must be purchased before boarding and are checked by roving fare inspectors. Monthly passes are available. All tickets and passes include transfer agreements with NCTD BREEZE buses and monthly passes include transfer with the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) buses and Trolleys. On January 20, 2011, the NCTD implemented a <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> - the <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> led to increased ridership on the Coaster and so was made a permanent <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> in September 2011.

50|$|In 2009, Chiba Prefecture {{and several}} {{municipalities}} {{along the line}} agreed with Hokuso Railway for an average <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> of 4.6% (25% for student commuter passes), in exchange for which they agreed to subsidize half of the estimated revenue loss of 600 million yen. The <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> was implemented in July 2010 {{at the time of}} the opening of the Narita Sky Access Line. In 2011 and 2012, the cities of Shiroi and Inzai elected new mayors on platforms of negotiating for further <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> and stopping public subsidies respectively; a third-party study commissioned by the two city governments concluded in August 2013 that the Hokuso line would break at even more discounted fare levels without local subsidies. Hokuso, on the other hand, has argued that increased consumption tax rates and capital expenditures related to upgrading the Pasmo system will force them to raise fares in 2015.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the coming}} years, Silver City pursued {{a policy of}} {{continuous}} <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> to fill the additional capacity on its growing air ferry network. This included new car ferry services between Southampton (Eastleigh) and Cherbourg {{as well as between}} Southend (Rochford) and Ostend and a DC-3 passenger service linking Gatwick and Le Touquet. Both of the former commenced in spring 1952, while the latter was inaugurated the following year. As a result, the number of vehicles carried doubled from 5,000 to 10,000 between 1950 and 1952 and quadrupled to 40,000 {{by the end of the}} following year. The latter was the consequence of an average 40% <b>fare</b> <b>reduction.</b>|$|R

50|$|Nonetheless {{the railway}} transit was also under threat, and a <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> in December 1841 {{did little to}} stave off the {{approaching}} doom: on 21 February 1842 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened its railway (to Haymarket). As a relatively modern, fast and direct line, it {{put an end to the}} Slamannan's through passenger service.|$|R
50|$|On 1 April 1848 the Caledonian Railway {{opened its}} line between Edinburgh and Glasgow. It was {{difficult}} in operational terms, but in July the Caledonian accelerated its passenger trains and added new fast services, and cheap fares.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a model of}} travel behavior for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area using the 1990 Travel Behavior Inventory. The model incorporates mode choice {{and the number of}} trips individuals take. Using the estimation results, we report estimates for mode share price elasticities and find that they are quite low. All mode share elasticities are less than 0. 25 which means that a 4 % price change could cause no more than a 1 % change in mode share. Mode share elasticities for nonwork trips are higher than those for work trips indicating that there is greater flexibility in non-work trip mode choices than in work trip choices. Two pricing policy simulations are performed and the results verify that there is low mode choice responsiveness to price changes. The welfare costs associated with these policies are derived. It is found that a 10 % gasoline tax would cost the average traveler $ 0. 33 per day. A transit <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> by one-half would benefit the average traveler $ 0. 12 per day. It should be noted though that the transit <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> affects {{only a small part of}} the population who, apparently, receive large cost savings. Although the transit <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> does not reduce vehicle use by much, it does increase the transit share by 24 %, a substantial increase in ridership. The results presented here imply that large price changes are necessary to induce people to reduce their vehicle use either by switching modes or reducing the number of trips they take.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1890s the company’s {{position}} had become dire and further attempts to alleviate its problems ensued including <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> {{and an increase}} in services. However, maintenance suffered which only served to further compound the company’s troubles. A liquidator was finally appointed in March 1893. The company’s failure has been attributed to various causes including a lack of revenue to cover expenditure on maintenance, competition, mismanagement, and an economic depression.|$|R
50|$|The fare {{adjustment}} {{exercise for}} 2009 was also brought forward to April instead of October so that commuters could benefit earlier from the <b>reduction</b> in <b>fares.</b> From April 2009, commuters saw an overall 4.6% reduction in bus and train fares.

50|$|At this time, the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway {{opened a}} new line to Albert Harbour in Greenock; the company was allied to the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and the Albert Harbour station was {{adjacent}} to the steamer berths; the new entrant was severe competition for the Caledonian Railway's Greenock operation, {{and for a time}} there was cut-throat competition with ruinous <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> there, until a traffic pooling agreement was finalised in 1871.|$|R
50|$|However, {{not all of}} the company’s {{decisions}} {{proved to}} be sound, and in 1886 its brief 18-month tenure as operator of the Corporation Line joined a growing list of missteps. By the end of the 1880s the company’s future was uncertain and it implemented several economy measures in an attempt to improve its fortunes. This included a permanent <b>fare</b> <b>reduction,</b> the replacement of steam motors with horses on some routes, and the introduction of a one man-operated tramcar. None of these measures were particularly successful.|$|R
40|$|Southwest Airlines is {{frequently}} credited with having an important {{influence on the}} success of airline deregulation in the United States. This paper uses an original set of competition variables to estimate the extent of that influence in 1998. The estimated savings - due to actual, adjacent, and potential competition from Southwest - were $ 12. 9 billion. Southwest's low fares were directly responsible for $ 3. 4 billion of these savings to passengers. The remaining $ 9. 5 billion represents the effect that actual, adjacent, and potential competition from Southwest had on other carriers' fares. These savings amount to 20 per cent of the airline industry's 1998 domestic scheduled passenger revenue and slightly more than half the <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> attributed to airline deregulation. From a policy perspective, these results are both troubling and encouraging. On the one hand, it is troubling to find that {{a large part of the}} <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> from airline deregulation is due to one carrier. On the other hand, if entry by a carrier with the appropriate characteristics can make such a difference, policies that encourage entry - for example, relaxing the restriction on entry by foreign-owned carriers - may have a large impact on passenger welfare. ?

40|$|A dynamic panel {{model is}} used to {{estimate}} the effect that fares, income and quality of service have on demand for a sample of 22 urban metros.

The estimated long run income elasticity is small but positive (0. 18), indicating that metros are perceived as normal goods. The quality of service elasticities are positive and substantially higher than the absolute value of fare elasticities.

30|$|Maximum fares for the {{regulated}} regional flights have been adjusted {{according to the}} Norwegian Consumer Price Index. Deregulation of the commercial part of the Norwegian air transport market in 1994 resulted in a market situation characterized by [11] as competition with respect to capacity on flights between the large airports. However, the entry into the commercial air transport market of the low cost carrier ‘Norwegian Air Shuttle’ in 2002 provided increased domestic competition and considerable <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> for the main routes. Hence, fares have moved in opposite directions for regulated and commercial flights [10]. Experience from Japan shows similar results with deregulation giving lower fares on high traffic routes and making low traffic routes less competitive – both with respect to fares and service [12].|$|R
