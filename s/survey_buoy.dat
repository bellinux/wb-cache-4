5000|$|In September 1861, he was {{transferred}} to command the steamer [...] and <b>surveyed</b> and <b>buoyed</b> Hatteras Inlet in preparation for Union incursions into the inlets and rivers, along with other coastal inlets. His ship engaged the Confederate gunboat [...] in Hatteras Inlet on 14 November 1861, and skirmished with gunboats in Pamlico Sound.|$|R
50|$|Bibb {{served the}} Union cause in many ways: <b>surveying</b> and <b>buoying</b> harbors and {{channels}} along the Atlantic {{coast of the}} Confederacy between South Carolina and Florida; escorting transports; towing and piloting gunboats; carrying dispatches; and performing any other duties that were of assistance to the Union Army and Navy. Her labors won her the most generous praise {{of the leaders of}} both services.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the move}} from Redcliffe to Brisbane, John Gray, Pilot of Port Jackson, {{received}} orders to <b>survey</b> and <b>buoy</b> the south passage as discovered by Oxley. To maintain the buoys, a pilot was posted at Amity Point on Stradbroke Island. A sandbar {{at the mouth of}} the Brisbane River prevented large ships from entering the river and Amity Point became a pilot station at which large vessels unloaded and distributed their cargo to smaller craft capable of navigating the bar and transporting goods into Brisbane. The Amity Point pilot station was the first in the Moreton Bay penal settlement and continued to operate till the wreck of the Sovereign in 1848, when it was relocated to Moreton Island and shipping then used the northern entrance to the bay via Cape Moreton.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 April {{she headed}} for the Korean combat zone to salvage SS Park Benjamin, {{grounded}} with several compartments flooded near Pusan. In May she salvaged [...] off Cheju-do. During the next three months, she cruised the Korean coast to clear anchorages, conduct <b>surveys,</b> and plant <b>buoys</b> and moorings. Then on 2 September she pointed her bow south for the Philippines and for the next month and a half conducted diving and demolition operations to rid Subic Bay of the hulk of the Japanese vessel Oroyoku Maru.|$|R
50|$|As {{requested}} in {{a letter}} of October 16, 1861 from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to the Secretary of Treasury Arago was ordered to report to Flag Officer, Commanding the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron to assist with surveys supporting operations of that squadron in South Carolina waters. She proceeded to join the squadron by way of New York where she was provided additional armament at the New York Navy Yard. Arago and the steamer Vixen joined the squadron and sailed {{only to have the}} fleet scattered by a storm so that most ships had to sail independently. Vixen was first to arrive and when the fleet rejoined Arago and Vixen participated in the expedition to seize Port Royal, South Carolina. After surveys in the vicinity of Port Royal the survey personnel continued to support blockading fleet operations with <b>surveys</b> and <b>buoying</b> channels. In July 1862 Arago, with the schooner Caswell and steamer Bibb returned to New York.|$|R
40|$|The {{second phase}} of {{ecological}} studies at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant site was initiated in July 1973. The first, phase conducted during 1970 - 71 involved baseline ecological surveys with special reference to abalone and bony fishes. The objectives of this second phase are to quantitativey monitor abalone and algal communities, including predators and competitors, along permanent intertidal and subtidal transects established during the first phase. During the quarter nine permanent transects were located and marked with new <b>buoys.</b> <b>Surveys</b> on seven of these transects were completed, and the commercial sea urchin and red abalone fisheries operating in the Diablo Cove area were monitored. Sea otter activities between Diablo Cove and Pt. Buchon were recorded to determine {{the location of the}} herd and their general food habits. Little evidence of feeding activity has been observed in Diablo Cove. Temperature tolerance studies, began in March 1973 on red abalones, were continued. Problems in obtaining viable abalone larvae hampered this project. (11 pp. ...|$|R
40|$|In October 2003 a {{campaign}} {{on board the}} Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis had the objective to validate standard Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) sea-ice products. Additionally, the satellite laser altimeter on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was in operation. To capture the large-scale information on the sea-ice conditions necessary for satellite validation, the measurement strategy was to obtain large-scale sea-ice statistics using extensive sea-ice measurements in a Lagrangian approach. A drifting buoy array, spanning initially 50 km 100 km, was surveyed during the campaign. In situ measurements consisted of 12 transects, 50 500 m, with detailed snow and ice measurements as well as random snow depth sampling of floes within the buoy array using helicopters. In order {{to increase the amount}} of coincident in situ and satellite data an approach has been developed to extrapolate measurements in time and in space. Assuming no change in snow depth and freeboard occurred during the period of the campaign on the floes <b>surveyed,</b> we use <b>buoy</b> ice-drift information as well as daily estimates of thin-ice fraction and rough-ice vs smooth-ice fractions from AMSR-E and QuikSCAT, respectively, to estimate kilometer-scale snow depth and freeboard for other days. The results show that ICESat freeboard estimates have a mean difference of 1. 8 cm when compared with the in situ data and a correlation coefficient of 0. 6. Furthermore, incorporating ICESat roughness information into the AMSR-E snow depth algorithm significantly improves snow depth retrievals. Snow depth retrievals using a combination of AMSR-E and ICESat data agree with in situ data with a mean difference of 2. 3 cm and a correlation coefficient of 0. 84 with a negligible bias...|$|R
40|$|The Seafloor Sounding in Polar and Remote Areas (SSPARR) buoy is an {{autonomous}} echo sounding buoy envisioned for deployment in polar waters, in which ice cover and inclement weather frequently prevent normal shipboard <b>survey</b> operations. The <b>buoy</b> includes an echo sounder, a GPS, and Iridium phone sub- systems, allowing system to periodically fix its position, sound {{for the local}} water depth and telemeter the data to shore. The measurement of an echo sounder is the two-way travel time of a transmitted pulse. In order to obtain the approximate depth, the one-way travel time is multiplied by the vertical harmonic mean sound speed depth. However, as the local sound speed profile is not measured by the buoy, a suitable profile must be derived from another source. An analysis of 19, 795 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) vertical measurement profiles taken between 1972 and 2003 in the Arctic Ocean (above 65 N Latitude) has been conducted to determine the variability of sound speed {{as a function of}} depth throughout the Arctic (World Ocean Database 2005, NODC). The temperature stability provided by the freezing point of water creates an environment such that a single canonical sound speed profile is sufficient for single beam echo sounding for the entire Arctic. Upper and lower sound speed values within each 1 -meter depth interval are used to bound the likely error of depth soundings measured using the canonical profile. The method is compared to the traditional method of using historical tables (Carter 2 Ì† 7 s Tables) to correct echo sounders operating at a nominal (4800 ft/sec [1463 m/s]) sound speed, and found to reduce sounding errors as much as 4...|$|R
