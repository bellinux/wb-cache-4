5000|$|Pointer : [...] Controls the mount's {{elevation}} and firing. He sits in {{the left}} front corner of the mount. In front of him, are his optical sight, hand wheels, and elevation drive controls. To his right, about elbow high, is a large box called the Elevation Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the elevation power drive. Through a window {{on top of the}} box, he sees a set of dials that indicate the elevation of the gun, and the automatic elevation orders coming from the Fire Control System. Above the Indicator Regulator is the Electrical Fire <b>Select</b> <b>Switch.</b> It is a rotary switch with three positions: Off, Local, and Auto. Off disables the electrical firing system on the mount. Local enables the electric firing key on his right hand wheel. Auto enables the off mount electrical firing circuit from the Fire Control System. Just outside his right knee, is the Percussion Select Lever. This mechanical lever has two positions: Safe, and Armed. When it is in the armed position, the mechanical linkage for percussion firing is enabled. His right footrest is at one end of this linkage, and the firing pin sear in the breech block is at the other. By rocking his right foot forward, he fires the gun. Electrical firing is the primary firing method. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials tell him the difference between the gun's present elevation and the ordered elevation electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. He changes the elevation of the gun, by moving his hand wheels, until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the elevation drive into Auto. This disengages his hand wheels, and gives elevation control to the Fire Control System. Then, he moves the Electrical Fire <b>Select</b> <b>Switch</b> to [...] "AUTO", and reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Elevation in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the elevation drive and the Electrical Fire <b>Select</b> <b>Switch</b> to local. In local control, he controls the gun's elevation with his hand wheels to keep his sight's horizontal cross hair on the target. At the command of the Mount Captain, he fires the gun by squeezing the firing key on his right hand wheel.|$|R
