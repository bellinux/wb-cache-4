5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1877, {{the first of}} many related species from the region described until the 1910s. In 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman consolidated most into the single species Oryzomys couesi and in 1960 Raymond Hall united this taxon with its United States relative, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris), into a single widespread species; subsequently, many related, localized <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> by Goldman were also included in this taxon. After studies of the contact zone in Texas, where O.couesi and the marsh rice rat meet, were published in 1979 and underscored the distinctness of the two, they were again regarded as separate. Since then, some of the peripheral forms of the group, such as Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica and Oryzomys peninsulae from the Baja California Peninsula, have been reinstated as species. Nevertheless, O.couesi as currently constituted is likely a composite of several species; a 2010 study, using DNA sequence data, found evidence to recognize separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the distribution of O.couesi and two additional species from Panama and Costa Rica. Generally, Oryzomys couesi is common and of no conservation concern, and it is even considered a plague species in places, but some populations are threatened.|$|E

50|$|The other {{suborder}} of pteropods, Thecosomata, is superficially {{similar to}} sea angels, {{but are not}} closely related. They have larger, broader parapodia, and most <b>species</b> <b>retain</b> a shell; they {{are commonly known as}} sea butterflies.|$|R
25|$|This theory postulates that {{multicellularity}} arose as a {{means for}} prey to escape predation. Larger prey {{are less likely to be}} preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that multicellularity arose when the first predators evolved. By assembling as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore multicellularity was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory protist, Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a prey population of Chlorella vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting because before the predator was introduced, the population of Chlorella vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} megatheriid in North America was Eremotherium eomigrans which arrived 2.2 {{million years}} ago, after crossing the recently formed [...] Panamanian land bridge. With {{more than five}} tons in weight, 6 meters in length, and able to reach as high as , it was larger than an African bush elephant bull. Unlike relatives, this <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> a plesiomorphic extra claw.

50|$|Myrmicinae is a {{subfamily}} of ants, {{with about}} 140 extant genera; their distribution is cosmopolitan. The pupae lack cocoons. Some <b>species</b> <b>retain</b> a functional sting.

50|$|Subsequent to {{the recent}} {{split-up}} of the genus Sturnus, this species and the common starling are the only <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> in the genus. Hybrids with common starling are found occasionally where the breeding ranges overlap in northeast Spain.|$|E
50|$|Though Earth was {{now under}} the rule of humanity, the Old Ones had left behind many {{descendants}} and former servitors. These demons, far smaller and less powerful than the Old Ones, were usually the product of crossbreeding with humans and other mortal animals.

50|$|Farmlands, {{including}} savanna and woodland, form now {{a dominant}} habitat in the Gambia where crops were grown initially on a rotation system of 20 {{years with a}} fallow period.

While the agricultural crops grown are sorghum, millet and ground nuts, the tree <b>species</b> <b>retained,</b> within the lands cleared for agricultural use, are the Acacia albida, baobab, ficus species, winterthorn and African locust (Parkia biglobosa).|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Claude Casimir Gillet, the <b>species</b> <b>retains</b> the name {{which it was}} first given, but {{has a number of}} taxonomic synonyms. Its specific name honours Louis-Luc Godey. Within the genus Inocybe, it has been classified in a number of ways, but appears to form part of a clade (that is, a group sharing a common ancestor) with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica.|$|R
50|$|The {{gill arches}} of bony fish {{typically}} have no septum, so the gills alone project from the arch, supported by individual gill rays. Some <b>species</b> <b>retain</b> gill rakers. Though {{all but the}} most primitive bony fish lack spiracles, the pseudobranch associated with them often remains, being located {{at the base of the}} operculum. This is, however, often greatly reduced, consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure.|$|R
50|$|Rodents of the {{superfamily}} Muroidea, {{which includes}} mice, rats, voles, hamsters, bamboo rats, {{and many other}} species, generally have three molars in each quadrant of the jaws. A few of the oldest <b>species</b> <b>retain</b> the fourth upper premolar, and some living species have lost the third and even the second molars. Features of the molar crown are often used in muroid taxonomy, and many different systems have been proposed to name these features.|$|R
50|$|Clarke et al. (2006) {{found that}} the most {{primitive}} known euornithians (the Yanornithiformes) had a mosaic of advanced and primitive features. These <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> primitive features like gastralia (belly ribs) and a pubic symphysis. They also showed the first fully modern pygostyles, and the type specimen of Yixianornis (IVPP 13631) preserves eight elongated rectrices (tail feathers) in a modern arrangement. No earlier pygostylians are known which preserve a fan of tail feathers of this sort; instead, they show only paired plumes or a tuft of short feathers.|$|E

50|$|The {{description}} {{of this species}} formerly included plants now belonging to Sclerocactus brevispinus and Sclerocactus wetlandicus, two cacti endemic to Utah. When {{the second of the}} two species was separated in 1994, the name S. glaucus was applied only to plants found in Colorado; it made the common name Uinta Basin hookless cactus a misnomer, because now this species does not occur in the Uinta Basin of Utah. The two new <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> their federally threatened status, which they had received while members of S. glaucus. Sources vary in whether they recognize the separation of these species from S. glaucus; Anderson (2001) does not.|$|E

5000|$|Ricinulei are {{typically}} about 5 to 10 mm long. The cuticle (or exoskeleton) {{of both the}} legs and body is remarkably thick. Their most notable feature is a [...] "hood" [...] (or cucullus) which can be raised and lowered over the head. When lowered, it covers the mouth and the chelicerae.

50|$|Choanoflagellates {{are either}} free-swimming {{in the water}} column or sessile, {{adhering}} to the substrate directly or through either the periplast or a thin pedicel. Although choanoflagellates are thought to be strictly free-living and heterotrophic, a number of choanoflagellate relatives, such as members of Ichthyosporea or Mesomycetozoa, follow a parasitic or pathogenic lifestyle. The life histories of choanoflagellates are poorly understood. Many species are thought to be solitary; however coloniality seems to have arisen independently several times within the group and colonial <b>species</b> <b>retain</b> a solitary stage.|$|R

50|$|Skuas {{are related}} to gulls, waders, auks, and skimmers. In the three smaller species, all nesting {{exclusively}} in the Holarctic, breeding adults have the two central tail feathers obviously elongated, and at least some adults have white on the underparts and pale yellow on the neck. These characteristics are not shared by the larger species, all native to the Southern Hemisphere except for the great skua. Therefore, the skuas are often split into two genera, with only the smaller <b>species</b> <b>retained</b> in Stercorarius, and the large species placed in Catharacta. However, based on genetics, behavior, and feather lice, the overall relationship among the species is best expressed by placing all in a single genus. The pomarine and great skuas' mitochondrial DNA (inherited from the mother) is in fact {{more closely related to}} each other than it is to either Arctic or long-tailed skuas, or to the Southern Hemisphere species. Thus, hybridization must have played a considerable role {{in the evolution of the}} diversity of Northern Hemisphere skuas.|$|E

40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Much research on animal health and welfare assumes that animals passively endure the pathogens, diet, and environmental conditions that come their way.

Its distribution indicates that this species evolved fairly independently of other sea-eagle lineages, but the molecular data tentatively suggests it is possibly closer to the Holarctic species.|$|R
