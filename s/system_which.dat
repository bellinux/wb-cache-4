25|$|However, {{despite the}} {{intersection}} of evidentiality systems with other semantic or pragmatic systems (through grammatical categories), Aikhenvald believes that several languages do mark evidentiality without any grammatical connection to these other semantic/pragmatic systems. More explicitly stated, she believes that there are modal <b>systems</b> <b>which</b> do not express evidentiality and evidential <b>systems</b> <b>which</b> do not express modality. Likewise, there are mirative <b>systems</b> <b>which</b> do not express evidentiality and evidential <b>systems</b> <b>which</b> do not express mirativity.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we apply methods of {{commutative}} algebra to analysis of systems of PDEs. More precisely, {{we show that}} <b>systems</b> <b>which</b> are parabolic in a generalized sense are equivalent to certain completed <b>systems</b> <b>which</b> are parabolic in the standard sense. We also propose a constructive method for getting this completion, and Gröbner basis methods, via symbol modules of the systems, {{play a central role}} in practical computations. Moreover, we can easily construct <b>systems</b> <b>which</b> are not parabolic in the generalized sense but nevertheless become parabolic when completed...|$|R

5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s.
