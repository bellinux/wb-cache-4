5000|$|One piece barrels are {{machined}} from {{a single}} piece of material, usually aluminium, but stainless steel has historically been popular. Paintballs can range from [...]50 to [...]695 caliber (0.50 - 0.695 in), and barrels are made to match these diameters. Some one piece barrels have a <b>stepped</b> <b>bore</b> that increases from their rated bore size to around [...]70 caliber (.70 in) after 8 in. One-piece barrels are generally less expensive to produce and therefore to purchase, but if a different bore size is desired (for a closer fit {{to the size of a}} given brand or batch of paintballs) an entirely new barrel is required. The use of a single material for the entire barrel means that disadvantages of certain materials, such as durability (aluminum) or weight (stainless steel), cannot be mitigated.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{action of}} pulling a solid {{continuum}} through a fluid filled <b>stepped</b> <b>bore</b> tubular unit of larger bore size than the continuum itself, {{gives rise to}} hydrodynamic pressure and resistance to axial pull. Depending on the relative dimension of the unit and the continuum and also the rheological properties of the fluid, the combined effect of the hydro-dynamic pressure and the axial pull may become sufficient to induce plastic yielding and subsequent permanent deformation in the continuum. In order to fully understand {{the mechanics of the}} deformation process, a mathematical model involving non-linear equations has been formulated. A finite difference numerical technique was then used to solve these equations without having to pre-describe the deformation profile of the continuum being pulled through a <b>stepped</b> <b>bore</b> unit.

40|$|In this study, {{the coating}} of fine wires using {{hydrodynamic}} pressure technique {{has been investigated}} theoretically and experimentally. One of the principal aims of the project is to establish the minimum possible coating thickness on fine wires which can be applied by means of hydrodynamic technique. Models based on steady, uniform and laminar flow of Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian fluid for polymer coating for the process of plasto-hydrodynamic wire coating in a <b>stepped</b> <b>bore</b> unit have been developed. The closed form analytical solution is established in cylindrical coordinate since the practical case is a mathematical axisymmetric problem. The comparison of theoretical results between Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid, and Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems has been made. The experimental procedures and methods have been outlined, a melt chamber and a die unit have been designed and used, and investigations into {{a wide range of}} coating and drawing conditions have been carried out. The experimental work includes by the polymer of low density polyethylene (Escoren) coating on stainless steel wires with three diameters ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 4 mm, varying the temperature of the polymer melt between 120 - 155 Â°C, converting the different diameters of dies ranging from 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm, and shifting the drawing speed between 0. 08 - 1. 31 m/s. The experimental data have been processed and presented graphically. Some significant conclusions have been made...|$|E

40|$|Six Sigma {{is one of}} {{the popular}} methodologies used by the {{companies}} to improve the quality and productivity. It uses a detailed analysis of the process to determine the causes of the problem and proposes a successful improvement. Various approaches are adopted while following Six Sigma methodologies {{and one of them is}} DMAIC. The successful implementation of DMAIC and FTA is discussed in this paper. In this study, the major problem was of continuous rework up to 16 %, which was leading to wastage of man hours and labor cost. Initially, fault tree analysis (FTA) was used to detect the key process input variables (KPIVs) affecting the output. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to know the possible relationship between the KPIVs and the output. The DMAIC methodology was successfully implemented to reduce the rework from 16 % bores per month to 2. 20 % bores per month.

40|$|The {{requirements}} of production engineering for a precision hole are {{to ensure the}} required quality as well as minimal production costs. The interactions between machine, tool and the pre-drilled hole result in uncertainties during the final reaming process. For this purpose the reaming process itself {{and the appearance of}} process faults were focused in a large number of publications. Due {{to the fact that the}} reaming process is an inherent part of a process chain and thus directly linked to a pre-machining process (drilling process), the influence of a pre-drilled hole is neglected till date. For that reason the present paper deals with the influence of a diagonal pre-drilled hole on the reaming process with multi blade tools. Pretests show that the radial deviation of the pre-drilled hole seems to be an important input parameter for the reaming process within the process chain. Based on this new input parameter the question whether the reaming tool follows the path of the pre-drilled hole or not has arisen. To achieve a better understanding of this issue, cutting tests were accomplished to investigate this influence. For this purpose, holes with different radial deviations were manufactured on a five axis machining center and reamed in a second <b>step.</b> The <b>bored</b> holes were evaluated with the help of a coordinat...|$|R

60|$|Arriving at the house, {{the young}} people ascended the outer flight of wooden <b>steps,</b> which <b>bore</b> an odd {{likeness}} to the companion-way of a vessel, and the gallery, or 'deck,' as it was called--where a number of nets, floats, and buoys thrown over the railing completed the nautical resemblance. This {{part of the building}} was evidently devoted to kitchen, dining-room, and domestic offices; the principal room in the centre serving as hall or living-room, and communicating on the other side with two sleeping apartments. It was of considerable size, with heavy lateral beams across the ceiling--built, {{like the rest of the}} house, with a certain maritime strength--and looked not unlike a saloon cabin. An enormous open Franklin stove between the windows, as large as a chimney, blazing with drift-wood, gave light and heat to the apartment, and brought into flickering relief the boarded walls hung with the spoils of sea and shore, and glittering with gun-barrels. Fowling-pieces of all sizes, from the long ducking-gun mounted on a swivel for boat use to the light single-barrel or carbine, stood in racks against the walls; game-bags, revolvers in their holsters, hunting and fishing knives in their sheaths, depended from hooks above them. In one corner stood a harpoon; in another, two or three Indian spears for salmon. The carpetless floor and rude chairs and settles were covered with otter, mink, beaver, and a quantity of valuable seal-skins, with a few larger pelts of the bear and elk. The only attempt at decoration was the displayed wings and breasts of the wood and harlequin duck, the muir, the cormorant, the gull, the gannet, and the femininely delicate half-mourning of petrel and plover, nailed against the wall.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} of drawing wire, i. e., dieless wire drawing, {{is described in}} which no conventional reduction dies are used. The wire is passed through a unit having <b>stepped</b> parallel <b>bores</b> filled with polymer melts, the smallest bore diameter being greater than the initial nominal wire diameter. The technique {{eliminates the need for}} a leader wire, prevents breakage during start-up, and eliminates the use of conventional reduction dies and, hence, the problem of die wear. An analysis has been developed for predicting the produced wire sizes for given drawing speeds, the pressure distribution within the unit and the drawing load during the drawing process. The performance of the drawing process is effected by means of the plasto-hydrodynamic action of the polymer melt within the unit. Heat is generated by mechanical dissipation during the drawing process. The effect of this upon the performance of the process is considered by coupling the energy equation into the analysis and allowing the polymer viscosity to be dependent on temperature. Agreement between the theory and experiment is found to be close. To further investigate the performance of the drawing process, an extensive experimental study has been undertaken, in which parameters such as drawing speeds, the temperature of the polymer and type of polymers are varied. Based on the theoretical and experimental results, a microcomputer-based control system for the dieless wire drawing process has been designed and built. A method with which the percentage reduction in area of the wire can be measured on line is proposed. Wires of desired qualities in terms of consistency in diameter over long lengths, or uniform change in area of the wire, are capable of being produced from the new system. A self-tuning controller for determinisic systems is proposed, which has the same structure as a conventional PID controller. The new self-tuning PID controller is based on a generalised self-tuning controller with pole assignment for deterministic systems. Simulation and experimental studies for several examples indicate that the new controller performs well and can be further improved to provide a fundamental method of tuning a PID controller. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} geometry plasto-hydrodynamic {{pressure unit}} {{has been investigated}} theoretically and experimentally. Previous investigators have used either stepped parallel or tapered bore pressure unit for die-less drawing and/or coating of wires, tubes and stripes. In the present study a combined parallel and tapered bore unit {{has been used in}} conjunction with polymer melts as pressure fluid. In this present work a pressure unit is heated to convert the polymer feed into a viscous melt and the pressure in the fluid is generated by hydrodynamic action when a wire is drawn through it. Experimental work has been carried out on different pressure units with similar external but different internal geometries to investigate the performance of new pressure unit. Different types of polymer were used as the pressure medium. In this work analytical models based on Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian characteristics have been developed to investigate the performance of the pressure unit and to optimise the process. The predicted results showed reasonable agreement those observed experimentally in magnitudes of maximum pressure. Experimental and theoretical results, showed that there exists a gap ratio (optimum) for which the pressure is maximum. For greater or smaller values of the gap ratio than the optimum value, a decreased magnitude for the maximum pressure was obtained. The maximum pressure at that gap ratio(optimum) is much higher compared to those obtained using either <b>stepped</b> or tapered <b>bore</b> pressure unit at similar conditions...|$|R

He, like Don Gayferos, [...] "forgot his lady fair and true," [...] and was only anxious about the expected visit of the Marquis of A----. Soothfast tidings had assured him that this nobleman was at length, and without fail, to honour his castle at one in the afternoon, being a late dinner-hour; and much was the bustle in consequence of the annunciation. The Lord Keeper traversed the chambers, held consultation with the butler in the cellars, and even ventured, at the risk of a demele with a cook of a spirit lofty enough to scorn the admonitions of Lady Ashton herself, to peep into the kitchen. Satisfied, at length, that everything was in as active a train of preparation as was possible, he summoned Ravenswood and his daughter to walk upon the terrace, for the purpose of watching, from that commanding position, the earliest symptoms of his lordship's approach. For this purpose, with slow and idle step, he paraded the terrace, which, flanked with a heavy stone battlement, stretched in front of the castle upon a level with the first story; while visitors found access to the court by a projecting gateway, the bartizan or flat-leaded roof of which was accessible from the terrace by an easy flight of low and broad <b>steps.</b> The whole <b>bore</b> a resemblance partly to a castle, partly to a nobleman's seat; and though calculated, in some respects, for defence, evinced that it had been constructed under a sense of the power and security of the ancient Lords of Ravenswood.|$|R
40|$|This project arose {{out of a}} need {{to improve}} the {{accuracy}} with which the pressure drop along pneumatic conveying pipelines in process plant could be predicted. The methods previously available for making this prediction are examined and critically assessed. The need for a different method is shown, and a new approach is developed and tested. The new approach involves testing of the product to be conveyed, in a test pipeline at the smaller end of the industrial scale, with measurements being made of the pressure drop caused by bends and of the pressure gradients in straight lengths; the data is fed into a storage and retrieval system then extracted and used to predict the pressure drop in a plant pipeline conveying the same product. The method has been developed {{to the point where}} it is in current use for the design of pneumatic conveying systems for industrial applications. The development of a suitable test rig, the data storage and retrieval systems, and the method for predicting the pressure drop in a plant pipeline, are examined in detail. The method is tested against data from pipeline loops and found to give good results. A quantitative comparison is made against the work of other authors in the field; the results of this show good agreement although the scope of the current work is much wider than anything comparable. An assessment is also made of the areas requiring further work. A major advantage of the method lies in its use to predict the pressure drop along pipelines having <b>steps</b> up in <b>bore</b> size along their length, which were not amenable to treatment by previous methods.

In like manner, when the aforesaid antiquaries did argue and contend that a certain secret vault was not the tomb of a grey-haired lady who had been hanged and drawn and quartered by glorious Queen Bess for succouring a wretched priest who fainted of thirst and hunger at her door, the bachelor did solemnly maintain, against all comers, that the church was hallowed by the said poor lady's ashes; that her remains had been collected in the night from four of the city's gates, and thither in secret brought, and there deposited; and the bachelor did further (being highly excited at such times) deny the glory of Queen Bess, and assert the immeasurably greater glory of the meanest woman in her realm, who had a merciful and tender heart. As to the assertion that the flat stone near the door was not the grave of the miser who had disowned his only child and left a sum of money to the church to buy a peal of bells, the bachelor did readily admit the same, and that the place had given birth to no such man.
