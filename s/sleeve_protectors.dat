500|$|During this time, {{there were}} two popular kinds of armour: the ō-yoroi (lit. [...] "great armour") with a boxlike appearance, mainly worn by {{high-ranking}} samurai on horseback, and the lighter and more flexible dō-maru that wrapped around the body and was initially worn by lower-ranking foot soldiers. The ō-yoroi was made of leather and iron lames bound together in horizontal layers, ornamented and reinforced with leather, silk and gilt metal. It originated around the 10th century but was only commonly used starting with the Genpei War {{at the end of}} the 12th century. Being the most complete and elaborate Japanese armour, it was also worn for ceremonies. The tighter fitting dō-maru, developed in the 11th century, was generally made of a combination of leather and metal and did not include a solid breastplate or sleeves. In many cases its armour plates were replaced with scales of metal, leather or whalebone laced together with silk or leather cords. Even though it was a plainer armour compared to the ō-yoroi, upper class samurai started to adopt it around 1300, as battles began to be fought on foot favouring a more comfortable suit. Three dō-maru, fifteen ō-yoroi armours and one pair of gauntlets have been designated as National Treasures. Most of the items include a helmet and large <b>sleeve</b> <b>protectors.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{benefits}} of reforestation or bioengineering measures to control erosion {{have also been}} demonstrated (e.g. Pearce et al. 1987; Phillips et al. 1990; Blaschke et al. 2008; McIvor et al. 2011; Marden 2012; Phillips et al. 2012). In New Zealand pastoral hill country, wide-spaced trees of poplar (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) have been the primary means of erosion control for 50 + years (Wilkinson, 1999). These species are established using 2.5 - to 3.0 -m-long poles (vegetative cuttings), with plastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>protectors,</b> and planted on slopes at a spacing of 10 – 15  m depending on erosion potential and practitioner experience. These trees add value to hill pastoral systems through providing shade, shelter, quality fodder (summer/autumn), and carbon sequestration (Wall et al. 1997; Betteridge et al. 2012; Basher 2013), increasing their utilisation and further adoption by landowners. A mix of clones is usually planted, and they are managed {{for at least the}} first 5  years after planting. In some regions, treatment of erosion-prone pastoral areas has shifted from being farmer-led and voluntary to becoming a requirement promoted (and generally incentivised) or regulated by the local authorities.|$|E

40|$|ContextPancreatic {{surgery is}} an {{extremely}} challenging field, and the management of pancreatic diseases continues to evolve. In the past decade, minimal access surgery is moving towards minimizing the surgical trauma by reducing numbers {{and size of the}} port. In the last few years, a novel technique with a single-incision laparoscopic approach has been described for several laparoscopic procedures. ObjectivesWe present a single-port laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first single-port pancreatic resection in Brazil and Latin America. MethodsA 33 -year-old woman with neuroendocrine tumor underwent spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy via single-port approach. A single-incision advanced access platform with gelatin cap, self-retaining <b>sleeve</b> and wound <b>protector</b> was used. ResultsOperative time was 174 minutes. Blood loss was minimal, and the patient did not receive a transfusion. The recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 4. ConclusionsSingle-port laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is feasible and can be safely performed in specialized centers by skilled laparoscopic surgeons...|$|R

40|$|Plant Protection Products (PPP) {{used in the}} {{horticulture}} {{industry can}} be both chemical and biological. They are used for weeds (herbicides), insects (insecticides), and fungi (fungicides) and as growth retarders. Many horticulture workers {{get in touch with}} plants, treated with PPPs and many of these don’t use any protective equipment. The aim of this project is to illustrate the work environment hazards for staff working with greenhouse pot plants, after they have been sprayed. The method used was observations of the operations for packing plants. I studied the operations and took notes of how operations were performed and what protective equipment they used. I also took photos and asked questions. A literature study completed the observations. It was concentrated on possibilities to reduce the risks to be exposed to pesticide residues. Some of the risk factors noted were that without protective gloves, the workers got in direct contact with soil, flowers and leaves. Some persons wiped off their wet hands on the T-shirt and in some cases unprotected arms got in contact with leaves. Conclusions made are for instance the following: • A recommended protective equipment (gloves, <b>sleeve</b> <b>protectors</b> and apron) prevent a direct skin-contact to plants with possible residues. • It is hard to decide how big the hazards are and which effect it makes on humans. It depends on many factors as degradation rate, how much it has been sprayed, the toxicity of the PPP, what protective equipment you use, how much you get in contact with surfaces that are treated and how sensitive you are to different preparations. • If you use the recommended protective equipment combined with better knowledge about degradation time the risks are regarded to be rather low...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic {{gastrointestinal}} resections using single-port are possible, but triangulation {{problems and}} the need of articulated instruments difficult the procedures. AIM: To present a surgical alternative using single-port laparoscopic device on gastric resection. TECHNIQUE: The patient is placed in a supine and reverse Trendelenburg position with surgeon between patient's legs. First assistant {{was on the right}} side of the patient with the monitor placed on the patient's cranial side. With the patient under general anesthesia, a transumbilical 3 cm skin incision is performed. A single-incision advanced access platform with gelatin cap, self-retaining <b>sleeve</b> and wound <b>protector</b> is introduced through this incision. Three 5 - 12 mm operating ports were introduced through the single-port device. Due to the gel cap and sleeves, no articulated instruments are necessary. CO 2 pneumoperitoneum is established at 12 mmHg. A rigid 30 degree 10 mm laparoscope is introduced. Operation begins with access to the lesser sac by opening the omentum along the greater curvature of the stomach using harmonic scalpel. Once the stomach is fully exposed and a stay suture is place around the tumor. Gastric wall is divided with cautery 1 cm away from the tumor. Tumor is excised. Gastric wall is sutured with two-layer running suture. No drain was used. Umbilical incision was closed. RESULTS: This procedure was used in one patient with gastric duplication. Operative time was 200 minutes. Blood loss was minimal. Recovery was uneventful and patient discharged on postoperative day 2. Final aspect of the umbilical incision was good. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric resection with single-port laparoscopic platform is feasible and may be safely performed in selected patients...|$|R
