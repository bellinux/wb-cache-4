5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Bobby Roode, who {{was accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, against Ron Killings. The duration of the match was 9 minutes and 53 seconds. Konnan interfered in the bout distracting Killings, which allowed Roode to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> behind Killings and {{hit him in the}} back of the head with Roode's signature Northern Lariat maneuver.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the false information Robb {{gave to the}} captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force believes it is the whole Stark army. The remainder of Robb's men <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> on Jaime Lannister's army, defeating them and capturing Jaime. When captured, Jaime challenges Robb to a one-on-one duel to settle the matter, which Robb declines.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{beginning}} of construction, however, severe deficiencies were beginning to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the Arlington Heights, and an enemy force could shield itself with the heights and <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> on the fort unopposed. To prevent this from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling {{for the construction of a}} fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.|$|E

5|$|HMS Tiptoe (pennant number P332) was a British {{submarine}} of {{the third}} group of the T class. She was built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, and launched on 25 February 1944. She {{was one of two}} submarines named by Winston Churchill, and so far has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named Tiptoe. In 1955 she was involved in a collision with a coastal steamer whilst in Tromsø harbour. She was involved in escape trials off Malta in 1962, and the commanding officer was reprimanded in 1964 following an incident in the Firth of Clyde where she was run aground, and again in 1965 when she collided with HMS Yarmouth. Although originally named for the ability to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> on someone undetected, she maintained several links with ballet, including the Royal Ballet and ballet dancer Moira Shearer. She was scrapped in Portsmouth in 1975, while her anchor is on display in Blyth, Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E
5|$|The thistle {{has been}} one of the {{national}} emblem of the Scots nation since the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470. Today, it forms part of the emblem of the Scottish Rugby Union. As legend has it, an invading army had attempted to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> at night on the Scots. One, perhaps barefooted, unwelcome foreign soldier stumbled upon a Scots Thistle, and cried out in pain, thus alerting Scots to their presence. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of the Viking monarch Haakon IV of Norway, who had harried the coast for some years. Spiky plants such as brambles appear to have been used around forts since time immemorial, so the story, whether it factually relates to the Haakon episode or not, likely is the culmination of more than one such event over time. In some variants, it is invading English which stumble on a thistle, but the story predates this time.|$|E

25|$|Exit polls {{indicated}} that many NDP supporters voted Liberal {{to keep the}} new Conservative Party of Canada from winning. The Liberals had recruited several prominent NDP members, most notably former British Columbia Premier Ujjal Dosanjh, to run as Liberals {{as part of a}} drive to convince NDP voters that a reunited Conservative Party could <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> the middle {{in the event of a}} split in the centre-left vote.|$|E
25|$|Debagging, {{also known}} as depantsing and just known as pantsing in the United States, is the pulling down of a person's {{trousers}} or underwear mostly against their wishes, typically as a practical joke, but in other instances as a (somewhat common) sexual fetish. The most common method is to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> behind the intended victim, grab the trousers at the waist, and apply a quick downward tug before the victim {{is aware of the}} assailant's presence.|$|E
25|$|Swarming {{does not}} require good {{military}} intelligence alone, but intelligent soldiers who can manage multiple information streams and keep situational awareness. It is not advisable to have a soldier so engrossed in displays that an enemy can <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> and hit him {{over the head with}} a rock. One of the challenges of designing modern networked systems is not to overwhelm the users with information. Those users will also need extensive training, with their sensing and synchronization information, to use them properly under combat stress.|$|E

Players are graded on how elaborately they deliver the food.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} 1952 from the former districts of Brandon and Souris. It has been held by a centre-right party for all but one term of its existence. This tradition was broken in 1993 when massive vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform allowed the Liberals to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> the middle and take the riding. However, the seat reverted to form in 1997 when the PCs reclaimed it. The PCs and their successors, the modern Conservatives, have held the seat ever since. While Brandon has some Liberal and NDP support, {{it is not enough}} to overcome the conservative bent in the more rural areas of the riding.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish {{use their}} {{camouflage}} {{to hunt and}} <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> on their prey. They swim at the bottom, where shrimp and crabs are found and shoot out a jet of water to uncover the prey buried in the sand. Then when the prey tries to escape, the cuttlefish open their eight arms and shoot out two long feeding tentacles to grab them. Each arm has a pad covered in suckers which grabs and pulls prey toward its beak, paralyzing it with venom before eating it. In order to achieve a hypnotic effect and stun prey before catching them, cuttlefish are also known to change color rapidly.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 17/18 July the {{detachment}} attacked the Italian position. It proved to be highly successful, being well-planned and executed. Using the cover of darkness and a carefully laid deception plan, the commandos managed to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> behind the Italians position on the hills, and move thorough the forward defensive pits unchallenged. In the end they advanced to within 30 yards of the headquarters before they were challenged, and when they finally were, the force rushed the Italian defenders with sub machine guns and grenades and quickly overwhelmed them. They then withdrew from the position just before the Italians could call down an artillery barrage {{and returned to the}} garrison holding Tobruk. They suffered five casualties in the raid, one of whom later died of his wounds.|$|E

25|$|Demonstrating courage is {{fundamental}} to masculinity in Bara culture. Historically, kings were required to lead the advance in combat, placing themselves in danger first; the others {{were not allowed to}} protect him or come to his aid unless he was injured or exhausted. Cattle raiding is a major feature of Bara culture. Traditionally a rite of passage for young men to prove their worth and courage to a prospective wife's family and the larger community, the practice is currently outlawed but remains widespread throughout the southwest and south-central Bara territories. Young men could not expect to marry respectably without first having successfully stolen at least one or two cattle in a raid. Today, cattle rustlers (dahalo) are increasingly armed bandits stealing cattle for wealth rather than social prestige. Zebu wrestling is a sport practiced by Bara communities and involves Zebu being penned into an arena and whipped into frustration. Once the zebu is angry, players <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> behind the Zebu and jump onto its hump, attempting to 'ride' as long as possible without being injured by the beast. It is seen as a rite of passage for young boys.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the style}} of play for both {{characters}} is slightly different, controlling each character is broadly similar. Each can move forward and backward, can strafe left and right, can run, walk, sneak, and jump. Each shares an identical HUD, with the same information available to the player; currently held weapons, ammo count, a compass with objectives marked, and current health points. Both characters can single and/or dual wield six shooters, or single wield other weapons, such as rifles. Both characters can also lean {{to the left and}} right without moving from their current position, and can interact with certain objects, such as health pick-ups (in the Xbox 360 version, health automatically regenerates over time), ammo and dropped weaponry. The main differences between the two characters is that Ray is stronger and slower, he cannot jump as high as Billy, but he can kick heavy obstacles out of his way and take considerably more damage from enemy fire. Billy can move faster than Ray and is quieter, allowing him to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> on enemies. He can also grip onto ledges and pull himself up. Billy can also use two weapons Ray cannot - a whip, and a bow and arrow.|$|E
25|$|An alcohol-free Springfield Saint Patrick's Day parade is {{interrupted}} by a brawl between the Nationalist Irish and the Unionist Northern Irish in which Homer participates. A group of hungry children steal Marge's picnic basket. She is saved by Patrick Farrelly, who gives the children a cabbage and returns the basket. Marge offers him a cupcake in gratitude, and Patrick immediately offers her a job at his bakery after eating it. Homer is taken to jail, because of {{his involvement in the}} riot. Due to his history of crime, Homer's bail is set incredibly high, and he is forced to get a bail bondsman named Lucky Jim to help him. Lucky Jim agrees to secure Homer's release from prison, as long as Homer does not skip his bail. Otherwise, he {{will have to deal with}} Wolf the Bounty Hunter, who quickly inspires Homer to become a bounty hunter himself. Homer's first mission involves pretending to sell condos on a street corner to criminals. Snake approaches Homer, who tries to take Snake down. Homer corners Snake in an alleyway, where Snake pulls out a pistol and fires a shot straight to Homer's head. Miraculously, Ned Flanders places a sheet of bulletproof glass in front of Homer, which deflects the shot. Ned attempts to convince Snake to come in quietly, unknowingly allowing Homer to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> behind Snake and capture him by asphyxiating him with a plastic bag. Homer convinces Ned to join him as a bounty hunting duo.|$|E
25|$|The first Battle Royal, on January 22, {{included}} El Terrible, El Hijo del Fantasma, Averno, Dragón Rojo Jr., Euforia, Máscara Dorada, Máximo and Misterioso II. The match {{ended with}} El Terrible and El Hijo del Fantasma {{as the last}} two wrestlers in the ring, which meant their teams would meet in the final first round match that evening. After the match order was determined the actual tournament began. The first match saw Atlantis and Máscara Dorada defeat Dragón Rojo Jr. and La Sombra. While Atlantis is a Rudo the team got along without any problems, Atlantis wore his old Tecnico style white mask and wrestled a more tecnico style to complement Máscara Dorada. The second match saw Máximo and Mr. Niebla form a team that quickly earned the nickname La Peste con Amour ("the Love Plague") born from Mr. Niebla being part of La Peste Negra ("the Black Plague") and Máximo's Exótico ring character. The team won when Máximo kissed Blue Panther or Misterioso II, distracting him long enough for Mr. Niebla to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> behind him to roll him up for the pinfall. The third first round match paired longtime rivals Místico, CMLL's top Tecnico up with Averno, one of CMLL's top Rudos together to face Euforia and Averno's regular partner Ephesto. Místico and Averno {{came out with a}} surprising show of unity as they both wore masks that melded their own masks with their partner's mask, the arch-enemies got along in the match, handily winning it. The last match saw El Terrible and Volador Jr. defeat Hijo del Fantasma and Mephisto to earn their way to the quarter finals.|$|E
