25|$|Anatolian animal carpets {{represent}} a special type of pile-woven carpet, woven in the geographical region of Anatolia during the Seljuq and early Ottoman period, {{corresponding to the}} 14th–16th century. Very few animal-style carpets still exist today, {{and most of them}} are in a fragmentary state. Animal carpets were frequently depicted by Western European painters of the 14th–16th century. By comparison of the few surviving carpets with their painted counterparts, these paintings helped to establish a timeline of their production, and <b>support</b> <b>our</b> knowledge about the early Turkish carpet.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to these changes and litigation, the federal government passed laws mandating that BSA units be given equal access to local and state-level governmental resources. The Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, enacted in 2002, requires public {{elementary and secondary schools}} that receive U.S. Department of Education funding to provide BSA groups equal access to school facilities. The <b>Support</b> <b>Our</b> Scouts Act of 2005 requires state and local governments that receive HUD funding to provide BSA groups equal access to governmental forums (lands, facilities, etc.). State and local governments still have flexibility regarding the provision of special access to the BSA.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as an}} SDSR, the Conservative Party pledged in 2010 to {{undertake}} a fundamental and far reaching review of the procurement process and how defence equipment is provided in Britain. It pledged to reform the procurement process, compile a Green Paper on Sovereignty Capability, and publish another Defence Industrial Strategy following on from the Defence Industrial Strategy in 2005. The Conservative Party has said {{that there will be}} four aims for British defence procurement: to provide the best possible equipment at the best possible price; to streamline the procurement process to ensure the speedy delivery of equipment to the front line; to <b>support</b> <b>our</b> industry jobs at home by increasing defence exports; to provide defence procurement that underpins strategic relationships abroad and; to provide predictability to the defence industry.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to <b>support</b> <b>our</b> Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E

500|$|After {{his victory}} in the Straw poll, Hunter {{received}} media attention for his response to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's invitation to speak to students at Columbia University. He criticized the school for its decision, stating that [...] "if the left-wing leaders of academia will not <b>support</b> <b>our</b> troops, they, in the very least, should not <b>support</b> <b>our</b> adversaries..." [...] He then called for a revocation of federal funding to the University. These statements resulted in criticism from liberals such as Glenn Greenwald, who described Hunter's proposal as [...] "dangerous", [...] "improper" [...] and [...] "unconstitutional".|$|E
500|$|In {{a meeting}} March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC) {{unanimously}} {{passed a resolution}} proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the team's logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Redskin's spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response, saying, [...] "We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen {{to the voice of}} the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who <b>support</b> <b>our</b> name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community." [...] At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott. The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015.|$|E
500|$|The storyline which {{featured}} the character's old nemesis DC Hooch drew criticism of Becky's excessive littering of her cigarette butts. Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: [...] "It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow {{one of its}} characters to throw a butt {{on the floor and}} suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. We understand the writers are concerned with realism but Becky is a role model to many viewers. We all have a responsibility to keep our local area clean and we would hope that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would <b>support</b> <b>our</b> call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy." [...] A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll to find out which character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she [...] "loved a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror praised Becky's feud with Tracy, explaining it was a [...] "perfectly poised, barbed battle". Though he said it was ruined by Kylie's return.|$|E
