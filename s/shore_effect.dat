40|$|The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is {{invasive}} worldwide, has displaced {{indigenous species}} {{on the west coast}} of South Africa and now threatens Perna perna on the south coast. We tested the hypothesis that Mytilus will replace Perna by examining changes in their distribution on shores where they co-exist. Total cover, adult density, recruit density, recruit/adult correlations and mean maximum lengths of both species were measured in 2001 at two contrasting sites (Plettenberg Bay and Tsitsikamma) 70 km apart, each including two locations 100 m apart. Cover and density were measured again in 2004. Total mussel abundance was significantly lower in Tsitsikamma, and recruit density was only 17 % that of Plettenberg Bay. Abundance and cover increased upshore for Mytilus, but decreased for Perna, giving Mytilus higher adult and recruit density and total cover than Perna in the upper zones. Low shore densities of recruits and adults were similar between species but cover was lower for Mytilus, reflecting its smaller size, and presumably slower growth or higher mortality there. Thus, mechanisms excluding species differed among zones. Recruitment limitation delays invasion at Tsitsikamma and excludes Perna from the high shore, while Mytilus is excluded from the low <b>shore</b> by post-recruitment <b>effects.</b> Recruitment limitation also shapes population structure. Recruit/adult correlations were significant only where adult densities were low, and this effect was species-specific. Thus, at low densities, larvae settle or survive better near adult conspecifics. After 3 years, these patterns remained strongly evident, suggesting Mytilus will not eliminate Perna and that co-existence is possible through partial habitat segregation driven by recruitment limitation of Perna on the high <b>shore</b> and post-settlement <b>effects</b> on Mytilus on the low shore. 1...|$|R

Here, we present some further insight into the physics of such instability. The obliqueness of wave incidence has two effects on the alongshore drift: (i) a direct effect on the relative angle between the wave fronts and the shoreline, and (ii) an indirect effect on the breakers height via the wave energy spreading as the waves refract when they approach the <b>shore.</b> The direct <b>effect</b> turns out to be, in all incidents, stabilizing, and the instability occurs only from the effects of the wave energy spreading, which dominate for large incidence angles. Whereas earlier studies have pointed only to the alongshore drift as the cause of the instability, we show that the instability mechanism involves both the surf and the shoaling zones, so that the link provided by the cross-shore sediment transport is also essential.

40|$|Grazing is an {{important}} determinant of the spatial and temporal patterns of distribution of intertidal organisms on rocky shores. This process is Likely to interact with other environmental factors at different scales in space and time. Understanding these interactions is important before generalizations about the ecological role of grazing can be advanced. In the present study. the ecological significance of grazing was evaluated by excluding limpets from mid-shore levels on rocky coasts in the northwest Mediterranean. Alternative models were evaluated leading to different predictions about {{the interactive effects of}} limpets, slope of the substratum and season. These models were distinguished on the basis of spatial and temporal consistency in these interactions. The null hypothesis of consistent effects of limpets was examined at relatively small (0. 1 to 5 km) and large (100 s of km) spatial scales, between seasons (summer vs winter), between dates within seasons, and in relation to slope of the substratum (horizontal vs vertical substrata). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated inconsistencies in the effects of limpets at different spatial and temporal scales. Interactions between grazing, slope of the substratum and season changed from shore to <b>shore,</b> and strong <b>effects</b> of limpets were observed only occasionally.

40|$|A fine {{time-scale}} {{study was}} undertaken {{on the effects}} of wave exposure, tidal height and substratum type on mussel recruit densities on the south coast of South Africa. Prior to sampling, an exposed and a sheltered shore were identified at each of 2 sites (Diaz Cross and High Rocks) 7 km apart. Each shore was divided into 3 shore levels (termed zones) within which 3 substrata (adult mussels, coralline and non-coralline macroalgae) were sampled. Destructive sampling of early (< 1 mm) and late (1 to 5 mm) plantigrades was performed daily over 30 d during a period of comparatively high recruitment. Recruitment was synchronised among substrata within zones, but not among zones or between sites. This suggests that larvae will settle on all substrata within a zone, but will prefer some substrata over others. They will not, however, search among zones for favoured substrata. Densities of early (but not late) plantigrades were consistently greater at Diaz Cross than High Rocks, indicating important differences in post-settlement mortality between sites. At both sites, densities of both recruit classes were greater on the low and mid shore than on the high shore. Generally (18 out of 20 comparisons), plantigrade densities within each zone were greater on algae than on adult mussels. Approximately 45 % of all recruits collected were found on the foliose coralline alga Corallina, 37 % on adult mussels and 18 % on the rhodophyte Gelidium pristoides. Without secondary relocation from macroalgae to adult mussel beds, juveniles recruiting onto algae are likely to be lost. On low shore algae, densities of both early and late plantigrades were greater for exposed shores. Densities of plantigrades on the mussel bed and on algae on the mid and high shore were not correlated with exposure. Thus, site, substratum and zone all had significant and interacting effects on the density of recruits on both exposed and sheltered <b>shores.</b> The <b>effect</b> of wave exposure on recruitment, at least on the low shore, suggests that spatial subsidies not only in the form of food supply, but also in the form of larval transport, have a role in structuring mussel populations. ...|$|R
40|$|Although sand {{deposits}} {{are present}} on many intertidal rocky <b>shores,</b> their <b>effects</b> on species richness, zonation and trophic structure {{have often been}} overlooked. This study {{is the first to}} recognise sand as an important abiotic factor on South African rocky shores. Rocky shores in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa are subject to extensive sand inundation and are composed of two hard substrata of differing topographies. Four sites on one substratum and six on the other were sampled quantitatively using quadrats. The biota were identified, counted and/ or weighed to provide a matrix of species biomass and numbers in separate zones. This matrix was then analysed using ordination and classification. A total of 321 species were identified which is more than local rocky or sandy shores. While the intermediate disturbance hypothesis would predict high species richness on these shores, it does not fully explain this richness nor the distribution of species assemblages. Habitat heterogeneity, including the dynamics of sand deposits, is strongly influenced by substratum topography and is the most important factor generating species richness. Abrasion by sand (sand scour) causes local reductions in richness but the presence of semi-permanent sand deposits allows habitation by psammophilic and sand-dependent species. As a result the biota of a sand inundated rocky shore includes both a full rocky shore and a large sandy beach component. Substratum topography controls patterns of sand deposition and retention and community analysis showed that samples were clustered primarily according to species richness and secondarily according to substratum type. Ordination of species identified an arc of species assemblages of decreasing levels of sand tolerance. These corresponded to sample groupings so that th assemblages found in various habitats were characterised by particular levels of sand tolerance. The presence of sand has a negative effect on the biomass of primary producers and filter feeders but a positive effect on the biomass of deposit feeders. Because sand is retained to different degrees in different zones, trophic structure varies between zones and to a lesser extent, between rock types. In general, however, the trophic structure of sand inundated rocky shores {{is similar to that of}} non-inundated shores...|$|R

Field campaigns were performed in October and November of 2007. This data was combined with local wind and pressure data and modeled waves data from WAVEWATCH III, used by NOAA. The results showed that the southwest winds acting at the sea surface might be the main responsible for the abrupt elevation of the sea level during the period of study, because their capability of throwing sea water to the near <b>shore</b> by Ekman <b>effect.</b> However, the wave set up due to the high swell waves coming straight to the coast in the same time is a fundamental component in this elevation. In addition, there are evidences of a cyclone near the study area, which can explain some of the abnormalities studied in this work. The washout systems {{have been shown to be}} highly sensitive to this kind of storm surge, and all the sampled and modeled data suggest that the opening and closure of the washouts may occurs due to such phenomena...|$|R
