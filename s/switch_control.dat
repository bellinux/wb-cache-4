5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the entire team to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time <b>switch</b> <b>control</b> between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E

As such, Montana can commandeer vehicles (cars and boats), can move around the map on foot, can interact with civilians and NPCs both hostile and non-hostile, can engage in primary and sub-missions, and can wield a variety of weaponry; pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, a sniper rifle, a rocket launcher, a chainsaw, and various melee weapons, such as pipes and machetes. In a departure from most Grand Theft Auto-style games, Montana cannot kill innocent people. If the player tries to shoot a non-aggressive target, Montana will refuse; if the player tries to hit an innocent person with a car, they will only be injured. However, as the game progresses, the player acquires access to some of Montana's employees; a driver, a boat pilot, a weapons dealer, an enforcer and an assassin. When these employees have been unlocked, the player can <b>switch</b> <b>control</b> from Montana {{to any one of}} them (except the weapons dealer), and when playing as the enforcer or the assassin, the player can kill innocent people.|$|E

500|$|The game's 'FreeFlow' {{combat system}} allows for basic attacks {{including}} strikes, counters, and dodging {{which can be}} combined to keep Batman attacking while moving between enemies and avoiding being attacked himself. Basic enemies include enemies armed with shields and shock batons, while others are armed with guns which significantly damage Batman. These enemies can perform a charge and tackle attack only used by larger enemies in previous games; precision timed dodging, and a batarang can instantly defeat some charging enemies. The system adds the ability to combine attacks on prone enemies without interrupting a combo streak. Batman can counter enemy attacks and throw them into other enemies for increased damage. Batman is also capable of disarming enemies wielding items like baseball bats and using the acquired weapon on several foes before it breaks. Arkham Knight introduces [...] "Dual Play", in which players can seamlessly <b>switch</b> <b>control</b> of Batman {{to one of his}} allies: Robin, Nightwing or Catwoman while in FreeFlow Combat, which the player enters when they have accumulated an uninterrupted combat streak. Each successful, uninterrupted attack adds to the player's combat score, which carries over between each controlled character and unlocks double-team takedowns on opponents at higher scores.|$|E

Rather than raster scanning, these vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD) <b>switch</b> <b>control</b> grids and anode voltages on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses phosphor-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low anode voltages (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their high brightness allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit {{a broad spectrum of}} greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small. (This technology is distinct from fluorescent lighting, which uses a discharge tube.) ...|$|E

40|$|This work proposes three <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> {{strategies}} for aggregated heating, ventilation, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings to track the automatic generation control (AGC) signal in smart grid. The existing control strategies include the direct load control strategy and the setpoint regulation strategy. The direct load control strategy cannot track the AGC signal when the state of charge (SOC) of the aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) exceeds their regulation capacity, while the setpoint regulation strategy provides flexible regulation capacity, but causes larger tracking errors. To improve the tracking performance, we took {{the advantages of the}} two control modes and developed three <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies. The <b>control</b> strategies <b>switch</b> between the direct load control mode and the setpoint regulation mode according to different switching indices. Specifically, we design a discrete-time controller and optimize the controller parameter for the setpoint regulation strategy using the Fibonacci optimization algorithm, enabling us to propose two <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies across multiple time steps. Furthermore, we extend the <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies by introducing a two-stage regulation in a single time step.
