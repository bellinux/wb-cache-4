After analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the metal stamping development process and the interaction level among part design and die design activities, the needs for concurrent <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> and die design are explored in depth, and an activity model for concurrent <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> and die development is presented. A framework is proposed to support concurrent <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> and die development by providing computer aided environments for part, process and die design, advisory tools for part stampability evaluation and part cost estimation, as well as process and die evaluation, and knowledge bases incorporated in the advisory tools. According to the framework, a design support strategy for concurrent <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> and die development is investigated to guide the coordination of design activities including material selection, part stampability evaluation, process planning and die design, as well as cost estimation. Based on the proposed approach and strategy, the system prototype has been developed employing the knowledge-based approach. The results of this research will facilitate the rationalization of <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> and die development and thus reduce the cost of metal stamping development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{spring-back}} {{phenomenon in}} automotive panel forming {{is one of}} the main quality problems, which may affect the tolerance and final shape of panel products. The stamping and spring-back process simulation for the automotive panel were realized by using the Auto form software, emphasizing on the possibly spring-back quantity forecasted and the die surface was optimized to control spring-back. The reasonability of optimization scheme was proved by comparing the simulation result with the actual part. The spring-back in sheet metal forming has been the hot issue concerned in the field of stamping [1]. In order to control the spring-back of the <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> better and improve the formin...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{designing}} of cutting-dies is {{a complex}} and experience-based process, it is poorly supported by conventional 3 D CAD software. Thus, the majority of design activities, including the (re) modeling of those cutting die-components that are directly responsible for performing shaping operations on a sheet-metal <b>stamping</b> <b>part,</b> traditionally {{still need to be}} carried-out repetitively, separately, and manually by the designer. In order to eliminate some of these drawbacks and upgrade the capabilities of conventional 3 D CAD software, this paper proposes a new methodology {{for the development of a}} parametric system capable of automatically performing a (re) modeling process of compound washer diesć cutting-components. The presented methodology integrates CATIA V 5 built-in modules, including Part Design, Assembly Design and Knowledge Advisor, publication mechanism, and compound cutting die-design knowledge. The system developed by this methodology represents an 2 ̆ 7 intelligent 2 ̆ 7 assembly template composed of two modules 2 ̆ 7 GAJA 12 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 GAJA 22 ̆ 7, respectively. 2 ̆ 7 GAJA 12 ̆ 7 is responsible for the direct input of the die-design problem regarding the shape, dimensions and material of the <b>stamping</b> <b>part,</b> its extraction in the form of geometric features, and the transferring of relevant design parameters and features to the module 2 ̆ 7 GAJA 22 ̆ 7. 2 ̆ 7 GAJA 22 ̆ 7 interprets the current values for the input parameters and automatically performs the modeling process of cutting die-components, using die-design knowledge and the company 2 ̆ 7 s internal design and manufacturing standards. Experimental results show that the use of this system significantly shortens the modeling-time for cutting the die-components, improves the modeling-quality, and enables the training of inexperienced designers...|$|E

The {{repairing}} of incomplete {{measured data}} {{caused by the}} inaccessibility or invisibility of some portions of the product surface for measure tools {{plays an important role}} in Reverse Engineering. The fundamental principles of Reverse Engineering and Anatomical CAD are introduced. The main functional advantages of 3 -matic package integrated with Anatomical CAD are presented. There is a big difference in the working flows between Anatomical CAD and traditional CAD packages in the process of RE data repairing. In this paper, we propose a new method of data repairing based on Anatomical CAD. The point cloud of the <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> obtained by a Potable CMM is repaired successfully by 3 -matic, which reduces preparation times by working with a triangular mesh directly, and saves the turn-around time and works more effectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|Quality control {{describes}} numerous {{methods for}} monitoring {{the quality of}} a production process. With respect to this it will be a growing requirement on optical 3 D-measurement techniques to reach the demands of the measurement capability. Here the limitations to fulfill these demands under industrial conditions are discussed when using fringe-projection technique for 3 D-measurement. The analysis is done while measuring an automotive <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> and a 3 D-gauge with a telecentric fringe projection system, as examples. In the analysis we determined some geometric features like diameter of hole and be nding angles of parts of the object surface. The results demonstrate the possibility to achieve a standard deviation of lower than 1 μ m within a measurement volume of 90 mm in diameter for the geometric features. Due to the low standard deviation a measurement capability has been reached like tactile measurement systems. To achieve this the influence of the locale choice of the geometric fitting procedure onto the point cloud has to be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|International audienceControlling {{variability}} {{and process}} optimization are major issues of manufacturing processes {{which should be}} tackled together since optimal processes must be robust. There {{is a lack of}} numerical tool combining optimization and robustness. In this paper, a complete approach starting from modelling and leading to the selection of robust optimal process parameters is proposed. A model of <b>stamping</b> <b>part</b> is developed through Finite Element simulation codes and validated by experimental methods. The search for optimal tool configurations is performed by optimizing a desirability function and by means of a genetic algorithm based optimization code. Several tool configurations are selected from the resulting solutions and are observed through robustness analysis. Noise parameters relating to friction and material mechanical properties are taken into consideration during this analysis. A quadratic response surface developed with design of experiments (DOE) links noise parameters to geometrical variations of parts. For every optimal configuration, the rate of non-conform parts which do not satisfy the design requirements is assessed and the more robust tool configuration is selected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed on this ultimate configuration to observe the respective influence of noise parameters on the process scattering. The method has been applied on a U-shape part...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{tailoring}} a hot <b>stamping</b> <b>part,</b> to achieve locally graded properties, can improve the crash behavior. Depending {{on the role of}} the structural part (carrying either bending or axial crash load), the best position for the local regions with lower strength and higher ductility can be different. The distribution of these local regions and their mechanical properties affects the crash behavior of the part in each loading case and therefore can be effectively designed to improve the crash performance. To investigate these effects and examine the improvement possibilities, a numerical thermalmechanical-metallurgical model of a hot stamping process and a representative side impact crash model were created and analysed. The hot stamping model was used to predict the consequent phase fractions and mechanical properties of tailored hot stamping parts produced with different tailoring scenarios. In the metallurgical model, a modified phase transformation model based on Scheil’s additive principle was incorporated. The geometry and mesh of the stamped part was exported to a crash numerical model with a 3 -point bending configuration. A constitutive model was used to define the plastic behavior of the stamped part corresponding to different hardness values. Various possibilities in locally positioning the high strength or high ductility zones of material were examined. The results show that the positioning of the soft zones has a more significant effect on the crash performance than the variation in their mechanical properties of these soft zones...|$|E

40|$|Boron steels have phase {{transformation}} in hot stamping process, and the mechanical properties of hot <b>stamped</b> <b>parts</b> {{are determined by}} the microstructure generated by {{phase transformation}}. Cooling path has a significant effect on phase transformation and microstructure of the deformed parts; in order to obtain the tailored-customized mechanical properties, the relationship among cooling path, the phase transformation, and the corresponding microstructure must be investigated. In this paper, the dilatometric experiment with the cooling rate of 2, 10, and 50 °C/s and various dwell temperatures was conducted to explore the influence of cooling path on the start and finish temperatures of phase transformations from austenite to ferrite, bainite, and martensite; lasting times of transformations; and final microstructures in hot stamping process. The controllable factors which influence the mechanical properties of hot stamped boron steel component were also determined. In addition, the metallographic and Vickers hardness experiments were conducted as well to confirm the analysis result of dilatometric experiment. The knowledge about the relationship of cooling path, phase transformation, microstructure, and mechanical property of the hot <b>stamped</b> <b>parts</b> helps the design of hot stamping process of the <b>stamped</b> <b>parts</b> with tailored-customized mechanical properties.
