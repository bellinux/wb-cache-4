Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) {{can be used to}} amplify and process phase modulated signals. However, existing SOA nonlinear phase noise (NLPN) models are simplistic and, sometimes, inaccurate. It is, therefore, important to correctly model their behavior since NLPN is the main drawback in these applications. In this paper we show that a more accurate model can be used leading to simple nonlinear noise expressions at the SOA output of differential phase shift keying systems. To demonstrate the utility of this model, we have used it to calculate the optical signal to noise ratio penalties introduced by a power booster SOA and the first inline amplifier of a 40 Gb/s NRZ-DQPSK <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>link.</b> The model parameters have been estimated from measurements taken of a commercial SOA.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a catchment-scale investigation of anabranching in the moderately large 143 000 km 2 Fitzroy River catchment in north-eastern Australia. The primary {{aim is to}} determine whether mapped and remotely sensed data can provide useful information about the characteristics of anabranching in a catchment of this scale. Anabranching comprises 6 % of the total channel network by length, and 24 % of higher-order channels (those with catchment areas over 100 km 2). Three anabranching planform morphologies are described, which occur in geographically distinct regions, and add to previous descriptions of anabranching rivers. Sinuosity and link length are calculated for all channels of the mapped <b>channel</b> network (a <b>link</b> is a stretch of river between two stream junctions). Slope, mean floodplain width, mean annual rainfall and underlying and catchment geology parameters are calculated for links of a stream network derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), in which each link has either a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> or anabranching morphology. Anabranching and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>links</b> do not occupy different ranges of attribute values, and a logistic regression analysis was unable to predict anabranching. However, slope, catchment area, mean floodplain width, length and sinuosity parameters all have significantly different means when comparing <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> with anabranching <b>links,</b> although it is shown that the difference in mean floodplain widths {{is the result of}} its correlation with catchment area. Anabranching channels have a tendency towards shorter link lengths, lower sinuosities and lower valley slopes and occur at larger catchment areas than <b>single</b> <b>channels.</b> These differences are discussed in the context of published hypotheses regarding the cause of anabranching. However, the spatial resolution and precision of our data limit our ability to investigate controls on anabranching, which will require detailed measurement of variables at a reach scale...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to that, in real-life deployments, {{there are various}} scenarios (as discussed in the “Introduction” section) where a larger network is divided into relatively smaller number of nodes on a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> where the <b>links</b> of the same channel {{can stay in the}} same contention neighborhood.|$|R
30|$|Once {{the channel}} sensing and {{characterization}} process end, SUs have to allocate a channel for communication to each link {{they have with}} neighbors. More specifically, the channel assignment problem corresponds to {{the selection of a}} <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> for each <b>link</b> (i.e., for each vertex of the conflict graph) from those available at the intersection between the ranked channel lists of the two nodes involved at the given link. This selection should be done so that two interfering links (i.e., vertices that have a common edge in the conflict graph) do not make use of the same channel.|$|R
40|$|A {{database}} {{is founded}} {{to estimate the}} nonlinear impairments of <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> return-to-zero (RZ) transmission systems with arbitrary parameters. Our link setup consists of multi-span transmission fiber and dispersion compensation component, with dispersion slope full compensating. The total transmission distance and the transmission fiber could be arbitrary, i. e. with arbitrary nonlinear coefficient, attenuation and dispersion. The parameters of input signal could also be arbitrary, i. e. with arbitrary transmission rate, input power, and any duty cycle of RZ pulse. Even the amplification schemes could be single-stage erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), or double-stage EDFA, or hybrid EDFA-Raman amplification. The database is obtained by numerous numerical simulations, neglecting the amplified spontaneous emission noise, polarization mode dispersion. The performance of transmission system impaired by nonlinear effects is represented by eye opening penalty (EOP). One can use the database to estimate the EOP of <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> transmission systems with bit rate up to 160 Gb/s, and can also evaluate the maximum transmission distance for given system impairment conveniently. For high-bit-rate transmission systems, intra-channel nonlinearity dominates the nonlinear impairments, therefore, the database to asses the nonlinear impairment of <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> transmission <b>link</b> is also valid for high-bit-rate wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) systems. The accuracy and the limitation of the database are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The common radio {{transmission}} and reception activities are accomplished through modulation at <b>single</b> carrier frequency. <b>Channels</b> <b>linking</b> information sources and receivers {{are one of}} the fundamental blocks of all communication system. In free space, the signal for transmission and reception suffers from diffraction, scattering and interference due to the presence of dust particles, rain drops, heat and other obstacles. A concurrent dual band receiver is designed to operate at two frequency band with two Local Oscillators (LO) at the detection level. A frequency multiplier is introduced to use Single Oscillator (SO). This architecture reduces component cost, low power consumption and complexity of the receiver thereby enhancing its performance...|$|R
40|$|Using two-hop {{neighborhood}} information, {{we develop}} four approaches for time-division channel access scheduling in ad hoc networks with omni-directional antennas, which {{are derived from}} a novel approach to contention resolution that allows a group of contenders to elect deterministically one or multiple winners in a given contention context (e. g., a time slot). Except for the node activation multiple access (NAMA) which schedules communications through a <b>single</b> <b>channel,</b> the <b>link</b> activation multiple access (LAMA), pair-wise link activation multiple access (PAMA) and hybrid activation multiple access (HAMA) are all dependent on the physical layer {{that is capable of}} creating multiple channels using the code division multiplexing scheme. The throughput and delay characteristics of these protocols in randomly generated multihop wireless networks are studied by analyses and simulation, and their performances are compared against a well-known static scheduling algorithm based on complete topology information, and the ideal CSMA and CSMA/CA protocols.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{infrared}} wireless networks, it is often assumed that the noise from the detector and preamplifier is much lower than that from ambient light sources and hence can be ignored in performance analysis calculations. However, in cellular tracked networks, where the fields of view (FOV) are narrow, {{the contribution of the}} noise from the ambient light sources is greatly reduced and the detector and preamplifier noise become a dominant noise source. An optical system and preamplifier model is used to predict the performance of a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> indoor wireless <b>link</b> operating in this regime. Simulations predict a single 10 mW source can provide 1 Gbit/s wireless coverage over a cell 0. 4 m in diameter at a distance of 2 m from the source.

With the help of 3 D Fractal Tree Antenna (FRA). we are observing Gaussian noise and azimuthal angle in a MIMO system when we are analyzing the fractal antenna for several degrees of freedom, number offractal stages, angle between branches and parent to child branch scaling length. Simulations of fractal tree arrays are conducted so their spatial correlation and MIMO channel capacity can be observed.

40|$|Conference PaperIn this work, we {{show that}} in the {{wireless}} relay network, a tremendous savings in energy {{can be achieved by}} having side information at the transmitters and by employing power control. We present efficient protocols and the corresponding optimal power control policies that approach the universal lower bound on the outage probability of the block fading relay channel. Each of the proposed protocols have their own utility for specific channel conditions. However, a hybrid protocol between two known coding schemes is the best scheme for all channel conditions and is sufficient to approach the lower bound on outage probability. Unlike the <b>single</b> <b>link</b> <b>channel,</b> {{we show that}} exploiting the knowledge of the channel at the transmitters can significantly lower the outage even if the transmit powers at the source and relay have to be kept constant. In this case, it is also demonstrated that the lower bound on outage is closely followed by the outage probability of the hybrid protocol. Our results reveal that exploiting the right network protocol in conjunction with power control result in orders of magnitude savings in power over direct transmission for a target performance level...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{detecting}} fetal ECG using abdominal {{signal is}} a commonly used method, but fetal ECG signal {{will be affected}} by maternal ECG. Current FECG extraction algorithms are mainly aiming at multiple channels signal. They often assume there is only one fetus and did not consider multiple births. This paper proposed a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> blind source separation (SCBSS) algorithm based on source number estimation using multi-algorithm fusion to process single abdominal signal. The method decomposed collected <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> signal into multiple intrinsic mode function (IMF) utilizing Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), mapping <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> into multiple channels. Four multiple channel source number estimation (MCSNE) methods (Bootstrap, Hough, AIC and PCA) were weighting fused to estimate accurate source number and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was employed to determine weighted coefficient. According to source number and IMF, nonnegative matrix was constructed and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was employed to separate mixed signals. Experiments used <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> signal mixed by four man-made signals and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> ECG mixed by two to verify the proposed algorithm. Results showed that the proposed algorithm could determine number of independent signal in single acquired signal.

40|$|A radio {{direction}} finding (DF) {{system is}} an antenna array and a receiver arranged in a combination to determine the azimuth angle of a distant emitter. Basically, all DF systems derive the emitter location from an initial determination of the angle-of-arrival (AOA). Radio direction finding techniques have classically been based on multiple-antenna systems employing multiple receivers. Classic techniques such as MUSIC [1][2] and ESPRIT use simultaneous phase information from each antenna to estimate the angle-of-arrival of the signal of interest. In many scenarios (e. g., hand-held systems), however, multiple receivers are impractical. Thus, <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> techniques are of interest, particularly in mobile scenarios.
