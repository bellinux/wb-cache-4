5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E
5|$|A well {{organized}} tropical wave over northern Africa entered the Atlantic Ocean on May 31. The wave never <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of organization while crossing the Atlantic. It emerged into the eastern north Pacific on June 10. It {{was not until}} June 13 when the convection associated with the wave became better organized. On June 14, Tropical Depression Two-E formed at a location about 515.7miles (830km) from Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Diodorus Siculus (c.a. 90 BCâ€“c.a. 30 BC), another Greek writer, {{wrote in}} Book IV of his Bibliotheca Historica that the Campanian plain was called fiery (Phlegrean) {{because of the}} peak, Vesuvius, which had spouted flames like Etna and <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of the fire that had burnt in ancient history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Tet Offensive, the North Vietnamese <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of {{expanding}} and modernizing their logistical effort. The number of supply and maintenance personnel had fallen, mainly due to increased use of motor/river transportation and mechanized construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year that the 559th Group was using 20 bulldozers, 11 road graders, three rock crushers, and two steamrollers for maintenance and new road construction.|$|E

Birds appear to reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age; this is the age range of breeding recorded in captivity.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance {{north of the}} Bahamas <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of having a well-defined surface circulation and sufficient wind velocity, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tammy at 7:30a.m. EDT (1130 UTC) October 5 east of Florida, skipping tropical depression status. This marked {{only the second time}} that the 'T' name has been used to name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950; the other time was for Tanya in 1995 (later on there would be Tomas in 2010 and Tony in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} budget, the {{restoration}} had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of new cracks and deterioration. Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported {{into the rest of}} the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Binky's cagemate Nuka {{suddenly}} became sick with the parasitic disease sarcocystosis, dying from associated liver failure on July 14, {{a week after}} her symptoms began. Shortly thereafter, Binky <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of the disease. On the morning of July 20, he went into convulsions and died. Zoo visitors left bouquets of flowers outside the bears' empty enclosure, and the zoo's memorial service saw a high turnout despite pouring rain. The bears were buried on zoo grounds.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the health}} of the Dry Island Albertosaurus {{assembly}} was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian Transport Ministry {{said that}} if the {{aircraft}} <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of problems, the checks would be expanded to cover all 737s operating in Indonesia.

5|$|The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the world's first {{commercial}} jetliner. Developed and manufactured by de Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters, the Comet1 prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines {{buried in the}} wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable passenger cabin and <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing torn off in the impact with them, <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of scorching. Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
