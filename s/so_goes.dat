25|$|Reswitching {{implies the}} {{possibility}} of capital reversing, an association between high interest rates (or rates of profit) and more capital-intensive techniques. Thus, reswitching implies the rejection of a simple (monotonic) non-increasing relationship between capital intensity and either the rate of profit, sometimes confusingly {{referred to as the}} rate of interest. As rates fall, for example, profit-seeking businesses can switch from using one set of techniques (A) to another (B) and then back to A. This problem arises for either a macroeconomic or a microeconomic production process and <b>so</b> <b>goes</b> beyond the aggregation problems discussed above.|$|E
25|$|The set for Wisteria Lane, {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} facades {{but also of}} some actual houses, was located on the Universal Studios Hollywood back lot. It was referred to by film crews as Colonial Street, and {{has been used for}} several motion pictures and television shows since the mid-1940s. Notable productions that were filmed here include: <b>So</b> <b>Goes</b> My Love, Leave it to Beaver, The 'Burbs, Providence, Deep Impact, Bedtime for Bonzo, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Gremlins, The Munsters, Psycho, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. For the second season of Desperate Housewives, the street underwent some significant changes. Among the most noticeable of these changes was the removal of a church facade and a mansion in order to make room for Edie's house and a park.|$|E

After Alabama banned the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1956, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth formed the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) {{the same year}} to challenge the city's segregation policies through lawsuits and protests. When the courts overturned the segregation of the city's parks, the city responded by closing them. Shuttlesworth's home was repeatedly bombed, as was Bethel Baptist Church, where he was pastor. After Shuttlesworth was arrested and jailed for violating the city's segregation rules in 1962, he sent a petition to Mayor Art Hanes' office asking that public facilities be desegregated. Hanes responded with a letter informing Shuttlesworth that his petition had been thrown in the garbage.

[...] Portland's NAACP tried to create a united front among Irish, Jewish, African-Americans, and labor unions {{in opposition to the}} change, but it was unsuccessful.
