6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] {{she agreed}} softly. [...] "I really am <b>sorry</b> that I <b>bothered</b> you. There {{is one thing}} I should like to know, though {{and that is how}} you managed to escape?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] she said. [...] "I {{must have}} made a mistake. I was quite sure {{that this was the}} address, but it evidently isn't. Thank you so much. I'm so <b>sorry</b> to have <b>bothered</b> you." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, in a {{place of}} {{business}} an apologetic or over-polite request made of a person who is paid to provide the service you may want, is usually seen as unnecessary - and may backfire. For example: [...] "I'm terribly <b>sorry</b> to <b>bother</b> you -- but may I have another napkin?" [...] might elicit an eyeroll. Simply say: [...] "may I have another napkin, please?" [...] This may hold true even, perhaps counter-intuitively, if the latter is delivered somewhat more curtly or coolly.|$|R

"I'm <b>sorry</b> to <b>bother</b> you," [...] he said, after a pause, half {{afraid to}} speak, [...] "but {{there are four}} lamps all burning hard in these four compartments, and using up the air we may need by-and-by for our own breathing. If I were to {{climb to the top}} of the carriage--which I can easily do--I could put them all out, and economize our oxygen. It would leave us in the dark, but it'd give us one more chance of life.

This going about together--these pleasant little parties--there's been some kind of misunderstanding. I told her I saw no harm in it, but I should just {{like to hear from}} yourself. Has Cassandra been left a little too much in the company of Mr. Denham?" ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sorry</b> to <b>Bother</b> You is {{the sixth}} album by {{political}} hip hop group The Coup, which {{was released on}} October 30, 2012, on ANTI-. It's the group's first album where no samples are being used and all tracks are made by live instrumentation. It debuted at #194 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling about 2000 copies in the first week. At Metacritic it received an average score of 80, which indicates [...] "generally favorable acclaim", based on 15 reviews.

5000|$|Once {{the musical}} backing had been {{completed}} Stewart recorded the lead vocal and Godley and Creme the backing vocals, but even though the song was finished Godley felt it was still lacking something. Stewart said, [...] "Lol remembered he had said something into the grand piano mics when he was laying down the solos. He'd said 'Be quiet, big boys don't cry' — heaven knows why, but I soloed it and we all agreed that the idea sounded very interesting {{if we could just}} find the right voice to speak the words. Just at that point the door to the control room opened and our secretary Kathy Redfern looked in and whispered 'Eric, <b>sorry</b> to <b>bother</b> you. There's a telephone call for you.' Lol jumped up and said 'That's the voice, her voice is perfect!'." [...] The group agreed that Redfern was the ideal person, but Redfern was unconvinced and had to be coaxed into recording her vocal contribution, using the same whispered voice that she had used when entering the control room. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for the name of the 1980s band Boys Don't Cry.|$|R
5000|$|Frank {{leaves to}} go see {{scientist}} Ted Olson at the Police Squad crime lab. Ted tells Frank that if the shooter stood where Sally said, the bullet which killed Johnson should have penetrated deeper. Ted demonstrates this by shooting into a shelf of videotapes containing Barbara Walters interviews. Ed and Frank then go a neighborhood in the city called Little Italy to question Ralph Twice's widow ("We're <b>sorry</b> to <b>bother</b> you {{at a time like}} this, Mrs. Twice. We would have come earlier, but your husband wasn't dead then"). She tells them that Ralph didn't have any enemies, although the Democrats didn't like him. Mrs. Twice claims that Ralph was a good man and laments how she's going to break the news of his death to her daughter. Frank and Ed suggest preposterous lies such as: [...] "he was killed by left-wing insurgents from Paraguay", or that [...] "he threw himself on a grenade and saved a battalion", and ultimately that [...] "he was traded to the Cubs for Reggie Jackson". They leave Mrs. Twice in more grief than when they found her. No further progress is made in the next ten hours, so the following morning Frank reports back to Police Squad. While Sally is giving a [...] "formal" [...] statement (wearing in an evening dress with a stenographer wearing a tuxedo), Ed and Frank receive the lab reports, brought to them by Al. The lab reports contradict Sally's version of the events, suggesting that the shooter was really much further away from the victims than she claimed.|$|R
