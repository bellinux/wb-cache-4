The objectives of the study were to assess the efficacy of the sperm to uptake exogenous DNA in relation to sperm viability. Two trials were carried out. Trial 1 was achieved to assess the effects of <b>semen</b> <b>dilution</b> (4 µl diluent/ 1 µl semen), heat incubation (exposure of semen to 37 °C for 30 minutes) and the addition of lipofectin and their combinations on sperm characteristics. The sperm motility in the heat incubated or the diluted semen was 79 % and was significantly less than that estimated for the un-treated semen (90 %). However, no significant effects of heat incubation or <b>semen</b> <b>dilution</b> were mostly observed in the percentages of live, dead and abnormal sperm. The combination of heat incubation and <b>semen</b> <b>dilution</b> resulted in more reduction in the sperm motility compared to that occurred by either one. The addition of lipofectin to the diluted semen then heat incubated significantly detracted the motility and the percentage of live sperm, and increased the percentages of dead and abnormal sperm, and the effect was positively associated with lipofectin concentration. Trial 2, was designed to assess the effects of lipofectin (5 %) addition on the fusion of DNA into the sperm and sperm viability. The exogenous DNA used was the plasmid pUC 18, and two specifi...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Previous {{research}} has shown that the sperm quality index (SQI) is positively correlated with semen characteristics as well as fertility when broiler breeder semen is diluted 10 -fold prior to analysis. How-ever, {{research has}} not been conducted to establish if se-men dilution rate affects the ability of the SQI to predict fertility when inseminating a constant number of sperm or a constant volume of semen. As a result, 3 experiments were undertaken. The objective of the first study was to determine if diluent, minimum essential media, or 0. 85 % saline affects the SQI. The second objectivewas to identify potential <b>semen</b> <b>dilution</b> rates for the SQI by obtaining the range in live sperm concentrations to which the SQI is most sensitive. The purpose of experiment 3 was to determine which <b>semen</b> <b>dilution</b> rate, 10 -, 25 -, 50 -, 75 -fold, or a constant concentration of 180 × 106 sperm/mL, yields an SQI that is most predictive of fertility.

40|$|BackgroundProstate-specific antigen (PSA) is a {{biomarker}} {{of recent}} semen exposure. There is currently only limited information on whether topical vaginal products affect PSA assays. We investigated this question using various dilutions of several vaginal products (lubricants and spermicides) and the Abacus ABAcard for PSA detection. Study DesignPooled semen controls and various dilutions of nonoxynol- 9 (N 9), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), Replens, Gynol 2, K-Y jelly, Astroglide, Surgilube, combined with pooled <b>semen</b> <b>dilutions,</b> were tested for PSA using the Abacus ABAcard. ResultsN 9 (2 % with saline) and CMC {{did not appear}} to affect the results of testing with the ABAcard, but not all <b>semen</b> <b>dilutions</b> were tested. The other products (including Replens and Gynol, which is 2 % N 9 with propylene glycol, K-Y, Astroglide and Surgilube) at some of the dilutions tested either affected or gave invalid results with PSA testing using the ABAcard. Both Gynol 2 and K-Y at 1 : 10 dilution gave false-positive results. ConclusionsSome vaginal products affect PSA results obtained by using the semiquantitative ABAcard. In vivo confirmation is necessary to further optimize PSA detection when topical vaginal products are present.

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the cryopreservation of pheasant semen by adopting the freezing/thawing protocol by Tselutin et al. (1999) with some modifications. Semen was collected by abdominal massage twice a week. Evaluations were performed on pooled semen from fifteen males (Phasianus colchicus mongolicus). Two <b>semen</b> <b>dilutions</b> (DIL) with Lake diluent (1 : 2 and 1 : 3, v/v; Lake, 1968) and two equilibration times (ET) at 5 °C (10 min and 30 min) before dimethylacetamide (DMA) addition, were tested. Assessment of sperm mobility was performed by Accudenz methodology according to Froman’s procedure (1997) and viability by eosin/nigrosin staining. As expected, viability and mobility were strongly affected by the freezing/thawing procedure. ET did not affect mobility while influenced live sperm percentage during the DMA equilibration (DMA-Eq). Semen/diluent ratio significantly (p< 0. 001) modified the mobility parameter and the highest progressive movements of spermatozoa were obtained with the most diluted semen in each critical step of the cryopreservation procedure. In conclusion, for pheasant semen cryopreservation, the 1 : 3 dilution ratio can be considered appropriate and the cooling time up to 30 minutes not crucial for the spermatozoa mobility and viability. Nevertheless, the deleterious effect of freezing/thawing procedure reduced live thawed spermatozoa to 24 % and forward motility to 89 % of the initial movement capacity...|$|R
40|$|Placement {{of sperm}} {{deep in the}} equine uterine horn allows fewer sperm to be inseminated while {{maintaining}} acceptable fertility, and has been promoted for use in circumstances when fertility {{would be expected to}} be low if standard insemination were used (e. g. semen from a subfertile stallion, or frozen-thawed semen). Two main deep- horn insemination techniques, transrectally guided (TRG) and hysteroscopic (HYS) insemination, have been developed for this purpose; however, there is some controversy regarding their comparative efficacy. This study was conducted to compare pregnancy rates when mares were inseminated by TRG or HYS, utilizing sperm numbers approaching and under the threshold for maximal fertility, resulting in reduced fertility. Pregnancy rates were not different between HYS and TRG techniques when 1 x 106 or 0. 5 x 106 sperm were inseminated. Combined pregnancy rates for the two techniques were also not different. Pregnancy rates using a subthreshold number of sperm were not significantly affected by a deep-horn insemination technique. Dilution of semen to less than 20 x 106 sperm/mL has been reported to decrease semen quality in multiple species, a phenomenon known as the <b>semen</b> ?<b>dilution</b> effect. ? The sperm concentrations utilized in Experiment 1 were 5 and 2. 5 x 106 /mL (1 and 0. 5 x 106 sperm doses, respectively). This experiment was performed to evaluate whether the lower pregnancy rates obtained with 0. 5 x 106 sperm was due to lower quality plasma membrane integrity (PMI) and sperm motion characteristics (TMOT, PMOT, VCL, VAP, VSL, STR). Treatments evaluated included 2. 5 x 106 sperm/mL with the addition of 0, 7. 5, and 25 % seminal plasma, 30 x 106 sperm/mL, and 3 : 1 extender: semen. The 2. 5 x 106 sperm/mL treatments have lower initial PMI, TMOT, and PMOT, but they maintain their initial quality following 24 and 48 h of cool-storage. The sperm velocity and straightness parameters suggest that sperm swim faster but have a more circular pattern as seminal plasma increases to 25 % at a given concentration. Based on the findings from this experiment, the <b>semen</b> ?<b>dilution</b> effect? may not significantly alter stallion sperm characteristics when a commercially-available semen extender is used for <b>semen</b> <b>dilution...</b>|$|E

Our {{objective was to}} determine if the SQI from semen prior to storage is predictive of semen quality after storage. Prior to <b>semen</b> <b>dilution,</b> sperm concentration, viability, and SQI were determined for each male’s neat semen sample. Each ejaculate was then diluted 1 : 1 with Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender and maintained at 4 C on a rotary shaker for 16 h. After <b>semen</b> <b>dilution,</b> sperm concentration, viability, and SQI were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 h. The SQI increased from 0 to 4 h of storage then decreased in a quartic fashion as storage time further increased (r = 0. 83). There was a linear decrease in sperm viability as storage time 2 increased (r = 0. 87). There was a negative relationship for the SQI from fresh semen with percentage of dead 2 sperm over storage period yielding correlation coefficients ranging from r =- 0. 88 to- 0. 55. Over storage, positive correlation coefficients for the SQI from fresh semen with live sperm concentration ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 61. There were also strong positive correlations for percentage of dead sperm and live sperm concentration from fresh semen with their respective semen characteristic at each storage period (r= 0. 81 to 0. 97 and r= 0. 80 to 0. 96, respectively).

We investigated the in vitro effect of Gynol 2, K-Y Jelly 2, Replens 2, Astroglide 2, Carbopol, and Silicorel on quantitative detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Study DesignA predetermined concentration of each of the gels was added to serially diluted semen samples. Additionally, serial dilutions of each of the gels were added to three different <b>semen</b> <b>dilutions</b> (high, medium, or low). The resulting samples were tested for PSA on the Abbott ARCHITECT System. ResultsWhen using the Abbott ARCHITECT system, the only products that inhibited PSA detection were Gynol 2 and Replens 2. The inhibition caused by Gynol 2 was dose-dependent, but that of Replens was dose-independent. K-Y Jelly 2 -spiked samples had higher PSA values than controls. ConclusionsCaution is warranted when using the Abbott quantitative assay for PSA detection as a biomarker of semen exposure in settings where Gynol 2, Replens 2 or K-Y Jelly 2 might also have been used. Neither Astroglide 2 nor Silicorel inhibited PSA detection. Additional studies evaluating other vaginal products, including microbicides, and their effects on other assays, are needed. In vivo studies will be especially important to optimize PSA detection from clinical samples. ImplicationsResearchers should consider the potential for specific lubricants or any vaginal products to affect the particular assay used for semen biomarker detection.

Fertility was highest with unfrozen (76 and 83 %) and frozen (14 and 15 %) <b>semen</b> with <b>dilution</b> rates of 1 : 3 or 1 : 5. When semen {{was held at}} 5 C for. 25, 1, 4, 6, or 8 hr before DMSO was added, fertility of frozen-thawed sperm was lowered to levels of less than 11 %, whereas the level of fertility (16 %) was highest with a holding time of 2 hr. Fertility of processed-unfrozen semen was lowered with a holding time of 6 hr; holding times of. 25, 1, or 2 hr {{had no effect on}} semen fertility. The DMSO levels of 4 or 6 % (v/v) significantly depressed fertility of processed-unfrozen semen, whereas DMSO levels of 0, 2, or 6 % provided less cryoprotection than the 4 % level in which fertility was highest at 22 %. Equilibration time of semen and 4 % DMSO resulted in decreased fertility levels from 82 % and 33 %, respectively, for periods of 4 or 6 hr for processed-unfrozen samples.

Technical aspects of <b>semen</b> collection, <b>dilution</b> and cryopreservation have limited the development and use of AI in camelid and equid species. To-date, efficiency is low but progress has been made and viable offspring have been produced through the use of AI in domestic South American camelids using both fresh and frozen semen. The origin, composition, and function of the viscous component of camelid seminal plasma remain a mystery and an obvious area for future research. A better understanding of the normal constituents of seminal plasma will enable the rational design of semen extenders suitable for camelids. Post-thaw sperm viability is very low, and studies are needed to address questions of optimal freezing and thawing procedures as well as the insemination dose. The basis for differences in reported pregnancy rates with sexed and frozen semen in domestic equids, and the ultimate success of AI in wild equids will require continued research into the ‘‘stallion effect’’, extenders and cryoprotectants, optimal volume and number of spermatozoa, temperatures during handling, processing an transport, and insemination techniques.

Semen was divided to be diluted (1 : 3) in MMC and LGM and subsequently chilled in Equitainer®. Seminal parameters of motility and spermatic morphology, membrane integrity (hyposmotic test), spermatic viability and spontaneous acrosome reaction (Trypan-blue Giemsa stain) were evaluated in fresh and chilled semen after 12 and 24 hours of incubation at 4 ºC. No difference between extenders was identified in semen conservation after 12 hours. After 24 hours just spermatic motility was different (p> 0. 05). But, after both periods of conservation, semen diluted in LGM maintained most of the characteristics verified in the fresh semen.

40|$|Aims: To {{develop a}} fast and {{sensitive}} protocol for detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in bovine semen {{and to make}} a critical evaluation of the analytical sensitivity. Methods and Results: Processed semen was spiked with known amounts of MAP. Semen from different bulls as well as <b>semen</b> of different <b>dilutions</b> was tested. The samples were treated with lysing agents and beadbeating and the DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform. Real-time PCR with a fluorescent probe targeting the insertion element IS 900 detected as few as 10 organisms per sample of 100 ¿l semen. PCR-inhibition was monitored by inclusion of an internal control. Pre-treatment with immunomagnetic separation was also evaluated, but was not shown to improve the overall sensitivity. Conclusions: Real-time PCR is a sensitive method for detection of MAP in bovine semen. Lysis by mechanical disruption followed by phenol and chloroform extraction efficiently isolated DNA and removed PCR-inhibitors.

Ten ejaculates, five each from a buffalo and a Sahiwal bull, possessing more than 60 % sperm motility were used. These ejaculates were diluted in Tris-citric acid (TCA) extender (at 37 °C; 50 X 106 spermatozoa/mi), containing either GTLS (gentamycin 500 g/ml, tylosin 100 g/ml and linco-spectin 300 / 600 g/ml), streptomycin 1000 g/ml and penicillin 1000 IU/ml (SP), or negative control with no antibiotics (NCON). Samples were cooled to 4 °C in 2 hours, equilibrated at 4 °C for 4 hours, filled in 0. 5 ml straws, frozen in a controlled rate cell freezer and plunged into liquid nitrogen. Frozen semen was thawed at 37 °C for 15 seconds. Post-thaw sperm motion characteristics, plasma membrane integrity and sperm morphology were determined. Total aerobic bacterial counts and the frequency of appearance of bacterial genera were determined in neat <b>semen,</b> after <b>dilution,</b> and after freezing and thawing. Mean motilities (visual; computer-assisted, linear and circular), velocities (straight-line, average path and curvilinear) and lateral head displacement (LHD) in post- thaw semen samples did not differ due to antibiotics or species. Same was true for sperm plasma membrane integrity. Morphologically abnormal spermatozoa were lower (P< 0. 05) in GTLS and SP than in NCON. Sperm cells possessing normal acrosomes were higher (P< 0. 01) in GTLS and SP than in NCON. Total aerobic bacterial counts in post-thaw samples were lower (P< 0. 05) in GTLS than in SP or NCON. Staphylococcus and micrococcus were lower in samples treated with GTLS than that of SP or NCON. Pseudomonas and E. coli were more frequent in buffaloes than Sahiwal bull samples. Proteus and corynebacteria were scarcely present. In conclusion, GTLS was not determintal to post thaw motion characteristics, sperm morphology and membrane integrity of buffalo and Sahiwal bull spermatozoa.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two different extenders (Skimmed Milk Glucose - SMG or Lactose - Egg Yolk - LEY) on physical characteristics and fertility of fractionated donkey semen cooled at 5 °C. For this, four Pêga donkeys were used as semen donors. The sperm rich fraction of the ejaculate was diluted preparing insemination doses containing 400 x 106 motile spermatozoa in a volume of 22 mL, cooled to 5 °C and stored up to 48 hours in a container proposed by Palhares (1997). Sperm motility and vigor were assessed in fresh semen, after first <b>semen</b> <b>dilution,</b> before insemination, at 24 and 48 hours after storage. For the fertility evaluation, 44 mares were inseminated with semen stored for a period between 12 and 24 hours. The mares were inseminated on fixed days (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) after the detection of a follicle greater than a 30 mm diameter in one of the ovaries through ovulation. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed on day 12 post-ovulation, using transrectal ultrasonography. Semen diluted in SMG showed superior sperm motility than LEY, at the Pre-AI evaluation (P< 0. 05). At 48 hours of storage, all donkeys had motility values between 45 and 53 % for semen diluted in SMG, while only one donkey showed motility greater than 30 % in the LEY treatment. The pregnancy rate/cycle for mares inseminated with semen diluted in SMG was superior than that obtained using LEY (56. 52 % vs 4. 76 %, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} a new semen diluent (diluent C) which prolongs the sustained motility of ocean pout sperm, a distinguishing {{feature of the}} sperm of internally fertilizing teleosts. Sperm motilities were compared in the new diluent (C), based on the ionic composition of ocean pout seminal plasma, vs. four other semen diluents (A, B, D and E) ordinarily used for extending the semen of external fertilizers. While sperm retained motility after extension of ocean pout semen {{in all of these}} diluents, motility was significantly reduced following sperm resuspension in diluents B and D. Since sperm motility remained high in diluent C, formulated to closely mimic the composition of ocean pout seminal plasma, it was selected for additional experimentation. Negative effects were observed on sperm motility after dilution (> 1 : 10) of ocean pout semen with diluent C, but sperm motility could be restored by replacement of the seminal plasma. Of practical importance for storage of ocean pout sperm at 4 degrees C, it was shown that <b>semen</b> <b>dilution</b> 1 : 3 in diluent C preserved sperm motility beyond 5 days. Although ocean pout sperm tolerate a fairly wide range of K+ levels (0 - 30 mmol/l), the best motility was observed from 10 - 20 mmol/l [K+], similar to the ionic levels found in seminal plasma. Finally, since no change in fertility of ocean pout sperm occurred following 1 : 3 dilution of semen in diluent C, we conclude that diluent C is an effective medium for in vitro artificial egg insemination and prolonged motility of ocean pout sperm.

40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the antioxidative capacity of vitamin E, vitamin C and their combination (vitamin E+C) on standard semen parameters i. e., mortality, percent live sperms, percent abnormal sperms and acrosomal integrity in cryopreserved Bhadawari bull semen. Materials and Methods: Ejaculates collected from four Bhadawari bulls were evaluated and later pooled at 37 °C. Pooled semen sample was divided into four equal parts viz. T- 1,T- 2,T- 3 and C. The divided samples were diluted with a Trisbased extender containing the antioxidants vitamin E (5 mM) (T- 1) vitamin C (5 mM) (T- 2), vitamin E+C combination (5 mM+ 5 mM) (T- 3) and extender containing no antioxidants (control, C). The diluted samples with different antioxidant concentration were cooled to 5 °C, frozen in 0. 25 -ml French straws and stored in liquid nitrogen (− 196 °C). Frozen straws were thawed individually at 37 °C for 20 s in a water bath for evaluation. Results: Semen extender supplementation with vitamin E (5 mM), vitamin C (5 mM) and vitamin E+C combination caused significant (p< 0. 01) increases in the seminal attributes while significant (p< 0. 01) decreases was observed in percent abnormal sperms in comparison to control group indicating that supplementation of antioxidant in form of vitamin and their combination improves the quality of post thaw semen. Significantly higher values of semen parameters were observed in the T- 3 followed by T- 1 and T- 2 indicating the anti-oxidative capacity of different supplements utilized during the study.

Twenty saliva and <b>semen</b> stains, four <b>dilution</b> series (10 - 0. 01 μl saliva, 5 - 0. 01 μl semen) and, optionally, bona fide or mock casework samples of human or non-human origin were analyzed by 20 participating laboratories using an RNA extraction or RNA/DNA co-extraction method. Two novel mRNA multiplexes were used: a saliva triplex (HTN 3, STATH and MUC 7) and a semen pentaplex (PRM 1, PRM 2, PSA, SEMG 1 and TGM 4). The laboratories used different chemistries and instrumentation and a majority (16 / 20) were able to successfully isolate and detect mRNA in dried stains. The simultaneous extraction of RNA and DNA from individual stains not only permitted a confirmation {{of the presence of}} saliva/semen (i. e. tissue/fluid source of origin), but allowed an STR profile of the stain donor to be obtained as well. The method proved to be reproducible and sensitive, with as little as 0. 05 μl saliva or semen, using different analysis strategies. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability to positively identify the presence of saliva and semen, as well as obtain high quality DNA profiles, from old and compromised casework samples.

Abeygunawardena et al, (2001) stated {{that the proportion of}} calvings from Al was negligible in Eastern Province (EP) and Northern Province (NP) when compared to other regions of Sri Lanka. So far there are no studies regarding the doe factors, semen factors, inseminators and the successful rate of the Al service of goat semen in Jaffna. Thus the objective of the present study is to examine the viability of goat semen and the effects of refrigeration (at 4 - 80 C) for 3 days on the viability of goat chilled semen. In our present studies chilled semen of goat species (Sannan and Jamunapari) were collected by means of artificial vagina and stored at 4 - 80 C. General examination including volume, colour and pH was performed on chilled <b>semen.</b> After <b>dilution,</b> microscopic examination was performed to evaluate the progressive individual motility, sperm morphology and sperm count. Chilled semen of both species was compared by microscopic examination from day 0 to day 3 during storage. Hemocytometer was loaded with 10 HI of semen to evaluate the sperm count. Eosin stain (1 %) was used to assess the viable sperm. Hemocytometer and stop watch were used to evaluate the sperm velocity. Repeated measures and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's post test were performed to compare the semen quality of both species. Viability decreased significantly (ANOVA P< 0. 05) in a time dependent manner during storage. For Sannan, at O h (control) (93. 02 ± 0. 6958 %; 22. 460 ± 1. 1020 um/s), 2411 (86. 18 ± 0. 6250 %; 16. 870 ± 0. 8278 um/s), 4811 (80. 96 ± 0. 7471 %; 11. 190 ± 0. 8825 um/s) and at 72 h (76. 64 ± 0. 5294 %; 4. 993 ± 0. 3624 um/s). For Jamunapari at O h (control) (91. 13 ± 0. 2605 %; 19. 060 ± 0. 7957 um/s), 24 h (87. 74 ± 0. 2137 %; 14. 210 ± 1. 1850 um/s), 48 h (81. 91 ± 0. 2188 %; 8. 923 ± 0. 8795 gm/s) and at 72 h (77. 57 ± 0. 2440 %; 4. 347 ± 0. 7467 um/s).

Three ejaculates from each of 145 boars were collected. Preparation of the <b>semen</b> doses included <b>dilution</b> with an EDTA extender and storage for up to 72 h post collection. The semen doses were assessed using flow cytometric methods for the percentage of viable sperm (PI/SYBR- 14) and sperm DNA fragmentation (SCSA) at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. A total of 3276 experimental inseminations in Danish breeding herds were conducted. The results showed that for 11 (7. 6 %) of the boars at least one of the three samples showed a value of DNA fragmentation index (DFI) above 20 % within the storage period. Total number of piglets born (litter size) for Hampshire, Landrace and Danish Large White boars was, respectively, 0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 9 piglets smaller per litter when DFI values were above 2. 1 % as opposed to below this value.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to ascertain the ele-mental content of whole semen obtained during various times of the breeding season from two breeds of turkeys. It was also possible then to determine any changes that may occur due to length of time the toms were in semen production. Toms used in this study were hatched in late March and early April. At 12 weeks of age, they were placed on range and re-mained there until late fall. Semen collec-tions began in late November and were car-ried on for a period of six months. At each collection, 10 to 12 males were used as semen donors. As the season progressed, the number of toms producing semen gradually declined. Attempts were made to determine the level of 14 elements in whole semen by a Jarrell-Ash Direct Reading Spectrophotom-eter. Since semen quantities from individ-ual toms are small, it was necessary to use pooled semen collected on several days. Following each collection, the semen was placed in a drying oven at 85 °C. for a mini-mum of seven days. Yields of dry semen at each collection period for the two breeds are shown in Table 1.

Semen samples were collected once a week for four weeks from the bucks in first group using an artificial vagina, and from the animals in second group using an electroejaculator. The collected semen samples were diluted with sodium citrate extender with three different level of egg yolk (5, 10 and 20 %). Extend semen samples were stored at 5 °C for three days. Computer assisted sperm analysis and Sperm Class Analyzer® were used for evaluation of the buck semen samples. Sperm motility parameters were evaluated which includes; percentage of motile sperm, percentage of progressive motile sperm, the value of the linear velocity (VSL), the value of the average velocity (VAP), the value of the curvilinear velocity (VCL), and the amplitude of lateral movement of the head (ALH). Results showed that all sperm motility parameters under the different level of egg yolk in semen samples that collected by artificial vagina were significantly higher than those which collected by electroejaculator. The percentage of motile sperm and progressive motile sperm of samples that collected by artificial vagina were higher at 10 % of egg yolk, while these motility parameters were higher at 5 % of egg yolk for semen samples that collected by electroejaculator.

40|$|The {{structural}} stability of transcriptionally inert paternal chromatin is of vital {{importance for the}} fertilization process and early embryonic development. Accordingly, a series of eight experiments were conducted during a 7 -month period to investigate: (1) effects of bull breed, individuality, successive ejaculations, semen quality characteristics (SQC), <b>semen</b> <b>dilution</b> rates and hypothermic storage of semen in a Tris-egg yolk extender on incidence of sperm nuclear chromatin instability (NCI), and (2) effects {{of the interaction between}} variation of NCI within a frozen ejaculate and variation of oocytes quality due to maturation time and/or season on the efficiency of in vitro embryo production (IVEP). Semen samples were collected once a week from six bulls using an AV and only ejaculates (n = 220) of > 0. 30 x 10 (9) sperm/ml and >= 60 % motility were used. NCI was measured by: (1) detection of lysine-rich histones in sperm chromatin using aniline blue staining, (2) sperm susceptibility to acid-induced nuclear DNA denaturation in situ using acridine orange test, and (3) sperm susceptibility to nuclear chromatin decondensation (NCD). Bovine oocytes (n = 695) were matured in vitro for 18 or 24 h, fertilized after sperm selection through a swim-up procedure and cultured for 72 h. The results showed that the 2 nd ejaculates were superior to the 1 st ones with respect to chromatin stability. Dilution of semen to 49. 67 +/- 8. 56 x 10 (6) sperm/ml (1 : 19) decreased resistance of sperm to NCD. Cooling of semen had no significant effect on chromatin stability. Cryopreservation of semen augmented sperm vulnerability to DNA denaturation. Improvement of SQC (semen volume, sperm motility, velocity, viability and morphological normalcy) was generally concomitant with increase of sperm resistance to NCI. While Blonde d'Aquitaine bulls had a resistance to NCD higher than Limousine bulls in fresh semen, the former showed a greater susceptibility to DNA denaturation than the latter in cooled semen. Individuality significantly influenced NCI. The variability of NCI within a frozen ejaculate affected efficiency of IVEP. Significant negative correlations were observed between incidence of NCI and both fertilization rate and developmental capacity of embryos after maturation of oocytes for 18 h. The significant variation in IVEP traits due to season was independent of the effect of sperm chromatin instability. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

After artificial insemination, animals were evaluated based on the estrous return and the number of piglet's born. Cysteine at concentrations of 10. 0 and 20. 0 mM resulted in more pronounced reductions even at the time zero. Semen viability decreased to levels below 10 % at these high levels of CYS in the first 24 hour of storage at 17 ºC. At the end of the storage time, less than 65 % of sperm cells had intact plasma membrane in all groups. The sperm viability decreased significantly when the semen was added at high concentrations of CYS (time " 0 "; CYS 10. 0 and CYS 20. 0; p< 0. 05), when compared to the other CYS concentrations.
