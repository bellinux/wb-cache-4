5|$|Gabriel initiates {{a second}} {{broadcast}} by showing a simulated {{explosion of the}} U.S. Capitol building, causing a public panic. Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility <b>superstation</b> in West Virginia. They find {{a team led by}} Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to kill all of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of the natural gas distribution system and redirects all of the gas into the station. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.|$|E
5|$|The video had {{its world}} premiere on MTV during prime time on March 31, 1983 though {{it should be}} noted that neither Beat It nor Billie Jean was, as is often claimed, the first music video by an African-American artist to be played on MTV. Soon after its premiere the video was also running on other video {{programs}} including BET's Video Soul, <b>SuperStation</b> WTBS's Night Tracks, and NBC's Friday Night Videos. In fact, Beat It was the first video shown on the latter's first ever telecast on July 29, 1983.|$|E
5|$|On the {{asteroid}} Polis Massa, Obi-Wan regroups with Yoda and Padmé {{gives birth to}} twins named Luke and Leia before dying shortly thereafter. A funeral procession is held for Padmé on Naboo, who is buried with the necklace Anakin made her years earlier. On Mustafar, Palpatine finds a severely burnt Vader still alive. After returning to Coruscant, Vader's mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. Palpatine explains to Vader that he killed Padmé in his anger. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Yoda decide to conceal the twins from the Sith, as they are the galaxy's only hope for freedom. Yoda exiles himself to the planet Dagobah, while Vader and the Emperor oversee {{the construction of a}} <b>superstation,</b> the Death Star. Bail Organa adopts Leia as his own daughter and takes her to Alderaan, while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-family Owen and Beru Lars on Tatooine, where Obi-Wan intends to watch over Luke until the time is right to challenge the Empire.|$|E
50|$|Beginning June 28, 1991, Videon added three U.S. <b>Superstations</b> to its pay-TV lineup: WTBS Atlanta (cable 33), WGN Chicago (cable 34), and WSBK Boston (cable 35).|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} megafaunal bioturbation was characterised at flat sedimented {{sites on the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) at 2500 m depth. This study {{investigated}} the properties of and spatial variation in surficial bioturbation at the MAR. Lebensspuren assemblages were assessed at four <b>superstations</b> {{either side of the}} MAR and in two different surface productivity regimes, north and south of the sub-polar front. High-definition ROV videos from these <b>superstations</b> were used to quantify area and abundance of 58 lebensspuren types. Lebensspuren area was lowest at the SW with 4. 12 % lebensspuren coverage and the SE & NW had the greatest area coverage of lebensspuren (9. 69 % for both). All stations except the SW were dominated by epifaunal, particularly track-style, lebensspuren. Infaunal mounds were more significant in the southern <b>superstations,</b> particularly in the SW. In terms of lebensspuren assemblage composition, all <b>superstations</b> were significantly different from one another, which directly corresponded with the composition of lebensspuren-forming epifauna. Lebensspuren assemblages appeared to have been primarily influenced by local-scale environmental variation and were independent of detrital flux. This investigation presented a novel relationship between lebensspuren and faunal density that conflicted with the traditionally held view of inverse proportionality and suggests that, at the MAR, megafaunal reworking was not the only significant control on lebensspuren assemblages...|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Calvin Hastings, {{who bought}} WCSL in Cherryville in 1983 and WGNC in Gastonia six years later, bought WOHS and began calling the three {{stations}} Piedmont <b>Superstations.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fort Worth, Texas based {{independent}} station, KTVT, {{carried the}} series until 1995, when it ceased operating {{as a regional}} cable <b>superstation</b> and became an affiliate of CBS. TBS, then a national cable <b>superstation,</b> carried the series {{for nearly a decade}} beginning in 1999. Fellow <b>superstation</b> WGN America began carrying the series shortly thereafter, and continued to until September 2010. Viacom's Nick at Nite began airing reruns of the series in March 2002, and its sister network TV Land began airing reruns in 2004, making The Cosby Show one of the few series that was shown on both Nick at Nite and TV Land at the same time.|$|E

50|$|Several Major League Baseball {{teams have}} {{historically}} carried their games on <b>superstations,</b> which are broadcast television stations that are distributed on a regional or national basis on {{cable and satellite}} television.|$|R
50|$|Syndex is {{currently}} being used to block <b>superstations</b> offered through a programming tier provided by satellite provider Dish Network from being picked up in certain markets. In this case, the CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates in given markets can invoke the syndex law to keep the <b>superstations</b> that have the same network affiliations as the local station from coming into the market in any form. CW stations are using the law in order to block KTLA in Los Angeles, WPIX/New York City and KWGN-TV/Denver, while WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey and WSBK-TV/Boston are presently blocked in markets where MyNetworkTV affiliates are invoking the law.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, High Noon was remade as a TV {{movie for}} the cable channel TBS <b>Superstation,</b> with Tom Skerritt {{in the lead}} role.|$|E
25|$|House of Cards was {{acquired}} by Canadian <b>superstation</b> CHCH for broadcast beginning September 13, 2017, making the program available throughout Canada on cable and free-to-air in CHCH's broadcast region, which includes portions of the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, {{her husband}} Dave {{suggested}} that they start a television ministry. Initially airing on <b>superstation</b> WGN-TV in Chicago and Black Entertainment Television (BET), her program, now called Enjoying Everyday Life, {{is still on the}} air today.|$|E
50|$|US <b>superstations,</b> {{as well as}} (sustainable) Canadian and US-based {{cable network}} {{programming}} began {{to emerge in the}} 1990s and continues to be available via Shaw or satellite providers. Digital cable service is also available.|$|R
5000|$|Games {{available}} on U.S. over-the-air channels available in Canada on cable or satellite, such as national games on Fox, and local coverage on <b>superstations</b> such as WGN-TV, WPIX, and formerly WPCH-TV. MLB Network is also {{available on}} some providers.|$|R
50|$|Other studios {{can also}} allow full signal rights to <b>superstations</b> for its programming. For example, 20th Television allowed WGN full signal {{rights to the}} {{syndicated}} version of 24 as did NBCUniversal Television Distribution with 30 Rock, and Sony Pictures Television used the same method for Seinfeld for TBS.|$|R
25|$|A {{downtown}} <b>superstation</b> {{has been}} proposed to provide express service from the Loop to both O'Hare and Midway Airports, via the Blue and Orange Lines respectively. The station would provide services such as baggage check. However, budget issues plague the operation and have prevented construction.|$|E
25|$|Reruns of Scooby-Doo {{have been}} in {{syndication}} since 1980, and have also been shown on cable television networks such as TBS <b>Superstation</b> (until 1989) and USA Network (as part of the USA Cartoon Express from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With Turner Broadcasting purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the Scooby-Doo franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS <b>Superstation,</b> and TNT. Canadian network Teletoon began airing Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! in 1997, with the other Scooby series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, Scooby-Doo became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station Boomerang.|$|E
25|$|The annual Hollywood Christmas Parade: The 2006 parade on Nov 26 was the 75th {{edition of}} the Christmas Parade. The parade goes down Hollywood Boulevard and is {{broadcast}} in the LA area on KTLA, and around the United States on Tribune-owned stations and the WGN <b>superstation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{local radio}} {{stations}} are, {{or have been}} distributed on satellite radio throughout the United States, and Canada in select cases. Stations once distributed on satellite radio include WLTW New York City, KHMX Houston, KIIS-FM Los Angeles, KNEW San Francisco, WTKS-FM Orlando, WLW Cincinnati and WSIX-FM Nashville on XM Satellite Radio, and WSM on Sirius Satellite Radio. XM, in particular, used <b>superstations</b> owned by Clear Channel Communications for much of its early programming, and still had two <b>superstations</b> from Clear Channel as recently as late 2008 (talk radio station WLW and country music station WSIX); both of those were dropped by March 2009. WSIX, KIIS and WLTW returned to the now-merged Sirius XM lineup in June 2011, along with new additions WHTZ New York City and WGCI-FM Chicago.|$|R
50|$|Don Curtis started WCSL in 1967. In 1983, Calvin Hastings bought WCSL and {{doubled its}} power from 500 to 1000 watts. Six years later, he bought WGNC in Gastonia and started KTC Broadcasting. In 1992 he bought WOHS (730 AM) in Shelby and began calling the three {{stations}} Piedmont <b>Superstations.</b>|$|R
50|$|WGN America {{was also}} one of four <b>superstations</b> that were owned by Tribune, {{alongside}} CW affiliates KTLA/Los Angeles, KWGN-TV/Denver and WPIX/New York City, the latter three of which were available on cable in their respective regions of the United States, and on Dish Network nationally for those who subscribed to the provider's a la carte <b>superstations</b> tier prior to its decision to halt its sale to new subscribers in September 2013; KTLA and WPIX are also available on Canadian cable and satellite providers via authorization by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) as WGN-TV is and remains to this day due to providers in that country having previously substituted the national channel with the WGN-TV Chicago signal (although KWGN-TV is also authorized by the CRTC for carriage in Canada, that station is not carried on any pay television providers within that country).|$|R
25|$|<b>SuperStation</b> WTBS {{launched}} Night Tracks on June 3, 1983, {{with up to}} 14 {{hours of}} music video airplay each late night weekend by 1985. Its most noticeable difference was that black artists received airplay that MTV initially ignored. The program ran {{until the end of}} May 1992.|$|E
25|$|Advertising from Winnipeg {{businesses}} sometimes {{air on the}} station, {{although this}} is sometimes ineffective due to simultaneous substitution. This practice requires Shaw and MTS to replace WDAZ's signal {{with that of a}} Winnipeg station (usually either CKY-DT or CKND-DT) whenever the same program and episode airs at the same time. Because WDAZ is carried on cable in southern Manitoba, it has become somewhat of a regional <b>superstation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{the team}} was {{purchased}} by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of <b>superstation</b> WTBS, {{as a means to}} keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner.|$|E
25|$|As well, {{a package}} of pay TV {{channels}} is also available for further fees, including movie networks such as The Movie Network, Movie Central, Super Channel and Super Écran, and American <b>superstations</b> such as WSBK, WPIX, WGN and KTLA (which are often affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV.) These services, however, require a descrambler box.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the appeal}} to viewers these <b>superstations</b> had came from the {{national}} carriage of games involving sports teams that the stations held broadcast rights to in their home markets, such as WTCG/WTBS's carriage of the Atlanta Hawks and Braves, and WGN-TV's broadcasts of sporting events featuring the Chicago Cubs, White Sox and Bulls.|$|R
50|$|Because {{some regions}} have had {{difficulty}} picking up over-the-air signals (particularly in mountainous areas), alternative means of distribution such as direct-to-home satellite and cable television have been introduced. Television channels specifically built {{to run on}} cable or satellite blur the line between TV station and TV network. That fact led some early cable channels to call themselves <b>superstations.</b>|$|R
25|$|KTVT's {{popularity}} also spread {{outside of}} the Metroplex {{beginning in the late}} 1970s, when the station uplinked its signal to satellite. This attained it a new status as a <b>superstation</b> along the lines of WTBS (now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta, WGN-TV in Chicago and WOR-TV in New York City (now WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey); its signal was transmitted to about 400 cable systems and to C-band satellite subscribers across the country, mainly in the Southwestern U.S. At its height, the station was available on nearly every cable television provider in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as large swaths of Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico. However, its quasi-national distribution would later hamper OPUBCO president Edward L. Gaylord's efforts to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers (of which Gaylord purchased a minority share in 1985), as the other Major League Baseball team owners had concerns about a fourth team having widespread television coverage through a <b>superstation</b> (as WTBS already carried the Atlanta Braves, WGN-TV aired the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, and WWOR-TV held rights to the New York Mets at the time).|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., Da Vinci's City Hall airs {{as part of}} the Da Vinci's Inquest rerun package, {{regarded}} as the eighth season of the series (even using the titles from the last three seasons of Inquest instead of the titles for City Hall). City Hall debuted in the U.S. on <b>Superstation</b> WGN on April 27, 2007, and released into national syndication to local stations, also as part of Da Vinci's Inquest, on November 4, 2007.|$|E
25|$|As {{it turned}} out, KMSP's {{transition}} into an independent station {{turned out to}} be a blessing in disguise. It was far more successful than the station ever had been as an ABC affiliate. It became a regional <b>superstation,</b> available on nearly every cable system in Minnesota as well as large portions of North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin. Over time, it became one of the most successful and profitable independent stations in the country.|$|E
50|$|The five {{remaining}} true <b>superstations</b> - MyNetworkTV affiliates WSBK-TV (channel 38) in Boston, Massachusetts, and WWOR-TV (channel 9) in Secaucus, New Jersey (part of the New York City television market), and CW affiliates WPIX (channel 11) in New York City, KWGN-TV (channel 2) in Denver, Colorado, and KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles, California (the latter {{three are}} owned by the same company, Tribune Broadcasting, {{which is also the}} owner of WGN-TV) - are carried on some rural cable providers, C-Band providers and on the Dish Network satellite service. However, syndication exclusivity blackout requests led Dish Network to stop selling {{one or more of the}} stations in some markets in recent years. Dish stopped selling all five true <b>superstations</b> outside of their home markets on September 19, 2013, limiting their distribution to customers who were already subscribed to the a la carte tier at that point.|$|R
5000|$|Out-of-market <b>superstations</b> {{were first}} {{identified}} {{with a combination of}} their channel number and a letter representing their originating market city following the incorporation of cable listings (WKBD-TV in Detroit, which effectively served as the Fox affiliate for most of Michigan until December 1994 via cable, was listed as [...] "50D", for instance; these identifiers were also used in some regional editions to disambiguate broadcast stations with identical channel numbers in genre-based listings pages (such as the sports guide) and crossreferences in the pages preceding the local listings, with the numeric identifier used for either a local or out-of-market station, and the alphanumeric identifier for an out-of-market station); the three major national <b>superstations</b> at the time, TBS, WGN and WOR (which were respectively identified as [...] "17A", [...] "9C" [...] and [...] "9N"), were eventually given conventional three-letter abbreviations in line with other cable channels.|$|R
50|$|Much as is {{the case}} in Canada, almost all of the {{television}} stations in Mexico are available on satellite and carried on select cable providers within the country. Like in Canada, Mexican providers can obtain carriage of American television stations (especially those located in U.S. television markets that border Mexico) on their digital tiers, even if they are not licensed <b>superstations.</b>|$|R
