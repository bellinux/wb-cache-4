40|$|The {{production}} of quality compost for Agaricus bisporus using alternative and local agricultural wastes beyond {{the search for}} productive strains are among the main factors related to improve yield. Thus, we evaluated the effect of compost nitrogen supplementation type using two compost formulation based on sugar cane by-products such as straw and bagasse as raw materials: (1) classic compost using chicken manure and (2) <b>synthetic</b> <b>compost</b> using soybean bran, urea and ammonium sulfate, for the cultivation of the five strains of A. bisporus: ABI- 05 / 03, ABI- 04 / 02, ABI- 06 / 05, and ABI- 09 / 10 ABI- 09 / 11. We found that the classic compost obtained average temperature and mass loss of 10. 56 and 13. 29 % higher than the <b>synthetic</b> <b>compost,</b> respectively, during the composting, pasteurization and conditioning process. The classic compost achieved greater yield {{in the end of}} 25 days of harvest by the strains ABI- 05 / 03, ABI- 06 / 05 and ABI- 04 / 02 corresponding to 26. 78, 25. 34 and 24. 71 %, respectively. We concluded that the classic and synthetic, based on sugar cane straw and bagasse are suitable agricultural waste for A. bisporus cultivation and the classic compost obtained higher composting temperatures in relation to <b>synthetic</b> <b>compost,</b> corroborating higher yields and more defined-pattern cultivation cycle for all strains when grown in classic compost...|$|E
30|$|The main {{constituent}} of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>compost</b> is cereal straw. This element is transported in compacted bales tied with ropes on trucks. The straw, {{which is the}} main carbon source, {{is responsible for the}} compost texture, allows natural ventilation and its organic matter determines the water retention capacity. The wheat straw is preferably used due to its firmness, texture conservation and availability, although other straws are also used such as rye or barley.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{nutritional}} value and amino acid composition of the mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) was carried out with the Somycel 653 strain cultivated on a <b>synthetic</b> <b>compost</b> containing rye straw, broiler chicken manure and gypsum. In 4 developmental stages of the whole fruit-bodies and the caps and stipes the following were determined: dry matter, vitamin C, nitrates, total nitrogen, crude protein (N × 4. 38) and amino acid composition. It was observed that in all stages of development the levels of total N and crude protein are significantly higher in the caps than in the stipes. From the amino acid composition {{it appears that the}} caps of stage 4 contain the highest amounts of essential and total amino acids as compared with caps, stipes and whole sporophores found in any developmental stage. This is correlated {{with the opening of the}} mushrooms in stage 4. It was observed that the nitrates level tends, to be higher in the cap than in the stipe...|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via <b>synthetic</b> fertilizers, <b>composts,</b> manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, eutrophication can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to anoxic areas called dead zones.|$|R

The same crop over repeated seasons has favored disease proliferation of stem and ear rot mainly attributed to Fusarium spp which represents a risk potential so that growers are warned top pay close attention to crop management. With the purpose of evaluating the effect of <b>synthetic</b> fertilization with <b>compost</b> and irrigation on maize stem and ear rot at Valle del Fuerte. Field experiments were conducted in the growing season of 2009 at INIFAP. The experiments were arranged under a split plot in randomized complete block design with three replicates. At the end of the season, it was found that fertilization or irrigation by themselves did not have any significant effect in yield and phenology variables evaluated. However, incidence on stem rot which was evaluated at 53 days after planting was that of 100 %. Moreover, there were significant differences regarding severity of rotten ears when less irrigation was applied. Finally, morphological study showed that the main agent associated in maize stem rot was Fusarium verticilliodes. In contrast to that of ear rot that the main agents involved were Apergillus spp, Penicillum pinophilum, and with a higher incidence was Fusarium verticilliodes...|$|R
40|$|Compost for the {{production}} of Agaricus blazei Murrill mushrooms, is produced from wheat straw, straw-bedded horse manure, chicken manure and gypsum. The substrate is made in two processes called Phase I (anaerobic) and Phase II (aerobic). Phase I includes mixing and moistening of the ingredients and a period of uncontrolled self-heating where temperatures will rise to 80 ºC. Phase II starts with a pasteurization period of 8 h at 56 - 60 ºC and continues with a conditioning period at 45 ºC for up to 7 days until volatile NH 3 has been cleared from the process by air. Quality parameters for compost cannot be established directly. Moisture and nitrogen contents and pH can be adjusted at the start of Phase I, but the values will be affected during processing. In this paperwork, we studied the physical properties (water content, electrical conductivity) and chemical composition (pH, organic matter, nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, ammonia) of four recipes of compost: classical, synthetic, mixt and original. During the experience, we recorded every hour the compost and the air temperature and the air relative humidity. The highest yield was obtained on <b>synthetic</b> <b>compost</b> with 42 kg mushrooms on 100 kg of compost. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} in our laboratory reported a convenient laboratory-scale composting test method {{to study the}} weight loss of polymer films in aerobic thermophilic (53 °C) reactors maintained at a 60 % moisture content. The laboratory-scale compost reactors contained the following <b>synthetic</b> <b>compost</b> mixture (percentage on dry-weight basis) : tree leaves (45. 0), shredded paper (16. 5), food (6. 7), meat (5. 8), cow manure (17. 5), sawdust (1. 9), aluminum and steel shavings (2. 4), glass beads (1. 3), urea (1. 9), and a compost seed (1. 0) which is designated Mix- 1 in this work. To simplify the laboratory-scale compost weight loss test method and better understand how compost mixture compositions and environmental parameters affect the rate of plastic degradation, a systematic variation of the synthetic mixture composition {{as well as the}} moisture content was carried out. Cellulose acetate (CA) with a degree of substitution (DS) value of 1. 7 and cellophane films were chosen as test polymer substrates for this work. The extent of CA DS- 1. 7 and cellophane weight loss {{as a function of the}} exposure time remained unchanged when the metal and glass components of the mixture were excluded in Mix- 2. Further study showed that large variations in the mixture composition such as the replacement of tree leaves, food, meat, and sawdust with steam-exploded wood and alfalfa (forming Mix-C) could be made with little or no change in the time dependence of CA DS- 1. 7 film weight loss. In contrast, substituting tree leaves, food, meat, cow manure, and sawdust with steam-exploded wood in combination with either Rabbit Choice (Mix-D) or starch and urea (Mix-E) resulted in a significant time increase (from 7 to 12 days) for the complete disappearance of CA DS- 1. 7 films. Interestingly, in this work no direct correlation was observed between the C/N ratio (which ranged from 13. 9 to 61. 4) and the CA DS- 1. 7 film weight loss. Decreasing moisture contents of the compost Mix- 2 from 60 and 50 and 40 % resulted in dramatic changes in polymer degradation such that CA DS- 1. 7 showed an increase in the time period for a complete disappearance of polymer films from 6 to 16 and 30 days, respectively. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This project {{tested at}} the field scale, five on-site, {{non-proprietary}} bioremediation processes on weathered petroleum hydrocarbons from a fire fighter training area. Two bioremediation processes based on fungi (commercially produced white rot fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus, and aged, coarse wood chips, 'compost', with naturally occurring fungi) were applied with variations and compared to one control: a typical static biopile. An elevated-face compost turner was used to turn the soil in selected windrows for aeration. Statistically-based sampling was employed and quality control measures were enforced for sampling and analysis. The treatment options examined for the contaminated soil were: (1) white rot fungus and compost, (2) compost, poultry manure and turning, (3) <b>compost,</b> <b>synthetic</b> nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium fertilizer, and turning, (4) <b>compost,</b> the above <b>synthetic</b> fertilizer, and no turning, and (5) the above synthetic fertilizer, and no turning (static biopile). The compost and poultry manure process performed the best, remediating 35 tonnes of soil contaminated with 6000 mg/kg of mineral oil and grease (MOG) to the remediation criteria of 1000 mg/kg in 19 days and to less than 300 mg/kg in less than 56 days. The net rate of bioremediation was 100 mg/kg/day of MOG. The estimated cost of this process for commercial applications, excluding labour, excavation and site preparation, was $ 18 to $ 29 per tonne, depending {{on the cost of}} the poultry manure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNitrate (NO 3 −) {{loss from}} intensively farmed {{cropland}} is a long-standing, recalcitrant environmental problem {{that contributes to}} surface and groundwater pollution and coastal zone hypoxia. Here nitrate leaching losses are reported from nine replicated cropped and unmanaged ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. Ecosystems include four annual corn–soybean–winter wheat rotations under conventional, no-till, reduced-input, and organic/biologically-based management, two perennial cropping systems that include alfalfa and hybrid poplar trees, and three unmanaged successional communities including an early successional community analogous to a cellulosic biofuel system {{as well as a}} mature deciduous forest. The organic, alfalfa, and unmanaged systems received no <b>synthetic,</b> manure, or <b>compost</b> nitrogen. Measured nitrate concentrations were combined with modeled soil water drainage to provide estimates of nitrate lost by leaching over 11 years. Among annual crops, average nitrate losses differed significantly (p no-till (41. 3 ± 3. 0) >reduced-input (24. 3 ± 0. 7) >organic (19. 0 ± 0. 8) management. Among perennial and unmanaged ecosystems, nitrate loss followed the pattern alfalfa (12. 8 ± 1. 8 kgNha− 1 yr− 1) =deciduous forest (11. 0 ± 4. 2) ≫early successional (1. 1 ± 0. 4) =mid-successional (0. 9 ± 0. 4) >poplar (< 0. 01 ± 0. 007 kgNha− 1 yr− 1) systems. Findings suggest that nitrate loss in annual row crops could be significantly mitigated by the adoption of no-till, cover crops, and greater reliance on biologically based inputs, and in biofuel systems by the production of cellulosic rather than grain-based feedstocks...|$|R
40|$|Recalcitrant organic {{compounds}} remain a key challenge in landfill leachate management {{as they are}} resistant to microbial degradation and have potential to damage the water environment. Conventional leachate characterisation methods are time consuming and limited by their inability to provide compositional analysis. This research therefore investigates the characteristics of recalcitrant {{organic compounds}} in leachates and undertakes a feasibility study of the possible use of UV absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy for a rapid and economical compositional analysis of recalcitrant organic compounds. Two laboratory experiments are carried out in this regard. In one experiment, a laboratory scale aerobic biodegradation is carried out on four untreated and two treated leachate samples collected from two UK MSW landfills (Pitsea and Rainham), and leachates are characterised using conventional methods (COD and DOC) as well as UV absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is found that the leachates which have low organic content are easily biodegradable whereas the leachates which have high organic content are not easily biodegradable. UV and fluorescence spectroscopy allow compositional analysis of recalcitrant organic compounds and show that humic and fulvic compounds are the key components of the recalcitrant organic compounds. A rapid biodegradability assessment of different leachates using these novel techniques is in agreement with conventional method showing that a rapid characterisation of leachates using spectroscopic methods is feasible. It is also found that organic compounds in these leachates are aromatic in nature and the leachates containing large amounts of aromatic compounds, condensed aromatic structures are difficult to degrade. In another experiment, {{the influence of the}} solid waste component on the development of recalcitrant organic compounds in leachates is investigated by carrying out an anaerobic biodegradation experiment for fresh waste, composted waste, newspaper waste and <b>synthetic</b> waste. <b>Composted</b> waste contributes significantly {{to the development of the}} recalcitrant compounds due to the removal of readily biodegradable organic compounds during composting and hence the increased proportion of biologically resistant compounds during the subsequent anaerobic biodegradation. Newspaper waste also contributes significantly to the presence of recalcitrant organic compounds due to the relatively less resistant cellulose and high lignin present in this waste. This research validates the application of UV and fluorescence spectroscopy for rapid on-site monitoring of landfill leachates that would help scientist and engineers to assess leachate quality, identify various organic compounds and to optimise leachate treatment processes. The analysis performed on Pitsea and Rainham leachates is a promising step towards developing a database of representative information of characteristics of recalcitrant organic compounds in leachates for different UK landfills. This research also provides an understanding of the composition of leachates from different wastes and it can be conclude that disposals enriched with composted and newspaper waste would favour the development of leachates with high concentrations and condensed aromatic structures of recalcitrant organic compounds in a landfill syste...|$|R
