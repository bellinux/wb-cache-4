40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> was {{developed}} as a probability-based index able to monitor rainfall deficit in a standardized or normalized way. Thus, the performance of this drought index {{is affected by the}} use of a distribution that does not provide an appropriate fit for the rainfall data. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the adjustment of the gamma distribution for the rainfall amounts summed over several time scales (Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), to assess the goodness-of-fit of alternative distributions to these rainfall series and to evaluate the normality assumption of the <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> series calculated from several distributions. Based on the Lilliefors test and on a normality test, it is verified that the gamma distribution is not suitable for calculating this Index in several timescales. The generalized normal distribution presented the best performance among all analysed distributions. It was also concluded that the drought early warning systems and the academic studies should re-evaluate the use of the gamma distribution in the <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> calculation algorithm.

40|$|Sahel is a drought-prone area in West Africa, and the {{agriculture}} sector remains {{the main source}} of employment in the rural communities. However, inter-annual rainfall variability significantly hampers the performance of agriculture in Sahel.

Using a just-Pope stochastic production function, this paper assesses crop yields responses to persistent drought spells in eight countries of Sahel. Six-month <b>standardized</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>indexes</b> (SPI) along with degree-days indexes were calculated and maximum likelihood estimations were carried out for specific crops using data spanning 1970 to 2000.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of standard meteorological drought indices based on measurements of precipitation {{is limited by}} the spatial distribution and quality of currently available rainfall data. Furthermore, they reflect only one component of the surface hydrologic cycle, and they cannot readily capture nonprecipitation-based moisture inputs to the land surface system (e. g., irrigation) that may temper drought impacts or variable rates of water consumption across a landscape. This study assesses the value of a new drought index based on remote sensing of evapotranspiration (ET). The evaporative stress index (ESI) quantifies anomalies in the ratio of actual to potential ET (PET), mapped using thermal band imagery from geostationary satellites. The study investigates the behavior and response time scales of the ESI through a retrospective comparison with the <b>standardized</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>indices</b> and Palmer drought index suite, and with drought classifications recorded in the U. S. Drought Monitor for the 2000 – 09 growing seasons. Spatial and temporal correlation analyses suggest that the ESI performs similarly to short-term (up to 6 months) precipitation-based indices but can be produced at higher spatial resolution and without requiring any precipitation data. Unique behavior is observed in the ESI in regions where the evaporative flux is enhanced by moisture sources decoupled from local rainfall: for example, in areas of intense irrigation or shallow water table. Normalization by PET serves to isolate the ET signal component responding to soil moisture variability from variations due to the radiation load. This study suggests that the ESI is a useful complement to the current suite of drought indicators, with particular added value in parts of the world where rainfall data are sparse or unreliable...|$|R

In this context, this work aimed at assessing the temporal variability of the <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> in Lebanon for improved understanding of drought occurrence. This is expected to help in mitigation and response actions to future drought circumstances across the country. The methodology of work involved the calculation of the <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> over different time series from four regions across the country using both the Variability Analysis of Surface Climate Observations (VASClimO) gridded rainfall dataset for the period 1951 – 2000 and the European rainfall dataset E-OBS for the period 1950 – 2014. In general, higher precipitation values were recorded by the VASClimO dataset than those coming from the E-OBS dataset. Intra-annual precipitation changes showed increasing precipitation starting in September-October and decreasing precipitation starting in February. The VASClimO dataset showed a 50 % increase in the frequency of severe drought conditions, while the E-OBS dataset indicated a 60 % increase in the frequency of moderate drought conditions. In addition, it was observed that the winter of 2014, characterized by extreme drought conditions, was the driest in the past 56 years. Although specific years were commonly characterized by severe to extreme drought conditions with the use of both datasets, considerable differences between the two datasets were observed with respect to the identification of the degree of wet and dry conditions for some other years.

40|$|Introduction Today, Climate change {{issue is}} one of the main {{challenges}} for scientists and due to the critical role of water in human life, the study of climate change impacts on severity and frequency of drought in each region seems to be indispensable (Hulme et al., 1999). Drought is usually occurred over a period of water shortage owing to less rainfall, high evapotranspiration and pumping a huge amount of water from water tables. This issue could have extensive consequences on agriculture, ecosystems and communities. The objectives of this study were to predict meteorological parameters, calculation of drought index and its zoning under the changing climate in Fars province. Materials and methods In order to predict the future climate in nine districts of Fars province (including Shiraz, Eghlid, Fasa, Lar, Lamerd, Darab, Zarghan, Neiriz and Abadeh), two climate models (HadCM 3 and IPCM 4) was applied under three scenarios (B 1, A 1 B and A 2). LARS-WG software was applied to downscale climate parameters (Semenov and Barrow, 2002). To predict incident probability of drought in the all study locations, a drought <b>index</b> (<b>Standardize</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index,</b> SPI) was calculated at a time scale of 12 months. SPI is the most commonly used drought index. SPI is calculated based upon the differences between monthly rainfall and average rainfall for a certain period of time according to the time scale (Mckee et al., 1995). In this study the SPI time series have been estimated for the historical base period 1980 - 1990 and for three future periods (2011 - 2030, 2046 - 2065, 2080 - 2099). Finally, drought maps and zoning were conducted in the whole province using GIS and based on IDW interpolation method.

40|$|Climate {{extremes}} such as droughts {{and intense}} rainfall events {{are expected to}} strongly influence global/regional water resources {{in addition to the}} growing demands for freshwater. This study examines the impacts of precipitation extremes and human water usage on total water storage (TWS) over the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) River Basin in South Asia. Monthly TWS changes derived from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) (2002 – 2014) and soil moisture from three reanalyses (1979 – 2014) are used to estimate new extreme indices. These indices are applied in conjunction with <b>standardized</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>indices</b> (SPI) to explore the impacts of precipitation extremes on TWS in the region. The results indicate that although long-term precipitation do not indicate any significant trends over the two subbasins (Ganges and Brahmaputra-Meghna), there is significant decline in rainfall (9. 0 [*]±[*] 4. 0 mm/decade) over the Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basin from 1998 to 2014. Both river basins exhibit a rapid decline of TWS from 2002 to 2014 (Ganges: 12. 2 [*]±[*] 3. 4 km 3 /yr and Brahmaputra-Meghna: 9. 1 [*]±[*] 2. 7 km 3 /yr). While the Ganges River Basin has been regaining TWS (5. 4 [*]±[*] 2. 2 km 3 /yr) from 2010 onward, the Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basin exhibits a further decline (13. 0 [*]±[*] 3. 2 km 3 /yr) in TWS from 2011 onward. The impact of human water consumption on TWS appears to be considerably higher in Ganges compared to Brahmaputra-Meghna, where it is mainly concentrated over Bangladesh. The interannual water storage dynamics are found to be strongly associated with meteorological forcing data such as precipitation. In particular, extreme drought conditions, such as those of 2006 and 2009, had profound negative impacts on the TWS, where groundwater resources are already being unsustainably exploited...|$|R

The five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are used to produce climate-change simulations around the Korean Peninsula and to estimate the uncertainty associated with these simulations. The horizontal resolution of each RCM is 12. 5 km and model simulations are available for historical (1981 - 2010) and future (2021 - 2100) periods under forcing from the RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 scenarios. To assess the characteristics of drought on multiple time scales in the future, we use <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Indices</b> for 1 -month (SPI- 1), 6 -month (SPI- 6) and 12 -month (SPI- 12). The number of drought months in the future is shown to be characterized by strong variability, with both increasing and decreasing trends among the scenarios. In particular, the number of drought months over South Korea is projected to increase (decrease) for the period 2041 - 2070 in the RCP 8. 5 (RCP 4. 5) scenario and increase (decrease) for the period 2071 - 2100 in the RCP 4. 5 (RCP 8. 5) scenario. In addition, the percentage area under any drought condition is overall projected to gradually decrease over South Korea during the entire future period, with the exception of SPI- 1 in the RCP 4. 5 scenario. Particularly, the drought areas for SPI- 1 in the RCP 4. 5 scenario show weakly positive long-term trend. Otherwise, future changes in drought areas for SPI- 6 and SPI- 12 have a marked downward trend under the two RCP scenarios. clos...|$|R

Current methods of monitoring drought are dependent on state-based monthly <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> value maps calculated by the Western Regional Climate Center. However, these maps do not provide the spatial resolution needed to illustrate differences in drought severity across the vast Nation. To better understand and monitor drought events and drought regime changes in the Navajo Nation, this project created a geodatabase of historical climate information specific to the area, and a decision support tool to calculate average <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> values for user-specified areas. The tool and geodatabase use Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Monitor (GPM) observed precipitation data and Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model modeled historical precipitation data, as well as NASA's modeled Land Data Assimilation Systems deep soil moisture, evaporation, and transpiration data products. The geodatabase and decision support tool will allow resource managers in the Navajo Nation to utilize current and future NASA Earth observation data for increased decision-making capacity regarding future climate change impact on water resources...|$|E
40|$|Drought {{recurrence}} in the Mediterranean {{is regarded}} as a fundamental factor for socio-economic development and the resilience of natural systems in context of global change. However, knowledge of past droughts has been hampered by the absence of high-resolution proxies. We present a drought reconstruction for the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula based on a new dendrochronology network considering the <b>Standardized</b> Evapotranspiration <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Index</b> (SPEI). A total of 774 latewood width series from 387 trees of P. sylvestris and P. uncinata were combined in an inter-regional chronology. The new chronology, calibrated against gridded climate data, reveals a robust relationship with the SPEI representing drought conditions of July and August. We developed a summer drought reconstruction for the period 1734 - 2013 representative for the northeastern and central Iberian Peninsula. We identified 16 extremely dry and 17 extremely wet summers, and four decadal scale dry and wet periods, including 2003 - 2013 as the driest episode of the reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNorthern {{and central}} Chile {{is one of}} the driest regions of the Arid-Americas with {{increasing}} demands on finite water supplies. The region faces recurrent droughts that cause important economic damages. The need to better monitor drought and study changes in their main properties is important for disaster risk management. The aim of this work is to apply the <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> Evapotranspiration <b>Index</b> (SPEI) to detect trends of dry periods of different magnitude as well as to describe their association with El Niño phenomenon in the Coquimbo region. Data shows that dry events are frequent in the region, and that spring and summer show negative trends (i. e. increasing dryness) in most of the stations analyzed. Significant trends for SPEI values are in the order of − 0. 05 yr− 1. The occurrence of dry conditions of different magnitude has increased over the last decades, and the duration of extreme climatic events has slightly increased as well. These results are consistent with future climatic projections and represent a major challenge for water resources management and the operation of existing reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we assess future drought probabilities in the Greater Alpine Region based on four {{regional}} climate model simulations with COSMO-CLM forced by ECHAM 5 and HadCM 3 under different emission scenarios. As a drought indicator, the <b>Standardized</b> <b>Precipitation</b> Evapotranspiration <b>Index</b> is applied. The evaluation of a hindcast run show reasonable skill of the CCLM in simulating the evolution of dry and wet phases, although decreasing skill towards the East of the Alpine domain is apparent. The results of the scenario investigations indicate a considerably higher probability for droughts averaged over the study region, but with rather diverse patterns {{north and south of}} the Alps. This signal is mainly emerging from the warm season months, whereas in winter nearly no change is detected. By differentiating between precipitation and temperature as the driving forces of the considerable drying trends in summer we found precipitation as the relevant driver north of and in the Alps, whereas we detected that temperature, as a proxy for evapotranspiration, is the main factor for the southern and eastern areas...|$|R
