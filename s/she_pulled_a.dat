500|$|Regarding the {{performance}} at the SAP Center at San Jose, Jim Harrington of the East Bay Times stated that Lovato [...] "outshined" [...] Jonas and that she did [...] "some of her best work of the night on the slower material, touching hearts with the Unbroken cut 'Fix a Heart' and the Demi track 'Nightingale'".

Cristal admits <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> similar stunt to get cast in the lead of a show years before. Because of her world-weariness, and the fact that her lawyers managed to secure her a large cash settlement, Cristal forgives Nomi, and they exchange a kiss. Nomi leaves Las Vegas and hitches a ride to Los Angeles, coincidentally with the same driver who earlier stole her possessions when she arrived.
