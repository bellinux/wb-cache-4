Three sowing techniques, broadcasting, sod <b>seeding</b> and <b>strip</b> <b>seeding,</b> each with, two rates of fertiliser, 150 or 300 kg/ha molybdic sulphur superphosphate, were used. By mid December, 48 and 38 % establishment had occurred in the <b>strip</b> and sod <b>seeding</b> respectively, but only 9 % in the broadcast. <b>Strip</b> <b>seeding</b> was the most successful technique resulting in earlier rhizome and tap-root development and wider lateral spread of rhizomes. However, both <b>strip</b> <b>seeding</b> and sod seeding resulted in all plants developing rhizomes 9 months after sowing. Plants from broadcasting were small with few rhizomes in the first season.

Three sowing techniques, broadcasting, sod <b>seeding</b> and <b>strip</b> <b>seeding,</b> each with two rates of fertiliser, 150 or 300 kg/ha molybdic sulphur superphosphate (8 % P, 20 % S), were used. By mid December, 48 % and 38 % establishment had occurred in the <b>strip</b> and sod <b>seeding</b> treatments respectively, but only 10 % in the broadcast. <b>Strip</b> <b>seeding</b> resulted in the earliest taproot and rhizome development of Caucasian clover and the greatest lateral spread of rhizomes. However, all plants <b>strip</b> and sod <b>seeding</b> developed rhizomes after nine months. Plants established by broadcasting were small with few rhizomes in the first season. The higher fertiliser rate improved establishment and growth, particularly in the <b>strip</b> <b>seeding</b> treatment. <b>Strip</b> <b>seeded</b> Caucasian clover established as rapidly as white clover and plants were similar in size after five months. However, Caucasian clover had a larger underground mass {{which could lead to}} greater persistence. A grazing trial was established to observe how two cultivars of Caucasian clover and two seed lines of zig zag clover responded to four diverse grazing treatments. The experiment was located at Lincoln University, latitude 43 º 39 S and longitude 172 º 28 E on a medium to free-draining soil of medium fertility with an annual rainfall of 651 mm. In March 1989 a seed production experiment was established and consisted of Caucasian clover cultivars Alpine and Monaro and zig zag clover seed lines Porters Pass and Kentucky. In spring of 1992 high endophyte ryegrass was direct drilled into this experiment. The first grazing to establish main plot treatments occurred in early October 1993. The experiment design was a randomised block design with two replicates of four treatments. The treatments included two grazing frequencies; rotational grazing and set stocking; and two grazing intensities; hard and lax. Point analysis was used {{to measure the}} botanical composition of the pastures. Only the hexaploid Monaro Caucasian clover was agronomically suitable as a companion for high endophyte ryegrass and white clover under the range of grazing managements. The zig zag clovers showed a classic hay type species inability to persist and contribute to dry matter production under grazing. The diploid Alpine Caucasian clover persisted undergrazing but had a low cover percentage. Monaro Caucasian clover had a mean seasonal cover of between 14 % and 21 % in the grazing treatments, contributing more to pasture cover in the rotationally grazed treatments. White clover, in contrast was more suited to the set stock hard grazed treatment {{and to a lesser extent}} the set stock lax grazed treatment...|$|R

In south Belgium, agri-environmental policies have encouraged farmers to <b>seed</b> buffer <b>strips</b> along rivers, in zones where the soil was previously devoted to agricultural production. We wanted to assess how important denitrification is in a buffer strip in comparison with a cropped field. The study investigated the denitrifiying enzyme activity (DEA) of two contiguous buffer strips with different management stories. The eastern part of the buffer <b>strip</b> was <b>seeded</b> in 1999. The western part of the buffer strip is a piece of crop field abandoned by the farmer 20 years ago and not managed for the last 10 years. This experimental study demonstrates that the denitrification enzyme activity in a riparian buffer strip is significantly higher than in the adjacent cropped field (3. 67 and 2. 12 mgNkg(- 1) d(- 1) respectively). The DEA was significantly different between the two buffer strips under comparison, assessing that the {{management of}} the buffer strips has a dominant effect on DEA.

The seed {{that is required}} for their establishment can be obtained through direct harvesting from semi-natural herbaceous vegetation. To test the efficiency of mechanical seed harvesting on donor Arrhenatherion elatioris grasslands, experiments were performed in northern Italy and eastern Czech Republic. Trials were organized with a randomized block design and involved harvesting as green hay (grass mowing and immediate collection), dry hay (grass mowing and collection after drying on the field), direct combining (grass cutting and threshing at the same combine passage) and <b>seed</b> <b>stripping</b> with pull-type equipment (seed removal without grass cutting with a brush harvester pulled by a tractor). Harvesting was carried out {{at the time of}} maximum ripe standing seed yield (SSY) in the first and second regrowth. The harvested materials were analysed for seed number and weight and compared with the SSY. The species composition and phenology were also surveyed. In all methods, the seed mixture obtained contained the species present as seed at harvest time and was correlated with SSY. However, with regard to the seed number collected, the harvesting efficiency changed in relation to species group (grasses or forbs), individual species, seed maturation and regrowth.

40|$|Germination is a {{key process}} in the {{dynamics}} of weed populations. In no-tillage systems, crop seeding is often found to induce seed germination in the <b>seeding</b> <b>strip.</b> In this research, experiments to investigate options for reducing weed seedling establishment were conducted in no-till soyabean fields located in two sites in south Brazil. A first experiment revealed that a reduction in emergence of some important weed species {{can be achieved by}} lowering seeding speed. Further experiments showed the ability of a modified seeder to contribute to an additional reduction in weed establishment. On the modified seeder, coulter discs were equipped with lateral blades, to diminish soil disturbance and to maintain a uniform soil cover by properly cutting the mulch layer. In a field {{with a high level of}} residues, the modified seeder, in contrast to the standard seeder, prevented the increase of soil exposure when seeding at high speed. The predominant weeds were annual species. Averaged over all seeding rates, the new equipment led to a 56 % reduction in within-row weed density, compared with the standard seeder. Regardless of seeder type, overall weed density increased with seeding speed, but with the modified seeder, this increase was only half that of the standard seeder. The modified seeder reduced weed biomass by 30 % and increased soyabean grain yield by 42 %. The research demonstrated that relatively simple changes, like a minor modification to a seeder and a lower seeding speed, can contribute to more diverse and sustainable alternatives to predominantly chemical-oriented weed management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} are {{often associated with}} loss of nerve tissue and require a graft to bridge the gap. Autologous nerve grafts are still the 'gold standard' in reconstructive surgery but have several disadvantages, such as sacrifice of a functional nerve, neuroma formation and loss of sensation at the donor site. Bioengineered grafts represent a promising approach to address this problem. In this study, poly- 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) strips were used to bridge a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve gap and their effects on long-term (12 weeks) nerve regeneration were compared. PHB <b>strips</b> were <b>seeded</b> with different cell types, either primary Schwann cells (SCs) or SC-like differentiated adipose-derived stem cells (dASCs) suspended in a fibrin glue matrix. The control group was PHB and fibrin matrix without cells. Functional and morphological properties of the regenerated nerve were assessed using walking track analysis, EMGs, muscle weight ratios and muscle and nerve histology. The animals treated with PHB <b>strips</b> <b>seeded</b> with SCs or dASCs showed significantly better functional ability than the control group.

50|$|A {{prepared}} seedbed remains receptive for {{a relatively}} short period, seldom as long as 5 years, sometimes as short as 3 years. Seedbed receptivity on moist, fertile sites decreases with particular rapidity, and especially on such sites, seedbed preparation should be scheduled {{to take advantage of}} good seed years. In poor seed years, site preparation can be carried out on mesic and drier sites with more chance of success, because of the generally longer receptivity of seedbeds there than those on moister sites. Although an indifferent seed year can suffice if seed distribution is good and environmental conditions favourable to seedling germination and survival, small amounts of seed are particularly vulnerable to depredation by small mammals. Considerable flexibility is possible in timing site preparation to coincide with cone crops. Treatment can be apllied either before any logging takes place, between partial cuts, or after logging. In cut and leave <b>strips,</b> <b>seedbed</b> preparation can be carried out as a single operation, pre-scarifying the leave strips, post-scarifying the cut strips.|$|R

The literature review describes the different functions of catch crops {{in relation to the}} soil and the environment. In detail are discussed biotic and abiotic factors affecting the cultivation of catch crops and agronomic practices applied in their cultivation. In the thesis are discussed the economic costs associated with the cultivation of catch crops and the possibility of the use of subsidies for its cultivation. Described is also the division of catch crops by date of sowing and the definition of appropriate and inappropriate catch crops, for the individual production area in the Czech republic. The folloving section of the thesis deals with the evaluation of experiments conducted on the experimental field station in Žabčice. Experiments with catch crops were found out in 2006. There were ten catch crops: Sinapis alba L., Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers., Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth., Fagopyrum vulgare Hill., Secale cereale L. var. multicaule Metzg. ex Alef., Panicum miliaceum L., Crambe abyssinica L.

40|$|Objective: Tissue {{engineering}} of viable, autologous cardiovascular replacements {{with the}} potential to grow, repair and remodel represents an attractive approach to overcome the shortcomings of available replacements for the repair of congenital cardiac defects. Currently, vascular myofibroblast cells represent an established cell source for cardiovascular tissue engineering. Cell isolation requires the invasive harvesting of venous or arterial vessel segments prior to scaffold seeding, a technique which may not be preferable, especially in pediatric patients. This study evaluates cells isolated from human umbilical cord artery, umbilical cord vein and whole cord as alternative autologous cell sources for cardiovascular tissue engineering. Methods: Cells were isolated from human umbilical cord artery (UCA), umbilical cord vein (UCV), whole umbilical cord (UCC) and saphenous vein segments (VC), and were expanded in culture. All three expanded cell groups were seeded on bioabsorbable copolymer strips and grown in vitro for 28 days. Isolated cells were characterized by flow cytometry, histology, immunohistochemistry, proliferation assays and compared to VC. Morphological analysis of the <b>seeded</b> polymer <b>strips</b> included histology, immunohistochemistry, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and uniaxial stress testing. Results: UCA, UCV and UCC demonstrated excellent cell growth properties comparable to VC. Following isolation, all three cell groups showed myofibroblast-like morphology and characteristics by staining positive for α-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) and vimentin. Histology and immunohistochemistry of seeded polymers showed good tissue and extracellular matrix formation containing collagen I, III and elastin. TEM showed viable myofibroblasts and the deposition of collagen fibrils and progessive growing tissue formation, with a confluent surface, was observed in SEM. No difference was found among the mechanical properties of UCA, UCV, UCC and VC tissue engineered constructs. Conclusions: Tissue engineering of cardiovascular constructs by using UCA, UCV and UCC is feasible in an in vitro environment. Cell growth, morphology, characteristics and tissue formation were comparable between UCA, UCV, UCC and VC. UCC represent an attractive, readily available autologous cell source for cardiovascular tissue engineering offering the additional benefits of utilizing juvenile cells and avoiding the invasive harvesting of intact vascular structure...|$|R

Collected data were used to elaborate allometric relations for stem volume, total biomass and specific relations for both compartments, based on one (d 2) or two (d 2 h) indipendent variables, for both structural types. Furthermore, pinewood specific biomass expansion factors (BEF) - indexes used to estimate carbon stocks starting from stem biomass data - were obtained. The achieved estimation models were subjected to both parallelism and coincidence tests, showing significant effects of stand structure on the accurancy of the allometric relations. The effects of stand structure and reliability of tree height curves on the accurancy of estimation models for volume and aboveground biomass and on biomass allocation in different compartments are analysed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Smallholders in Asia and Africa require {{low-cost}} {{seed drill}}s for minimal soil disturbance while establishing various crops. A seed drill {{that can be}} drawn by the widely-available two-wheel tractor (2 WT) is an attractive option for mechanization of no-till in small-sized fields. The Versatile <b>Strip</b> <b>Seed</b> Drill (VSSD) was designed with the capacity to make up to 40 mm wide and 60 mm deep strips in untilled land along with seed and basal fertilizer application in a single-pass operation, while powered by the 8. 95 to 11. 93 kW 2 WT. An important innovation of the VSSD was to fit the seed box with both fluted roller-type seed meters for delivery of sufficient small-size seeds to achieve adequate plant density per unit row length; and vertical disk-type seed meters for precision and spaced row planting of larger seeds. Both incessant seed dropping by fluted roller seed meters and spaced planting by vertical disk type seed meters provided optimum plant populations that were generally higher than in conventional, full-tillage plots with the same rate of hand broadcasted seed and fertilizers. Time required for crop establishment by VSSD ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 18 ha·h− 1. When the VSSD {{was attached to the}} 2 WT for crop establishment, the diesel fuel consumption varied from 4. 4 to 6. 1 L·ha− 1, which was lower than for most 2 WT-based planters previously used in Bangladesh. In on-farm multi-locations trials, wheat crops established with the VSSD had statistically similar grain yield compared to conventional tillage; however, significantly higher grain yield was obtained from mustard and lentil, by 14 % and 19 %, respectively. The VSSD is a unique, minimum-soil-disturbance multi-crop planter, and can be a platform on which to build conservation agriculture systems for small farms in Asia and Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} {{performance of}} 11 types of commercially produced degradable starch-polyethylene plastic compost bags was evaluated in municipal yard waste compost sites at Iowa State University (Ames) and in Carroll, Dubuque, and Grinnell, Iowa. Masterbatches for plastic production {{were provided by}} Archer Daniels Midland Co. (Decatur, Ill.), St. Lawrence Starch Co. Ltd. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and Fully Compounded Plastics (Decatur, Ill.). Bags differed in starch content (5 to 9 %) and prooxidant additives (transition metals and a type of unsaturated vegetable oil). Chemical and photodegradation properties of each material were evaluated. Materials from St. Lawrence Starch Co. Ltd. and Fully Compounded Plastics photodegraded faster than did materials from Archer Daniels Midland Co., whereas all materials containing transition metals demonstrated rapid thermal oxidative degradation in 70 °C-oven (dry) and high-temperature, high-humidity (steam chamber) treatments. Each compost site was <b>seeded</b> with test <b>strips</b> (200 to 800 of each type) taped together, which were recovered periodically over an 8 - to 12 -month period. At each sampling date, the compost row temperature was measured (65 to 95 °C), {{the location of the}} recovered test strip was recorded (interior or exterior), and at least four strips were recovered for evaluation. Degradation was followed by measuring the change in polyethylene molecular weight distribution via high-temperature gel permeation chromatography. Our initial 8 -month study indicated that materials recovered from the interior of the compost row demonstrated very little degradation, whereas materials recovered from the exterior degraded well. In the second-year study, however, degradation was observed in several plastic materials recovered from the interior of the compost row by month 5 at the Carroll site and almost every material by month 12 at the Grinnell site. The plastic bags collected from each community followed a similar degradation pattern. To our knowledge, this is the first scientific study demonstrating significant polyethylene degradation by these materials in a compost environment...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) {{is common}} and despite modern microsurgical {{techniques}} of repair, functional restoration is always incomplete. This results in impaired sensation and reduced motor function alongside pain and cold intolerance. Traumatic PNI are {{often associated with}} loss of nerve tissue, creating a gap, and direct repair of the two damaged nerve stumps is not possible. These types of injuries are reconstructed using autologous nerve grafts but this is far from ideal since it necessitates the sacrifice of a functional nerve from elsewhere in the body. Chronic muscle atrophy because of the prolonged delay in nerve regeneration across gaps is a significant impediment to an optimal functional recovery.   Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches to nerve repair might one day replace the need for autologous nerve grafts. This thesis investigates the effects of adipose derived stem cells (ASC) on nerve regeneration and muscle recovery by using the stem cells for intramuscular injection and combined with a biomaterial, poly- 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB), to create a bioengineered artificial nerve repair construct.   The mechanisms of interaction between the stem cells and neuromuscular system cells were investigated and {{with a view to}} translating this work into clinical practice, an optimal source of cells was investigated from human donors.   It was hypothesized that injecting regenerative cells into muscle would reduce nerve injury induced muscle atrophy. A rat sciatic nerve lesion was performed and three different types of cells were injected into the denervated gastrocnemius muscle; either (1) undifferentiated ASC, (2) ASC induced to a ‘Schwann cell-like’ phenotype (dASC) or (3) primary Schwann cells. Nerves were either repaired by direct end-end suture or capped to prevent muscle reinnervation. One month later, functionality was measured using a walking track test, and muscle atrophy was assessed by examining muscle weight and histology. The Schwann cells and dASC groups showed significantly better scores on functional tests when compared with control injections of growth medium alone. Muscle weight and histology were also significantly improved in the cell groups in comparison with the control group.   PHB <b>strips</b> <b>seeded</b> with either primary Schwann cells or dASC suspended in a fibrin glue matrix were used to bridge a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve gap. After 12 weeks, functional and morphological analysis (walking track test, electromyography, muscle weight and muscle and nerve histology) was performed. The results showed significantly better functional results for the PHB <b>strips</b> <b>seeded</b> with cells versus the control group with fibrin matrix only. This correlated with less muscle atrophy and greater distal axon myelination in the cell groups.   To further optimize the nerve regeneration and muscle recovery, the nerve gap lesion was repaired by treatment with the bioengineered constructs seeded with dASC or nerve autograft in combination with stem cell injection in the muscle. After 6 weeks, the best results were obtained in the nerve graft group combined with intramuscular dASC injection which showed significantly less atrophy than the other groups. The results also showed that using the stem cells in a matrix on a PHB strip in combination with intramuscular injections could significantly reduce muscle atrophy.   In vitro experiments showed that dASC expressed a wide range of neurotrophic and myogenic factors including BDNF, VEGF-A, IGF- 1 and HGF. Stem cell conditioned medium enhanced the proliferation of myoblast cell lines and primary Schwann cells. Various signaling pathways (PKA, MAP kinase) were involved in these effects dependent on the cell type investigated. Furthermore, in direct co-culture with myoblast cells, a small population of the cells fused together to form myotube-like structures and expressed myogenic markers.   Human ASC were isolated from the deep and superficial layers of abdominal fat tissue obtained during abdominoplasty procedures.   Cells from the superficial layer proliferated significantly faster than those from the deep layer. Superficial layer ASC induced significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth from neuronal cell lines when compared with the deep layer cells.   However, RT-PCR and ELISA analysis showed that ASC isolated from both layers expressed similar levels of the neurotrophic factors NGF, BDNF and GDNF.   In summary, these results show that stem cell therapy at both levels (the nerve lesion site and in the target denervated muscle) offers a promising approach for clinical application for treatment of peripheral nerve lesions. The bioengineered artificial nerve construct, combining PHB strip with cells, also provides a beneficial environment for nerve regeneration. Many of the benefits of the ASC are likely to be mediated through their secretome, a rich source of neurotrophic and myogenic factors. Thus adipose tissue contains a pool of regenerative stem cells which have significant potential application to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for nerve repair...|$|R
40|$|Cold-pressed blackberry, black raspberry, and {{blueberry}} {{seed oils}} were evaluated for their fatty acid composition, positional distribution of fatty acids within triacylglycerols, triacylglycerol (TAG) profile, total phenolic content (TPC), tocol profile, and oxidative stability (in the dark at 60 °C and under fluorescent light at 27 °C), {{before and after}} the removal of their minor components. All three berry <b>seed</b> oils were <b>stripped</b> of their minor components using a silicic acid column and a hexane/methanol solvent partitioning system, respectively. Accelerated oxidations under Schaal oven and photooxidative conditions demonstrated that the oxidative stability of non-stripped, and column-stripped oils was different. Tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively known as tocols, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography, and found to affect the stability of oils by donating hydrogen atoms in the dark at 60 °C. Pigments, including carotenoids and chlorophylls, were also measured by UV-visible spectrophotometry and were found to influence the stability of the oils. The stability of the oils was dictated by their fatty acid composition, TAG profile, and the type and quantity of their total tocols and pigments present. All tested seed oils contained significant levels of α-linolenic acid, ranging from 13. 4 to 33. 7 g per 100 g of oil, along with a low ratio of n− 6 /n− 3 fatty acids (1. 49 − 3. 86). Six triacylglycerols, namely LnLnLn, LnLLn, LLLn, LLL, OLL and OLLn were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography in berry seed oils tested, where O, L and Ln, are oleoyl, linoleoyl, and linonenoyl fatty acids, respectively. Total tocol contents were 286. 3 − 1302. 9 ppm, and included α-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols as well as δ-tocotrienol. The highest TPC of 0. 48 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of oil was observed in the black raspberry seed oil. Oxidative stability of the three berry seed oils tested was affected by their triacylglycerol profiles, positional distribution of fatty acids, storage conditions and minor components. These data suggests that the cold-pressed berry seed oils may also serve as potential dietary sources for tocols, α-linolenic acid (ALA) and natural antioxidants. These oils must be well protected from oxidative deterioration by proper storage in the dark {{and in the absence of}} oxygen and with minimal processing in order to retain their integrity and health promoting minor components...|$|R
40|$|The South Island takahē (Porphyrio hochstetteri) is an {{endangered}} ground-dwelling species, endemic to New Zealand. To prevent the species’ extinction, individuals were translocated to protected sites, such as off-shore pest-free islands and pest-fenced, mainland sites. The takahē {{may be one}} of the most researched bird species in New Zealand, but there are very few studies on its behavioural habits and ecology at these protected offshore island and mainland sites. This study was an investigation of translocated takahē foraging behaviour at two very different sites, Motutapu Island (Hauraki Gulf, Auckland) and Maungatautari mainland site (Waikato region), with two translocated takahē populations (18 vs 6 takahē respectively). In total, 24 takahē were observed at the time of this study. The aims of this research were to determine: (1) how takahē foraging behaviour differed between pasture and other habitats on Motutapu Island and at Maungatautari, (2) how other habitat elements (incl. vegetation cover, water, roads, tracks) affected foraging behaviour, and (3) if habitat restoration may assist takahē establishment. This study was conducted in reference to future successional habitat changes on Motutapu Island, as it is subject to active re-vegetation of native trees and shrubs. Similarly, Maungatautari is not actively maintaining the pastoral grassland sites between forest edge and the pest-proof fence. Therefore, without management, natural forest successions of these sites are likely to decrease food availability for takahē in the future. Plant species eaten by takahē were identified during field observations. Foraging behaviour was categorised into three main behaviours: (1) cutting for grass-blades, (2) tillering for grass meristems (leaf base, leaf blade discarded) and (3) <b>stripping</b> (grass <b>seeds).</b> A multinomial regression analysis, with confidence intervals of 95 % level confidence, determined the odds of a takahē behaviour occurring according to various habitat variables. Foraging behaviours were found to differ according to the percentages of vegetation cover. On Motutapu Island, the main findings were that takahē favoured tillering grass meristems at sites where a high percentage of shrubland was available rather than at sites with high tree cover (vegetation > 6 m) or with a high percentage of open grassland. In contrast, <b>stripping</b> <b>seeds</b> was favoured at sites with high tree cover and/or at restoration planting sites. Qualitative behavioural data from Maungatautari showed that takahē foraged primarily on pastoral grassland species, obtained primarily between the fence and the forest. Nesting and breeding observations were also made during incubation and chick-rearing. Only one chick reached juvenile-adult stage at Motutapu Island, compared to two chicks at Maungatautari. I identified nest material and nest cover plant species used by takahē (native and exotics- sedges/flax/shrubs/native long grass) during the breeding season and present a plant list based on qualitative fieldwork. Extensive pastoral grasslands on Motutapu Island are now being restored into forested areas, but wetland and native grassland restoration should be another priority for takahē habitat management. Similarly, the Maungatautari Ecological Island Trust (MEIT) may have to control the natural succession of the forest at the edge of the pest-proof fence. Overall, adding native species in pastoral grassland takahē territories at Motutapu Island and Maungautari will be necessary for the future well-being of these translocated takahē. This study has shown that analysing takahē foraging behaviours can help conservation management to improve habitat restoration and subsequent breeding success...|$|R
