I don't think found footage is in danger of running out.

I think you're going to see more comedies. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of sci-fi movies... sometimes it reminds me of when reality TV first really hit and was growing. There was a lot of pushback and people saying, 'Oh, it's going to go away, it's going to go away.' But it didn't go away. It just changed a lot... YouTube has completely changed the way that we experience movies because people are out there making stuff all the time and capturing moments, so there's a certain language that I think we've adopted. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> found footage format connects to that.

40|$|Title: Options {{affecting}} the physical assumptions in Youth Volleyball Aim: To gather relevant information on fitness training volleyball {{at the age}} of 16 to 18 years, which would help novice coaches to basic knowledge in this direction. In the questionnaire, I found out how much time is spent conditioning coaches youth trainings, and what they experience in this area. Methods: Data acquisition of high quality and trusted sources of literature and web sitxes relating to fitness training in different sports, general knowledge about physical abilities and basic information about volleyball and it all efficiently directed to the general fitness training volleyball. The practical part has the task of evaluating questionnaires collected. The evaluation used descriptive statistics. The relative frequency of this statistic is expressed in the graph for easy understanding. Using the questionnaire were addressed only coaches youth volleyball components. Assessment I conducted myself using Microsoft Excel, Power point and calculators. Result: Due to the fact that I was in the theoretical part focused on affordable quality literature, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work is made of high quality and proven resources, full of important and useful information, which concerned the final mainly physical abilities and their [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Attached to seabed. Probably feeding. Identified by Peter Schuchert. Identifying the two {{specimens}} {{was initially}} rather difficult. Both polyps, but especially the larger 008 # 4, has a polyp body which shows some bilateral features, viz the outline seen from below is kidney shaped. This is otherwise typical for the related genus Branchiocerianthus. However, other diagnostic {{features of the}} genus Branchiocerianthus are absent: branched blastostyles (stalks bearing the gonads), blastostyles arranged in a horseshoe- shape, shorter tentacles {{on one side of}} the hydranth. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kidney-shaped bodies are a result of the large size. Note that the polyp body is bent to one side in order to bring the tentacle crown to an almost vertical position, one side of the body and the lower tentacles are thus pressed against the stem. With age, these might therefore be modified Besides the body form, only the size deviates from existing descriptions of this species. In the original description of Sars, he gives a size of maximal 5 inches, which is not so much different from the present specimens. Likely only specimen 008 # 4 is larger than 5 inches. The size of animals I have seen so far was 4 - 5 cm. Anyway, I will mention these two specimens as deep water forms of C. glacialis (normal occurrence is 20 - 220 m). Corymorpha glacialis is a rather rare species and only a handful of specimens have been seen so far...|$|E
40|$|Some mental factors (processes) are {{the link}} between {{cognition}} and emotion- such as basic imagery (body images), thoughts, and other cognitive associations and structures. How exactly does the mind 'think ' however? I could say that it uses images to think, and that these images are mostly unconscious. That {{would be similar to}} having a dream, in a dream simple images represent larger psychological ideas and life experiences. The images your mind uses to think are probably basic, similar to how a computer works with simple switches at the most simple level. The most basic and important mental images are used to represent more significant psychological 'code ' or life experiences (like body images- since social interaction is important humans would be broken down in the mind into simple visualizations). <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind basically thinks by breaking down the psychological factors of life into more simple images. If you have an interaction with someone, then that interaction is broken down into more simple body-images and other images that represent what occurred in the interaction. These images are probably unconscious, you would not notice in what order your mind is going through them or what they are exactly. This means that your minds cognitions (such as images and thoughts) are going to influence your emo-tions. The real world is broken down into thoughts and visualizations (or psychological 'symbols') in your mind, and these mental processes influence your emotions. ...|$|E

I have attempted to keep maximum aesthetics and techniques of construction and building materials typical from this houses, but at the same time adapting the building to current standards of design and comfort.

40|$|No rights, no {{compensation}} CUE: Building roads {{can bring}} not only infrastructure but new opportunities to remote and poorly developed areas. However, while roads may bring {{benefits to the}} majority, for the people whose land they cross {{they can be very}} costly, as crops, trees and even buildings are bulldozed. And if people do not have well established rights of ownership, they may not even be compensated for their loss. Mike Davison introduces this report from Cameroon, where such a road building project led to violent protests from local farmers. IN:		?In Babungo village, in North ? OUT:		? are benefiting from the route. DUR?N	 5 ? 11 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Tumoh Emmanuel who, because of having no secure right to his land, received no compensation when a new road was built across it. Transcript Studio	In Babungo village, in North West Cameroon, the right to land is held by the village chief. He?s known as the fon. When a wealthy cattle ranch owner, Alhadji Baba, wanted to build a road to his ranch, he approached the fon, to ask for permission, since the road would have to cross land under the fon?s control. The fon agreed but the road proved to be very controversial, as Martha Chindong found out when she investigated the project. She spoke first to Fuangwe Soweh Christopher. He?d been chosen to manage the road building project. Christopher	The fon authorised me to trace a route. It was not an easy thing. The villagers rebelled against the route, because it was going to destroy their crops, it was going to destroy their trees, in fact it was going to destroy their land. So there was high tension, and may of the villagers carried dangerous weapons, waiting for who will enter his land to trace or dig a route. Chindong	Did you not consult with the people before starting the project, or you just went into their land like that? Christopher	At that time land was not being sold, and the fon is the custodian of all Babungo land, by our tradition. And he had the right to dish out any piece of land, especially for development, to anybody. So it was not necessary to bargain with the people. Chindong	Maybe the people were violent because you did not communicate with them. Those who had crops growing on the land; maybe you did not promise to compensate them in any way. Christopher	It?s true. There was no promise for any compensation. And at that time, we never even thought that if we had asked the people to accept compensation they will accept. Because they did not talk of compensation, but they talked of not allowing anybody to tamper with any piece of their land. And we knew that if we stayed at that stage, development would not come to the village. But I think that the Fon who was custodian of the village had some compensation from Alhadji Baba, and that was on behalf of the people. That is a crucial thing in African society, where the big man enjoys for his subjects. Chindong	And today, how are the people benefiting from this road? Christopher	The whole community, including myself are benefiting from this route, because we transport sick ones through the route, we carry crops from farms to our homes through this route, people are building along the route and can easily have electricity connected to their compounds, whereas it was not easy before. It is easy to transport food to distant villages like Belo and Kom, through this route. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> route has been beneficial to every citizen in Babungo. Studio	While the new road has clearly brought advantages to the people of Babungo, some of those whose crops and trees were destroyed are still unhappy that they received no compensation for their losses. Martha spoke to Tumoh Emmanuel about how the building of the road has affected his livelihood. Emmanuel	The road is passing through my plot, so I lost many mango trees, pear trees, palm trees etc. Chindong	Now tell me when they started the route, before they started the project, did they tell you that this is what is happening, and this is how it is going to affect you? Emmanuel	No. I had no idea of the development, I had no idea. They did not inform us. So we only found that tractors were sent to bulldoze every place. Chindong	What were your reactions? Emmanuel	We went out to stop caterpillars. So we had information from the workers, that all that was being done had already been compensated, so we would get our compensation after the construction of the road, which has never come until now. Chindong	Are you regretting that the road cut across your plot? Emmanuel	Yes I am regretting, because the crops that were destroyed, were those crops that we were living through. Chindong	Have you ever benefited anything from this project? Emmanuel	If I can say that I have benefited something from there it is just because gravel was sprayed on the road, so now travelling during rainy season, we have not mud on the way. Chindong	What of selling some items to tourists who pass through this route to Elba ranch? Emmanuel	Some other people who come from other quarters they do sell, but we around the road now, whose trees were destroyed, we have nothing now to sell, so we are just empty. But different people are benefiting from the route. End of tape. Building roads can bring new opportunities to remote and poorly developed areas, but for people whose land they cross, they can be very costly.
