5000|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, almost all American soft drink {{bottlers}} switched from cane sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) {{because of a}} rise in the price of sugar for a number of political reasons. However, the owner of Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling Company of Dublin, Texas refused to switch sweeteners, and it remained one of few bottlers in the United States to continue using cane <b>sugar</b> <b>year</b> round. Though the Dublin plant is not the only Dr Pepper bottler to have used cane sugar instead of HFCS as a sweetener, the Dublin plant was the most well-known plant to not make the change. Dr Pepper containing cane sugar carried the Imperial Sugar logo and thus the variant became popularly known as [...] "Dublin" [...] Dr Pepper.In addition to Dr Pepper products, the Dublin plant also produced Sun Crest Orange, Triple XXX, and NuGrape in 9-10 ounce returnable bottles. To purchase drinks in the 9-10 ounce returnable bottles, the buyer must first have provided their own crate of empty bottles in order to make an exchange.|$|E
