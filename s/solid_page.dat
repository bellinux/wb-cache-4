A virtual reality (VR) approach is taken to make the use of modelling tools more intuitive and interactive.

We discuss two cases where the micro-rotations are stationary solutions of an Allen-Cahn equation. Thus, for a certain parameter range, patterning arises and the domain is partitioned into subsets with approximate constant rotations. This describes a possible mechanism for the formation of grains and subgrains in deformed <b>solids.</b> Comment: 16 <b>pages,</b> 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{nanoscale}} materials with well-controlled {{size and shape}} {{can be used to}} learn more about critical length scales for numerous physical and chemical phenomena in solids and extended systems. Small nanocrystals (below 5 -nm diameter) have been shown to exhibit fully reversible single-domain structural phase transformations with large volume changes over multiple cycles. The same transformations in extended solids are accompanied by irreversible domain formation. Here we investigate the crossover between these regimes by studying a pressure-induced structural transformation in 4 -nm-diameter nanorods varying in aspect ratio from 1 to 10. We find that above a critical length the nanorods fracture at the moment of the structural transformation. This work demonstrates the use of simple, well-defined nanoscale systems to examine fundamental structural phenomena found in extended <b>solids.</b> 4 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the entanglement between any two spins in a one dimensional Heisenberg chain {{as a function}} of temperature and the external magnetic field. We find that the entanglement in an antiferromagnetic chain can be increased by increasing the temperature or the external field. Increasing the field can also create entanglement between otherwise disentangled spins. This entanglement can be confirmed by testing Bell's inequalities involving any two spins in the <b>solid.</b> Comment: 4 <b>pages,</b> 5 figure...|$|R

We show that in dimensions three it is not greater than the solid angle of the regular simplex. And in dimension four the same holds for simplices sufficiently close to the regular simplex. We also study a similar question for trihedral and dihedral angles of polyhedra compared to those of regular <b>solids.</b> Comment: 6 <b>page...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{prescription}} for constructing Hamiltonians representing the low energy physics of correlated electron materials with dynamically screened Coulomb interactions. The key feature is a renormalization of the hopping and hybridization parameters by the processes {{that lead to the}} dynamical screening. The renormalization is shown to be non-negligible for various classes of correlated electron materials. The bandwidth reduction effect is necessary for connecting models to materials behavior and for making quantitative predictions for low-energy properties of <b>solids.</b> Comment: 4 <b>pages,</b> 2 figure...|$|R

The population of spots evolves slowly compared to the interval between particle rearrangements and the soft spots are structurally {{different from the rest}} of the system. Our results suggest that disordered solids flow via localized rearrangements that tend to occur at soft spots, which are analogous to dislocations in crystalline <b>solids.</b> Comment: 4 <b>pages,</b> 4 figure...|$|R

The Hilbert space setting developed for the time-shift invariant case can be utilized to obtain an elementary approach to non-autonomous equations. The results cover a large class of evolutionary equations, where well-known strategies like evolution families may be difficult to use or fail to work.

40|$|Rural-to-urban {{migrant workers}} have contributed {{enormously}} to the Chinese economy {{and society in}} the past three decades. Many of them have concentrated in disadvantaged neighbourhoods and physically and socially suffered from poor residential environment. However it is unclear how the neighbourhoods - as the provision of shelter, social and public service, and community organizing - influence migrant workers' labour market outcomes. To fill this gap, this paper researches the way in which urban neighbourhoods have affected migrant workers' wages. Factors such as housing quality, social interaction and trust, and neighbourhood organization and participation were examined. Results show that five of eight neighbourhood characteristics had statistically significant effects on wages. Robustness tests were conducted to address endogeneity problems of self-selection and unobserved individual ability. Test results demonstrated that our main findings were generally robust, and thus the causality was <b>solid.</b> 10 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R
