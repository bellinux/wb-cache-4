40|$|AbstractThis work is {{dedicated}} to minimizing power consumption for a vehicle propulsion, with power distributed non-uniformly between axles under different <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> wheels {{on the right and}} {{on the left side of}} the vehicle. We present a method of calculating minimal total power required for the driving wheels of the mobile vehicle, for different transmission types.

40|$|A {{connected}} {{foundation is}} an effective foundation type that can improve the structural performance of electrical transmission towers in soft ground as a resilient energy supply system with improved stability. In the present study, {{the performance of a}} connected foundation for transmission towers was investigated, focusing on the effect of connection beam properties and <b>soil</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>For</b> this purpose, a finite element analysis was performed for various foundation and <b>soil</b> <b>conditions.</b> In order to validate the finite element analysis, the calculated results were compared with measured results obtained from field load tests. The use of connection beams was more effective for uplift foundations that usually control the design of transmission tower foundations. For the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>condition,</b> the use of connected foundation is more effective in soft clays with lower undrained shear strength (su). Smaller amounts of differential settlement were observed in all <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> both unconnected and connected foundations when a bearing rock layer was present. When the foundation was not reinforced by connection beams, the values of lateral load capacity of tower structure (Hu) were similar for both with- and without-rock layers. It was confirmed that introducing haunch-shaped connection beams is effective for increasing connection beam stability...|$|R

40|$|Soil erosion is {{a severe}} {{environmental}} {{problem on the}} Loess Plateau, China. Vegetation restoration is the most efficient method to control soil erosion and introducing late-successional plant species may accelerate natural succession. However, the progress is affected by <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> and the appropriate thresholds of <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> seed addition are needed. Our objectives were to identify the vegetation types, examine the key soil factors affecting the vegetation variation, and determine the thresholds of the soil factors for each vegetation type. Five vegetation types in secondary succession were identified: association (assoc.) Artemisia scoparia assoc. Bothriochloa ischaemum assoc. Artemisia gmelinii Artemisia giraldii assoc. Ostryopsis davidiana Rubus parvifolius L., Syringa oblate and assoc. Sophora viciifolia Years since abandonment (YEAR), alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen (AHN), soil water content (SW), and total phosphorus (TP) were the key factors used to discriminate among vegetation types. Assoc. A. scoparia developed in croplands that had been abandoned for less than 11 years. Assoc. B. ischaemum developed in croplands abandoned for more than 11 years with lower soil nutrient levels (0. 30 <= TP <= 0. 646 g kg(- 1) and 16. 72 <= AHN <= 32. 62 mg kg(- 1)). Assoc. A. gmelinii + A. giraldii always required greater TP (0. 646 <= TP <= 0. 79 g kg(- 1)) to develop. When soil water content was lower (6. 6 <= SW <= 8. 4 %), the assoc. S. viciifolia developed; otherwise, other associations, such as assoc. O. davidiana, developed. These soil thresholds {{can be used as}} references for guiding restoration, such as specifying proper <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> seed sowing...|$|R

50|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> farming are {{generally}} good, especially downwind of volcanoes. This is largely because volcanic rocks are often rich in potassium bearing minerals such as orthoclase and decay easily. Volcanic debris, especially lahars, {{also have a}} leveling effect and the storage {{of water in the}} form of snow and ice is also important. These snow-capped mountains such as Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor are used as ski resorts in the late winter. Much of that water eventually flows into reservoirs, where it is used for recreation before its potential energy is captured to generate hydroelectric power before being used to irrigate crops.|$|R

There are large areas of natural forests where truffles are still collected manually in a traditional way. For example, the county of Alto Maestrazgo (province of Castellón, Spain) has an ideal ground with suitable <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivating</b> truffles.

40|$|Vegetable {{production}} in South East Asia often is in rotation with °ooded rice. The puddling {{of the soil}} with flooded rice production may result in unfavourable <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the subsequent production of dry land crops. To establish whether permanent vegetable production results in favourable <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> vegetables, the effects of five different permanent vegetable production systems and a system of vegetable {{production in}} rotation with flooded rice on soil properties after flooded rice were studied in a 2 -year field experiment. Bulk density at 0. 05 { 0. 10 m depth layer decreased with permanent vegetable production and vegetable production in rotation with flooded rice. The decrease in bulk density was in°uenced by the application of organic manure and rice husks, and especially {{by the number of}} crops cultivated, suggesting that frequency of soil tillage had a major effect on bulk density. Ploughing with buffalo traction after flooded rice, in combination with construction of raised beds, could reduce or totally eliminate negative effects of puddling on soil structure. Bulk density at 0. 15 { 0. 20 m soil depth was not influenced. Soil acidity decreased significantly in all systems. Soil organic carbon increased in all systems, but significant increase was only found in two permanent vegetable production systems. Available phosphorus (P) significantly increased in two permanent vegetable production systems, with a positively correlation to the amount of P applied. The significant decrease in bulk density and increase in pH (H 2 O), after only 2 years, showed that <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> after flooded rice could be improved in a short time under intensive vegetable production...|$|R
