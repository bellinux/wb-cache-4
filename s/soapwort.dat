50|$|This shrub {{grows in}} cracks in rocks {{alongside}} flowing water. It has a fibrous mass of roots and lateral rhizomes that anchor it, {{and even if}} most of the plant is ripped away during flooding, it easily resprouts from remnants of the rhizomes. It is often found growing in sandstone bedrock, gravel bars, nooks between boulders, and in riverborne deposits of debris, rubble, and silt. It is adapted to periodic flooding, scouring, erosion, and deposition of litter. Other plants in the habitat may include hazel alder (Alnus serrulata), silky dogwood (Cornus amomum), jewelweed (Impatiens capensis), creepers (Parthenocissus), ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius), sycamore species (Platanus), blackberries (Rubus), willow species (Salix), American elderberry (Sambucus canadensis), <b>soapworts</b> (Saponaria), greenbrier species (Smilax), goldenrod species (Solidago), and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).|$|R

5000|$|Saporin [...] is {{a protein}} that {{is useful in}} {{biological}} research applications, especially studies of behavior. Saporin is a so-called ribosome inactivating protein (RIP), due to its N-glycosidase activity, from the seeds of Saponaria officinalis (common name: <b>soapwort).</b> It was first described by Fiorenzo Stirpe and his colleagues in 1983 in an article that illustrated the unusual stability of the protein.|$|E

50|$|Among the RIPs {{are some}} of the most toxic {{molecules}} known, including ricin and abrin (the latter is the poison preferred by the characters in The Blue Lagoon). These toxins contain a second protein subunit, which inserts the RIP into a cell, making it able to enzymatically inactivate the ribosomes, shutting down protein synthesis and resulting in cell death, and eventually causing death of the victim. Saporin has no chain capable of inserting it into the cell. Thus it and the <b>soapwort</b> plant are safe to handle. This has aided its use in research.|$|E
5000|$|Gentiana saponaria (<b>soapwort</b> gentian or harvestbells) is a 1 - 2 ft tall {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} Gentianaceae family. It is native to eastern North America south of the Great Lakes, from Wisconsin to New York, and south to Texas and Florida. Similar to the [...] "Bottle Gentians" [...] like Gentiana clausa and Gentiana andrewsii, it has paired, lanceolate leaves on unbranched stalks, blue or purple blooms, and a stout taproot. It is rare in its range, usually found in undisturbed sandy soils. The flowers are pollinated by bumblebees.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{familiar}} species might be common <b>soapwort</b> (S. officinalis), which {{is native to}} Eurasia but is known {{in much of the}} world as an introduced species, often a weed, and sometimes a cultivated ornamental plant. The genus name Saponaria derives from the Latin [...] ("soap") and -aria ("pertaining to"), and at least one species, S. officinalis, has been used to make soap. It contains saponins, and a liquid soap could be produced by soaking the leaves in water. This soap is still used to clean delicate antique tapestries.|$|E
50|$|Sesame halva {{is popular}} in the Balkans, Poland, Middle East, and other areas {{surrounding}} the Mediterranean Sea. The primary ingredients in this confection are sesame butter or paste (tahini), and sugar, glucose or honey. <b>Soapwort</b> (called ‘erq al halaweh in Arabic; çöven in Turkish), egg white, or marshmallow root are added in some recipes to stabilize the oils in the mixture or create a distinctive texture for the resulting confection. A version of sesame halva, called sesame crumble candy (芝麻酥糖) in China uses ground sesame and sugar, cooked to the hard ball stage because it is made crispier than other halvas.|$|E
50|$|The {{inner bark}} of Quillaja saponaria {{can be reduced}} to powder and {{employed}} as a substitute for soap, since it forms a lather with water, owing to the presence of a glucoside saponin, sometimes distinguished as quillaia saponin. It also applied as an agricultural spray adjuvant. The same, or a closely similar substance, is found in <b>soapwort</b> (Saponaria officinalis), in senega root (Polygala senega) and in sarsaparilla; it appears to be chemically related to digitonin, which occurs in digitalis. The wood is used in cabinetry, and scents derived from the tree are used in perfumes and cosmetics.|$|E
5000|$|Turkish delight, lokum or rahat lokum {{and many}} other transliterations (رَاحَة الْحُلْقُوم rāḥat al-ḥulqūm, Lokum or rahat lokum, from colloquial راحه الحلقوم rāḥat al-ḥalqūm, Azerbaijani: [...] ) is a family of {{confections}} based on a gel of starch and sugar. Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates, pistachios, and hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties are mostly flavored with rosewater, mastic, Bergamot orange, or lemon. The confection is often packaged and eaten in small cubes dusted with icing sugar, copra, or powdered cream of tartar, to prevent clinging. Other common flavors include cinnamon and mint. In the production process, <b>soapwort</b> {{may be used as}} an emulsifying additive.|$|E
50|$|Edward the Less is a Pudge, a race {{of short}} and merry people who spend their days in the Pudgelands dancing, eating horrible food, singing inane songs and whistling. But Edward is {{frustrated}} with the overly merry lifestyle and dreams of seeking out a magical city island he has read about, which includes tall people, skyscrapers, pizza and people who ride around in yellow cars and push each other around. Edward decides to leave his hamlet of Pushington Downs, along with his faithful sidekick <b>Soapwort</b> McFuggletoes. During their journey, the duo come into possession of a magic token, which {{they are forced to}} destroy so it will not {{fall into the hands of}} the evil Dark Person.|$|E
5000|$|Tahini halvah (חלבה) is {{very popular}} in Israel and among people of Jewish {{background}} all over the world. Spelled [...] "halvah" [...] in English, it usually comes in slabs or small packages, and is available {{in a wide variety}} of flavours, chocolate and vanilla being very common. The halvah is almost always parve. Israeli halvah will usually not contain wheat flour or semolina, but will contain sesame tahini, glucose, sugar, vanilla and saponaria officinalis root extracts (<b>soapwort),</b> which are not usually found in other recipes. It is often served as a breakfast component at Israeli hotels, though it is not usually part of an Israeli breakfast, and it is even used in specialty ice-cream.|$|E
50|$|Even walking posed problems, as {{shoes were}} rationed. However, anyone could {{get hold of}} shoes with wooden soles without using a ration ticket. These were uncomfortable, fragile and {{certainly}} not waterproof. A shortage of fabrics made prices soar. Clothes were patched up. Knitting was unpicked to reknit other garments. A red sweater became two or three pairs of long red socks. Reduced wardrobes meant people rarely changed clothes, but those aspiring to elegance painted false stockings on their legs with liquid chicory. Washing clothes was not easy. Washing powder was eventually replaced by ashes or by using infusions of plants such as <b>soapwort,</b> which lathers like soap. Ivy was used for black garments, worn by the numerous women in mourning. The tubes taken from redundant bicycle pumps were used as moulds for the manufacture of candles made with lard, the wicks made from cotton, which itself was recycled from old hand-crocheted curtains.|$|E

50|$|Saponins have {{historically}} been understood to be plant-derived, but they have also been isolated from marine organisms such as sea cucumber. Saponins are indeed found in many plants, and derive their name from the <b>soapwort</b> plant (genus Saponaria, family Caryophyllaceae), the root of which was used historically as a soap. Saponins are {{also found in the}} botanical family Sapindaceae, with its defining genus Sapindus (soapberry or soapnut), and in the closely related families Aceraceae (maples) and Hippocastanaceae (horse chestnuts; ref. needed). It is also found heavily in Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Gynostemma, Cucurbitaceae) in a form called gypenosides, and ginseng or red ginseng (Panax, Araliaceae) in a form called ginsenosides. Within these families, this class of chemical compounds is found {{in various parts of the}} plant: leaves, stems, roots, bulbs, blossom and fruit. Commercial formulations of plant-derived saponins, e.g., from the soap bark (or soapbark) tree, Quillaja saponaria, and those from other sources are available via controlled manufacturing processes, which make them of use as chemical and biomedical reagents.|$|E

40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RlPs) {{are found}} {{distributed throughout the}} plant kingdom. These proteins possess a RNA N-glycosidase activity whereby the depurination of a specific adenine residue from the large ribosomal subunit renders eukaryotic and, in some cases, prokaryotic ribosomes inactive. RIPs are most commonly found as single chain polypeptides and have been designated 'type I’. Some RIPs, however, are comprised of two polypeptide chains ('type 11 '), an active polypeptide, analogous to the type I RIP, and a galactose-binding polypeptide. This thesis describes the characterisation of saporins, type I RIPs from <b>soapwort</b> (Saponaria officinalis L.). The work describes an analysis of saporin gene expression {{and the distribution of}} these proteins throughout the <b>soapwort</b> plant. Saporin gene expression in <b>soapwort</b> leaf tissue was shown to be temporally and spatially regulated. Saporins were distributed throughout the plant, the most abundant source of saporins was found in the seed tissue. The distribution of saporins in the seeds and leaves of <b>soapwort</b> was also studied at the cellular and subcellular level. Saporins were distributed to both vacuolar and extracellular sites of deposition in developing and mature seeds and to an extracellular site only in young leaves. Together with an analysis of the RIP activity of saporins on endogeneous ribosomes, where Saponaria ribosomes were shown to be depurinated by saporins, this work confirmed the assumption that saporins were targeted to a subcellular compartment separate from the cell cytosol where they could not come into contact with their own ribosomes. Molecular and biochemical differences between the leaf and seed saporin isoforms were also examined. The leaf saporins were shown consistently to be of a higher molecular weight than the seed saporins. This difference was also observed in other tissues of the <b>soapwort</b> plant. Differential extractability properties of the saporins were investigated and were applied to the purification of a leaf saporin isoform. The purified leaf saporin was identified as a new and uncharacterised isoform identical in its N-terminal sequence to a previously characterised seed saporin isoform...|$|E
