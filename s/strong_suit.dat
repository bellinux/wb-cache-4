5|$|On January 31, 2012, Gingrich placed {{second in}} the Republican Florida primary, losing by a fifteen {{percentage}} point margin, 47% to 32%. Some factors that contributed to this outcome include two strong debate performances by Romney (which were typically Gingrich's <b>strong</b> <b>suit),</b> the wide margin by which the Gingrich campaign was outspent in television ads, and a widely criticized proposal by Gingrich to have a permanent colony on the moon by 2020 to reinvigorate the American Space Program.|$|E
5|$|Much of Bloodlines {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed the game and typographical errors in on-screen text. Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized {{while waiting for the}} player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants standing still, unable to locate a hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was Bloodlines greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's <b>strong</b> <b>suit,</b> features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{instruments}} tend {{to work in}} sections, {{with groups}} of trombones or flutes or whatever alternating or overlapping in tone blocks that are displaced from each other rhythmically, ultimately to a heavy effect that leaves little room for luminosity. Indeed, rhythm was the score’s <b>strong</b> <b>suit,</b> and sometimes it injected considerable momentum. By the end, though, it did not sustain a score of this length on its own, unassisted as it was by concomitant strength in harmonic direction or, most regrettably, melodic contour.|$|E

25|$|In the New Hampshire Primary, both McCain and Romney had gambled {{much on the}} state. McCain had staked much on his {{grassroots}} efforts in the state he won in 2000, {{as well as the}} state {{with one of the most}} independent voting blocks which was McCain's <b>strong</b> <b>suit.</b> Romney, coming from neighboring Massachusetts was known by many in New Hampshire and even owned a home in the state of New Hampshire. Pre-Primary polling showed McCain with a slight edge (32%-28%) with Huckabee leading Giuliani for third (12%-9%).|$|E
25|$|On 19 June Frankel {{started at}} odds of 1/10 for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot against a field which {{included}} Excelebration and <b>Strong</b> <b>Suit,</b> respectively ranked the equal second and the equal fifth best three-year-old colts {{in the world}} by the IFHA in 2011. Frankel took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew steadily clear to win by eleven lengths from Excelebration. Frankel ran the penultimate furlong in a time of 10.58 seconds, which equates to a top speed of over 42mph. The Guardian's correspondent described the performance as possibly the greatest in the history of Thoroughbred racing. Timeform responded to the win by raising Frankel's provisional rating to 147, the highest in the organisation's history, two pounds in advance of the 145 recorded in 1965 by Sea-Bird. However the British Horseracing Authority's handicapper, Dominic Gardiner-Hill, was more cautious. He rated the horse at 140, which was still just behind Dancing Brave's all-time record mark of 141. The Racing Post gave the performance a rating of 142, the highest in the publication's history, three pounds ahead of Dubai Millennium.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Alex McCown-Levy graded {{the episode}} a 'B+', calling it [...] "a {{fast-moving}} and fun adventure, {{the kind of}} race-against-time scenario that remains the series’ <b>strong</b> <b>suit</b> [...] played to the show’s strengths on numerous levels". He highlighted Johnson's fight against the prisoners, and Woods' direction of that scene, {{as well as the}} heart-to-heart between Johnson and May. McCown-Levy also felt [...] "the show is having the most narratively efficient season yet, effectively balancing mission-of-the-week adventures with the longer plots", but was critical of Lucy and the low stokes of the villains. Terri Schwartz at IGN scored the episode an eight out of ten, indicating a [...] "great" [...] episode, and said the highlight was the action and choreography. Schwartz also noted character-focused moments such as the Johnson and May heart-to-heart and the revelations about Mace, while highliy criticizing the ghost effects, saying, [...] "Maybe it's Lucy's makeup or maybe it's the downside of having a TV show budget, but the look of these affected beings takes me out of the episode whenever they appear. Because of that ... "Lockup" [...] didn't pop as much as last week's [...] "Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire".|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} reception to {{the album}} was generally favourable. Based on 40 reviews, review aggregate website Metacritic reported a rating of 78 out of 100. There were mixed comments about the ballads; two reviewers noted a disparity between {{the energy of the}} ballads to different songs. Drowned in Sound commented that, [...] "ballads remain a <b>strong</b> <b>suit,</b> particularly the easy grace of the title track, {{but more often than not}} sit awkwardly next to the more toothsome numbers and feel under-produced by comparison" [...] with similar comments from AllMusic who said, [...] "Made in the Darks main weakness might be its ballads, but that may just be in comparison to its many energetic moments, which are so addictive that it feels like a forced come-down whenever the band slows things down." [...] However, The Observer gave a positive evaluation of the ballads; [...] "Hot Chip have had a happy way with a subliminal power ballad. And Made in the Dark can boast four of the best." [...] Pitchfork rated the album as 7/10 with a mixed review, describing it as a [...] "patchy, turbulent record" [...] due to the use of many different individual components and also said that it was a [...] "good record but not a great one". Martin responded to the criticism made by Pitchfork: ...|$|E

OK! commented that [...] "in addition to seeing Brit in three different sexy getups, the video [...] features an oiled-up Britney writhing around in nothing but a smile". Rolling Stone said the video was [...] "a cross between 'Toxic' and The Office" [...] and added, [...] "she’s dancing [...] looking like the old Britney". Courtney Hazlett of msnbc.com claimed [...] "When Spears isn’t shown naked and writhing in a steam room, she’s fired up". TV Guide writer Adam Bryant said that [...] "the music video features {{some of the most}} strategically placed hands in music-video history [...] video is quite a return to form for the troubled pop star". The music video for [...] "Womanizer" [...] became a worldwide success right after it premiered on the Internet, gaining seven million viewers in less than 48 hours. The music video was listed as the best video of 2008 in polls by MTV and Fuse TV. It won Music Video of the Year at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. The video was also nominated for Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. It lost the latter category to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies", but won Best Pop Video. Womanizer was VEVOcertified after it reached 100 million views on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|The state {{registration}} for architects in Georgia required either an architecture degree (which League did not have) {{or ten years}} experience in a licensed office (which she did) and passing a week-long examination.

She passed that part of the exam but failed the test on design – which was her <b>strong</b> <b>suit.</b> (One of the examiners disliked her submission).

2500|$|Muck {{served as}} music {{director}} of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) from 1906 to 1908 and then again from 1912 to 1918 (with a yearly salary of 28,000 dollars as the New York Times reported on March 26, 1918). Initially he had to work to expand his repertoire from the operas and German music he concentrated on in Europe. Olin Downes later wrote that [...] "his repertory was unequal to the demands of his audience" [...] so he relied on members of the BSO for coaching in French works. Contemporary works were not his <b>strong</b> <b>suit,</b> though he dutifully programmed music that was not to his own taste, such as the American premiere of Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra. He also introduced some Sibelius symphonies and many works of Debussy to Boston. Despite his restrained style, he occasionally revealed his romantic side in a work like Liszt's Faust Symphony. On his death the New York Times said that in Boston [...] "he built a virtuoso orchestra." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soviet pilots {{appreciated}} the cannon-armed P-39 primarily for its air-to-air capability. A common Western misconception {{is that the}} Bell fighters were used as ground attack aircraft. This is because the Soviet term for {{the mission of the}} P-39, prikrytiye sukhoputnykh voysk (coverage of ground forces) is commonly translated ground support, which is often taken to mean close air support. In Soviet usage, it has a broader meaning. Soviet-operated P-39s did make strafing attacks, but it was [...] "never a primary mission or <b>strong</b> <b>suit</b> for this aircraft". The Soviets developed successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell fighters and scored a surprising number of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Soviet P-39s had no trouble dispatching Junkers Ju 87 Stukas or German twin-engine bombers and matched, and in some areas surpassed, early and mid-war Messerschmitt Bf 109s. The usual nickname for the Airacobra in the VVS was Kobrushka ("little cobra") or Kobrastochka, a blend of Kobra and Lastochka (swallow), [...] "dear little cobra".|$|E
2500|$|Jon Dolan, {{writing for}} Blender, gave the album {{three out of}} five stars and commended Norwood's {{decision}} to re-team with Jerkins: [...] "Now she's gone back to girlie hip-hop Eden; four songs were written by Jerkins, author of her best late-'90s hits. Fluttery jams about long distance longing and time-suspending slow dances are balanced by grown-up moments of deeply felt, if slightly weird, balladic fortitude." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the sentiments of the songs, whether self-affirming or heartbroken, were back to generic ones: [...] "Song titles like 'Torn Down' and 'Shattered Heart' show how much Brandy {{is trying to get}} serious, taking on an adult world where happily ever after is elusive. But she still comes across as a fledgling, a personality still being formed, eagerly tagging along after her role models." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Henry Goldblatt noted [...] "the huskiness that defined Brandy's prior work has been replaced by wispier and higher tones. The result is pleasant but far less ambitious than her last CD, 2004's Afrodisiac." [...] Mikael Wood's review for Los Angeles Times was less emphatic. He gave the album one and a half stars out of four, and said: [...] "Unfortunately, it's also hard {{to make it through the}} thing. Brandy's <b>strong</b> <b>suit</b> has never been her thoughtfulness; appropriately for someone with her Hollywood history, she's long been one of R's emptiest vessels, a gorgeous voice used by a series of gifted producers to communicate their own unique ideas." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers {{and chicken}} cocks, and tom-cats, {{and all of}} them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog {{whirling}} {{in the air like a}} doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or maybe a couple if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep'him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most anything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this flor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing out, 'Flies, Dan'l, flies!' and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his <b>strong</b> <b>suit,</b> you understand; and when it came to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had travelled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see.|$|E
