5|$|Eight {{months after}} the release of Grove's book, Titan Books, in {{association}} with <b>Sparkplug</b> Press, released a detailed history on the Friday the 13th series. Peter M. Bracke released Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th on October 24, 2005. The book chronicles the creation of the series up to the release of Freddy vs. Jason. Bracke spent three years researching the series and collecting more than 200 interviews from the cast and crew of each of the films. Bracke's extensive work for the book prompted Sean S. Cunningham to provide a foreword. Crystal Lake Memories also includes images, storyboards, concept art, and publicity material that had not been released to the public. A private party was held on October 22, 2005 at Universal Studios CityWalk Hollywood for the book's premiere.|$|E

500|$|The {{raising of}} the twenty squadrons {{involved}} {{the training of}} 1,254 RAF personnel in the United States, and {{about the same number}} in the United Kingdom. Both RAF and USAF personnel were trained in the United States by the 392nd Strategic Missile Squadron (Training), which was formed at Cooke Air Force Base in California on 23 May 1957, and assigned to the 704th Strategic Missile Wing. Both were assigned to the 1st Missile Division on 22 July. The squadron was renamed the 392nd Missile Training Squadron on 12 August, and was activated on 15 September. Training was also provided by Douglas Aircraft and A. C. <b>Sparkplug</b> at the former's plant in Tuscon, Arizona. The 672nd Strategic Missile Squadron, which was renamed the 672nd Technical Training Squadron on [...] 25 April 1958, was formed at Cooke Air Force Base on 1 January 1958, and moved to RAF Feltwell on 20 May 1958, and then to RAF Lakenheath on 17 August 1959, where it was disbanded on 1 October 1959. RAF Bomber Command established a Strategic Missile School at RAF Feltwell in January 1961, and in May responsibility for Thor missile training passed from the USAF to the RAF. The school conducted courses for launch control officers, technical officers, authentication officers, missile serving chiefs and missile, general and electrical fitters.

2500|$|Since {{the right}} engine had backfired during the {{maintenance}} check in San Juan, 13 new spark plugs (AC-LS-87) were installed. The AC-LS-87 <b>sparkplug</b> accounted for 30 of the 36 {{required for the}} engine to run. This type of <b>sparkplug</b> was not approved {{for use in the}} Curtiss C-46A by the engine manufacturer or the United States Air Forces (which specifically prohibited the use of this type of <b>sparkplug</b> in the C-46A's Pratt and Whitney engines). Furthermore, the rear right engine sparkplugs suffered from extreme heat damage. This was linked to the right engine ignition switch found in the left magneto position, only allowing the rear sparkplugs to fire. Finally, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) determined [...] "the spark plug terminals for this engine were found to be oily and dirty and spark plug electrodes were found to have too much clearance." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{secondary}} {{assembly device}} contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running {{down to the}} center of the secondary was a ~1.3cm thick hollow cylindrical rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the <b>sparkplug,</b> a tritium-boosted fission device, which had an aperture of about 0.5cm at its center. The <b>sparkplug</b> was charged with about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary's compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the geometric characteristics of the <b>sparkplug</b> (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or k, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its adiabatic compression energy determined the minimal energy required for the <b>sparkplug</b> to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper's momentum. The <b>sparkplug</b> weighed about 18kg, and its initial firing yielded [...] Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about [...] to the total yield. The energy required by the <b>sparkplug</b> to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary's yield because coupling of the primary’s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ~28cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular frustum, with its small diameter facing the primary's side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff air-gap about 0.9cm wide that was to increase the tamper's momentum, a levitation technique used as early as Operation Sandstone and famously quoted by Ted Taylor as hammer-on-the-nail-impact. Since there were also technical concerns that high-Z tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel, leading to unacceptably large radiation losses the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to hinder to some extent the unavoidable and undesirable Taylor mixing.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{detonation}} of {{the primary}} fission bomb stage in a thermonuclear weapon (Teller-Ullam staging), the <b>sparkplug,</b> a cylinder of U-235/Pu-239 {{at the center of}} the fusion stage(s), begins to fission in a chain reaction, from excess neutrons channeled from the primary. [...] The neutrons released from the fission of the <b>sparkplug</b> split lithium-6 into tritium and helium-4, while lithium-7 is split into helium-4, tritium, and one neutron. As these reactions occur, the fusion stage is compressed by photons from the primary and fission of the U-238 or U-238/U-235 jacket surrounding the fusion stage. Therefore, the fusion stage breeds its own tritium as the device detonates. [...] In the extreme heat and pressure of the explosion, some of the tritium is then forced into fusion with deuterium, and that reaction releases even more neutrons.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{original}} Transformers episode [...] "Autobot Spike", <b>Sparkplug</b> Witwicky creates an Autobot using mismatched robot parts that he names Autobot X, but the robot is a mindless monster and goes berserk.

2500|$|Boron {{was used}} at many {{locations}} in this dry system; {{it has a}} high cross-section for the absorption of slow neutrons, which fission U and Pu, but a low cross-section for the absorption of fast neutrons, which fission U. Because of this characteristic, B deposited {{onto the surface of}} the secondary stage would prevent predetonation of the <b>sparkplug</b> by stray neutrons from the primary without interfering with the subsequent fissioning of the U of the fusion tamper wrapping the secondary. Boron also played a role in increasing the compressive plasma pressure around the secondary by blocking the sputtering effect, leading to higher thermonuclear efficiency. Because the structural foam holding the secondary in place within the casing was doped with B, the secondary was compressed more highly, at a cost of some radiated neutrons. An example of the usefulness of B can be seen {{by the fact that the}} fizzled Castle Koon MORGENSTERN device didn't use it in its design. As a result, the intense neutron flux from its RACER IV primary pre-detonated the spherical fission <b>sparkplug,</b> which in turn [...] "cooked" [...] the fusion fuel, leading to an overall poor compression. It should be noted, that the plastic's low molecular weight is unable to implode the secondary's mass. Its plasma-pressure is confined in the boiled-off sections of the tamper and the radiation case so that material from neither of these two walls can enter the radiation channel that has to be open for the radiation transit.|$|E
25|$|On 4 June 1949 (three {{days prior}} to the accident), the Strato Freight C-46 arrived in San Juan from Newark, New Jersey, US.

2500|$|According to Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard, Powellism {{was seen}} as a proper step toward free markets in the early 1970s, writing [...] "There is only {{political}} strategy that carries hope for Britain in the foreseeable future: that of the dissident stormy petrel of British politics, Enoch Powell. Decades of horrific British policies have created a rigid, stratified, and cartellized economy, a set of frozen power blocs integrated with Big Government: namely, Big Business and Big Labor. Even the most cautious and gradualist of English libertarians now admit that only a radical political change can save England. Enoch Powell is the only man on the horizon who could be the <b>sparkplug</b> for such a change. It is true, of course, that for libertarians Enoch Powell has many deficiencies. For one thing he is an admitted High Tory who believes in the divine right of kings; for another, his immigration policy is the reverse of libertarian. But on the critical issues in these parlous times: on checking the inflationary rise in the money supply, and on scuttling the disastrous price and wage controls, Powell is by far the soundest politician in Britain. A sweep of Enoch Powell into power would hardly be ideal, but it offers the best existing hope for British freedom and survival." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{space between}} the uranium fusion tamper (also termed pusher; both terms can be used interchangeably) which is the metal {{cladding}} encasing the secondary and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It {{is one of the}} most closely guarded secrets of a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary’s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the channel filler – an optical element used as a refractive medium, also called random-phase plate. This [...] "plate" [...] was a polystyrene plastic foam filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-Z plasma from the X-rays and tamped (not to be confused with the fusion tamper) the sputtering effect that choked the radiation from compressing the secondary. Sputtering is the manifestation of the underdense plasma corona of the ablating hohlraum and the tamper surfaces. It is a problem, also shared by magnetically confined fusion reactors (see Tokamak), that has to do with the ablated particles, the blown-off uranium (or Pb–Bi alloy, depending on the [...] "cocktail", or high-Z element mixture, of the hohlraum design to tailor its opacity), which fly inside the radiation channel and absorb radiation or reflect it, contributing negatively to the radiation mirroring (also termed [...] "ducting" [...] in the TN jargon). The re-emitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary’s tamper and ablate it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction. (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity. After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this radiative equilibrium must be reached together with the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the <b>sparkplug</b> (see below), hence their name equilibrium supers.|$|E

5000|$|Dual {{ignition}} promotes {{engine efficiency}} by initiating twin flame fronts, giving {{faster and more}} complete burning and thereby increasing power. Although a dual ignition system is a method of achieving optimum combustion and better fuel consumption, it remains rare in cars and motorcycles because of difficulties in siting the second plug within the cylinder head. The Nash Ambassador for 1932-1948 used twin <b>sparkplugs</b> on the straight eight engine, while later Alfa Romeo Twin Spark cars use dual ignition, as do Honda cars with the i-DSI series engines, and Chrysler's Modern Hemi engine. In 1980 Nissan installed twin <b>sparkplugs</b> on the Nissan NAPS-Z engine, with Ford introducing it on the 1989 Ford Ranger and 1991 Ford Mustang four-cylinder models. Several modern Mercedes-Benz engines also have two spark plugs per cylinder, such as the M112 and M113 engines. Some motorcycles, such as the Honda VT500 and the Ducati Multistrada, also have dual ignition. The 2012 Ducati Multistrada was upgraded with [...] "twin-plug cylinder heads for smoother, more efficient combustion", the change contributing to a 5% increase in torque and a 10% improvement in fuel consumption.|$|R
