Though <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> tone, The Smoking Mirror incorporates some humour and graphics animated {{in the style}} of classic animated films. It was the fourth and last game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which was used to render the locations of the game's events.|$|E
5|$|The {{many forms}} of dance provide {{entertainment}} for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> tone, such as when {{it is used to}} express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides {{a good example of the}} various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E
50|$|What is {{considered}} serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in sociology, cultural anthropology, and criminology; {{being of the}} wrong religious faith may be considered a <b>serious</b> crime <b>in</b> some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a <b>serious</b> crime <b>in</b> some cultures and not others; homosexuality a <b>serious</b> crime <b>in</b> some cultures; and prostitution is a <b>serious</b> crime <b>in</b> some cultures. Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.|$|R

25|$|The Serious {{show has}} had a {{remarkable}} record for winning awards, {{with each of the}} first seven series gaining honours and total awards into double figures. The show has won four BAFTA children's awards in the Factual category: for <b>Serious</b> Desert <b>in</b> the 2004 nominations, for <b>Serious</b> Arctic <b>in</b> the 2005 nominations, for <b>Serious</b> Andes <b>in</b> 2008 and for <b>Serious</b> Ocean <b>in</b> 2010. <b>Serious</b> Amazon was also nominated in 2006 for the same category.

5|$|Tolkien {{at first}} {{intended}} The Lord of the Rings to be a children's tale {{in the style}} of The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> the writing. Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> sick or malnourished specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{as in the}} UK, the Hicklin test of {{obscenity}} applied, but New York {{case law}} had established that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than on children and that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, Ellen Glasgow and John Dos Passos. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his brief. His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E

5|$|It {{became known}} on 4 September 2015 that ISIL had {{destroyed}} {{three of the}} best preserved tower tombs including the Tower of Elahbel. On 5 October 2015, news media reported ISIL is destroying buildings with no religious meaning, including the Arch of Triumph. On 20 January 2017, news emerged that the militants destroyed the tetrapylon {{and part of the}} theater. Following the March 2017 capture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army, Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture, stated that the damage to ancient monuments may be lesser than earlier believed and preliminary pictures showed almost no further damage than what was already known. Antiquities official Wael Hafyan stated that the Tetrapylon was badly damaged while the damage to the facade of the Roman theatre was less <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> relativity.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E
25|$|After living {{briefly in}} Italy (1844), Dickens {{travelled}} to Switzerland (1846), where he {{began work on}} Dombey and Son (1846–48).

25|$|In {{terms of}} tone and style, Reformation propaganda, while {{sometimes}} <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> tone, was often satirical, featuring word-play and sarcasm. In this it developed earlier medieval traditions of religious satire. One {{example of this}} would be Martin Luther's commentary on the Life of John Chrysostom in his Die Lügend von S. Johanne Chrysostomo.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} {{literature suggests that}} <b>serious</b> engagement <b>in</b> leisure activities leads to happiness, life satisfaction, and successful aging among older adults. This qualitative study {{was used to examine}} the benefits of <b>serious</b> involvement <b>in</b> leisure activities among older Korean adults who were members of a sports club. Using an analytic data analysis, we identified three main themes associated with the benefits of <b>serious</b> engagement <b>in</b> leisure activities: 1) the experience of psychological benefits, 2) the creation of social support, and 3) the enhancement of physical health. These themes indicate that, through <b>serious</b> involvement <b>in</b> certain physical activities, participants gain various health benefits, which may contribute to successful aging...|$|R

25|$|Hydrological {{resources}} (see Geography above) {{are also}} lacking: {{the demand for}} water exceeds the supply, with this imbalance especially <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> Alicante province.

Valencia's water needs result in harsh contention with neighbouring regions such as Castilla–La Mancha and Catalonia.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Roman imperial decline seemed less <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the Crisis of the Third Century. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.|$|E
25|$|The first filmed {{pilot was}} {{produced}} in April 1991, with Frances Fisher playing Jill Taylor. Fisher, primarily known as a dramatic actress, was well qualified for the co-starring role but was viewed by the studio audience as not being comedic enough, and too <b>serious</b> <b>in</b> her line delivery. The producers tried to work with Fisher on adapting to the situation comedy setting, but shortly after the pilot wrapped post-production, they decided to recast her.|$|E
