40|$|Polysiloxanes, {{which can}} add high {{softness}} and lubricity to treated textiles, {{have been proposed}} as <b>softening</b> post-finishing agents <b>for</b> <b>fabric.</b> However, the hydrophobicity of the finished fabric is not satisfactory. In this work, long-chain fluoroalkyl acrylate was used to modify the polysiloxane, aimed at improving hydrophobicity of the finished fabric and retaining its softness simultaneously. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1 H/ 13 C NMR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the chemical structure and thermal stability of the as-prepared polymer. The modified polysiloxane was tested as a finishing agent. Its film morphologies on the fabric surface and on a silicon wafer were determined. Chemical compositions and performance properties of the finished fabric were investigated. By bonding long-chain fluoroalkyl, the modified polysiloxane presented good thermal stability. Due to the combined effect of the low surface free energy of the perfluorinated side chains and the relatively high surface roughness of the cotton fibers, the treated fabric had favorable hydrophobicity with a WCA of 144. 7 ° on its surface. In addition, their softness was increased, but the color remained unchanged...|$|R
