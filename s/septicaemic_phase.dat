40|$|Thirty-six {{patients}} with coliform meningitis in the 15 -year period 1960 - 1974 are reported. Only 9 patients survived unscathed though the other 5 survivors were not seriously affected. During the <b>septicaemic</b> <b>phase</b> {{of the illness}} the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), though positive on culture, may be otherwise normal. Meningitis can ensue even when the patient is receiving antibiotics to which the organism is sensitive and the possible disadvantages of using a nondiffusible antibiotic must be appreciated. The CSF in Esch. coli meningitis can be persistently haemorrhagic which may cause difficulties in the initial diagnosis. It must be emphasized that infective illness in the newborn is often nonspecific in its presentation and that repeated bacteriological investigations are essential in neonates who are unwell...|$|E
40|$|Guinea-pigs were {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} L. interrogans serovar copenhageni serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and their {{liver and kidney}} were studied by immunoelectron microscopy using the post embedding indirect immunogold labelling technique. Primary antibody was a purified rabbit anti-serum produced against the same leptospiral strain used in the inoculum. Gold-labelled leptospiral antigen (LAg) was found close to cell membranes of hepatocytes, kidney tubular cells and endothelial cells of the interstitial capillaries of the kidney. Afterwards it was internalized by hepatic and tubular cells, and eventually found in lysosomes. Phagolysosomes of Kupffer cells were also found to contain remnants of degraded leptospires and gold-labelled LAg. Gold-labelled intact leptospires were detected at the enlarged intercellular spaces between hepatocytes at the areas of hepatic cell plate disarray, showing the potential for leptospiral migration during the <b>septicaemic</b> <b>phase</b> of the disease potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of the lesions. The affinity of leptospiral antigenic material for cell membranes suggests an initial interaction with cell surface proteins followed by its internalization and cell damage. The nature of antigenic material detected, however, remains undefined; {{it may be a}} toxin, an enzyme or any other factor/s involved in leptospiral virulence...|$|E
