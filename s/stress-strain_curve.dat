The tangent is equal to the elastic modulus and then decreases beyond the proportional limit. The tangent modulus is a line drawn tangent to the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curve</b> at a particular value of strain (in the elastic section of the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curve,</b> the tangent modulus is equal to the elastic modulus).

25|$|Most silks, in {{particular}} dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of {{high tensile strength}} and extensibility (ductility).

25|$|When a {{yield point}} is not easily defined based on {{the shape of the}} <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curve</b> an offset yield point is {{arbitrarily}} defined. The value for this is commonly set at 0.1 or 0.2% plastic strain. The offset value is given as a subscript, e.g., Rp0.2=310 MPa. High strength steel and aluminum alloys do not exhibit a yield point, so this offset yield point is used on these materials.|$|E
25|$|Young's modulus quantifies the {{elasticity}} of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as {{the ratio of}} rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curve</b> when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{localized}} deformation {{behavior of}} annealed Al and Al severely deformed by ECAE process {{was determined by}} using microindentation test. Using the method proposed by Tabor, the indentation <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curves</b> of annealed Al and as-ECAE deformed Al were constructed, which display similar work-hardening behavior. For annealed Al, the altitude of the indentation <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curves</b> {{is a function of}} the indenter size. A master curve then is constructed, which displays different work-hardening behavior. For the ECAE deformed Al, the indentation <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curves</b> are independent of the indenter size, suggesting that the microstructure inside the as-ECAE deformed Al is different from the annealed Al...|$|R
25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curve</b> is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|The shear {{strength}} and stiffness of soil determines {{whether or not}} soil will be stable or {{how much it will}} deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary to determine if a slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall); some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the structure. Different criteria can be used to define the [...] "{{shear strength}}" [...] and the [...] "yield point" [...] for a soil element from a <b>stress–strain</b> <b>curve.</b> One may define the peak shear strength as the peak of a <b>stress–strain</b> <b>curve,</b> or the shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the shear resistance levels off. If the <b>stress–strain</b> <b>curve</b> does not stabilize before the end of shear strength test, the [...] "strength" [...] is sometimes considered to be the shear resistance at 15–20% strain. The shear strength of soil depends on many factors including the effective stress and the void ratio.|$|E
40|$|Modifying <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curves</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} topics in mechanical engineering and materials science. Real <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curves</b> should be modified after necking point as stress becomes three-dimensional after creation of throat, and consequently, equivalent stress should be used instead of axial one. Also, distribution of triple stresses across throat section is not uniform anymore, and {{it is not possible to}} calculate the stress through dividing force value by surface area. Methods presented to modify these curves mainly have some defects which enter the error resulting from simplifying assumptions into the results. Entrance of stress analysis softwares into mechanical engineering has caused use of finite elements methods in order to modify <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curves.</b> As you know, being as an input for stress analysis software, as one of the applications of these curves, has a direct effect on simulation results. Optimization methods have been developed and extended in engineering sciences. Modifying <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curves</b> may be an application of these methods.

2500|$|A solid {{material}} will deform when a load {{is applied to}} it. If it returns to its original shape after the load is removed, this is called elastic deformation. In the range where the ratio between load and deformation remains constant, the <b>stress-strain</b> <b>curve</b> is linear. [...] Not many materials are linear and elastic beyond {{a small amount of}} deformation. A stiff material needs more force to deform compared to a soft material, and an infinite force would be needed to deform a perfectly rigid material, implying that it would have an infinite Young's modulus. Although such a material cannot exist, a material with a very high Young's modulus can be approximated as rigid.|$|E
