5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
5|$|The {{northeast}} monsoon, {{which begins}} in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds {{that have already}} lost their moisture out to the ocean (opposite from the <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon).</b> They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods. However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Buses, {{which are}} the most {{commonly}} used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon,</b> can interrupt transportation networks. Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are also in service. In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about normal mode {{analysis}} on multi-scale characteristics of Asian <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons.</b> In this study {{a new concept}} of utilizing generalized normal mode initialization (NMI) is introduced for climatic analysis and diagnosis. For the actual constitution of normal modes (NMs) in this study, a two layer shallow water model was selected. We used the 17 year-atmospheric data to construct the basic state with the summer mean over those 17 years and to define the actual anomalies of the special summers relative to the climatic mean. The highlight in this study about normal mode analysis of Asian <b>Summer</b> <b>Monsoons</b> {{is that for the}} first time the following were considered with the instability of the 3 -D basic state: 1) the nonlinear dynamic balancing of NMI, 2) the effects of hard orography (not only quasi-linear effects of vorticity and divergence), 3) actual anomalies of special episodes relative to a climatic mean and 4) the normal mode group with a specific range of oscillation frequencies. The NMs and NMI were conducted in two experiment-groups: 1) impacts of SST-anomalies with ENSO on Asian <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons</b> and 2) interannual variability of Meiyu and connections to multi-scale oscillations of Asian <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons</b> and yielded the interesting conclusions on Asian monsoon climate. The important insight from this thesis is that MNs and NMI, which have been used in the numerical weather forecast, were successfully applied in climatic analysis of Asian <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons.</b> Compared with the other methods, NMs and NMI have two advantages: 1) the atmospheric circulation structures in different time scales can be identified with normal mode groups giving distinctive signals, and 2) the impacts of various physical processes on the atmospheric circulation or climate change can be detected from the complement of the actual atmosphere to the model solution...|$|R
5|$|The {{southwest}} <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon,</b> {{a four-month}} period when massive convective thunderstorms dominate India's weather, is Earth's most productive wet season. A product of southeast trade winds originating from a high-pressure mass centred over the southern Indian Ocean, the monsoonal torrents supply over 80% of India's annual rainfall. Attracted by a low-pressure region centred over South Asia, the mass spawns surface winds that ferry humid air into India from the southwest. These inflows ultimately {{result from a}} northward shift of the local jet stream, which itself results from rising summer temperatures over Tibet and the Indian subcontinent. The void left by the jet stream, which switches from a route {{just south of the}} Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet, then attracts warm, humid air.|$|E
5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E
25|$|In Nepal, rice (Nepali: धान, Dhaan) {{is grown}} in the Terai and hilly regions. It is mainly grown during the <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> in Nepal.|$|E
50|$|The Arizona Upland {{receives}} between 12 and 15 {{inches of}} annual precipitation, of which half {{falls in the}} <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons.</b> Cold air collects in the valleys. Less cold tolerant species grow on the warmer slopes above.|$|R
50|$|By early autumn, the North Pacific high {{pressure}} system is pushed away as Asiatic continental cold {{high pressure}} moves southwards. This produces inclement weather although {{not on the}} scale of the <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons.</b> Korea can, however, be struck by typhoons during this period.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{plant species}} are pinyon pines and junipers. Wildflower growth is highly variable each year, depending on precipitation levels, with April and May generally {{being the best}} months to see blooms, and early fall also good in years with many <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons.</b>|$|R
25|$|As Nepal builds barrages {{to divert}} more water for {{irrigation}} {{during the dry}} season preceding the <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon,</b> there is less for downstream users in Bangladesh and India's Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states. The best solution could be building large upstream reservoirs, to capture and store surplus flows during <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> as well as providing flood control benefits to Bangladesh and India. Then water sharing agreements could allocate a portion of the stored water to be left to flow into India during the following dry season.|$|E
25|$|Cedars are {{adapted to}} mountainous climates; in the Mediterranean, they receive winter precipitation, mainly as snow, and summer drought, {{while in the}} western Himalaya, they receive {{primarily}} <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> rainfall.|$|E
25|$|The {{path of the}} antumbra over highly {{populated}} areas allowed at least an estimated 100 million people to view annularity. Because it took place during Southeast Asia's <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> season, viewing conditions were not ideal in some areas, including Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|The town {{experiences}} mainly {{three seasons}} as <b>summer,</b> <b>monsoons</b> and winter. <b>Summers</b> are quite hot with temperatures ranging in the mid-thirties (Celsius). The highest recorded temperature in Apra is 40 degree Celsius and winters are quite severe and chilly, {{with the cold}} winds.|$|R
50|$|It is drought {{tolerant}} and very fast growing after rains. It typically undergoes 2 major growth periods, one after winter rains, the other after <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons.</b> It {{is reported to}} be more effective than many other desert plants at extracting water from the soil during dry periods.|$|R
50|$|Subtropical, {{dry climate}} with {{distinct}} winter, <b>summer</b> and <b>monsoon.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{period between}} August–September is the late {{phase of the}} <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon.</b> During this period, the Great Whirl almost forms a closed circulation, and strong {{upwelling}} streams (colder than 17°C, typical upwelling water temperature ~ 19-23°C) develop near the Northern Somali coast.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> recedes (Oct-Nov): During this period, the {{southwest}} monsoon winds continually weaken, so the Northward Somali Current (extension {{flow of the}} EACC) no longer crosses the equator, turning instead to the east at around 3°N. However, the Great Whirl still remains.|$|E
25|$|Nepal {{experiences}} five seasons: <b>summer,</b> <b>monsoon,</b> autumn, {{winter and}} spring. The Himalaya blocks cold winds from Central Asia {{in the winter}} and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns. In a land once thickly forested, deforestation is a major problem in all regions, with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} time span, {{a major part of}} the {{zooplankton}} sampling was carried out from January to September 2008. We begin the analysis of seasonal changes from the Winter North-east Monsoon, through the Spring Inter-monsoon and finally, to the <b>Summer</b> South-west <b>Monsoon</b> period. During winter and <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons,</b> the prevailing wind direction is parallel to the coast, but it has opposite directions (Böhm et al. 1999). This does not allow a coastal current (the East Arabian Current) to set up upwelling during winter, but maximizes the offshore Ekman transport and thus the upwelling intensity during the summer.|$|R
50|$|The Guadalupe Mountains {{experience}} relatively hot summers, calm, mild autumn weather, {{and cool}} to cold weather {{in winter and}} early spring. Snow storms, freezing rain, or fog may occur in winter or early spring. Frequent high wind warnings are issued during winter through spring. Late <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons</b> produce thunderstorms. Nights are cool, even in summer.|$|R
50|$|Deeba Danda {{experiences}} a subtropical highland climate just like other Himalayan and Sub-Himalayan regions. It has a pleasant & cool climate in <b>Summers.</b> <b>Monsoon</b> brings heavy rains {{and with it}} comes lush greenery. It gets very cold in winters, heavy snowfall is common. The region receives bright sunshine during winter since the skies are crystal clear in winter.|$|R
25|$|The climate varies {{considerably}} {{between the}} northern and southern extents of this long mountain range. Seasonal variations also occur due to the presence of large bodies of warm water delivering warm damp air from each side of the range. This region undergoes a seasonal variety with two wet seasons, including a <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon,</b> and two dry seasons each year.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{the cold}} weather killed trees, rice crops, and even water buffalo, {{especially}} in the north. Floods destroyed many remaining crops. The monsoon season was disrupted, resulting in overwhelming floods in the Yangtze Valley. In India, the delayed <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon</b> caused late torrential rains that aggravated the spread of cholera from a region near the Ganges in Bengal to as far as Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} two months of the airlift the AAF {{delivered}} only 700 tons of cargo and CNAC only 112 tons, and tonnage fell for both June and July, mostly {{as a result of the}} full onset of the <b>summer</b> <b>monsoon.</b> In July, CNAC quadrupled its tonnage to 221 tons, but 10AF C-47s brought only 85 net tons of materiel and personnel into China.|$|E
50|$|The Guadalupe Mountains {{experience}} relatively hot summers, calm, mild autumn weather, {{and cool}} to cold weather {{in winter and}} early spring.

50|$|Most <b>summer</b> <b>monsoons</b> have a {{dominant}} westerly component {{and a strong}} tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air).
