50|$|<b>Superinsulation</b> is an {{approach}} to building design, construction, and retrofitting that dramatically reduces heat loss (and gain) by using much higher levels of insulation and airtightness than normal. <b>Superinsulation</b> {{is one of the}} ancestors of the passive house approach.|$|E
40|$|Evacuated panel <b>superinsulations</b> {{with very}} high center-of-panel thermal {{resistances}} {{are being developed}} for use in refrigerators/freezers. Attainment of high resistances relies upon the maintenance of low vacuum levels {{by the use of}} stainless steel vacuum jackets. However, the metal jackets also present a path for heat conduction around the high resistance fillers. This paper presents results of a study of the impact of metal vacuum jackets on the overall thermal performance of vacuum <b>superinsulations</b> when incorporated into the walls and doors of refrigerators/freezers. Results are presented on measurements of the thermophysical properties of several types and thicknesses of stainless steel foils that were being considered for application in <b>superinsulations.</b> A direct electrical heating method was used for simultaneous measurements of the electrical resistivity, total hemispherical emittance, and thermal conductivity of the foils. Results are also presented on simulations of the energy usage of refrigerators/freezers containing stainless-steel-clad vacuum <b>superinsulations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The results {{presented}} here were obtained during Phase 4 {{of the first}} CRADA, which had the specific objective of determining the lifetime of <b>superinsulations</b> when installed in simulated refrigerator doors. The second CRADA was established to evaluate and test design concepts proposed to significantly reduce energy consumption in a refrigerator-freezer that is representative of approximately 60 % of the US market. The stated goal of this CRADA is to demonstrate advanced technologies which reduce, by 50 %, the 1993 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) standard energy consumption for a 20 ft{sup 3 } (570 L) top-mount, automatic-defrost, refrigerator-freezer. For a unit this size, the goal translates to an energy consumption of 1. 003 kWh/d. The general objective of the research is to facilitate the introduction of efficient appliances by demonstrating design changes that can be effectively incorporated into new products. In previous work on this project, a Phase 1 prototype refrigerator-freezer achieved an energy consumption of 1. 413 kWh/d [Vineyard, et al., 1995].

30|$|The {{cryostat}} and the SQUID microscope {{were described}} in detail by Kawai et al. (2016). In order to simplify the structure and reduce the work for operations, we designed the cryostat without liquid N 2 reservoir. Alternatively, we designed the cryostat with low boil-off rate of liquid helium without liquid nitrogen, optimizing the thermal shield configuration including <b>superinsulations.</b> The exterior of the cryostat is aluminum, except for the bottom flange, which is glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP). The cylindrical 10 -L liquid He reservoir is made of GFRP and has a hollow center. A rigid GFRP shaft that passes through the hollow center directly connects a micrometer spindle attached to the top flange of the cryostat to a copper rod placed beneath the He reservoir via thermal anchors. Instead, Fong et al. (2005) used a lever mechanism for sensor-to-sample distance adjustment, which is manipulated from outside of the cryostat. A SQUID chip is mounted on the conical top of a sapphire rod, which is tightly connected to the copper rod. By rotating the micrometer spindle, the copper rod and the SQUID chip {{move up and down}} in the range of ~ 1  mm with an accuracy of ~ 5  μm. The SQUID chip was electrically connected to silver-based thin-film electrodes using silver paste. In order to achieve the minimum sensor-to-sample distance, it is important to minimize the height of silver paste mound. On the other hand, Fong et al. (2005) glued SQUID chip on the sapphire rod, grinded and polished the edges, deposited silver pads to the sides, then gold wires were attached to the silver pads on the sides. Our method allows to change SQUID chip for the maintenance easily in case of SQUID malfunction, etc.|$|R

50|$|Both {{superconductivity}} and <b>superinsulation</b> {{are caused}} by the pairing of conduction electrons at low temperatures into Cooper pairs. In superconductors, all the pairs move in unison, allowing current without resistance. In superinsulators the Cooper pairs avoid each other, preventing current from flowing. A phase diagram showing parallels with superconductivity is here.|$|E
50|$|Passivhaus {{buildings}} employ <b>superinsulation</b> {{to significantly}} reduce the heat transfer through the walls, roof and floor compared to conventional buildings. A wide range of thermal insulation materials {{can be used to}} provide the required high R-values (low U-values, typically in the 0.10 to 0.15 W/(m²·K) range). Special attention is given to eliminating thermal bridges.|$|E
50|$|While some {{techniques}} and technologies were specifically {{developed for the}} Passive House standard, others, such as <b>superinsulation,</b> already existed, {{and the concept of}} passive solar building design dates back to antiquity.

Further improvements can be realised in many ways, [...] including electric heating, thermal battery, chemical reaction preheating, flame heating and <b>superinsulation.</b>|$|E

Recognized as being ahead of its time, the house continues to be published today. His Hooker Office Building (1978) with its double glass walls with insulated aluminum louvers between them, has become the prototype for numerous energy conserving commercial buildings in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Buildings {{designed}} with sustainable architecture principles use airtight technologies to conserve energy. Under low energy building, passive house, low-energy house, self-sufficient homes, zero energy building, and <b>superinsulation</b> standards, structures {{must be more}} air-tight than previously. Air barriers, careful sealing of construction joints and service penetrations (holes for pipes, etc.) achieve this. Airtightness minimizes the amount of warm (or cool) air that can pass through the structure, so the mechanical ventilation system can recover the heat before discharging air externally. Green buildings may include windows that combine triple-pane insulated glazing with argon or krypton gas to reduce thermal conductivity and increase efficiency. In landscape and exterior construction projects, airtight seals protect general service and landscape lighting electrical connections and splices. Many other specific applications must meet airtight standards to be waterproof or vapor-proof for human safety and proper function.|$|E

50|$|In new construction, {{the cost}} of the extra {{insulation}} and wall framing may be offset by not requiring a dedicated central heating system. In homes with numerous rooms, more than one floor, air conditioning or large sized, a central furnace is often justified or required to ensure sufficiently uniform temperatures. Small furnaces are not very expensive and some ductwork to every room is almost always required to provide ventilation air in any case. When peak demand and annual energy use is low, sophisticated and expensive central heating systems are not often required. Hence, even electric resistance heaters may be used. Electric heaters are typically only used on the coldest winter nights when overall demand for electricity is low. Other forms of backup heater are widely used, such as wood pellets, wood stoves, natural gas boilers or even furnaces. The cost of a <b>superinsulation</b> retrofit should be balanced against the future cost of heating fuel (which can be expected to fluctuate from year to year due to supply problems, natural disasters or geopolitical events), the desire to reduce pollution from heating a building, or the desire to provide exceptional thermal comfort.|$|E
50|$|It is possible, and {{increasingly}} desirable, to retrofit <b>superinsulation</b> to an existing houses or buildings. The easiest way is often to add layers of continuous rigid exterior insulation, and sometimes by building new exterior walls that allow more space for insulation. A vapor barrier {{can be installed}} {{on the outside of}} the original framing but may not be needed. An improved continuous air barrier is almost always worth adding, as older homes tend to be leaky, and such an air barrier can be important for energy savings and durability. Care should be exercised when adding a vapor barrier as it can reduce drying of incidental moisture, or even cause summer (in climates with humid summers) interstitial condensation and consequent mold and mildew. This may cause health problems for the occupants and damage the existing structure. Many builders in northern Canada use a simple 1/3 to 2/3 approach, placing the vapor barrier no further out than 1/3 of the R-value of the insulated portion of the wall. This method is generally valid for interior walls that have little or no vapor resistance (e.g. they use fibrous insulation) and controls air leakage condensation as well as vapor diffusion condensation. This approach will ensure that condensation does not occur on or to the inside of the vapor barrier during cold weather. The 1/3:2/3 rule will ensure that the vapor barrier temperature will not fall below the dew point temperature of the interior air, and will minimize the possibility of cold-weather condensation problems. For example, with an internal room temperature of 20°C (68°F), the vapor barrier will then only reach 7.3 °C (45 °F) when the outside temperatures is at −18°C (-1°F). Indoor air dewpoint temperatures are more likely to be in the order of around 0 °C (32 °F) when it is that cold outdoors, much lower than the predicted vapor barrier temperature, and hence the 1/3:2/3 rules is quite conservative. For climates that do not often experience -18°C, the 1/3:2/3 rule should be amended to 40:60% or 50:50. As the interior air dewpoint temperature is an important basis for such rules, buildings with high interior humidities during cold weather (e.g., museums, swimming pools, humdified or poorly ventilated airtight homes) may require different rules, as can buildings with drier interior environments (such as highly ventilated buildings, warehouses). The 2009 International Residential Code (IRC) embodies more sophisticated rules to guide the choice of insulation on the exterior of new homes, which can be applied when retrofitting older homes.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} CRADA was to {{determine}} the thermal performance of various metal claddings used to encapsulate Filled Evacuated Panel (FEP) <b>superinsulation</b> and to optimize the cost versus thermal performance of the claddings. A FEP <b>superinsulation</b> is a new type of <b>superinsulation</b> with the potential for saving large amounts of energy in buildings, building equipment, transportation (refrigerated railcars and trucks), industrial applications, etc. The major disadvantage of metal claddings for FEPs is the heat loss through the cladding caused by the high thermal conductivity of most metals. In smaller FEPs, this heat loss can degrade the overall performance of the FEP by factors of two or more as compared with polymer-clad FEPs. On the other hand, metal claddings are essentially impermeable to ambient air, whereas polymer claddings are not. Thus, the longevity and reliability of metal-clad FEPs are much superior to polymer-clad FEPs. In addition, because of the very low vapor pressure of metals as compared to polymers, metal-clad FEPs can achieve and operate at lower internal pressures.
