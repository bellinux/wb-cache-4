An intricate 800-tile mosaic, {{set in a}} three-metre raised circle, was created by local artist John Todd to illustrate her life and interests. The mosaic has her portrait as the centrepiece, surrounded by images including the beach where <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> walk, racehorses at Redcar Racecourse (where she celebrated her wedding), the Redcar steelworks, the Zetland Lifeboat, clasped hands and doves (to symbolise the Northern Ireland peace process) and the Houses of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Coleman {{was born}} on January 26, 1892, in Atlanta, Texas, the tenth of {{thirteen}} children to sharecroppers George Coleman, who was mostly Cherokee and part African-American, and Susan, who was African-American. When Coleman was two years old, her family moved to Waxahachie, Texas, where she lived until age 23. Coleman began attending school in Waxahachie {{at the age of}} six. She had to walk four miles each day to her segregated, one-room school, where <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> read and established herself as an outstanding math student. She completed all eight grades in that school. Every year, Coleman's routine of school, chores, and church was interrupted by the cotton harvest. In 1901, George Coleman left his family. He returned to Oklahoma, or Indian Territory, as it was then called, to find better opportunities; but Susan and her family did not go along. At the age of 12, Bessie was accepted into the Missionary Baptist Church School on scholarship. When she turned eighteen, she took her savings and enrolled in the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University (now called Langston University) in Langston, Oklahoma. She completed one term before her money ran out and she returned home.|$|E

25|$|Grand Duchess Anastasia {{brought up}} her {{children}} with simplicity and more freedom than she received from her parents, and would {{keep a close}} relationship with them. She spoke French to her husband and English with her children. She was a keen tennis player, with her own tennis court at the Villa Wenden. She loved Italian music, particularly the operas of Puccini, and the theater. Her extant letters reveal a warm, caring person, who always seems to have been happy about life. She frequented many other European royals who stayed at the Riviera; her parents and brothers were also frequent visitors. Her mother {{died of a heart attack}} in 1891, and Anastasia remained very close to her widower father and her brothers, particularly the two eldest Nicholas and Michael. Anastasia spent lavishly from the Grand Duke's income and her own dowry, for which she was widely criticized, but <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> shock people who condemned her. She liked society and became a frequent visitor to the gambling tables of Monte Carlo, losing a large sum of money at the casino; but in spite of her extravagances, she never lost her husband's affection.|$|E
500|$|Emmy Noether {{was born}} on 23 March 1882, {{the first of four}} children. Her first name was [...] "Amalie", after her mother and {{paternal}} grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age. As a girl, Noether was well liked. She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age. She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> dance.|$|E
500|$|A {{meeting was}} {{arranged}} for the following day; Caroline went to a secluded room, where Leopold arrived with two aides. As Leopold II was unknown to her, Caroline was so flustered with the encounter that she mixed up Belgium and Sweden in the king's presence, referring to him as His Majesty Oscar, to his surprise and amusement. The two aides' purpose soon became clear: one sat {{on each side of}} her and began asking questions that required her to [...] "turn my head first to the right, then to the left ... their only aim, as I learned later, being to show off my two profiles to the mute personage", according to her memoirs. Leopold confessed himself pleased and invited Caroline to Austria with him; a large sum of money duly arrived the next day, along with some empty trunks, as Leopold was aware that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> buy clothes.|$|E

2500|$|Fannye Rose Shore {{was born}} to Russian-Jewish {{immigrant}} shopkeepers, Anna (née Stein) and Solomon Shore, in Winchester, Tennessee. She had an elder sister, eight years her senior, Elizabeth, known as [...] "Bessie". When Fannye was two years old, she was stricken with polio (infantile paralysis), a disease that was not preventable at the time, and for which the only treatment was bed rest. Her parents provided intensive care for her, suggesting rigorous exercising. She recovered, but she sustained a deformed foot and limp. <b>She</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> sing as a small child; her mother, a contralto with operatic aspirations, encouraged her.

2500|$|She {{moved in}} early life to Arkansas When {{she was a}} young child, she delighted in oratory, in {{climbing}} some hill and imitating speakers she had heard, in either prose or verse; and when not roaming, <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> fly a kite and to shoot a bow and arrow. From these early years she was a poet; and the study of astronomy and natural philosophy dispelled so many fond illusions concerning the mystery of the clouds, that she almost regretted knowledge. Her early education was varied, and her country life made her familiar with nature. From reading poetry, she early began to make it. Her father died while she was in college, her education occurred at Forest Hill Seminary, near Memphis, Tennessee. It was here, after her father's death, that her poetry first attracted public attention. Not returning to school after the father's death, she started writing her first verses, the subject being [...] "Night." [...] She was 16 years old when her first poem was published.|$|E
2500|$|Yerkes mostly painted en plein-air but {{she also}} worked {{at home in a}} studio. Numerous {{photographs}} were taken by her on each trip to be used as reference later. Archie died in 1945 and Yerkes’ painting efforts took a pause. They resumed in the 1950s with encouragement from her second partner, Albert Cobb, although she did not remarry. Yerkes continued to camp and paint the American West well into the 1970s and into her nineties. She also hooked pictorial rugs, wove fabric for her own clothes and accessories, and carved furniture in the same Southwestern and natural motifs <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> paint. She died in San Mateo on November 8, 1989, at the age of 103. [...] After decades of painting, over [...] of her paintings adorned her own walls {{at the time of her}} death. The art world knows her as [...] "Mary Agnes" [...] Yerkes but she, as well as her family members, used [...] "Agnes".|$|E
2500|$|Although her {{difficulties}} with the English language persisted, {{as time went}} on, the once rigidly formal Portuguese Infanta mellowed and began to enjoy {{some of the more}} innocent pleasures of the court. <b>She</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> play cards and shocked devout Protestants by playing on Sundays. She enjoyed dancing and took great delight in organising masques. She had a great love for the countryside and picnics; fishing and archery were also favourite pastimes. In a far cry from her convent-days the newly liberated Catherine displayed a fondness for the recent trend of court ladies wearing men's clothing, which we are told, [...] "showed off her pretty, neat legs and ankles"; and she was even reported to have considered leading the way in wearing shorter dresses, which would show off her feet. In 1670, on a trip to Audley End with her ladies-in-waiting, the once chronically shy Catherine attended a country fair disguised as a village maiden, but was soon discovered and, due to the large crowds, forced to make a hasty retreat. And when in 1664 her favourite painter, Jacob Huysmans, a Flemish Catholic, painted her as St Catherine, it promptly set a trend among court ladies.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{was four}} (or five) {{years old when}} her mother Charity died (at the age of 25), leaving her family to decide who would raise Halie and her brother. [...] Aunt Duke assumed this responsibility, and the {{children}} were forced to work from sun-up to sun-down. [...] Aunt Duke would always inspect the house using the [...] "white glove" [...] method. If the house was not cleaned properly, Jackson was beaten. If one of the other relatives could not do their chores or clean at their job, Jackson or one of her cousins was expected to perform that particular task. School was hardly an option. [...] Jackson loved to sing and church is where <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> sing the most. [...] Her Aunt Bell told her that one day she would sing in front of royalty, a prediction that would eventually come true. Jackson began her singing career at the local Mount Moriah Baptist Church. [...] At 12 years old, she was baptized in the Mississippi River by Mt. Moriah's pastor, the Rev. E.D. Lawrence, then went back to the church to [...] "receive the right hand of fellowship".|$|E

[...] She was born a free person of color either in 1830 or 1831 and is {{believed}} to have spent her early life in New Orleans and New York and her young adulthood in Kentucky and Wisconsin. [...] Her mother died young, and she was raised by her grandmother. In her essays in The Elevator, she describes a middle-class childhood in which <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> read and was [...] "passionately fond of music", not assuming [...] "a young lady's position in society until I was somewhat prepared by years." [...] In one incident, she tells of hiding away in the attic and playing alone with her dolls at the age of fourteen when a potential suitor came to see her. [...] Carter had a younger sister, who died [...] of a spinal disease at ten. Carter later wrote in The Elevator of how bad she had felt because she had hit her sister three weeks before she died, [...] using the incident to advise her younger readers to refrain from anger.|$|E
2500|$|He later built a large four-story stone tower on {{the site}} called Hawk Tower. [...] While he had not visited Ireland {{at this point in}} his life, it is {{possible}} that Hawk Tower is based on Francis Joseph Bigger's 'Castle Séan' at Ardglass, County Down, which had also in turn influenced Yeats' choice of a poets tower, Thoor Ballylee. Construction on Tor House continued into the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was completed by his eldest son. The completed residence was used as a family home until his descendants decided to turn it over to the Tor House Foundation, formed by Ansel Adams, for historic preservation. The romantic Gothic tower was named after a hawk that appeared while Jeffers was working on the structure, and which disappeared the day it was completed. The tower was a gift for his wife Una, who had a fascination for Irish literature and stone towers. In Una's special room on the second floor were kept many of her favorite items, photographs of Jeffers taken by the artist Weston, plants and dried flowers from Shelley's grave, and a rosewood melodeon which <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> play. The tower also included a secret interior staircase – a source of great fun for his young sons.|$|E
