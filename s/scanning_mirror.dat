40|$|Since launch, the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua MODIS have {{operated}} successfully {{for more than}} 8 and 6 years, respectively. MODIS collects data using a two-sided <b>scan</b> <b>mirror</b> over a large scan angular range. The <b>scan</b> <b>mirror</b> is made of a polished, nickel-plated beryllium base coated with high purity silver, which is then over-coated with the Denton proprietary silicon monoxide and silicon dioxide mixture. The <b>scan</b> <b>mirror's</b> reflectance was characterized pre-launch using its witness samples, and the response versus scan angle was measured at the sensor system level. In this study, we present an assessment of MODIS <b>scan</b> <b>mirror</b> on-orbit degradation by examining changes of spectral band response over each sensor's mission lifetime. Results show that the <b>scan</b> <b>mirror's</b> optical properties for both Terra and Aqua MODIS have experienced significant degradation since launch in the VIS spectral region, which is mirror side dependent as well as scan angle dependent. In general, the mirror degradation is more severe for Terra MODIS than Aqua MODIS, especially during recent years. For Terra MODIS, the degradation rate is noticeably different between the mirror sides. On the other hand, {{there has been little}} mirror side dependent difference for Aqua MODIS...|$|R

The primary mission of the MSS was to obtain data for agriculture, forestry, geology, hydrology, oceanography, and meteorology.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{since the}} {{instrument}} {{is expected to}} be linear in energy, a non linearity correction is applied to the interferograms before the computation of the spectra. Next, the two reference views are used for the first step of radiometric calibration. A second step, performed on ground, is used to compensate for certain physical effects that have been ignored in the first (e.g., incidence correction for the <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror,</b> non-blackness effect etc.).|$|E

40|$|A Cryogenic <b>Scan</b> <b>Mirror</b> Mechanism (CSMM) {{has been}} {{developed}} for the Multi-band Imaging Photometer for SIRTF (MIPS) {{which is one of}} three scientific instruments in the focal plane of the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). The design of this <b>scan</b> <b>mirror</b> is based on a mirror mechanism which is currently in operation onboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) Short Wave Spectrometer (SWS). The SWS team provided this design through the University of Arizona, to Ball Aerospace, where it was modified to satisfy the requirements for MIPS.

50|$|OLA has {{a single}} common {{receiver}} and two complementary transmitter assemblies that enhance {{the resolution of the}} information brought back. OLA's high-energy laser transmitter is used for ranging and mapping from 1 to 7.5 km. The low-energy transmitter is used for ranging and imaging from 0.5 to 1 km. The repetition rate of these transmitters sets the data acquisition rate of OLA. Laser pulses from both the low and high energy transmitters are directed onto a movable <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror,</b> which is co-aligned with the field of view of the receiver telescope limiting the effects of background solar radiation. Each pulse provides target range, azimuth, elevation, received intensity and a time-tag.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the subject}} is {{properly}} placed, wavefront correction and imaging takes place. A laser is collimated and then reflected off of a beam-splitting mirror. As in confocal SLO, light must pass through both a horizontal and a vertical <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror</b> {{before and after the}} eye is scanned to align the moving beam for eventual retinal faster images of the retina. Additionally, the light is reflected off of a deformable mirror before and after exposure to the eye to diffuse optical aberrations. The laser enters the eye through the pupil to illuminate the region it has been focused onto and light reflected back leaves the same way. Light returning from the mirrors passes through the first beam splitter onto another beam splitter where it is directed simultaneously toward a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and toward a Shark-Hartmann wavefront sensor array. The light going toward the photomultiplier is focused through a confocal pinhole to remove light not reflecting off of the plane of interest and then recorded in the PMT. Light directed to the wavefront sensor array is split up by the lenslets in the array and then recorded onto a Charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for detection of optical aberrations. These aberrations are then subtracted from the images recorded in the PMT to vastly increase lateral resolution.|$|E
5000|$|The LADS {{system is}} built around a Nd:YAG laser, which emits an infra-red beam at 990 hertz. The beam is {{frequency}} doubled to produce a green laser. This is split into two beams, one infra-red, one green, by an optical coupler, with the infra-red beam aimed directly below the aircraft, and the green beam directed across the target area with a <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror.</b> The infra-red laser does not penetrate the water's surface, and its reflected pulse indicates {{the height of the}} aircraft above the surface. However, the green laser penetrates to the ocean floor, and the return pulse from the green laser indicates the height of the aircraft from the ocean floor; {{the difference between the two}} values is used to calculate the water's depth. The data from the lasers is not processed aboard the aircraft, but instead by a ground support team, with aircraft flight data and global positioning system information used to help generate hydrographic readings. The aircraft makes multiple, overlapping passes of the target area to ensure accurate data is collected. The LADS system is capable of taking 990 soundings per second, with data points positioned 2 to 6 m apart across a swath up to 288 m wide. The system is capable of working with waters up to 70 m deep, and can be modified to perform land surveys of areas with an altitude variance less than 50 m ...|$|E

40|$|The MEMS (Micro-Electronical Mechanical System) <b>{{scanning}}</b> <b>mirror</b> is {{an optical}} MEMS device that can scan laser beams across {{one or two}} dimensions. MEMS scanning mirrors can be applied {{in a variety of}} applications, such as laser display, bio-medical imaging and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). These commercial applications have recently created a great demand for low-driving-voltage and low-power MEMS mirrors. However, no reported two-axis MEMS <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror</b> is available for usage in a universal supplying voltage such as 5 V. In this paper, we present an ultra-low voltage driven two-axis MEMS <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror</b> which is 5 V compatible. In order to realize low voltage and low power, a two-axis MEMS <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror</b> with mechanical leverage driven by PZT (Lead zirconate titanate) ceramic is designed, modeled, fabricated and characterized. To further decrease the power of the MEMS <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror,</b> a new method of impedance matching for PZT ceramic driven by a two-frequency mixed signal is established. As experimental results show, this MEMS <b>scanning</b> <b>mirror</b> reaches a two-axis scanning angle of 41. 9 ° × 40. 3 ° at a total driving voltage of 4. 2 Vpp and total power of 16 mW.

40|$|Distances from a fixed {{reference}} or scan postion {{to several}} locations {{on the surface}} of an antenna reflector can be measured by using a self pulsed laser ranging system. Processing the information thus obtained is used to define the shape of the surface upon which antenna operational efficiency is directly dependent. Operation of the system consists of initiating a pulse from the laser emitter which is pointed at the <b>scan</b> <b>mirror.</b> The emitted pulse strikes the <b>scan</b> <b>mirror,</b> is reflected and sent to one of several targets {{on the surface of}} the antenna. Upon reflection from the target, the pulse returns to a detector via the <b>scan</b> <b>mirror.</b> The detected pulse is amplified and used to trigger the next emitted pulse. After the first pulse is emitted, received and used to trigger another pulse the process becomes repetitive with a repitition rate uniquely determined by the distance traveled to the target and back. A measure of the repetition rate or frequency thus created provides the means required for determining range since the total distance traveled is inversely proportional to the frequency...|$|R
