Then they are married.|$|E

After turning Mick into a vampire, the couple became estranged and Coraline was presumed dead {{for more than}} twenty years.

5|$|The {{locations}} in the film are separated visually from the shots of Madonna, who is singing in a darkened studio. Unlike her previous videos, Madonna portrays a narrator, whose song comments on the story, appearing in shots completely different from the narrative action. <b>She</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> speak for the character, addressing his problems directly, like the chorus of a classical tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Coach's (Nicholas Colasanto) daughter, Lisa, (Allyce Beasley) {{arrives with}} her fiancé, Roy (Philip Charles MacKenzie), a {{door-to-door}} salesman who {{turns out to}} be abrasive and insensitive. Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy not good enough for her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because <b>she</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. <b>She</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Sylvia Royals {{was born}} on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's {{involvement}} in the First World War, although <b>she</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have had a strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for {{the course of the}} illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H.Rider Haggard and E.T.A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the Old Testament, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Navy {{examined}} {{the ship in}} great detail after she arrived in Libau. The cruiser was then renamed Admiral Makarov and assigned to the 8th Fleet, based in Tallinn. In late 1948, she became the flagship of the 8th Fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral F. V. Zozulya. In the early 1950s, three new s entered service, which prompted the Soviet Navy to withdraw Admiral Makarov from front line duties. She returned to her old job as a training cruiser, this time based in Kronstadt in mid-1954. During this period, most of her light anti-aircraft armament was removed, and new radars were installed. Her ultimate fate is unclear; <b>she</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been placed out of service by May 1959, and was scrapped some time thereafter, reportedly by mid-1960. Nevertheless, she was the longest-surviving major warship of the Kriegsmarine, and the only one to see active service {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when <b>she</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} Haiti, Madeleine Short reunites with her fiancé Neil Parker, with {{imminent}} {{plans to be}} married. On the way to their lodging, the couple's coach passes Murder Legendre, an evil voodoo master, who observes them with interest and manages to grab Madeleine's scarf. Neil and Madeleine arrive {{at the home of}} the wealthy plantation owner, Charles Beaumont. Charles's love of Madeleine prompts him to meet Murder secretly in Murder's sugarcane mill, operated entirely by zombies. Charles wants to convince Madeleine to marry him and solicits Murder's supernatural assistance. Murder states {{that the only way to}} help Charles is to transform Madeleine into a zombie with a potion. Beaumont agrees and surreptitiously gives the potion to Madeleine. Shortly after Madeleine and Neil's wedding ceremony, the potion takes effect on Madeleine and <b>she</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> die. After her funeral, Murder and Charles enter Madeleine's tomb at night and Murder revives her as a zombie. Drunk and depressed, Neil imagines ghostly apparitions of Madeleine and goes to her tomb. Finding it empty, Neil seeks assistance from the local missionary, Dr. Bruner, who recounts how Murder turned many of his rivals into zombies, who now guard his estate. The two men journey to Murder's cliffside castle to rescue Madeleine.|$|E
5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but <b>she</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E

She vanishes and leaves Marissa Tasker, her fraternal twin sister, in her place, {{telling him that}} {{he still has a}} {{daughter}} left in the world. <b>She</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> JR on June 29 when he visits her gravesite, asking himself how he can ever live without her; he calls her by her true name, Arabella.|$|E
