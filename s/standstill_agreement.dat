5|$|The Nizam was {{prepared}} {{to enter into a}} limited treaty with India, which gave Hyderabad safeguards not provided for in the standard Instrument of Accession, such as a provision guaranteeing Hyderabad's neutrality {{in the event of a}} conflict between India and Pakistan. India rejected this proposal, arguing that other states would demand similar concessions. A temporary <b>Standstill</b> <b>Agreement</b> was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India. By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was blockading his state, a charge India denied.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sikkim was a British dependency, with {{a status}} {{similar to that}} of the other princely states, and was {{therefore}} considered to be within the frontiers of India in the colonial period. On independence, however, the Chogyal of Sikkim resisted full integration into India. Given the region's strategic importance to India, the Government of India signed first a <b>Standstill</b> <b>Agreement</b> and then in 1950 a full treaty with the Chogyal of Sikkim which in effect made it a protectorate which was no longer part of India. India had responsibility for defence, external affairs and communications, and ultimate responsibility for law and order, but Sikkim was otherwise given full internal autonomy. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, supported by the minority Bhutia and Lepcha upper classes, attempted to negotiate greater powers, particularly over external affairs, to give Sikkim more of an international personality. These policies were opposed by Kazi Lhendup Dorji and the Sikkim State Congress, who represented the ethnic Nepali middle classes and took a more pro-Indian view.|$|E
5|$|Patel and Menon {{backed up}} their {{diplomatic}} efforts by producing treaties {{that were designed}} to be attractive to rulers of princely states. Two key documents were produced. The first was the <b>Standstill</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the Instrument of Accession, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state. The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects {{to the government of}} India—defence, external affairs, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the Government of India Act 1935. Rulers of states which were in effect estates or talukas, where substantial administrative powers were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all residuary powers and jurisdiction in the Government of India. Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.|$|E

25|$|Despite historical, {{cultural}} and ethnic links between them, relations between India and Pakistan have {{been plagued by}} years of mistrust and suspicion ever since the partition of India in 1947. The principal source of contention between India and its western neighbour has been the Kashmir conflict. After an invasion by Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani paramilitary forces, the Hindu Maharaja of the Dogra Kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh, and its Muslim Prime Minister, Sheikh Abdullah, signed an Instrument of Accession with New Delhi. The First Kashmir War started after the Indian Army entered Srinagar, {{the capital of the}} state, to secure the area from the invading forces. The war ended in December 1948 with the Line of Control dividing the erstwhile princely state into territories administered by Pakistan (northern and western areas) and India (southern, central and northeastern areas). Pakistan contested the legality of the Instrument of Accession since the Dogra Kingdom has signed a <b>standstill</b> <b>agreement</b> with it. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 started following the failure of Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.|$|E
25|$|Hyderabad was {{the largest}} of the princely states, and it {{included}} parts of present-day Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra states. Its ruler, the Nizam Osman Ali Khan, was a Muslim, although over 80% of its people were Hindu. The Nizam sought independence or accession with Pakistan. Muslim forces loyal to Nizam, called the Razakars, under Qasim Razvi, pressed the Nizam to hold out against India, while organising attacks on people on Indian soil. Even though a <b>Standstill</b> <b>Agreement</b> was signed due to the desperate efforts of Lord Mountbatten to avoid a war, the Nizam rejected deals and changed his positions. In September 1948 Patel emphasised in Cabinet meetings that India should talk no more, and reconciled Nehru and the Governor-General, Chakravarti Rajgopalachari, to military action. Following preparations, Patel ordered the Indian Army to invade Hyderabad (in his capacity as Acting Prime Minister) when Nehru was touring Europe. The action was termed Operation Polo, and thousands of Razakar forces were killed, but Hyderabad was forcefully secured and integrated into the Indian Union. The main aim of Mountbatten and Nehru in avoiding a forced annexation was to prevent an outbreak of Hindu–Muslim violence. Patel insisted that if Hyderabad were allowed to continue as an independent nation enclave surrounded by India, the prestige of the government would fall, and then neither Hindus nor Muslims would feel secure in its realm. After defeating Nizam, Patel retained him as the ceremonial chief of state, and held talks with him.|$|E
500|$|The Instruments of Accession {{implemented}} {{a number of}} other safeguards. Clause 7 provided that the princes would not be bound to the Indian constitution as and when it was drafted. Clause 8 guaranteed their autonomy in all areas that were not ceded to the Government of India. This was supplemented by a number of promises. Rulers who agreed to accede would receive guarantees that their extra-territorial rights, such as immunity from prosecution in Indian courts and exemption from customs duty, would be protected, that they would be allowed to democratise slowly, that none of the eighteen major states would be forced to merge, and that they would remain eligible for British honours and decorations. In discussions, Lord Mountbatten reinforced the statements of Patel and Menon by emphasising that the documents gave the princes all the [...] "practical independence" [...] they needed. Mountbatten, Patel and Menon also sought to give princes the impression that if they did not accept the terms put to them then, they might subsequently need to accede on substantially less favourable terms. The <b>Standstill</b> <b>Agreement</b> was also used as a negotiating tool, as the States Department categorically ruled out signing a <b>Standstill</b> <b>Agreement</b> with princely states that did not sign an Instrument of Accession.|$|E

Those outstanding orders could no longer be paid for in Britain nor could the goods be delivered to Germany, which blocked Rhodius Koenigs trading.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that South Africa became the subject of severe {{financial}} sanctions {{during the course of the}} 1980 s. The most visible impact of the pariah status which South Africa had attained was the imposition of a debt standstill by the South African authorities in September 1985. Then numerous foreign lenders refused to roll over short-term credit facilities which had up to that point been utilised by domestic borrowers, thereby causing a severe dearth of foreign exchange. In spite of the standstill, foreign capital nevertheless flowed out of the country: first a very considerable amount of short-term capital, mostly related to trade finance, that could not be brought within the standstill net because that would have damaged normal trade flows; thereafter, amounts which became payable in terms of the various <b>standstill</b> <b>agreements</b> in addition to some other outflows falling outside the standstill net. From mid- 1985 to mid- 1994 the average outflow amounted to some 2. 5 % of gross domestic product and 13 % of gross domestic fixed investment. During the nine years up to mid- 1994 the South African economy was forced to generate current account surpluses for lack of foreign sources of funding. This curtailed the freedom of the domestic macroeconomic policymakers to a considerable extent. Nevertheless, it led to a reduction in the relative burden of South Africa’s foreign debt to acceptable levels by developing country standards...|$|R
40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of policy makers, {{the understanding of the}} causes and the course of financial crises remains inadequate. The theoretical analysis of currency crises has been hampered by the lack of empirical regularities in those of the past. Nonetheless, attempts are made repeatedly to provide a canonical explanation of international financial crises and to propose economic policies to prevent such crises. This article surveys the recent theoretical, empirical and economic policy literature on financial crises (with emphasis on the Asian crisis). Much of the recent theoretical literature, in particular that dealing with the Asian crisis, refers to the complex relationship between the constitutive imperfections of financial markets resulting from asymmetric information and the worldwide liberalization of the financial and capital markets. It is an outstanding feature of financial markets that they are strongly dominated by expectations. The actual market outcome may correspond to expectations even if these expectations were unjustified ex ante or absurd. Thus, expectations determine whether market outcomes tend toward a "good" or "bad" equilibrium. In principle, changes in international investors" expectations for the worse – whether justified or not – may trigger crises (self-fulfilling crises) and move a country from a "good" (high growth) to a "bad" (low growth) equilibrium. According to the views of leading theoreticians and practitioners, this mechanism was the preeminent element of the Asian crisis. It is a surprising insight that "self-fulfilling crises" may indeed be the result of rational behavior, given the constitutive imperfections of financial and capital markets. In a world of liberalized financial markets, such crises cannot in principle be averted and are very difficult to forecast. A reversal of the liberalization of financial markets or the re-introduction of capital controls would be the wrong response, however. A superior option in economic policy is the establishment of "support" systems to increase the efficiency and stability of international financial markets. Core elements of such systems would be institutions of financial surveillance and monitoring, which among other tasks could fulfill the important function of a "lender of last resort" at the international level, and provide an internationally accepted set of rules for <b>standstill</b> <b>agreements,</b> debt relief for and financial default of countries.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{transfer}} of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called [...] "Kashmir") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority.

He signed a <b>Standstill</b> <b>Agreement</b> with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent.

An internal revolt began in the Poonch region against oppressive taxation by the Maharaja. In August, Maharaja's forces fired upon demonstrations in favour of Kashmir joining Pakistan, burned whole villages and massacred innocent people. The Poonch rebels declared an independent government of [...] "Azad" [...] Kashmir on 24 October. Rulers of Princely States were encouraged to accede their States to either Dominion – India or Pakistan, taking into account factors such as geographical contiguity and the wishes of their people. [...] In 1947, Kashmir's population was [...] "77% Muslim and 20% Hindu". [...] To postpone making a hurried decision, the Maharaja signed a <b>standstill</b> <b>agreement</b> with Pakistan, which ensured continuity of trade, travel, communication, and similar services between the two. Such an agreement was pending with India. Following huge riots in Jammu, in October 1947, Pashtuns from Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province recruited by the Poonch rebels, invaded Kashmir, along with the Poonch rebels, allegedly incensed by the atrocities against fellow Muslims in Poonch and Jammu. The tribesmen engaged in looting and killing along the way. The ostensible aim of the guerilla campaign was to frighten Hari Singh into submission. [...] Instead the Maharaja appealed to the Government of India for assistance, and the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Once the Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state.
