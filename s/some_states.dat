Faced with UN pressure, the Gizenga government however collapsed in January 1962 after Gizenga was arrested.|$|E

5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch, and is considered invasive in <b>some</b> <b>states</b> in the United States and in parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.|$|E
