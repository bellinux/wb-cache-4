However, little research has been conducted on the crenobiology or ecology in these systems. In this study, aquatic insect, amphipod, and isopod communities were examined in 16 <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> in Missouri, in some of which associated environmental gradients were also measured. The goal {{of this study was to}} create a comprehensive list of species present in all studied systems, as well analyze changes in community composition among and within <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> in relation to environmental gradients in selected springs. Sorenson's similarity coefficient and UPGMA cluster analysis showed that differences between high discharge <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> may be related to the presence of trout and trout fisherman. Renkonen's similarity coefficient and UPGMA cluster analysis showed that differences between low to medium discharge <b>spring</b> <b>systems</b> may be related to the aquatic faunal region in which each is located, as species assemblages in Prairie and Big River faunal region springs were dissimilar from those in Ozark springs. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that environmental conditions differ among springs and affect species differently in each aquatic faunal region, which may explain the observed differences in community composition. In addition, several state and federally listed species of conservation concern were collected, as well as several species endemic to the Interior Highland...|$|R

Through the 1920s a number of theorists {{outlined}} an independent role for the tank that required it to move at high speed into the rear areas, a modern version of the cavalry. The British referred to these designs as cruiser tanks, but similar high-speed designs were developed under a variety of names. As the Defense Act limited tank development to the infantry, the United States Cavalry began tank development under the name [...] "combat car". In keeping with the high-speed role, the new T5 Combat Car introduced the new vertical volute spring suspension (VVSS) system, which proved clearly superior to the Vickers leaf <b>spring</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the design}} of an automobile, the most {{important}} task is to minimize the occurrence and consequences of automobile accidents. Too many passengers die or injure every year because of accidents. Most of the vehicle manufacturing companies are unable to control these accidents. We are coming across the many accidents which {{were the result of}} poor designing and maintenance. The vehicles should have active safety system which will avoid the accidents as much as possible and passive safety system which will reduce the damage and loss of lives. The <b>spring</b> damper <b>system</b> is a passive safety system which will decrease the impact of accident. In this <b>systems</b> <b>spring</b> will store the energy and damper will dissipate the energy. This <b>spring</b> damper <b>system</b> reduces the impact of accident by increasing the time of collision as the spring needs some time to compress it totally. In this to check the amount of reduction in impact force when two bodies collide is analyzed with the <b>spring</b> damper <b>system</b> and without the <b>spring</b> damper <b>system.</b> The Impact force is significantly reduced with the <b>spring</b> damper <b>system...</b>|$|R

If the system starts in a particular mode, vibrations in other modes do not develop. [...] With the nonlinear component, Fermi expected energy in one mode [...] to transfer gradually to other modes, and eventually, to be distributed equally among all modes. [...] This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode, but much later, essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode. [...] This behavior {{is very different from the}} expected equipartition of energy. It remained mysterious until 1965, when Kruskal and Zabusky showed that, after appropriate mathematical transformations, the system {{can be described}} by the Korteweg–de Vries equation, which is the prototype of nonlinear partial differential equations that have soliton solutions. [...] This means that FPUT behavior can be understood in terms of solitons.|$|E
