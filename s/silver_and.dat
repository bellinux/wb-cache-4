5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, <b>silver,</b> <b>and</b> gold. The melt is {{treated in a}} reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top of}} the melt and are skimmed off. Metallic <b>silver</b> <b>and</b> gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves <b>silver</b> <b>and</b> gold, both of which, being immiscible in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton–Kroll process, treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.|$|E
