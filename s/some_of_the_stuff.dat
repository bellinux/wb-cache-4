Timberlake had four weeks to record the whole material, because he had to shoot his scenes for the film Runner Runner. Although, originally planned for release in October 2012, the album's date was postponed because of the singer's wedding with actress Jessica Biel. Wright stated that although in the project were involved artists who are also primarily Timberlake's friends it was tough keeping the album a secret, making them use codenames for the project. During an interview with American radio and television host Ryan Seacrest, Timberlake explained the meaning behind the album's title saying, [...] "It more or less came out of: I was playing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> for my friends and they would come {{in and out of the}} studio and I'd say, 'What do you think of this?'
