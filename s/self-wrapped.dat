40|$|A nanoscaledBa 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 TiO 3 (BST) powder was {{successfully}} synthesized using a modified hydrothermal process {{at a low}} temperature (∼ 80 °C). By dissolving Ba(OH) 2 · 8 H 2 U and Sr(OH) 2 · 8 H 2 O in deionized water as a base solution, nanocrystalline BST powder {{can be obtained by}} mixing an ethanol solution of tetrabutyl titanate with a hot base solution by stirring. The grain size of BST is close to 17 - 20 nm, as calculated by XRD patterns and confirmed by TEM and SEM measurements. A perovskite structure core material of the nanoscaled BST {{was successfully}} <b>self-wrapped</b> by a non-ferroelectric oxide MgO derived from a magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O) solution under ultrasonic dispersion. A small amount of ammonia solution was added to this mixture to adjust it to a proper level of acidity in order to form a homogeneous core-shell structure. Straightforward experimental results revealed the formation of a core-shell structure. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) combined with EDX was used to confirm the composition and its variation. TEM, SEM, and XRD results showed that the average particle size of a core-shell structure was less than 150 nm up to sintering at 1100 °C, depending on the core BST powder and its dispersion.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{flexibility and}} structural softness of ultrathin devices based on organic thin films and low-dimensional nanomaterials have enabled {{a wide range}} of applications including flexible display, artificial skin, and health monitoring devices. However, both living systems and inanimate systems that are encountered in daily lives are all 3 D. It is therefore desirable to either create freestanding electronics in a 3 D form or to incorporate electronics onto 3 D objects. Here, a technique is reported to utilize shape-memory polymers together with carbon nanotube flexible electronics to achieve this goal. Temperature-assisted shape control of these freestanding electronics in a programmable manner is demonstrated, with theoretical analysis for understanding the shape evolution. The shape control process can be executed with prepatterned heaters, desirable for 3 D shape formation in an enclosed environment. The incorporation of carbon nanotube transistors, gas sensors, temperature sensors, and memory devices that are capable of <b>self-wrapping</b> onto any irregular shaped-objects without degradations in device performance is demonstrated. clos...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-A {{new type}} of newe cuff {{electrode}} consisting of conduc-tive segments embedded within a self-curling sheath of biocompatihle insulation has been developed. This spiral nerve cuff is biased to <b>self-wrap</b> around peripheral nerves and possesses a “self-sizing ” property, presenting an alternative to present commercially available, fixed-size nerve cuffs that are manually wrapped around nerves and sutured shut (“split-cylinder ” cuffs). Spiral cuff design and manufacture are de-scribed. We hypothesize that unlike traditional cuffs, the spiral cuff poten-tially can be implanted safely when sized to fit peripheral nerves snugly. Theoretical pressure analyses of traditional and spiral cuffs that sup-port this hypothesis are presented. These analyses are designed to pre-dict the minimum CNR (cuff diameter/nerve diameter ratio) at {{which there is no}} interference with intraneural blood flow. A safe CNR of 0. 997 is predicted for a 1 mm split-cylinder cuff, while a safe CNR of 0. 83 is predicted for a 1 mm spiral cuff. The quantitative relationships between nerve size and safe cuff size are detailed. Results of a prelim-inary experiment in which snug spiral cuffs were implanted on feline peripheral nerve support the prediction that they may be safe. I...|$|R
