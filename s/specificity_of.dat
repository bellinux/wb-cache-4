5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E

Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E

CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

The <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to study the primary sequence <b>specificities</b> <b>of</b> protein kinases by using an oriented degenerate peptide library.

The identified substrate <b>specificities</b> <b>of</b> these kinases, together with known crystal structures of protein kinase A, CDK 2, Erk 2, twitchin, and casein kinase I, provide a structural basis for the substrate recognition of protein Ser/Thr kinases. In particular, the specific selection of amino acids at the + 1 and - 3 positions to the substrate serine/threonine can be rationalized {{on the basis of}} sequences of protein kinases.
