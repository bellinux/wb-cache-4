60|$|Clearly, this curious Australian {{cousin of}} the Mediterranean sea-horses has {{acquired}} so marvellous a resemblance to a bit of fucus in order to deceive the eyes of its ever-watchful enemies, and to become indistinguishable from the uneatable weed whose colour and form it so surprisingly imitates. Protective resemblances of the sort are extremely common among the pipe-fish family, {{and the reason why}} they should be so is no doubt sufficiently obvious at first sight to any reflecting mind--such, for example, as the intelligent reader's. Pipe-fish, as everybody knows, are far from giddy. They do not swim in the vortex of piscine dissipation. Being mostly small and defenceless creatures, lurking among the marine vegetation of the shoals and reefs, they are usually accustomed to cling for support by their snake-like tails to the stalks or leaves of those submerged forests. The omniscient schoolboy must often have watched in aquariums the habits and manners of the common sea-horses, twisted together by their long thin bodies into one inextricable mass of living matwork, or anchored firmly with a treble <b>serpentine</b> <b>coil</b> to some projecting branch of coralline or of quivering sea-wrack. Bad swimmers by nature, utterly unarmed, and wholly undefended by protective mail, the pipe-fish generally can neither fight nor run away: and therefore they depend entirely for their lives upon their peculiar skulking and lurking habits. Their one mode of defence is not to show themselves; discretion is the better part of their valour; they hide as much as possible among the thickest seaweed, and trust to Providence to escape observation.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present a spray dryer device {{developed}} to synthesize ammonium niobium-oxalate precursor powder with controlled grain size. The dryer device is manufactured using stainless steel 304 and measures 0, 48 m in outside diameter and 1, 9 m in height. The spray dryer has a cylindrical shape assembled on a conical base. The central chamber is heated by three 4 KW resistances and is equipped with <b>serpentine</b> <b>coil</b> heaters placed around its main body. This configuration guarantees that the air is at the same temperature of the chamber walls and the adherence of the powder particles on the wall is prevented. The precursor solution is atomized on the air stream downwards from the top to the bottom, at low rates. Powder particles are collected on a 0, 4 m diameter horizontal plate placed at the bottom portion of the dryer and the wet air is released from the chamber by the opening located under the collecting plate. The synthesis of the niobium oxalate precursor and the results of the decomposition process are described...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{geometries}} of capillary tubes {{has been investigated}} by many researchers. Their studies {{were based on the}} coil diameters and lengths alone, with no particular attention placed on the effect of coil pitch. At present no information is available about the effects of <b>serpentine</b> <b>coiled</b> capillary tubes on refrigerator performance. This study examined the effects of pitches of both helical and <b>serpentine</b> <b>coiled</b> capillary tubes on the performance of a vapor compression refrigeration system. Several capillary tubes of equal lengths (2. 03 m) and varying pitches, <b>coiled</b> diameters, and <b>serpentine</b> heights were used. Both inlet and outlet pressure and temperature of the test section (capillary tube) were measured and used to estimate the coefficient of performance (COP) of the system. The results show that, in the case of helical coiled geometries the pitch has no significant effect on the system performance but the coil diameter as already predicted by many researchers. In the case of serpentine geometries both pitch and height affects the system performance. Performance increases with both increase in the pitch and the height. Correlations were proposed to describe relationships between straight and coiled capillary tube and between helical <b>coiled</b> and <b>serpentine</b> <b>coiled</b> capillary tubes. The coefficient of correlations are: 0. 9841 for mass flow rates of helical and serpentine with straight tubes; 0. 9864 for corresponding COPs and 0. 9996 for mass flow rates of <b>serpentine</b> and helical <b>coiled</b> tube.

The container of the phase change material (PCM) is the controlling unit of the phase change heat transfer model. It was solved numerically by an enthalpy-based finite difference method and was validated by experimental data. CaCl 2 ? 6 H 2 O was used as the PCM in the latent heat storage system of SAGSHP system. In the tank, the PCMs are encapsulated in plastic kegs that are setting on the <b>serpentine</b> <b>coil.</b> The experiments were performed from March 12 to April 10, 2004 in the heating season of the transition period. In order to reflect the effects of the system, two days were chosen to compare the numerical results with experimental data.

40|$|The {{organization}} of carbon nanotubes into well-defined horizontal geometries and arrays on surfaces {{is a critical}} prerequisite for their large-scale integration into nanocircuits. We have elaborated a series of surface-directed mechanisms of carbon nanotube growth, which can be classified as different modes of orientational epitaxy: Lattice-directed epitaxy (by atomic rows), ledge-directed epitaxy (by atomic steps) [1], and graphoepitaxy (by nanofacets) [2]. Some of these modes of "nanotube epitaxy " can be simultaneously combined with electric field-directed growth [3] for the orthogonal self-assembly of carbon nanotube crossbar architectures [4], and with gas flow for the self-{{organization of}} nanotube serpentines [5].

60|$|The sledge {{on which}} Edith was seated was formed {{very much in}} the same manner as the little sled which had been made for her at Fort Chimo. It was very much larger, how ever, and could have easily held eight or ten persons. The runners, which were shod with frozen mud (a {{substance}} that was now becoming nearly unfit for use owing to the warm weather), were a perfect wonder of ingenuity--as, indeed, was the whole machine--being pieced and lashed together with lines of raw hide in the most complicated manner and very neatly. The dogs were each fastened by a separate line to the sledge, the best dog being placed in the centre and having the longest line, while the others were attached by lines proportionably shorter according to the distance of each from the leading dog, and the outsiders being close to the runners of the sledge. All the lines were attached to the front bar of the machine. There were many advantages attending this mode of harnessing, among which were the readiness with which any dog could be attached or detached without affecting the others, and the ease with which Annatock, when so inclined, could lay hold of the line of a refractory dog, haul him back without stopping the others, and give him a cuffing. This, however, was seldom done, as the driver could touch any member of the team with the point of his whip. The handle of this terrible instrument was not much more than eighteen or twenty inches long, but the lash was upwards of six yards! Near the handle it was about three inches broad, being thick cords of walrus-hide platted; it gradually tapered towards the point, where it terminated in a fine line of the same material. While driving, the long lash of this whip trails on the snow behind the sledge, and by a peculiar sleight of hand its <b>serpentine</b> <b>coils</b> can be brought up for instant use.|$|R

[...] "Pliosauromorphs", such as the Pliosauridae and the Rhomaleosauridae, had shorter necks with a large, elongated head.

5000|$|To become flippers, {{the limbs}} had changed considerably. The limbs were very large, each {{about as long}} as the trunk. The forelimbs and hindlimbs {{strongly}} resembled each other. The humerus in the upper arm, and the thighbone in the upper leg, had become large flat bones, expanded at their outer ends. The elbow joints and the knee joints were no longer functional: the lower arm and the lower leg could not flex in relation to the upper limb elements, but formed a flat continuation of them. All outer bones had become flat supporting elements of the flippers, tightly connected to each other and hardly able to rotate, flex, extend or spread. This was true of the ulna, radius, metacarpals and fingers, as well of the tibia, fibula, metatarsals and toes.

The Bolla can change into a Kulshedra should it live many years without being seen by a human.

40|$|Basosquamous {{carcinoma}} (BSC) {{is a rare}} {{skin cancer}} which has areas of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and a transition zone between them. However, dermoscopic features of BSC are not well described in the published work, except one study. The aim {{of the present study}} was to better identify and clarify the dermoscopic findings of BSC in the largest group of patients in the published work and to describe its dermoscopic features according to histopathologically BCC-dominant, SCC-dominant and intermediate categories. Dermoscopic features of 36 histopathologically proven BSC and their dermatopathological correlates were retrospectively analyzed. Dermoscopic features were evaluated by pattern analysis. Keratin mass (91. 7 %) was the most common dermoscopic feature. Surface scaling (77. 8 %), ulceration (69. 4 %), white structureless areas (69. 4 %), white clods (66. 7 %) and blood spots on keratin mass (66. 7 %) were the other frequent findings. Polymorphous vascular pattern consisting of various combinations of branched, <b>serpentine,</b> straight, <b>coiled</b> or looped vessels were detected in 61 % of the lesions. BSC has BCC-dominant vascular features together with otherwise SCC-dominant morphology, the common pattern seen in BSC lesions being BCC-dominant polymorphous or monomorphous vasculature, together with dermoscopic findings of keratinization. White circles, known to be a valuable clue to SCC and keratoacanthoma, were present at the same magnitude in BSC in our study. The observed histological correlation of eosinophilic keratin overlying the epithelium which lined follicular infundibulae in these tumors, provides a plausible new perspective on dermoscopic white circles...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of novel and efficient mixing methods {{is important for}} optimizing the efficiency of many biological and chemical processes. Tuning the physical and performance properties of nucleic acid-based nanoparticles is one such example known to be strongly affected by mixing efficiency. The characteristics of DNA nanoparticles (such as size, polydispersity, ζ-potential, and gel shift) are important to ensure their therapeutic potency, and new methods to optimize these characteristics are of significant importance to achieve the highest efficacy. In the present study, a simple segmented flow microfluidics system has been developed to augment mixing of pDNA/bPEI nanoparticles. This DNA and cationic polymer pair (plasmid DNA and branched poly(ethylenimine)) was chosen due to bPEI’s well-known ability to spontaneously condense plasmid DNA. The system fabricated in this project utilizes silastic tubing (1. 6 mm ID) as the reaction channels, nitrogen gas as the continuous phase, and the aqueous components as the dispersed phase. Drop flow has been characterized using UV/Vis spectrophotometry, and the relationships between continuous and dispersed phase flow and drop rate and size have been documented. Drops have been successfully formed using {{two different types of}} drop generation (cross-flow and co-flow). Physical properties of the nanoparticles were analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and agarose gel electrophoresis. Biological performance of the nanoparticles was analyzed using DNase I protection, unincorporated bPEI quantitation, mammalian cell transfection, and cell viability assays. The nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) ratio (5 and 20), flow rate, and flow-path geometry (linear, <b>serpentine,</b> and <b>coiled)</b> have been explored for their effect on mixing and particle uniformity. The results show a significant decrease in nanoparticle size compared with bulk-mixed methods at an N/P ratio of 5 and an observable difference in nanoparticle properties and performance when adjusting the nature of mixing using the developed microfluidics system...|$|R

40|$|Research {{has been}} {{completed}} in a pilot scale, eight foot diameter tank to investigate blending, using a pump with dual opposing jets. The jets re-circulate fluids in the tank to promote blending when fluids {{are added to the}} tank. Different jet diameters and different horizontal and vertical orientations of the jets were investigated. In all, eighty five tests were performed both in a tank without internal obstructions and a tank with vertical obstructions similar to a tube bank in a heat exchanger. These obstructions provided scale models of several miles of two inch diameter, <b>serpentine,</b> vertical cooling <b>coils</b> below the liquid surface for a full scale, 1. 3 million gallon, liquid radioactive waste storage tank. Two types of tests were performed. One type of test used a tracer fluid, which was homogeneously blended into solution. Data were statistically evaluated to determine blending times for solutions of different density and viscosity, and the blending times were successfully compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The other type of test blended solutions of different viscosity. For example, in one test a half tank of water was added to a half tank of a more viscous, concentrated salt solution. In this case, the fluid mechanics of the blending process was noted to significantly change due to stratification of fluids. CFD models for stratification were not investigated. This paper is the fourth in a series of papers resulting from this research (Leishear, et. al.
