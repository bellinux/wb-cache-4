5000|$|Ambassadors carry formal {{letters of}} {{credence}} from their head of <b>state,</b> <b>addressed</b> to the host country's head of state. Because many Commonwealth countries have the same head of state, the accreditation of a High Commissioner {{is in the form}} of a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one head of government (Prime Minister) to that of another. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to foreign and Commonwealth states: e.g., British High Commissioners are formally titled [...] "The High Commissioner for Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom", whereas British Ambassadors to foreign countries are known as [...] "Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador".|$|E

50|$|The Treaty of Westphalia {{confirmed}} {{the conquest of}} Alsace by France, and in due course the French <b>state</b> <b>addressed</b> the challenge of rebuilding population levels in its new eastern territories. In about November 1662 the government issued an order encouraging former owners of abandoned lands to return and reclaim their former properties, and in addition encouraging newcomers to colonise the abandoned territories in the region. The only condition imposed on newcomers wishing to settle in the villages was {{that they must be}} Roman Catholics. Powerful incentives for newcomers included the offer of a five-year exemption from taxation. The policy succeeded, with immigrants arriving from nearby parts of Lorraine, across the Vosges Mountains as well as from more distant places. By 1801 the population would be back up to 696 as the village was rebuilt around the church. Today the year 17.. inscribed on several of the older houses in the centre of the village bears silent testimony to a century of peace and reconstruction. These houses are generally of traditional Vosgien stone built construction with a house on one end and a stable at the other, and a barn in the middle. A long corridor from the front leads to a large kitchen at the rear. The stone used is the local sand stone, and the walls are coated with plaster.|$|E

40|$|We have {{employed}} admittance spectroscopy and deep-level transient spectroscopy {{in order to}} investigate the electronic properties of ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) $_ 2 $ heterojunctions and Cr/Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) $_ 2 $ Schottky contacts. Our work concentrates {{on the origin of}} an energy-distributed defect state commonly found in these systems. The activation energy of the defect <b>state</b> <b>addressed</b> continuously shifts upon air annealing or damp-heat treatment and is a valuable measure of the degree of band bending in Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) $_ 2 $-based junctions. We demonstrate that the band bending within the Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) $_ 2 $ layer, reported in the literature to become minimal after air exposure, returns after the formation of either a Schottky contact or a heterojunction. The earlier phenomenon turns out to be independent of a surface passivation due to the CdS bath deposition. Comment: 3 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|Summary: This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} and function {{of the right to}} a fair trial in Brussels I. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the European Court of Justice balances the right to a fair trial against the free movement of judgments. This question will be answered in terms of whether the ECJ perceives the right to a fair trial to constitute an autonomous source of obligations or whether it interprets (and if so, how it does so) PIL mechanisms {{in the light of the}} requirements of a fair trial. In particular, the paper will analyse to what extent the courts in the Member <b>State</b> <b>addressed</b> may review compliance with the right to a fair hearing of the court originally seized. Finally, the proposal of the European Commission to abolish the exequatur will be examined from a fundamental rights perspective...|$|E
