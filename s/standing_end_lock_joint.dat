40|$|The {{problem of}} fault {{tolerance}} in cooperative manipulators rigidly {{connected to a}} solid object is addressed in this paper. Four faults are considered: free-swinging <b>joint</b> faults, <b>locked</b> <b>joint</b> faults, incorrect measured joint position, and incorrect measured joint velocity. The faults are first detected by a fault detection and isolation system. Freeswinging and <b>locked</b> <b>joint</b> faults are isolated using artificial neural networks. The other faults are isolated based on the kinematic constraints imposed on the cooperative system. After {{the isolation of the}} faults, the control system is reconfigured. Control laws for the system with passive or <b>locked</b> <b>joints</b> are developed. Results of the fault tolerance system applied in simulations and in a real cooperative system are presented...|$|R

50|$|Less preferred, {{but also}} {{effective}} techniques are <b>joint</b> <b>locks.</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>locks</b> {{are not the}} preferred method for attacking an enemy, {{because they do not}} completely disable the enemy. <b>Joints</b> <b>locks</b> do inflict large amounts of pain and can secure compliance from the enemy. This makes them especially useful in controlling opponents during crowd control operations or when someone is being clearly threatening, but the rules of engagement prohibit killing them (if the opponent is easily given to surrender under pain). If compliance cannot be secured or is not desired, the <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> can be extended fully, breaking the applicable joint. Students are taught the difference between pain that signals a <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> is in progress and simple discomfort.|$|R

50|$|If {{working end}} of the line has an eye in it, and the <b>standing</b> <b>end</b> is accessible, the knot can be tied to a closed ring, another eye, or a rail with {{inaccessible}} ends, as follows. Pass the eye around the ring or rail, then pass the <b>standing</b> <b>end</b> through its own eye (this effectively forms a girth hitch). Then pass the <b>standing</b> <b>end</b> through the eye again, and pull up tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) in cooperative manipulators is {{addressed in this}} paper. Four FDI procedures are developed to deal with free-swinging <b>joint</b> faults, <b>locked</b> <b>joint</b> faults, incorrectly measured joint position, and incorrectly measured joint velocity. Free-swinging and <b>locked</b> <b>joint</b> faults are isolated via neural networks. For each arm, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is used to reproduce {{the dynamics of the}} fault-free robot. The outputs of each MLP are compared to the actual joint velocities in order to generate a residual vector which is then classified by an RBF network. The remaining faults are isolated based on the kinematic constraints imposed on the cooperative system. Results obtained via simulations and via an actual cooperative manipulator robot are presented...|$|R

50|$|A {{basket weave}} knot can be tied {{from a single}} strand by first forming a bight {{in the middle of}} the line. The ends near the bight become the <b>standing</b> <b>ends.</b> This method will keep the knot in one plane only for knots in which the <b>standing</b> <b>ends</b> enter the same side; these knots are called bosun's knots because they can be tied in a lanyard. For knots in which the <b>standing</b> <b>ends</b> enter from {{different}} sides of the rectangle, the bight will wrap across one side of the knot after it is set.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} fault {{tolerance}} in cooperative manipulators rigidly connected to an undeformable load is {{addressed in this}} paper. Four categories of faults are considered: free-swinging <b>joint</b> faults (FSJFs), <b>locked</b> <b>joint</b> faults (LJFs), incorrectly measured joint position faults (JPFs), and incorrectly measured joint velocity faults (JVFs). Free-swinging and <b>locked</b> <b>joint</b> faults are detected via artificial neural networks (ANNs). Incorrectly measured joint position and velocity faults are detected by considering the kinematic constraints of the cooperative system. When a fault is detected, the control system is reconfigured according {{to the nature of}} the isolated fault and the task is resumed to the largest extent possible. The fault tolerance framework is applied to an actual system composed of two cooperative robotic manipulators. The results presented demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the methodology...|$|R
