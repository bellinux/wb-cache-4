30|$|The lupus-associated (La) antigen, {{also known}} by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee {{approved}} name of Sjögren Syndrome B (SSB), is an abundant, essential, and ubiquitously expressed ribonucleoprotein that is revealed preferentially in dead tumour cells because La is over-expressed in malignancy[8 – 10] and dead tumour cells are inefficiently cleared in vivo unlike dead normal cells[10, 11]. The La-specific mAb, DAB 4 (APOMAB®), targets dead tumour cells in vivo[12], particularly after DNA-damaging anti-cancer treatment[10, 11]. Using DAB 4 labeled with the β-emitter Yttrium- 90 (90 Y), we have tested the concept of targeting dead tumour cells {{as a way to}} deliver RIT to surrounding viable tumour cells in murine <b>syngraft</b> and human xenograft models. Compared to DAB 4 -directed RIT alone, prior treatment with DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy resulted in supra-additive anti-tumour responses, with the quality of the responses ranging from significant tumour growth delay in carcinoma models[11] to sustained complete regression in a lymphoma model[13].|$|E

To minimize adverse events and improve drug delivery efficiently and specifically in cancer cells, encapsulation of Dox with naturally obtained galactoxyloglucan polysaccharide (PST 001), isolated from Tamarindus indica was attempted. Thus formed PST-Dox nanoparticles induced apoptosis and exhibited significant cytotoxicity in murine ascites cell lines, Dalton’s lymphoma ascites and Ehrlich’s ascites carcinoma. The mechanism contributing to the augmented cytotoxicity of nanoconjugates at lower doses was validated by measuring the Dox intracellular uptake in human colon, leukemic and breast cancer cell lines. PST-Dox nanoparticles showed rapid internalization of Dox into cancer cells within {{a short period of}} incubation. Further, in vivo efficacy was tested in comparison to the parent counterparts - PST 001 and Dox, in ascites and solid tumor <b>syngraft</b> mice models. Treatment of ascites tumors with PST-Dox nanoparticles significantly reduced the tumor volume, viable tumor cell count, and increased survival and percentage life span in the early, established and prophylactic phases of the disease. Administration of nanoparticles through intratumoral route delivered more robust antitumor response than the intraperitoneal route in solid malignancies. Thus, the results indicate that PST-Dox nanoparticles have greater potential compared to the Dox as targeted drug delivery nanocarriers for loco regional cancer chemotherapy applications...|$|E
40|$|Hand {{and face}} vascularized {{composite}} allotransplantation (VCA) is an evolving and challenging field with great opportunities. During VCA, massive surgical damage is inflicted on both {{donor and recipient}} tissues, which {{may contribute to the}} high VCA rejection rates. To segregate between the damage-induced and rejection phase of post-VCA responses, we compared responses occurring up to 5 days following syngeneic versus allogeneic vascularized groin flap transplantations, culminating in transplant acceptance or rejection, respectively. The immune response elicited upon transplantation of a syngeneic versus allogeneic vascularized groin flap was compared at Post-operative days 2 or 5 by histology, immunohistochemistry and by broad-scope gene and protein analyses using quantitative real-time PCR and Multiplex respectively. Immune cell infiltration began at the donor-recipient interface and paralleled expression of a large group of wound healing-associated genes in both allografts and syngrafts. By day 5 post-transplantation, cell infiltration spread over the entire allograft but remained confined to the wound site in the <b>syngraft.</b> This shift correlated with upregulation of IL- 18, INFg, CXCL 9, 10 and 11, CCL 2, CCL 5, CX 3 CL 1 and IL- 10 in the allograft only, suggesting their role in the induction of the anti-alloantigen adaptive immune response. High resemblance between the cues governing VCA and solid organ rejection was observed. Despite this high resemblance we describe also, for the first time, a damage induced inflammatory component in VCA rejection as immune cell infiltration into the graft initiated at the surgical damage site spreading to the entire allograft only at late stage rejection. We speculate that the highly inflammatory setting created by the unique surgical damage during VCA may enhance acute allograft rejection...|$|E
40|$|Ischemic injury {{plays an}} {{important}} role in chronic renal transplant failure (CRTF). Downregulation of ecto-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) in combination with up-regulation of ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase is a hallmark of ischemic injury. We studied the expression of renal ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase and ecto-ATPase in experimental renal transplantation. Fisher 344 -to-Lewis allografted rats were either treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or left untreated. Lewis-to-Lewis <b>syngrafted</b> rats served as controls, Untreated allografted rats developed proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and mild intimal hyperplasia. ACEi completely prevented focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FGS) and proteinuria, but significantly enhanced intimal hyperplasia. Untreated allografted rats revealed marked vascular ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase activity, which increased with ACEi. Vascular ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase activity was absent in <b>syngrafted</b> animals. Ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase activity correlated well with intimal hyperplasia. Glomerular ecto-ATPase expression was significantly reduced in untreated allografted rats compared to <b>syngrafted</b> rats and correlated well with the extent of FGS. ACEi prevented reduction in glomerular ecto-ATPase. We found de-novo expression of ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase at sites of renal intimal hyperplasia. Glomerular ecto-ATPase expression was markedly reduced in allografted rats and was prevented by ACEi. These enzyme expression patterns suggest local ischemic damage in experimental CRTF...|$|R
40|$|Using {{differential}} mRNA {{display to}} uncover potential mediators associated with chronic rejection, we identified a cDNA fragment induced in Lewis to F 344 rat cardiac allografts with arteriosclerosis but not Lewis <b>syngrafts.</b> The full-length cDNA (1. 4 kb) isolated from a rat cardiac allograft cDNA library was 99 % identical to galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) macrophage lectin, a cell-surface receptor. This cDNA hybridized in Northern analysis with total RNA from eight cardiac allografts {{but not with}} host hearts, <b>syngrafts,</b> or other organs. There was a significant allograft-specific increase in transcript levels measured by reverse transcriptase PCR at days 7, 14, 28, and 75 in comparison with paired F 344 host hearts (subject to same circulation but histologically normal), day- 0 hearts, and <b>syngrafts</b> (P < 0. 008, n = 4 at each time). Transcript levels in cardiac allografts were higher than those in paired host spleens (a major source of inflammatory cells) (P < 0. 0001), indicating the localized nature of Gal/GalNAc lectin induction. By in situ hybridization and immunostaining, Gal/GalNAc lectin expression localized to a subset of inflammatory cells in cardiac allografts. These findings link Gal/GalNAc macrophage lectin to the chronic rejection process, as a possible mediator of macrophage infiltration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{a major cause of}} death {{following}} renal transplantation. Mechanisms leading to vascular dysfunction outside the transplanted organ involve common risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, proteinuria, but immune-mediated factors may also be involved. We hypothesized that transplantation-associated risk factors are involved in the development of vascular dysfunction following renal transplantation. Methods: Vascular function was studied in Fisher to Lewis allografts. Lewis to Lewis <b>syngrafted</b> rats served as controls. All rats received cyclo-sporin A for 10 days. Allografts were treated with ACE inhibition or AT 1 receptor blockade or left untreated. After 34 weeks, aorta rings were studied for contractile and dilator responses in {{the presence or absence of}} L-NMMA and/or indomethacin. Tissue sections were immunostained for COX- 1 and COX- 2. Results: In contrast to <b>syngrafts</b> and treated allografts, untreated allografts developed proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia. In aortic rings, NOS inhibition similarly increased contractile responses and decreased dilator responses in <b>syngrafts</b> and allografts, indicating comparable NO pathways. In contrast, indomethacin affected contractile and dilator responses in <b>syngrafts,</b> but not in treated and untreated allografts, indicating absence of COX-derived prostanoids in control over vascular tone in allografts. This was in line with immunohistologic analysis demonstrating reduced aortic COX- 2 expression in allografts. COX- 1 expression was unaltered. Interestingly, RAS blockade quantitatively increased endothelium-dependent dilation without qualitatively altering COX function and expression. Conclusion: Involvement of COX-derived prostaglandins in vascular endothelial function outside the transplanted organ is strongly diminished after allogeneic renal transplantation. RAS blockade improves common cardiovascular risk factors and endothelium-dependent dilation, but fails to restore prostaglandin function. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG...|$|R

Accepted manuscript online: 15 October 2016 Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is unavoidably caused by loss and subsequent restoration of blood flow during organ procurement and prolonged IRI results in increased rates of delayed graft function and early graft loss. The endogenously produced gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), is a novel molecule that mitigates hypoxic tissue injury. The current study investigates the protective mitochondrial effects of H 2 S during in vivo cold storage and subsequent renal transplantation (RTx) and in vitro cold hypoxic renal injury. Donor allografts from Brown Norway rats treated with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution + H 2 S (150 μM NaSH) during prolonged (24 -hour) cold (4 °C) storage exhibited significantly (p 1000 -fold compared to similar levels of the non-specific H 2 S donor, GYY 4137 and also improved <b>syngraft</b> function and survival following prolonged cold storage compared to UW. H 2 S treatment mitigates cold IRI-associated renal injury via mitochondrial actions and could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to minimize the detrimental clinical outcomes of prolonged cold IRI during RTx.

40|$|Long-term {{renin-angiotensin system}} {{blockade}} is beneficial {{in a variety}} of renal diseases, This study examines the long-term (34 weeks) effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II receptor type I blocker L 158, 809 in the Fisher to Lewis rat model of chronic renal transplant failure, Treatment in allografted rats with lisinopril or L 158, 809 was initiated 10 days after transplantation, or at the time when proteinuria exceeded 50 mg/ 24 h, Untreated allografts and <b>syngrafts</b> served as controls, In contrast to <b>syngrafts,</b> untreated allografts developed proteinuria, hypercholesterolaemia, interstitial damage, and glomerulosclerosis, Lisinopril or L 158, 809 treatment in allografts starting at day 10 after transplantation completely prevented this with the exception of interstitial damage, but this treatment also caused a reduction in blood pressure and renal function. Moreover, the intimal surface area of the renal arteries was dramatically increased in allografts treated with either lisinopril or L 158, 809 compared with untreated allografted rats, Treatment once proteinuria had developed was less effective in preventing glomerulosclerosis, but also caused less intimal expansion. Thus, chronic renin-angiotensin system blockade preserves glomerular morphology in the absence of proteinuria, but enhances intimal hyperplasia and reduces renal function in experimental transplantation. In view of these results, it should be questioned whether such treatment benefits renal transplant patients in the long term. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of these immune cells and the synthesis patterns of the T(h) 1 - and T(h) 2 -cytokine IL- 12 and IL- 10 during the early course after transplantation (Tx). Orthotopic single-lung Tx was performed in Lewis to Lewis (<b>syngrafts)</b> and Brown Norway/Lewis F(1) hybrid to Lewis (allografts). Naïve lungs, <b>syngrafts</b> after 5 days and allografts after 3 and 5 days were analyzed for CD 68 (+), CD 163 (+) and CD 3 (+) cells by immunohistochemistry and IL- 12 and IL- 10 were detected by immunofluorescence. CD 68 (+) macrophages increased in number after allogeneic Tx compared to syngeneic Tx on day 5 (P<. 001), CD 163 (+) macrophages sequestrated early around veins (day 3) compared to the accumulation around arteries and bronchioles (P<. 001) while CD 3 (+) T cells were scarce. There was a predominance of IL- 12 over IL- 10 on day 5 after allogeneic Tx (P<. 001). CD 68 (+) macrophages were the most abundant cells during acute pulmonary rejection and CD 163 (+) macrophages showed a characteristic distribution pattern over time around vessels and bronchioles. The up-regulation of IL- 12 reflects an early response after allo-antigen exposure, indicating a strong impact of the initiation of the T(h) 1 pathway at an early phase during acute lung rejection...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, using RIT with 177 Lu as the payload, we {{have shown}} that La-targeted RIT is well tolerated and able to inhibit growth of LL 2 tumour <b>syngrafts</b> pre-treated with chemotherapy. Moreover, the {{addition}} of a PARPi potentiated the anti-tumour effects of both chemotherapy and RIT. Additional approaches such as repeated cycles of RIT, conjugation to α-emitting radionuclides, or chemo-RIT combinations with inhibitors of EGFR signalling, cell cycle checkpoints, or DNA repair, may contribute to eradication of LL 2 tumours. Nonetheless, here we demonstrate the principle that bystander killing by a short-range β-emitter is a feasible and active approach to the treatment of lung cancer. This approach may find clinical application as consolidation treatment for such standard treatments as platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy in advanced disease and adjuvant settings.|$|R

To this end, we have striven to establish an in vitro organ factory to build up complex organ structures from autologous adult stem cells by using the kidney as a target organ.

40|$|Background The Fisher to Lewis (F-L) {{model of}} renal {{transplantation}} (Rtx) is widely used. Rtx from F to L without immunosuppressive treatment results in 50 % survival, whereas L to F results in survival rates similar to <b>syngrafts.</b> When treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or antihypertensive triple therapy, renal damage is markedly reduced in F-L allografts. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, the ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) {{is more effective}} than antihypertensive triple therapy, suggesting that the inhibition of intrarenal ACE plays an additional role in the attenuation of renal damage. Methods In the present study, we investigated strain-related differences in intrarenal ACE activity between F and L rats and whether treatment with ACE-I in F-L allografted rats results in reduction of intrarenal ACE. Intrarenal ACE was measured by activity assays, immunohistochemistry and PCR.

40|$|At present, the {{diagnosis}} of renal allograft rejection requires a renal biopsy. Clinical management of renal transplant patients would be improved if rapid, noninvasive and reliable biomarkers of rejection were available. This study is designed to determine whether such protein biomarkers {{can be found in}} renal-graft tissue proteomic approach. Orthotopic kidney transplantations were performed using Fisher (F 344) or Lewis rats as donors and Lewis rats as recipients. Hence, there were two groups of renal transplant models: one is allograft (from F 344 to Lewis rats); another is <b>syngrafts</b> (from Lewis to Lewis rats) serving as control. Renal tissues were collected 3, 7 and 14 days after transplantation. As many as 18 samples were analyzed by 2 -D Electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS). Eleven differentially expressed proteins were identified between groups. In conclusion, proteomic technology can detect renal tissue proteins associated with acute renal allograft rejection. Identification of these proteins as diagnostic markers for rejection in patients&#x 2032; urine or sera may be useful and non-invasive, and these proteins might serve as novel therapeutic targets that also help to improve the understanding of mechanism of renal rejection...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of arteriosclerotic lesions in the Lewis to F 344 rat model of chronic cardiac rejection {{is characterized by}} macrophage adhesion to the vessel lumen and macrophage infiltration in the neointima prior to smooth muscle cell accumulation. We report the cloning and characterization of allograft inflammatory factor- 1 (AIF- 1), a novel cDNA that is expressed early and persistently in chronically rejecting cardiac allografts but is absent in cardiac <b>syngrafts</b> and host hearts.

Analysis of isolated cell populations confirmed that AIF- 1 was selectively expressed in macrophages and neutrophils and demonstrated that AIF- 1 transcripts could be upregulated by sixfold after stimulation with the T cell-derived cytokine IFN-gamma.

40|$|Background: Insulin-producing cell {{clusters}} (IPCCs) {{have recently}} been generated in vitro from adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) to circumvent islet shortage. However, it is unknown how long they can survive upon transplantation, whether they are eventually rejected by recipients, and how their long-term survival can be induced to permanently cure type 1 diabetes. IPCC graft survival is critical for their clinical application and this issue must be systematically addressed prior to their in-depth clinical trials. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we found that IPCC grafts that differentiated from murine ASCs in vitro, unlike their freshly isolated islet counterparts, did not survive long-term in syngeneic mice, suggesting that ASC-derived IPCCs have intrinsic survival disadvantage over freshly isolated islets. Indeed, b cells retrieved from IPCC <b>syngrafts</b> underwent faster apoptosis than their islet counterparts. However, blocking both Fas and TNF receptor death pathways inhibited their apoptosis and restored their long-term survival in syngeneic recipients. Furthermore, blocking CD 40 -CD 154 costimulation and Fas/TNF signaling induced long-term IPCC allograft survival in overwhelming majority of recipients. Importantly, Fas-deficient IPCC allografts exhibited certain immune privilege and enjoyed long-term survival in diabetic NOD mice {{in the presence of}} CD 28 /CD 40 joint blockade while their islet counterparts failed to do so.

Recent studies revealed that regulatory T cells (Tregs), hepatic satellite cells and Kupffer cells play a potential role in spontaneous {{immune tolerance}}, however the precise mechanism of spontaneous immune tolerance is still undefined. By using Microarray Chips, we investigated different immune regulatory factors to decipher critical mechanisms of spontaneous tolerance after mouse liver transplantation. Allogeneic (C 57 BL/ 6 -C 3 H) and syngeneic (C 3 H-C 3 H) liver transplantation were performed by 6 - 8 weeks old male C 57 BL/ 6 and C 3 H mice. Graft samples (N = 4 each group) were collected from 8 weeks post-operation mice. 11 differentially expressed miRNAs in allogeneic grafts (Allografts) vs. syngeneic grafts (<b>Syngrafts)</b> were identified using Agilent Mouse miRNA Chips. It was revealed that 185 genes were modified by the 11 miRNAs, furthermore, within the 185 target genes, 11 of them were tightly correlated with immune regulation after Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and Genbank data cross-comparison.

40|$|In renal {{transplant}}ation, chronic renal transplant failure (CRTF) is {{the principal}} cause of late graft loss. Both immunological and non-immunological factors {{play a role in}} the pathogenesis of CRTF. However, CRTF is unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy. In several kidney diseases, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has shown to reduce the rate of progression of renal disease more effectively than conventional antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, RAS blockade may be of benefit in the treatment of CRTF. Several short-term studies in human renal transplant recipients showed that RAS blockade had a beneficial effect on renal transplant function, blood pressure and proteinuria. Despite these benefits physicians remain reluctant to use ACE inhibition in these recipients, because of fear of functional decrease in renal perfusion, especially in the setting of renal transplant artery stenosis. To study the long-term effects of RAS blockade we used the established Fisher to Lewis (F-L) model for CRTF, which mirrors the progressive changes seen in humans. Studies in our lab and by others showed that RAS blockade in the F-L model prevents proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and hypertension. However, when treated for 34 weeks with RAS blockade, renal arteries developed severe intimal hyperplasia. This effect was specific for Fisher rats. <b>Syngrafted</b> Fisher rats treated with ACE inhibition developed intimal hyperplasia, but allografting significantly aggravated it. Fisher rats have a four times higher renal ACE activity, compared with the Lewis rat. This is comparable to the human DD/II genotype differences in ACE activity. Renal transplant patients with the DD genotype may be more vulnerable for vascular changes when treated with RAS blockade...|$|R
