5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with <b>soft</b> <b>hornwort</b> in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|The shingle ridge {{that protects}} the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. In the damper areas, sea wormwood, sea {{lavender}} and scrubby sea-blite also thrive.

50|$|A {{number of}} plant species which are {{otherwise}} scarce or absent in the Bristol region {{are found in}} high concentrations on the North Somerset Levels, including Water Horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile), Rigid (Ceratophyllum demersum) and <b>Soft</b> (C. submersum) <b>hornworts,</b> Thread-leaved (Ranunculus trichophyllus), Common (R. aquatilis) and Fan-leaved (R. circinatus) water-crowfoots, Lesser Water-parsnip (Berula erecta), Tubular (Oenanthe fistulosa) and Fine-leaved (O. aquatica) water-dropworts, Tufted Forget-me-not (Myosotis laxa ssp. caespitosa), Skullcap and Fen Bedstraw. Water-violet (Hottonia palustris) is found here, mainly in the Nailsea & Tickenham areas, but also in scattered locations further south; this species is found nowhere else in the Bristol region. The introduced water fern Azolla filiculoides is widespread throughout.|$|R
50|$|Ceratophyllum submersum, {{commonly}} known as the <b>soft</b> <b>hornwort,</b> is a species of Ceratophyllum. It is a submerged, free-floating aquatic plant. It has been reported from Europe, Central Asia, northern Africa, scattered places in tropical Africa, Turkey, Oman, Florida, and the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5000|$|These {{unimproved}} wet meadows {{are described}} by Natural England {{as important for}} their outstanding assemblages of invertebrates, with many nationally rare and scarce species, and of national significance for its assemblage of breeding birds typical of wet grassland. The aquatic fauna is diverse, including the nationally scarce <b>soft</b> <b>hornwort</b> and fen pondweed.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the site}} is owned and managed by the Ministry of Defence. Natural England {{describes}} it as [...] "extensive intertidal sand-silt flats, saltmarsh, beaches, grazing marshes, rough grass and scrubland". The flats are of international importance for nine species of wildfowl and waders, such as dark-bellied brent geese. Rare plants include <b>soft</b> <b>hornwort</b> and spiral tasselwood, and the site is also important for invertebrates, with 71 nationally rare species.|$|E
5000|$|Freshwater ditch communities, which lie mainly {{along the}} western side of the SSSI area, are {{recognised}} as being of [...] "being of international importance" [...] and support species such as broad-leaved pondweed Potamogeton natans, water violet Hottonia palustris and the nationally scarce whorled water milfoil Myriophyllum verticillatum. Other areas of ditches support species such as the nationally scarce water soldier Stratiotes alludes, fen pondweed Potamogeton coloratus, hairlike pondweed Potamogeton trichoides and water parsnip Sium latifolium. The area of ditch close to Breydon Water are more brackish in nature and feature species such as <b>soft</b> <b>hornwort</b> Ceratophyllum submersum and the nationally scarce stiff saltmarsh grass Puccinellia rupestris.|$|E
5000|$|In 1955 Shrawley Wood (103.1 {{hectares}} or 254.8 acres), {{was designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its Biological interest. The site was selected {{because it is a}} large tract of ancient woodland almost completely dominated by coppiced Small-leaved Lime. [...] "...This type of woodland is a feature of eastern England and its occurrence here is unusual in the West Midlands. The woodland also {{has a long history of}} management with records going back to the beginning of the eighteenth century. ... The streams and pools included in this site add to the site's conservation value ... the rare <b>soft</b> <b>hornwort</b> occurs in one of the pools. Over 400 species of fungi have been recorded in the woodland. ...".|$|E
