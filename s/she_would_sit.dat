25|$|In {{her later}} years, Stuart took {{a house in}} London at 108, Gloucester Place, Marylebone, and from there she walked in Regent's Park. At home, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> with her books, and {{although}} something of a recluse, on occasion she was also highly sociable. She destroyed many of her manuscripts, but continued to write letters and to talk and to visit great houses. A few months before her death, she was sketched by Sir George Hayter, and died at home in London on 4 August 1851.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{included}} the song on her setlist for her 2011 world concert tour entitled California Dreams Tour. For {{performances of the}} song, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> on a flower-entwined bower swing that rises up to reveal a large white bridal train that flows out to complete the entire backdrop. At the same time, a bubble machine started-up and the bed-sheet hanging behind her showed footage of cartoon animals falling in love. In a review {{of one of her}} concerts Ed Masley from The Arizona Republic called her performance of [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was [...] "sweet".|$|E
500|$|In January 1866 George was {{appointed}} headmaster of Liverpool College, {{and the family}} moved to premises in the Dingle area. Despite the new surroundings, Josephine continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.|$|E
60|$|The child bore this out, for <b>she</b> <b>would</b> neither <b>sit</b> alone nor {{go to her}} mother.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> always <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> on {{that little}} stool. I think {{she must have}} had a kind of notion that it was a coaxing, wheedling little stool.|$|R
50|$|McGowan's {{daughter}} Jerry was {{an actress}} and dancer herself; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> often <b>sit</b> in on Our Gang story meetings and appears onscreen in Shivering Shakespeare.|$|R
500|$|Texas {{entered the}} yard's {{floating}} drydock at approximately 22:30 on 13 December, at high tide with only [...] to spare between her hull and the blocks <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> on. She underwent a 14-month refit {{that sought to}} restore the ship to her 1945 condition. While under refit, yard workers sand-blasted paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull. Inside the ship, welders and fabricators replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted-out deck plates. Topside, workers removed the concrete from the main deck and made repairs. (A new pinewood deck would be installed in Green's Bayou.) In total, more than [...] of steel (amounting to about 15% of the ship's hull) was replaced and more than 40,000 rivets were seal-welded on the underwater hull.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
500|$|During testing, Nordby and {{the special}} effects teams {{realized}} that getting Fox {{in and out of}} the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming. To remedy this, they hired a photo double. [...] "very day (for about 10 days) <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in a chair with this full appliance on her and we would shoot this jaw, and then all [...] would have to do is the dentures", stated Nordby. He said that [...] "when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [...] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [...] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked". The camera accompanied them in the same way, as [...] "it would roll and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face" [...] in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear contact lenses and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. [...] "But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get", said Nordby. [...] "KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] she {{returned}} with dignity, indicating {{with a gesture}} of her hand that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> down again. [...] "I am sorry {{to ask you to}} come so far." ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{trembling}} {{so much that}} I wanted to bring her in and make her rest; but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> only <b>sit</b> down on the step of the stile, and there she whispered it, in this way.|$|R
60|$|The {{last evening}} for many weeks that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> thus <b>sit</b> with him,--the last that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{ever be a}} part of his home. She had already ceased to belong entirely to him; she who had always been the most {{precious}} to him, except his mother.|$|R
2500|$|She first {{appeared}} in WCW as a [...] "fan" [...] of Rick Steiner named Robin Green, wearing a Steiner T-shirt and large glasses. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in the audience and would interact with Steiner whenever he appeared. She eventually turned on him, aligning herself with Kevin Sullivan and adopting the name Woman and became the manager of Doom (Butch Reed and Ron Simmons). After leaving Doom, she aligned herself with Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 September 2006, Short {{announced}} {{that she would not}} be standing at the next general election. In a brief statement, Short said she was [...] "ashamed" [...] of Tony Blair's government and backed proportional representation, which she hoped would be achieved through a hung parliament. The Labour Party Chief Whip referred the matter to the Labour Party National Executive Committee to consider disciplinary action. On Friday 20 October, Short resigned the Labour whip and {{announced that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> as an Independent Labour MP. Short received a written reprimand from Labour's Chief Whip shortly before the news of her resignation of the party whip was announced.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse adhered {{strictly}} {{to the rule}} which forbade all superfluous talk during work. She saw her sisters together only in the hours of common recreation after meals. At such times <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> down beside whomever she happened to be near, or beside a nun whom she had observed to be downcast, disregarding the tacit and sometimes expressed sensitivity and even jealousy of her biological sisters. [...] "We must apologize to the others for our being four under one roof", {{she was in the}} habit of remarking. [...] "When I am dead, you must be very careful not to lead a family life with one another...I did not come to Carmel to be with my sisters; on the contrary, I saw clearly that their presence would cost me dear, for I was determined not to give way to nature." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> down, but {{stood by}} the fire dipping her inky middle finger in the egg-cup, which {{contained}} vinegar, and smearing it over the ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very gloomy.|$|R
60|$|BALSQUITH (ambling calmly to the hearth). This is the {{business}} of the Sergeant at Arms rather than of the leader of the House. Theres no use in my tackling Mrs. Banger: <b>she</b> <b>would</b> only <b>sit</b> on my head too.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Forel's {{eyes were}} hazy. [...] "I {{think she has}} given way at last--it was awful at first when <b>she</b> <b>would</b> only <b>sit</b> and look at me," [...] she said; and then her voice sank a little, [...] "How did it happen, Tom?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1888, {{newly married}} and having moved to Manhattan [...] from her parents' home, Cotton sought {{to become a}} student of William Merritt Chase. He agreed to teach her {{and at the same}} time asked whether <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> for a portrait. In 1908 Chase {{described}} the meeting: [...] "One morning a young lady came into my Tenth street studio, just as I was leaving for an art class in Brooklyn. She came as a pupil, but the moment she appeared before me I saw her only as a splendid model. Half way to the elevated station I stopped, hastened back, and overtook her. She consented to sit for me; and I painted that day, without an interruption, till late in the evening. The result is the Lady in Black, now hung in the Metropolitan Museum." [...] In 1889 a second Chase portrait of her, [...] "Lady in Pink," [...] was shown at the Spring Exhibition at the National Academy of Design in New York.|$|E
2500|$|The {{front office}} knew {{something}} had to be done to save the team from another disappointing finish. During the 2007–08 off-season, the Connecticut Sun made major changes to their roster in an effort to win that ever-elusive championship title. The Sun made three trades, one sending Katie Douglas, the face of the franchise, to the Indiana Fever, a deal that signaled the end of the partnership that led the Sun to consecutive WNBA Finals appearances. In return, the Sun received Tamika Whitmore who would surely create a physical presence in the paint, something that the Sun had been lacking in previous years. Following that monumental trade, Nykesha Sales announced <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> out the 2008 season due to multiple nagging injuries. 7'2" [...] center Margo Dydek also took the season off due to her pregnancy. With three former starters missing from the Sun lineup, most sports critics and publications predicted the team to finish fourth in the East. Some even claimed the Sun would finish sixth, only ahead of the expansion Atlanta Dream.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{first order}} of {{business}} was to settle the Paul MacEwan question. On December 9, 1980, she managed to get her former leadership rivals to vote MacEwan out of the caucus and party. Since she did not have a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, the party was left with just two seats, because MacEwan was now an independent, and Akerman's seat was left vacant due to his resignation. For almost a year, [...] <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in the Assembly's visitors gallery until she could run for a seat in the 1981 Nova Scotia general election. McDonough's first provincial [...] election as leader was fought in the Halifax Chebucto riding, where the Liberals and Conservatives were more or less evenly matched in terms of voter support, and the NDP was a distant third in the previous election. [...] She won her seat, the first one for the NDP in Mainland Nova Scotia, but the NDP lost all of its Cape Breton Island seats in the process. She spent the next three years as the only New Democrat, and the only woman in the House of Assembly. She took on the [...] "old boys' network", that permeated within Nova Scotia's politics at the time, by attempting to dismantle the province's entrenched patronage system.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> often <b>sit</b> {{and swing}} on a low-bending grape-vine, that hung between two lofty trees, {{sometimes}} singing, and sometimes {{listening to the}} insects that hummed around her, {{and all the while}} as happy a Kate as any Kate in the world.|$|R
50|$|In the House, the Speaker {{does not}} vote on any motion, except {{in order to}} resolve ties. After leaving office, the Speaker {{normally}} takes no part in party politics; if elevated to the House of Lords, he or <b>she</b> <b>would</b> normally <b>sit</b> as a crossbencher.|$|R
60|$|Whether or no Nick {{were afraid}} of Mrs. Dallow he still waved away this bounty, protesting that he would rather take a stall {{according}} to his wont and pay for it. Which led his guest to declare with a sudden flicker of passion that if he didn't do as <b>she</b> wished <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>sit</b> to him again.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> {{with her}} two slim hands [...] Clasped round her bended knees; While we on our elbows lolled, [...] And stared at ease.|$|E
60|$|Aline stood {{where he}} had left her, leaning on the balustrade. In the {{fullness}} of time there came to her the recollection she had promised Freddie that shortly after luncheon <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Frank--I {{hope it is}} {{only the}} shock and fatigue; but Dr. Worth wished him to be kept as quiet as possible. He can't bear to see any one in the room, so that good Anne said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in Charlie's room close by." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could imagine}} the lengths to which the thirst of vengeance would urge a scorned woman, and of all women he felt that Cecile scorned was the most to be feared. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> with folded hands. Once she overcame the first tempestuous {{outburst}} of her passion <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be up and doing, straining every sense to outwit and thwart him in his project, whose scope she must have more than guessed.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{declared}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> also <b>sit</b> in the veranda all night; and, {{as a matter}} of course, they were joined by Mrs. Growler. They had been so seated about an hour when Kate Daly {{declared that}} the heavens were on fire. The two young women jumped up, flew to the gate, and found that the whole western horizon was lurid with a dark red light.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know." [...] Cynthia {{turned away}} with a {{trembling}} chin, and began to beat the coffee up with an egg she had dropped into the pot. She put the breakfast on the table when it was ready, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> down with the rest. She {{said she did not}} want any breakfast, and she drank {{a cup of coffee in}} the kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah; if you {{had seen}} her in Florence, as I used to see her, in the long Summer evenings! Her lovely hair was all loose to the wind, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> hour after hour looking, oh, at the stars! Have you seen the stars in Italy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As to Paulina, {{the child}} was at once happy and mute, busy and watchful. Her father {{frequently}} lifted her to his knee; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> there till she felt or fancied he grew restless; then it was--"Papa, put me down; I shall tire you with my weight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, she {{was ever}} of a {{contented}} spirit. I mind her, {{when she was}} a tiny child; if no one would play with her, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> by the hour talking with her dolls, till someone could spare time to perch her on his shoulder, and take her out." ...|$|E
50|$|When her {{daughter}} {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate in 2000, she moved to Washington, D.C., living along Connecticut Avenue. She appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2004. Once living alone became too much for her, in 2006, she moved into the Clintons' large Whitehaven house in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C. There <b>she</b> <b>would</b> often <b>sit</b> and discuss the day when {{her daughter}} came home from work.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{when the}} dance was over, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> down, <b>she</b> walked away. He came {{with his arm}} round her, keeping her upon the {{movement}} of his walking. And she seemed to agree. She was bright {{as a piece of}} moonlight, as bright as a steel blade, he seemed to be clasping a blade that hurt him. Yet he would clasp her, if it killed him.|$|R
6000|$|Presently Rose looked up, {{and meeting}} the bright {{pleasant}} eyes, observed--"Violetta {{has been very}} good, and said all her lessons quite perfect, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>sit</b> up till her Aunt Ailie comes home. Do you think she may?" ...|$|R
