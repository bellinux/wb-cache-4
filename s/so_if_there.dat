5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{principles}} of stare decisis (judicial precedent), the High Court is bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal. In turn, decisions of the High Court must be followed by District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. On the other hand, a Judge of the High Court is not bound by previous decisions by other High Court Judges. As a matter of comity, though, a Court will generally not depart from a previous decision {{unless there is a}} good reason to do <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> are conflicting High Court decisions, {{it is up to the}} Court of Appeal to decide which decision is correct.|$|E
500|$|For the plutonium-producing {{production}} reactors, {{the same}} reasons mandated the use of natural uranium fuel and graphite as a moderator; but it was originally assumed {{that they would be}} water-cooled like the American reactors at the Hanford Site. A water-cooled reactor of the required size would require about [...] of water per day, preferably very pure so as to avoid corroding the metal pipes. Moreover, there were concerns about safety. Water absorbs neutrons, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a sudden loss of cooling water this will result in an increase in the neutron flux and the reactor temperature, and possibly a catastrophic nuclear meltdown. Such an event did indeed occur in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The American solution was to locate the facility in a remote location, but in the densely-populated British Isles the only such locations were in the north and west of Scotland. By April 1947, Hinton had convinced Portal of the advantages of a gas-cooled system. Helium was at first the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, So, in the end, air cooling was chosen.|$|E
500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky {{became the}} second game to use Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, after Lure of the Temptress. According to Cecil, the {{original}} version of the engine seemed less applicable in Beneath a Steel Sky, {{as the ability to}} issue commands conflicted with the gameplay they intended to create. Lure of the Temptress had one story that was moved forward by a key event, whereas Beneath a Steel Sky had multiple threads. In one way this presented them with [...] "exciting gameplay opportunities, but in others it cordoned off more ambitious ideas in terms of multilinearity." [...] As a consequence, some of the engine's features were scaled back. Tony Warriner and David Sykes, both Revolution co-founders and programmers, had to update the engine, which was part of the new deal with Virgin Interactive. As an example of change in the updated engine, Virtual Theatre 2.0, Warriner explained that in Lure of the Temptress, the system controlled everything, for instance specific routines to a door. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was a door on-screen, the door-routine was called up to handle it. The consequence was that every door looked the same and acted the same, so if a door was somewhat different from the last one, it caused a problem. This was changed in the new system, as it was object oriented and no distinction was made between a proper object like a door or key.|$|E

As a result, it's clear that although in Japanese there's the direction of up and down, the direction is influneced by the idea of consideration.

2500|$|High power optical {{amplifiers}} {{are used}} in long distance systems. They use internal pump lasers with power levels up a few watts, which is a major hazard. However these power levels are contained within the amplifier module. Any system employing typical optical connectors (i.e. not expanded beam) cannot typically exceed about 100nbsp&mW, above which power level single mode connectors become unreliable, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a single mode connector in the system, the design power level will always be below this level, even if no other details are known [...] An additional factor with these systems is that light around the 1550nbsp&nm wavelength band (common for optical amplifiers) is regarded as relatively low risk, since the eye fluids absorb the light before it {{is focused on the}} retina. This tends to reduce the overall risk factor of such systems.|$|E

However, the original sarcophagus was not replaced; instead, the mausoleum, which is open to visitors, now has two sarcophagi: the marble one placed on the side and the original wooden one, which covers Saladin's tomb.

2500|$|Harris holds nuanced {{views about}} Israel and Judaism. He has said, [...] "I don't think Israel should {{exist as a}} Jewish state.

In January 2010, however, the council deleted references to the redevelopment of the site. Simon Danzcuk, the Rochdale Labour Party parliamentary candidate, has warned that the council believe a housing development on the site is an inevitability and that they are [...] "sleepwalking into a catastrophic mistake."

2500|$|The Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle {{was first}} {{listed on the}} {{endangered}} species list on September 16, 1988. Threats to the beetle include loss of habitat due to urban development, invasive species, and mining. Urban development is the number one threat to the beetle and affects their karst environment in many different ways. For instance, urban development may lead to the filling in or collapse of caves, alteration of drainage patterns, alteration of surface plant and animal communities, as well as contamination and human visitation. Many caves are filled in or collapsed during road and building construction. A solid foundation is required for construction to take place <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a cave in the way it will be collapsed and filled for a sturdy foundation. Road development destroys a majority of the karst habitats where the beetles live. It is estimated that 10% of all caves in Travis County are destroyed every ten years. Some ranchers even lead to the problem. Many of them fill the entrances to the caves so their livestock do not roam into the caves. This blocks the air movement in the cave changing the conditions in the cave. If conditions are not just right the beetle will die. Large paved areas and drainage systems that are put in during urban development alter the natural drainage patterns causing major problems to karst environments. This environment depends on air filled gaps and infiltration from water above, diverting water away from a cave can dry it up killing all the species inside. If water is diverted into a cave it can flood and alter living conditions. Altering surface plant and animal communities affects karst environments as well. When these communities are removed for development many of the nutrients that originally entered the cave are now lost. Without nutrients the beetle and other karst invertebrates can not survive. If a substantial amount of vegetation is removed, infiltration will increase changing their delicate habitat. The caves also face the threat of contamination when developing close to their habitat. Karst is very susceptible to groundwater contamination so when sewer and drainage systems are put in contaminated water can enter the caves. Many of the caves in Travis County are used for disposal of refuse and have probable killed most organisms within the cave. Farming as well leads to the contamination of habitat. Fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural waste can infiltrate through the ground contaminating the groundwater that enters the cave. The final way urban development has increased the loss of habitat is by increased human visitation. When humans build close to a species habitat it likely that visitation to the cave will increase. Some species are scared off by this new visitation. If one species leaves it often affects the whole chain of that ecosystem. Some caves are vandalized so much so that it changes the environment in which the beetle lives.|$|E
