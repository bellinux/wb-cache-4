5|$|Rhodocene {{exists as}} , a {{paramagnetic}} 19-valence electron radical monomer only {{at or below}} −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150°C in the gas phase. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure.</b> At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure</b> of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure</b> with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure</b> of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with {{a greater degree of}} π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures</b> {{are finding}} {{increasingly}} widespread use in fields ranging from aerospace and wind turbines to sports {{applications such as}} skis and surfboards. The high specific stiffness that composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures</b> can provide lends them well to these applications. However, the operational environment of these structures is frequently aggressive and often results in damage during service. The extent and effect of damage incurred {{is an important factor}} in the design and maintenance of composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures.</b> Failure of an individual component can be catastrophic for the rest of the structure. The purpose of this investigation was, firstly, to ascertain whether DSP was a viable technique for determining strain fields within composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures.</b> Secondly, to determine whether four point flexure would give rise to pure flexure between the central rollers, and if not, to understand what load conditions were present. This investigation was also carried out with a view to extend the investigation into the effect of defects on composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures</b> manufactured by RIFT. The grounds for selection of composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures</b> normally lie in their flexural performance. Reliable and accurate quantitative testing methods for evaluating the flexural performance of sandwich panels are needed if composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures</b> are to be used safely and effectively. In addition, methods to determine the effect of damage and defects on flexural behaviour of <b>sandwich</b> <b>structures</b> is particularly important for designing the repair and maintenance regimes of composite sandwich components...|$|R

25|$|The Lynx is a {{multi-purpose}} twin-engine battlefield helicopter, {{of which}} specialized versions {{have been developed}} for both sea and land-based warfare. A distinguishing feature between early and later aircraft is the undercarriage: early Army versions of the Lynx were equipped with skids, while the Naval and later models have been outfitted with wheels, a requirement for easy ground handling on the deck of a warship. Early versions of the Lynx were powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem turboshaft engines, which powered a four-blade rotor. Mounted on a rigid titanium monobloc rotor head of the kind pioneered by the MBB BO105 a few years earlier. The innovative blade design comprised a honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure</b> and made out of composite material. For shipboard stowage, both the rotor blades and tail can be folded. Lag dampers were incorporated but these are not required in flight (owing to the rigidity of the monobloc rotor head). In flight, the main rotor is kept at a constant speed, simplifying aircraft control; the rotor also features a vibration absorption system.|$|E
500|$|Ferrocene was an {{extremely}} important compound in {{the early history of}} the branch of organometallic chemistry, and to this day iron {{is still one of the}} most important metals in this field. It was first synthesised in 1951 during an attempt to prepare the fulvalene (C10H8) by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene; the resultant product was found to have molecular formula C10H10Fe and reported to exhibit [...] "remarkable stability". The discovery sparked substantial interest in the field of organometallic chemistry, in part because the structure proposed by Pauson and Kealy (shown at right) was inconsistent with then-existing bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability. Consequently, the initial challenge was to definitively determine the structure of ferrocene in the hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood. The shockingly novel <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure,</b> , was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952: Robert Burns Woodward and Geoffrey Wilkinson investigated the reactivity in order to determine the structure and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule (such as benzene), Ernst Otto Fischer deduced the <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure</b> and also began synthesising other metallocenes including cobaltocene; Eiland and Pepinsky provided X-ray crystallographic confirmation of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
