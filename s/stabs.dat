40|$|BACKGROUND Instillation of {{contrast}} medium into <b>stab</b> wounds has shown promising results regarding visibility {{and assessment of}} general <b>stab</b> direction with computed tomography. However, the accuracy of this method [...] and, incidentally also probing of <b>stab</b> wounds [...] has to our knowledge not previously been examined. Also the effect of bluntness of different <b>stabbing</b> objects on the examination of <b>stab</b> wounds was not considered before this study. METHODS Using a pocket-knife, a steak-knife, and a Phillips screwdriver, nine <b>stab</b> wounds each were inflicted to three pork haunches. The depths of the <b>stab</b> wounds were determined by probing and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) after instillation of a contrast medium (CM) and then compared to those observed by dissection, our internal "gold standard". RESULTS In <b>stab</b> wounds inflicted by knives, MSCT-CM and probing provided results which differed by roughly 10 - 11...|$|R
50|$|A <b>stab</b> vest, or <b>stab</b> proof vest is a {{reinforced}} {{piece of}} body armor, worn under or over other items of clothing, {{which is designed}} to resist knife attacks to the chest, back and sides. <b>Stab</b> vests are different from bulletproof vests, most of which offer protection against firearms but afford little against <b>stabbing</b> with sharp-tipped objects such as knives; most <b>stab</b> vests afford less protection against bullets, particularly those of high caliber, but are designed to prevent serious injury by prohibiting knife penetration beyond a few millimeters. <b>Stab</b> vests are also needle and slash proof.|$|R
