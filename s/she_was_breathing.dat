60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> quickly. He {{could see}} the tears in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Jill was pale, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> quickly, but {{she forced}} a smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> quickly. He {{started to}} speak, {{but she went}} on, looking {{straight}} before her. Her face was very white in the moon-light.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The Sleeping Beauty is {{the oldest}} {{existing}} figure on display. It was modeled after Madame du Barry. She appears asleep and a device in her chest makes {{it seem as if}} <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} trust not, Myra, but I {{own that}} I am afraid of it. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>breathing</b> faster than <b>she</b> did, {{and she has}} moved restlessly several times while we have been talking, and has a patch of colour on each cheek, which looks like fever. However, we must hope for the best. Anyhow, I shall bring Dinah up here if possible." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>is</b> able to <b>breathe</b> underwater.|$|R
6000|$|... "'A {{very fine}} nicht,' says she, very frank, though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> quick like {{as if she}} had been running, 'You'll be police?' says she.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> quickly, {{and there}} was a slight flush on her face. She took the book from George's unresisting hand and rewarded him with a smile.|$|E
60|$|Bailey had {{not been}} gone too long before Ruth appeared. She {{stood in the doorway}} looking at him for a moment. Her face was pale and her eyes bright. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> quickly.|$|E
50|$|Guest died on November 8, 2003 in Old Westbury, New York at age 83. A {{friend was}} driving {{her to the}} {{hospital}} after <b>she</b> <b>was</b> experiencing <b>breathing</b> difficulties at home.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} epilogue, Max <b>is</b> {{underwater}} but <b>she</b> thinks <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dead. <b>She</b> hears singing {{that sounds like}} 'strangled whales'. It feels good. She sighs with relief. She then realizes that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>breathing,</b> alive and underwater. Dylan pulls her out. Fang and Angel are also there. Dylan and Fang go {{to see if there}} is anything left of the tree house village and Angel enters Dr. Martinez's thoughts and says that they are monitoring satellite connection all over the world from inside the cave and whole countries may be covered in water, ash or flame.|$|R
50|$|Tomoka Kurotani as Kagero - poison specialist. Poison flows {{within her}} veins and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> able to <b>breathe</b> poison at enemies or {{poisoning}} {{them with a}} kiss.|$|R
60|$|She {{bent forward}} with assumed {{interest}} {{to watch the}} scoring. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> heavily. There were tears in her eyes--she bit her lips savagely and glared at the track until they were gone.|$|E
60|$|He {{laid his}} fingers upon her hand, and she {{followed}} him into the room. She was very pale, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> as though she had been running. He passed his arm around her waist.|$|E
60|$|His {{wife had}} {{recovered}} the paper, and was reading with burning eyes. A bright wave of colour had flowed over her masterful features. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> as stertorously as ever her son Washington had {{done on the}} previous night.|$|E
60|$|At last, a lull, a stillness, a recess. Her limbs {{seemed to}} yield and give way beneath her. She half fainted with fatigue. She {{staggered}} and fell. Too weary to undress, she flung herself upon the bed, just as <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> clothes and all. Her overwrought nerves lost consciousness at once. In three minutes <b>she</b> <b>was</b> asleep, <b>breathing</b> fast but peacefully.|$|R
60|$|Night fell--the long night; {{would she}} wake again? Both watched with her, ready at the faintest {{movement}} to administer oxygen and brandy. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> still <b>breathing,</b> but very faintly, when {{at six o'clock}} they heard the express come in, and presently the carriage stop before the house. Mademoiselle stole down to let them in.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo {{collapsed}} in a hallway of her St. Petersburg, Florida apartment. Firefighters and paramedics, arriving in response to her husband Michael's 9-1-1 call, found her face-down and unconscious. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> not <b>breathing</b> and had no pulse. They attempted to resuscitate her and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her intubated and ventilated.|$|R
60|$|Austen did not smile. She was {{speaking}} quietly, {{but he saw}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> deeply, {{and he knew that}} she possessed a courage which went far beyond that of most women, and an insight into life and affairs.|$|E
60|$|Then {{again he}} kneeled {{to attend to}} her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> regularly, her eyes were wide open and as if conscious, but there seemed {{something}} missing in her look. She was conscious in herself, but unconscious of her surroundings.|$|E
60|$|She put up {{her hand}} and {{smoothed}} back the curl. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> fast and deep, {{as though she had}} been running, and with every breath perfume seemed to come from her hair, and from her body, like perfume from an opening flower.|$|E
6000|$|And Mrs. Leigh, Protestant as <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> <b>breathes</b> a prayer, {{that the}} Lord may {{have mercy on}} that soul, as [...] "clear as diamond, and as hard," [...] as she said of herself. That last scene, too, before the fatal block--it could not be {{altogether}} acting. Mrs. Leigh had learned many a priceless lesson {{in the last seven}} years; might not Mary Stuart have learned something in seventeen? And Mrs. Leigh had been a courtier, and knew, as far as a chaste Englishwoman could know (which even in those coarser days was not very much), of that godless style of French court profligacy in which poor Mary had had her youthful training, amid the Medicis, and the Guises, and Cardinal Lorraine; and she shuddered, and sighed to herself"--To whom little is given, of them shall little be required!" [...] But still the bells pealed on and would not cease.|$|R
5|$|When Bågenholm {{was pulled}} out of the water, her pupils were dilated, her blood was not circulating, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>breathing.</b> Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm was brought to the Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ventilated with oxygen. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> also treated with a defibrillator, but to no effect.|$|R
60|$|A {{new light}} shone into the room. <b>She</b> seemed to <b>be</b> <b>breathing</b> a {{different}} atmosphere--the atmosphere of hope. She listened {{no longer with}} horror for a creaking upon the stairs. She walked back and forth until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> exhausted.... Curiously enough, when the end came <b>she</b> <b>was</b> asleep, crouched upon the bed and dreaming wildly. She sprang up to find Inspector French, with a policeman behind him, standing upon the threshold.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{while he}} was still {{skirting}} his subject, before he had wandered to what he really wished to say, the music stopped, the applause broke out again, and Lady Wetherby returned to the table like a pugilist seeking his corner {{at the end of a}} round. Her face was flushed and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> hard.|$|E
60|$|They lifted {{them both}} up for dead, and Compton, taking Fan in his strong arms, held {{her like a}} child as they drove slowly back to the ranch. All {{believed}} Lester dead; but Compton, who held his ear to Fan's lips, insisted that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing,</b> and indeed she recovered from her swoon before they reached the house.|$|E
60|$|He locked them in, {{walked down}} the passage {{and opened the door}} of Louise's bedchamber with fingers that trembled a little. With a smothered oath he cut the cord from the arms of the maid and the gag from her mouth. Louise, clad in a loose {{afternoon}} gown, was lying upon the bed, as though asleep. Bellamy saw with an impulse of relief that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> regularly.|$|E
50|$|The accused {{had broken}} into {{the home of the}} {{deceased}} with the intention of robbing her. On entering her bedroom, he shot her in the neck. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> still <b>breathing</b> on her admission to hospital. Two days later, her doctors declared that she showed no sign of brain activity. The brainstem had ceased to function; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> effectively dead. Two days further, after thorough neurologic scrutiny, the ventilator was disconnected, and after ten minutes she registered no heart activity.|$|R
2500|$|And why, Gasparoli asked, {{does the}} caller seem {{reluctant}} to touch Hedgepeth's body despite repeated pleas from the dispatcher {{to at least}} see if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> still <b>breathing?</b> If Rosario <b>was</b> not able to bring herself to do so, could she not have asked Rangel to do so? [...] "I have often thought," [...] Gaparoli wrote," [...] if it <b>was</b> , that <b>she</b> didn't call 9-1-1 the moment she first saw [...]" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> {{seemed to}} <b>be</b> <b>breathing</b> high, sharp air, {{as if she}} had just come out of a hot room. These strange Skrebenskys made her aware of another, freer element, in which each person was {{detached}} and isolated. Was not this her natural element? Was not the close Brangwen life stifling her? ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not within}} this woman's power to resist him. She tried {{to draw away}} from him, but could not. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> quickly. The mocking light quivered on her face only {{because it had been}} there so long. If it went out she would be helpless. He put his hands on her shoulders, and she was helpless. It brought her mouth nearer his. She was {{offering}} him her mouth.|$|E
60|$|She {{retired from}} the room, ere the clergyman could {{convince}} himself {{that it was more}} than a phantom which he beheld. He ran down stairs--he summoned assistants, but no one could attend his call; for the deep ruckling groans of the patient satisfied every one that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> her last; and Mrs. Dods, with the maid-servant, ran into the bedroom, to witness the death of Hannah Irwin, which shortly after took place.|$|E
6000|$|She took a {{chair in}} silence. An {{irregular}} movement in {{the lower part of}} her veil seemed to indicate that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> with difficulty. The doctor observed her with close attention. [...] "Let me see my prescription again," [...] he said. Having added an ingredient, he handed it back with a word of explanation. [...] "Your nerves are more out of order than I supposed. The hardest disease to cure that I know of is--worry." ...|$|E
60|$|But Momaya, though startled, had wheeled to {{face the}} fearsome thing with all the savage ferocity of a she-tiger at bay. When she saw who it <b>was,</b> <b>she</b> <b>breathed</b> a sigh of partial relief, though she still clung tightly to Tibo.|$|R
60|$|Before {{she could}} speak the door burst open, and the boisterous Rosamund Hunt, in her {{flamboyant}} white hat, boa, and parasol, stood framed in the doorway. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> in a <b>breathing</b> heat, and on her open face was {{an expression of the}} most infantile astonishment.|$|R
50|$|Grace is born {{seven weeks}} {{premature}} {{and in the}} breech position. As <b>she</b> <b>was</b> starved of oxygen, she has {{to spend some time}} in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. After a scan shows that she has a bleed on the brain and internal bleeding, Grace is placed on a ventilator. Grace almost dies from an Intraventricular hemorrhage and has to have a blood transfusion. Connie decides to turn off Grace's life support when her ECG results show minimal brain-stem activity. When Doctor Ooma Chowdry (Sakuntala Ramanee) asks Connie if she wants to hold Grace, Connie declines, but Sam holds her and notices <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>breathing</b> on her own. Grace pulls through and Connie allows Sam increased access to his daughter. Sam ask Maddy to look after Grace and while Grace is in a room on her own, Susie Prendergast kidnaps Grace, thinking <b>she</b> <b>is</b> her baby sister. She threatens to drop Grace on her head, but Sam and Maddy persuade Susie to give her back. When Grace is 10 months old, she falls down the stairs and <b>is</b> badly injured. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> rushed to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and undergoes surgery for a collapsed lung and nearly dies. Grace leaves with Connie, who has decided to care for her father, who has been diagnosed with cancer.|$|R
