5000|$|At the customer's premises, {{the wires}} usually enter the {{building}} through a weatherhead that protects against entry {{of rain and}} snow, and drop down though conduit to an electric meter which measures and records the power used for billing purposes, then enters the main <b>service</b> <b>panel.</b> The utility's portion of the system ends, and the customer's wiring begins, at the output socket of the electric meter. The <b>service</b> <b>panel</b> will contain a [...] "main" [...] fuse or circuit breaker, which controls all of the electric current entering the building at once, {{and a number of}} smaller fuses/breakers, which protect individual branch circuits. There is always a main shutoff switch to turn off all power; when circuit breakers are used this is provided by the main circuit breaker.|$|R

5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings had the {{advantage}} of a reduction in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of <b>service</b> <b>panels</b> also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|R

5000|$|In the USA and {{countries}} using its system, the secondary {{is most often}} the split-phase 120/240 volt system. The 240 V secondary winding is center-tapped and the center neutral wire is grounded, making the two end conductors [...] "hot" [...] {{with respect to the}} center tap. These three wires run down the service drop to the electric meter and <b>service</b> <b>panel</b> inside the building. Connecting a load between either hot wire and the neutral gives 120 volts. Connecting between both hot wires gives 240 volts.|$|R
5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence <b>Services</b> <b>Panel</b> of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated {{that if there were}} even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence <b>Services</b> <b>Panel</b> submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.|$|R
50|$|In Europe and {{countries}} using its system, the secondary {{is often the}} three phase 400Y/230 system. There are three 230 V secondary windings, each receiving power from a primary winding attached {{to one of the}} primary phases. One end of each secondary winding is connected to a 'neutral' wire, which is grounded. The other end of the 3 secondary windings, along with the neutral, are brought down the service drop to the <b>service</b> <b>panel.</b> 230 V loads are connected between any of the three phase wires and the neutral.|$|R
