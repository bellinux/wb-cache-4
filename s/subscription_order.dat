5000|$|Russian-born {{publisher}} Albert Lewis Kanter (1897-1973) created Classic Comics for Elliot Publishing Company in 1941 {{with its}} debut issues being The Three Musketeers, followed by Ivanhoe and The Count of Monte Cristo. In {{addition to the}} literary adaptations, books featured author profiles, educational fillers, and an ad for the coming title. In later editions, a catalog of titles and a <b>subscription</b> <b>order</b> form appeared on back covers. Recognizing the appeal of early comic books, Albert Lewis Kanter [...] believed he could use the new medium to introduce young and reluctant readers to [...] "great literature".|$|E
5000|$|Issues {{included}} among their contents {{features such as}} comics adaptations of Aesop Fables (usually two to three pages), a limerick by Edward Lear, a Mother Goose rhyme, or poem from Robert Louis Stevensons A Childs Garden of Verses (one page), and a one-page factual article about a bird, beast, or reptile. As the publisher allowed only in-house advertising in his books, the back cover interior sometimes offered a catalog of titles and a <b>subscription</b> <b>order</b> form. First editions included a [...] "Coming Next Month" [...] ad and a dot-to-dot puzzle on the inside front cover. The interior of the back cover featured a [...] "Color this Picture with your Crayons" [...] full-page line-drawn illustration of {{a scene from the}} tale. The exterior of the back cover often depicted a full-page color illustration from the tale. Artists included John Costanza, Kurt Schaffenberger, L. B. Cole and Graham Ingels. Unlike other comic book publishers, Kanter reprinted his titles regularly and the line was distributed abroad.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of {{portable}} and flexible privacy-preserving access rights for large online data repositories. Privacy-preserving access control means that the service provider can neither learn what access rights a customer has nor link a request to access an item to a particular customer, thus maintaining privacy of both customer activity and customer access rights. Flexible access rights allow any customer to choose any subset of items from the repository and correspondingly be charged only for the items selected. And portability of access rights means that the rights themselves can be stored on small devices of limited storage space and computational capabilities, and therefore the rights must be enforced using the limited resources available. Our main results are solutions to the problem that utilize minimal perfect hash functions and order-preserving minimal perfect hash functions. None of them use expensive cryptography, all require very little space, and they are therefore suitable for computationally weak and spacelimited devices such as smartcards, sensors, etc. Performance of the schemes is measured as the probability of false positives (i. e., the probability that access to an unpurchased item will be permitted) for a given storage space bound. Using our techniques, for a data repository of size n and <b>subscription</b> <b>order</b> of m # n items, we achieve a probability of false positives of m using only O(cm) bits of storage space, where c is an adjustable parameter (a constant or otherwise) that can be set to provide the desired performance. This {{is the first time that}} such provable bounds are established for this problem, and we believe the techniques we use are of more general interest through the unusual use we make of perfect hashing...|$|E

50|$|Grace Magazine was {{launched}} on 14 May 2002 by MODE magazine's last executive editor, Ceslie Armstrong, {{and many of}} the ex-MODE staff as an independent quarterly publication and website under a similar concept. Even though the initial 400,000 print run sold out quickly and advertising revenue appeared high, the independent status and limited funding prohibited the ability to grow to fill the newsstand and <b>subscription</b> <b>orders.</b> Critics, however, believed that Grace featured far less stylish fashion content than its predecessor and unwisely pursued an editorial emphasis on weight-related health issues. Grace Magazine ceased operation due to lack of funding in November 2003, after publishing 10 issues.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the Albanian patriotic activity, Duçi was a successful entrepreneur. His family emerged as an important player in the economic development of Egypts Delta region directed by Lord Cromers office. By 1901, he started working with his well-connected uncle Loni Logori on projects that explicitly tied the commercial interest of the British administration and the local landowners. Beside British, he openly solicited Austro-Hungarian support, despite of the distrust that many Eastern Orthodox south-Albanians had for the Austrian Geo-politics. Toskas initial failure did not dissuade the Austrian authorities to support him; in 1902 they sent him 120 krone for the <b>subscription,</b> <b>ordering</b> the newspaper to be shipped to Vienna from where it would get distributed to Ottoman Albania. Through his uncle, Duçi would also {{get in touch with}} the Albanian émigré in Bucharest, Italy, Istanbul, and Brussels. The French consul in Shkodër reported that Duçi collaborated with a defrocked Catholic priest named Gaspar Jakova Merturi who secured funds from a claimant for the Albanian throne, Prince Albert Ghica of Romania. He also collaborated closely with the Arberesh journalist Anselmo Lorecchio, editor of La Nazione Albanese.|$|R
