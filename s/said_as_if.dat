25|$|As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod {{helped to}} found the {{homeless}} charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a {{decision of the}} Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government’s Commonwealth Immigration Bill, believing {{it to be a}} breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod's subsequent dealings with him were, Powell <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was a pariah though Macleod 'knew what I said was not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved as if he did not know'. Powell's speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many {{of the members of the}} public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.|$|E
2500|$|On February 16, 2009, Travis {{attacked}} Sandra Herold's 55-year-old friend Charla Nash, inflicting devastating {{injuries to}} her face and limbs. Travis had left the house with Sandra Herold's car keys, and Nash came to help get the chimp back in the house; upon seeing Nash holding {{one of his favorite}} toys, Travis immediately attacked her. [...] Travis was familiar with Nash, who had also worked at the Herolds' towing company, although Nash had a different hair style {{at the time of the}} attack. [...] The chimp had been taking medication for Lyme disease. Herold, then 70 years old, attempted to stop Travis by hitting him with a shovel and stabbing him with a butcher knife. [...] "For me to do something like that – put a knife in him – was like putting one in myself," [...] Herold later said. The chimp turned around, she <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to say, [...] "'Mom, what did you do?'" [...] The ape was angered more. Herold then called 9-1-1 and pleaded for help. Travis' screams can be heard in the background of the tape as Sandra pleads for police, who initially believed the call to be a hoax, until she started screaming, [...] "He's eating her!" [...] Emergency medical services waited for police before approaching the house. Travis walked up to the police car when it arrived, tried to open a locked passenger door, and smashed a side-view mirror. Then he went calmly around to the driver's-side door and opened it, at which point Officer Frank Chiafari shot him several times. Travis retreated to the house, where he was found dead next to his cage.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} lock your door," [...] he {{mechanically}} <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> lecturing in school. [...] "Then {{no one could}} intrude even by accident." ...|$|E
