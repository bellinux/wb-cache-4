5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse {{is easy to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° <b>south</b> <b>latitude.</b>|$|E

In winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees <b>south</b> <b>latitude</b> in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees <b>south</b> <b>latitude</b> in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius.

25|$|The {{spread of}} Norwegian whaling {{industry}} to Antarctica {{in the early}} 20th century motivated Norway, right after its independence from Sweden in 1905, to pursue territorial expansion {{not only in the}} Arctic claiming Jan Mayen and Sverdrup Islands, but also in Antarctica. Norway claimed Bouvet Island and looked further south, formally inquiring with Foreign Office about the international status of the area between 45° and 65° <b>south</b> <b>latitude</b> and 35° and 80° west longitude. Following a second such diplomatic démarche by the Norwegian Government dated 4 March 1907, Britain replied that the areas were British based on discoveries made {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and issued the 1908 Letters Patent incorporating the British Falkland Islands Dependencies with a permanent local administration in Grytviken established in 1909.|$|E

5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911.

25|$|In the {{northern}} part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. For instance, Puerto Aisén, at 45°24' <b>south</b> <b>latitude,</b> receives 2,973.3 millimeters of rain per year. However, unlike in Valdivia, the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year in Puerto Aisén. The summer months average 206.1 millimeters, whereas the winter months average 300 millimeters. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average 13.6°C in the summer months and 4.7°C in the winter months. Although the area generally is chilly and wet, the combination of channels, fjords, snowcapped mountains, and islands of all shapes and sizes within such a narrow space makes for breathtaking views. The area is still heavily forested, although some of the native species of trees that grow in the central and southern parts of the country have given way to others better adapted to a generally colder climate.|$|E
25|$|In a 1998 study, tritium {{concentrations}} in surface seawater and atmospheric water vapor (10meters above the surface) were sampled {{at the following}} locations: the Sulu Sea, the Fremantle Bay, the Bay of Bengal, the Penang Bay, and the Strait of Malacca. Results indicated that the tritium concentration in surface seawater was highest at the Fremantle Bay (approximately 0.40Bq/liter), which could be accredited to the mixing of runoff of freshwater from nearby lands due to large amounts found in coastal waters. Typically, lower concentrations were found between 35 and 45 degrees <b>south</b> <b>latitude</b> and near the equator. Results also indicated that (in general) tritium has decreased over the years (up to 1997) due to the physical decay of bomb tritium in the Indian Ocean. As for water vapor, the tritium concentration was approximately one order of magnitude greater than surface seawater concentrations (ranging from 0.46 to 1.15Bq/liter). Therefore, the water vapor tritium is not affected by the surface seawater concentration; thus, the high tritium {{concentrations in}} the vapor were concluded to be {{a direct consequence of}} the downward movement of natural tritium from the stratosphere to the troposphere (therefore, the ocean air showed a dependence on latitudinal change).|$|E
