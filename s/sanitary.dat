5|$|As a {{journalist}} he spread enlightened {{ideas in the}} Royal Audiencia, and as a hygienist he composed an important treatise about <b>sanitary</b> conditions in colonial Ecuador that included interesting remarks about microorganisms and the spreading of disease.|$|E
5|$|Gypsy {{prisoners were}} used {{primarily}} for construction work. Thousands died of typhus and noma due to overcrowding, poor <b>sanitary</b> conditions, and malnutrition. Anywhere from 1,400 to 3,000 prisoners {{were transferred to}} other concentration camps before {{the murder of the}} remaining population.|$|E
5|$|Henry Whitney Bellows {{determined}} {{to take a}} different approach, establishing a civilian organization of nurses separate from the U.S. Army. Bellows was the founder of the United States <b>Sanitary</b> Commission and served as its only president. An influential minister, born and raised in Boston, Bellows went to Washington in May 1861 as head of a delegation of physicians representing the Women's Central Relief Association of New York and other organizations. Bellows's aim was to convince the government to establish a civilian auxiliary branch of the Army Medical Bureau. The <b>Sanitary</b> Commission, established by President Lincoln on June 13, 1861, provided nurses (mostly female) with medical supplies and organized hospital ships and soldiers' homes.|$|E
5|$|New {{programs}} were also launched under Walker's tenure: Electrical Engineering in 1882, Chemical Engineering in 1888, <b>Sanitary</b> Engineering in 1889, Geology in 1890, Naval Architecture in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{created the}} Rockefeller Foundation in 1913 to {{continue}} and expand {{the scope of the}} work of the <b>Sanitary</b> Commission, which was closed in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Routes of {{infection}} include vertical transmission (such as through childbirth), early life horizontal transmission (bites, lesions, and <b>sanitary</b> habits), and adult horizontal transmission (sexual contact, intravenous drug use).|$|E
5|$|Several Indiana {{facilities}} {{cared for}} wounded soldiers, including Indianapolis City Hospital. Governor Morton and the Indiana <b>Sanitary</b> Commission began recruiting women {{to work as}} nurses at military hospitals and ships in January 1863.|$|E
5|$|Sewerage. Sewage {{collection}} {{systems do}} not have sufficient hydraulic capacity to handle wastewater flows, especially in poor neighborhoods, which results in combined sewer overflows and <b>sanitary</b> sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Crown {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} with public health. Diseases had always troubled the colonies, and town councils spent money to bring physicians or <b>sanitary</b> equipment {{from other parts}} of the Americas. Reports by doctors about the <b>sanitary</b> and hygienic conditions of various neighborhoods of the cities were frequent. As a man of science, Eugenio Espejo demonstrated his knowledge of the latest scientific advances in Europe and the Americas. Most of the arguments and recommendations he made in his medical works can be found in contemporary sources, such as the Mémoires of the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} covering of the Senne resolved <b>sanitary</b> problems and flooding in Brussels’ old city, {{this was not}} the case in peripheral areas. The Senne was still very polluted, despite work done to the sewers and spillways in the canal. The drainage into the canal was not able to completely stop the floods that regularly affected certain outer areas of the city.|$|E
5|$|Banshbaria Union {{has been}} {{declared}} as 100% sanitized, as all households in the union adopted <b>sanitary</b> latrines, while the upazila has only 16% sanitation coverage. A survey published in 2006 by the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project found that of the 18,843 tube wells surveyed, 24.7% {{were found to be}} contaminated. Visible signs of arsenic poisoning were found in 47 people.|$|E
5|$|Changing {{demographics}} {{and a growing}} social awareness led to increased political and architectural interest in providing cost-effective, <b>sanitary,</b> and comfortable residential space to the growing urban population {{in general and the}} working class in particular. This was known as boligsaken ("the housing cause") in Norwegian popular culture and continues to play a role to this day.|$|E
5|$|During the war {{some women}} {{took on the}} added {{responsibility}} of running family farms and businesses. Hoosier women {{also contributed to the}} war effort as nurses and volunteers in charitable organizations, most commonly the local Ladies' Aid Societies. In January 1863 Governor Morton and the Indiana <b>Sanitary</b> Commission began recruiting women to work as nurses in military hospitals and on ships.|$|E
5|$|From Saxon {{times it}} was part of the hundred of Hayridge. From 1894 to 1935 {{it was part of}} Tiverton Rural District and prior to that it was part of Tiverton <b>Sanitary</b> District and Tiverton Poor Law Union. It may have been a borough in the 17th century but this status was not sustained.|$|E
5|$|Kilham, Coldsmouth and Thompson's Walls, Howtel and Pawston {{were four}} of 15 townships {{in the ancient}} parish of Kirknewton, {{one of the largest}} parishes in England. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, parishes were grouped into unions: Glendale Poor Law Union was created in 1837. Under the Public Health Act 1848 the area of the poor law union became Glendale Rural <b>Sanitary</b> District, which from 1889 formed a second tier of local {{government}} under Northumberland County Council. The four townships became civil parishes in their own right, separate from Kirknewton but within the <b>sanitary</b> district, in 1866, and under the Local Government Act 1894 became part of Glendale Rural District. Coldsmouth and Thompson's Walls, Howtel and Pawston were amalgamated into Kilham in 1955. Glendale Rural District was abolished in 1974, and became part of the newly created Borough of Berwick upon Tweed, which was in turn abolished {{as a result of the}} Northumberland (Structural Change) Order 2008, under which Northumberland became a unitary authority in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Neighborhoods in the {{vicinity}} of Eddy Creek include the Keystone Industrial Park, the Keystone <b>Sanitary</b> Landfill, and LaCapra Stone & Supply. It is estimated that there is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed. According to a 1992 report, development in an area near the creek would have little adverse impact on the creek.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, {{in support}} of the black <b>sanitary</b> public works employees, who were {{represented}} by AFSCME Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many <b>sanitary</b> products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses are {{stable in}} the {{environment}} and {{have been found in}} estuary samples at levels up to 1–5 infectious particles per US gallon, the viruses survive between 9 and 19 days. <b>Sanitary</b> measures adequate for eliminating bacteria and parasites seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus, as the incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar.|$|E
5|$|Service support: Support was {{provided}} to approximately 500 electoral centres and police stations through the siting and erection of permanent (or portable) accommodations {{and the provision of}} essential services. UNTAG deployed over 350 polling stations; the Australian contingent constructed and provided support (including <b>sanitary</b> facilities) at 120 stations in the northern areas of Kaokoland, Ovamboland and West Hereroland.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Inventario Sanitario Rural (ISR) or Rural <b>Sanitary</b> Register {{confirms}} that situation. Only 21% {{of the rural}} community organizations were considered {{able to carry out}} maintenance and only 10% to commercially operate the service. Only 32% issued bills and only 10% used metering. In 2005, the government defined guidelines for basic water supply and sanitation policy in rural areas to increase coverage and improve quality in those areas.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana <b>Sanitary</b> Commission, {{created in}} 1862, and soldiers' aid {{societies}} {{throughout the state}} raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. Hoosiers also provided other forms of support for soldiers and their families, including a Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home, and Orphans' Home to help {{meet the needs of}} Indiana's soldiers and their families as they passed through Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|The {{state also}} made {{important}} contributions to relief efforts. Many leaders of nursing and soldiers' aid organizations hailed from Massachusetts, including Dorothea Dix, {{founder of the}} Army Nurses Bureau, Henry Whitney Bellows, founder of the United States <b>Sanitary</b> Commission, and independent nurse Clara Barton.|$|E
5|$|Third-class {{passenger}} accommodations {{were located}} on the main deck: three compartments for men located forward, and a single compartment for families at the rear. The family compartment had state rooms containing either two, four, or six bunks. All compartments had well-lighted dining areas and wide hallways that led to lavatories and <b>sanitary</b> facilities on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|This {{small company}} was {{acquired}} in 1944 by two young entrepreneurs: Joan Llopart and Enric Riera. With {{the availability of}} plastic in the 1950s, the company expanded the range of its products and introduced in its catalog <b>sanitary</b> and household products. This then led to the figures of plastic toys decorated by hand.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{stewardship}} of Richard Assheton Cross, the Home Secretary, Disraeli's new government enacted many reforms, including the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875, which made inexpensive loans available to {{towns and cities}} to construct working-class housing. Also enacted were the Public Health Act 1875, modernising <b>sanitary</b> codes through the nation, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876).|$|E
5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's <b>sanitary</b> sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the <b>sanitary</b> sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Camping is {{a popular}} pastime at Colton Point State Park; 1,989persons have used the camping {{facilities}} in 2003. With no modern amenities like flush toilets or showers, the campsites take on a rustic nature. There are outhouses, fire rings, a <b>sanitary</b> dump station and picnic tables at the campground. An Organized Group Tenting area, intended for organized youth or adult groups, can accommodate up to 90 campers. 1,490campers used the area in 2003. The park also has approximately 100 picnic tables and five CCC-built picnic shelters which can be reserved. These facilities were used by 15,379 picnickers in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes, a {{contemporary}} painting {{by one of}} Bierstadt's main rivals in the landscape genre, Frederic Edwin Church. The two works represented the two great mountain ranges spanning North and South America. At the New York Metropolitan Fair in 1864, held by the United States <b>Sanitary</b> Commission {{to raise money for}} the Union war effort, the two paintings were exhibited opposite each other. Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes are still exhibited on opposite walls at their current location at the Metropolitan.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices emphasize {{the use of}} safe {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as <b>sanitary</b> piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} Vedaranyam is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Nagapattinam circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply project through the Vedaranyam Municipality is approved by the Commissioner of Municipal Administration, Chennai. Water is obtained from hand pumps and fountains located {{in various parts of}} the town. Door to door collection of garbage is done by <b>sanitary</b> workers of the municipality and about 6 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day. Vedaranyam municipality does not have underground drainage system and the current sewerage system for disposal of sullage is through septic tanks and public conveniences.|$|E
5|$|Following Cyprien, the Government of Madagascar did not request {{international}} assistance in post-storm recovery. By January10, a cargo plane carrying 65million MGF (2002 MGF; US$10,062) worth of relief supplies was deployed to the affected regions. The supplies, consisting of medical supplies, tents, and one tonne of rice, {{were given to}} local authorities to be distributed to the affected population. <b>Sanitary</b> items were also distributed {{by the government to}} avoid an outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged {{that it was}} too {{dangerous}} to continue the raid as Behars distress message may have alerted the Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small and extremely hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, <b>sanitary</b> facilities and exercise.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Aldermaston was a hundred, {{though for}} a period it was within the Theale hundred. By the 19th century, the {{hundreds}} had been superseded by other sub-divisions. From then on, Aldermaston was, at times, part of the Bradfield Poor Law Union and <b>Sanitary</b> District, and the registration sub-districts of Mortimer (late 19th century) and Bucklebury (early 20th century). It was at all times an ecclesiastical parish and acquired civil parish status in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, he {{was asked}} by the cabildo (town council) to write about smallpox, the worst medical problem the Audiencia faced. Espejo used the {{opportunity}} to write his most complete and best-written work, Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas (Reflections about a method to preserve the people from smallpox), denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation. This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and <b>sanitary</b> conditions of colonial America.|$|E
