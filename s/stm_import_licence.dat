They {{proposed}} to build 3,000 cars per annum, with production commencing in mid-1968. Jack Marshall, was the then Minister of Trade and Industry, whose consent was sought. He declined their request {{on the grounds that}} New Zealand was suffering from falling export prices at the time, which was causing a balance of trade problem for the Government. Other established car manufacturers were having the <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> reduced and the granting of a licence to another manufacturer was seen as counter-productive.|$|R

5000|$|The {{formation}} of Databank {{came at a}} time when computer systems were a scarce and expensive commodity in New Zealand, with the import of computers being restricted by the then government's prevailing highly regulatory economic policy. Computers could only be <b>imported</b> under <b>licence.</b> The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing cheque transaction volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion.

However, the NBNZ (National Bank of New Zealand) {{was the only one that}} happened to have a computer <b>import</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Production {{began in}} an old flour store in Devon Street, New Plymouth. The aim was to make 120 {{machines}} a year, but demand was higher after a flurry of articles in magazines and newspapers about the bike. Some were sold to Borneo and the New Hebrides. [...] Problems soon arose with the government refusing to issue an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the engines and brake hubs. While negotiations continued between Callender and the government, Callender sent {{a photo of the}} bike along with Hillary, Mulgrave, and himself to Suzuki in Japan. Suzuki turned the photo into a giant poster on their Tokyo Motor Show stand along with a replica of the bike. In 1966 the government issued the <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> to allow enough parts to build the 120 bikes per year. By that time Callender had decided to sell the business to Motor Components of Waitara. Motor Components planned to sell 1,000 bikes per year, but by then Suzuki had commenced production of its own specialised machine. They in turn were followed by the other major Japanese motor cycle manufacturers. Production at the Waitara plant stopped in the 1970s.|$|R

The company blamed the government's <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> bureaucracy for the problemit was difficult to get diesel engines from abroad. In the following month, over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting diesel engines. The economy improved in 1959.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{follows the}} work of H. Uzawa (1965) and R. E. Lucas (1988) by {{presenting}} an endogenous growth model with human capital accumulation as the engine of growth.

Agents may allocate time to obtain valuable <b>import</b> <b>licences.</b> The effect of this activity on the growth rate {{is found to be}} dependent upon whether agents specialize in the rent-seeking activity. When agents do not specialize, the rent-seeking activity reduces growth by reducing the incentive to accumulate productive human capital. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses an overlapping-generations {{framework}} {{to model the}} allocation of <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> of intermediate goods according to firm capacity. It shows that this method of allocation encourages rent-seeking and also thereby improves welfare compared with a method that does not allow rent-seeking. A. O. Kreuger (1975, 1974) and J. N. Bhagwati and P. Desai (1970) describe how Turkey and India have allocated imports {{on the basis of}} firm capacity, which led to rent-seeking through overexpansion of capacity. J. N. Bhagwati and T.

50|$|The Morris Marina was {{a popular}} car on the New Zealand market, {{imported}} by the New Zealand Motor Corporation. Imports began with built-up British-sourced saloons and coupes (in 1.3- and 1.8-litre forms) in 1971.

In 1974, before the termination of Leyland Australia's manufacturing operations, local assembly switched to British-sourced models again in saloon, estate, van and pick-up forms. Batches of fully built UK-sourced cars also came in 1973 and 1974 when the government allowed additional <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> due to the inability of local assembly plants to keep pace with demand for new cars.|$|R

40|$|This ban {{comes into}} force with {{immediate}} effect on Friday 22 July 2011. Phenazepam is a benzodiazepine which is currently not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (1971 Act) in the UK. Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs's advice: The UK Government has received independent expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) that phenazepam is sufficiently harmful to justify an immediate import ban under the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> pending its control as a Class C drug under the 1971 Act. The ACMD’s assessment reports that phenazepam is being marketed as a so called ‘legal high’ product, particularly on the internet. It {{has been identified as}} being a potent member of the benzodiazepine family causing harms such as amnesia and drowsiness that may potentially proceed to a coma with respiratory depression. Whilst phenazepam has been recognised to have limited medicinal properties, it is not prescribed in the UK for treatment neither does it have a UK marketing authorisation. Further, it has no legitimate commercial or industrial uses in the UK. This amendment to the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> will remain in place until such time as it is revoked. This will likely occur when phenazepam is fully controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 where it will be a criminal offence to unlawfully import, export, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply and be in simple possession of this substance without a licence or lawful authority.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of contemporary sugar trade policy in Indonesia highlights {{problems in the}} institutional framework for trade policy making. The institutions through which sugar trade policy is formulated entrench the interests of rent-seeking bureaucrats, <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> holders and traders {{to the detriment of}} consumers and downstream producers of processed products. Moreover, the resulting trade policy regime has problematic effects on sugarcane farmers. The structure of regulatory intervention is due less to democratic pressures than to the inclusion of vested interests in the institutions that formulate policy. Further, the lack of effective mechanisms for inter-ministerial coordination and for resolving conflicting policy preferences among ministries hinders the development of coherent trade policy and obstructs reform efforts. An institutional framework that facilitates representation of all interests affected by sugar trade policies and public scrutiny of the effects of policy intervention is likely to deliver better outcomes for consumers and producers alike. ...|$|R

5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption.

40|$|Includes BibliographyLatin America and the Caribbean {{is among}} the fastest growing markets {{in the world and}} an {{important}} trading partner for many countries. The positive byproducts of this trend include deeper integration and strengthened economic and diplomatic relations with trading partners around the world. However, as trade continues to grow, disputes will naturally arise between nations with respect {{to a wide range of}} trade barriers. Often these disputes are addressed within the framework of the World Trade Organization’s Dispute Settlement System. This document describes the experience of the region in the WTO Dispute Settlement System by analyzing key disputes involving technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures and intellectual property. These three areas, although conceptually diverse, have in common dealing with domestic, behind the border regulatory issues, as opposed to traditional trade barriers such as tariffs or <b>import</b> <b>licences.</b> Another common feature of the three areas is that each of them is regulated by a specific multilateral agreement negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This negotiation, which lasted from 1986 to 1994, also resulted in the creation of the WTO. As the magnitude of border measures has consistently lowered over the last two or three decades, domestic regulatory provisions have acquired an increasing prominence as potential obstacles to trade. To this extent, the analysis of the disputes presented here may point at future trends for Latin America and the Caribbean’s participation in WTO dispute settlement...|$|R
