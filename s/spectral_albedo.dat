The accuracy of this approach has been evaluated using 270 Landsat scenes covering six field stations supported by the SURFace RADiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (ARM/SGP) network. Comparison with field measurements shows that Landsat 30 -m snow-free shortwave albedos from all seasons generally achieve an absolute accuracy of +/- 0. 02 - 0. 05 for these validation sites during available clear days in 2003 - 2005,with a root mean square error less than 0. 03 and a bias less than 0. 02. This level of accuracy has been regarded as sufficient for driving global and regional climate models. The Landsat-based retrievals have also been compared to the operational 16 -day MODIS albedo produced every 8 -days from MODIS on Terra and Aqua (MCD 43 A).

5000|$|Solar {{insolation}} {{is made up}} of direct, diffuse, {{and reflected}} radiation. The absorption factor of a PV cell is deﬁned as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell. At high noon on a cloudless day at the equator, the power of the sun is about 1 kW/m², on the Earth's surface, to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun's rays. As such, PV arrays can track the sun through each day to greatly enhance energy collection. However, tracking devices add cost, and require maintenance, so it is more common for PV arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face solar noon (approximately due south in the Northern Hemisphere or due north in the Southern Hemisphere). The tilt angle, from horizontal, can be varied for season, but if fixed, should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system. This optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output. The optimization of the photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux, soiling, and snow losses should be taken into effect. In addition, recent work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection. For example, the <b>spectral</b> <b>albedo</b> can {{play a significant role in}} output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system [...] and the type of solar cell material. For the weather and latitudes of the United States and Europe, typical insolation ranges from 4 kWh/m²/day in northern climes to 6.5 kWh/m²/day in the sunniest regions. A photovoltaic installation in the southern latitudes of Europe or the United States may expect to produce 1 kWh/m²/day. A typical 1 kW photovoltaic installation in Australia or the southern latitudes of Europe or United States, may produce 3.5-5 kWh per day, dependent on location, orientation, tilt, insolation and other factors. In the Sahara desert, with less cloud cover and a better solar angle, one could ideally obtain closer to 8.3 kWh/m²/day provided the nearly ever present wind would not blow sand onto the units. The area of the Sahara desert is over 9 million km². 90,600 km², or about 1%, could generate as much electricity as all of the world's power plants combined.|$|E

The conventional methods for estimating broadband albedos rely {{on a series of}} steps in the processing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular modeling, and narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversions. Unfortunately, errors associated with each procedure may be accumulated and significantly impact the accuracy of the final albedo products. In an earlier study, we developed a new direct procedure that links the top-of-atmosphere <b>spectral</b> <b>albedos</b> with land surface broadband albedos without performing atmospheric correction and other processes. In this paper, this method is further improved in several aspects and implemented using actual Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Several case studies indicated that this new method can predict land surface broadband albedos very accurately and eliminate aerosol effects effectively. It is very promising for global applications and is particularly suitable for nonvegetated land surfaces. Note that a Lambertian surface has been assumed in the radiative transfer simulation in this paper as a first-order approximation; this assumption can be easily removed as long as a global bidirectional reflectance distribution function climatology is available.

We then show that the ‘‘reference equations’’ also perform well when total ozone and aerosol optical depth are changed with respect to the reference. The negative effect of humidity and elevation variations on the performance of the equations can be eliminated by adding a correction term.

40|$|In recent years, high-albedo {{materials}} and products have been utilized for urban building roofs and roads to lower their surface temperatures. These high-albedo {{materials and}} products include those with spectral selectivity. Accordingly, a numerical simulation was conducted to investigate the spectral dependency and characteristics of the urban albedo. The distribution of the <b>spectral</b> <b>albedo</b> relative to the albedo over the entire spectrum agreed well between the experimental (Itoh & Ashie 2008) and numerical investigations. The effects of the spectral selectivity of urban materials on the urban albedo are discussed using {{the results from the}} numerical simulation.

40|$|The <b>spectral</b> {{geometric}} <b>albedo</b> and the bolometric Bond albedo of Triton {{are calculated}} {{using data from}} the Voyager spacecraft photopolarimeter and science experiments. The geometric albedo is not inconsistent with the presence of a weak absorption feature in Triton's spectrum near 0. 75 micron. The bolometric Bond albedo (0. 65) is consistent with the 38 K daytime surface temperature of Triton. The results are also in agreement with the 37. 5 K temperature of nitrogen at an infrared basal pressure of 14 microbar...|$|R
40|$|Land surface albedo is a {{critical}} variable needed in land surface modeling. The conventional methods for estimating broadband albedos rely {{on a series of}} steps in the processing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular modeling, and narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversions. Unfortunately, errors associated with each procedure may be accumulated and significantly impact the accuracy of the final albedo products. In an earlier study, we developed a new direct procedure that links the top-of-atmosphere <b>spectral</b> <b>albedos</b> with land surface broadband albedos without performing atmospheric correction and other processes. In this paper, this method is further improved in several aspects and implemented using actual Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Several case studies indicated that this new method can predict land surface broadband albedos very accurately and eliminate aerosol effects effectively. It is very promising for global applications and is particularly suitable for nonvegetated land surfaces. Note that a Lambertian surface has been assumed in the radiative transfer simulation in this paper as a first-order approximation; this assumption can be easily removed as long as a global bidirectional reflectance distribution function climatology is available,This work {{was supported in part by}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under Grant NAG 5 - 6459...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{studies of}} {{irradiated}} sulfur dioxide frost {{have found that}} sulfur trioxide should be formed {{as a consequence of}} the irradiation process. The spectral reflectance of solid sulfur trioxide was measured in the laboratory and it was found that the compound has strong absorption features at 3. 37 and 3. 70 microns. These features are not present in the <b>spectral</b> geometric <b>albedo</b> of Io. This is interpreted as an indication that sulfur trioxide may exist in such limited abundance that it is undetectable in disk averaged spectrophotometry. It is suggested that the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on the Galileo spacecraft should be able to identify condensed sulfur trioxide on Io particularly in regions bordering the sulfur dioxide deposits. The presence of elemental sulfur on Io's surface has been questioned on several grounds, most notably the suggested production process (quenched molten sulfur extrusions) and the effect of radiation (particularly X-rays) on some of the allotropes. Mixtures of sulfur allotropes were produced in the laboratory by quenching molten sulfur and it was found that the spectra indicate the presence of certain red-colored allotropes which are preserved upon quenching. The color of the sulfur glass produced is redder when the temperature of the original melt is higher. This is consistent with the suggestion that Io's <b>spectral</b> geometric <b>albedo</b> can be partly explained by the presence of quenched sulfur glasses...|$|R
