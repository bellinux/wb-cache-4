5|$|Pallid <b>sturgeon</b> are {{generally}} bottom feeders, skimming the sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid <b>sturgeon</b> revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid <b>sturgeon</b> than it is for shovelnose <b>sturgeon.</b> In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose <b>sturgeon</b> and immature pallid <b>sturgeon,</b> the pallid <b>sturgeon</b> was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid <b>sturgeon</b> showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E
5|$|Taxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson {{classified}} the pallid <b>sturgeon</b> in 1905, grouping it in {{the genus}} Parascaphirhynchus and the family Acipenseridae, which includes all <b>sturgeon</b> worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose <b>sturgeon</b> (Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama <b>sturgeon</b> (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi), which may soon become extinct. These three species belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which has only one other genus, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, represented by three species found in west-central Asia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose <b>sturgeon.</b> The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid <b>sturgeon,</b> but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose <b>sturgeon.</b> Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid <b>sturgeon</b> eggs being fertilized by shovelnose <b>sturgeon</b> males.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, <b>Sturgeons</b> farm (including <b>Sturgeons</b> House) was {{acquired}} by Writtle College. In recent times, the house has been {{the home of the}} Principal of Writtle College.

40|$|Sequencing {{analysis}} was used to characterize a mtDNA D-loop amplicon of 838 bp. Four pallid <b>sturgeons,</b> Scaphirhynchus albus, and four shovelnose <b>sturgeons,</b> S. platorynchus, from four states (Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota) were used for this analysis. DNA sequencing of the nine fish revealed eleven polymorphic sites and six distinct haplotypes. No fixed nucleotide substitutions were observed between pallid and shovelnose <b>sturgeons...</b>|$|R
50|$|Currently, Italian caviar is {{obtained}} almost entirely from bred <b>sturgeons</b> and a breed in Calvisano {{is the first}} in the world to produce and sell caviar prepared with <b>sturgeons</b> by breed. Italian caviar is generally the most sold and appreciated in the world: Italy is the world's first producer.|$|R
5|$|For several decades, {{no natural}} {{reproduction}} of pallid <b>sturgeon</b> was observed, {{since all the}} fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid <b>sturgeon</b> were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid <b>sturgeon</b> in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid <b>sturgeon</b> were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms {{section of}} the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid <b>sturgeon</b> larvae were {{collected}} in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid <b>sturgeon</b> and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently {{being used by the}} larva pallid <b>sturgeon</b> for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|In Nebraska, a {{small number}} of pallid <b>sturgeon</b> have been {{captured}} along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid <b>sturgeon</b> prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid <b>sturgeon,</b> including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River. A number of these pallid <b>sturgeon</b> have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid <b>sturgeon</b> that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid <b>sturgeon</b> to return to the Missouri River.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sturgeons</b> are {{important}} because of producing the expensive caviar. With regard to decreasing of natural stocks of these fishes, cultured <b>sturgeons</b> farms are expanding, so infectious or non-infectious agents can cause problems in this industry. One {{of the most important}} infectious diseases, are parasitic diseases, like gill parasites. In this study from March 2007 to June 2008, gills of 122 <b>sturgeons</b> of south west of Caspian Sea, 44 samples of juveniles from freshwater farms and 25 samples of cultured fishes in freshwater were collected and examined. Parasites were separated and determination of species and prevalence of them were done. Nitzschia sturionis and Diclybothrium armatum (monogenea) with general prevalence 8. 7 % in Acipenser persicus and 25. 6 % in Acipenser stellatus from sea <b>sturgeons</b> and Trichodina (sp. 1, sp. 2) and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis from freshwater <b>sturgeons,</b> were separated. Statistical analysis was done according to species, sex, length and weight of fishes. Pathology, morphometric and morphological characters of Nitzschia sturionis were also studied. At the end, we have suggested ways for health management of farms for prevention of parasites entry...|$|R

50|$|Even though <b>sturgeons</b> {{concentrate}} in {{the area}} of the Caspian Sea next to the Turkmen coast, they do not currently migrate into the Atrek River owing to its low water level and pollution. Since the Atrek is the only Caspian watershed river of the Turkmen coast, <b>sturgeons</b> no longer reproduce in Turkmenistan.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of dams on the Missouri, pallid <b>sturgeon</b> migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid <b>sturgeon</b> caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid <b>sturgeon</b> eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid <b>sturgeon</b> larvae is extremely low, and of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Robert May's The Accomplisht Cook was {{published}} in 1660 when he was 72 years old. The book included {{a substantial number of}} recipes for soups and stews, 38 recipes for <b>sturgeon,</b> and a large number of pies variously containing fish (including <b>sturgeon),</b> meat (including battalia pie), and sweet fillings.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose <b>sturgeon.</b> In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid <b>sturgeon,</b> the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose <b>sturgeon,</b> all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid <b>sturgeon</b> are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose <b>sturgeon</b> are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the critical swimming speed of juvenile white <b>sturgeons</b> Acipenser transmontanus equipped with externally attached dummy ultrasonic transmitters and of untagged control {{fish in the}} laboratory. White <b>sturgeons</b> ranging from 31. 9 to 37. 0 cm fork length were subjected {{to one of three}} treatments: Control (handled but not tagged), tag attached below the dorsal fin, and tag attached with the anterior insertion point between the fourth and fifth dorsal scutes. Although transmitters were of recommended weight, we found that the swimming performance of tagged white <b>sturgeons</b> was significantly less than that of untagged control fish. Swimming performance of tagged fish was not differentially affected by tag location. Our results suggest that data from ultrasonic telemetry studies of externally tagged juvenile white <b>sturgeons</b> should be interpreted with caution due to the reduced swimming performance caused by external transmitters...|$|R

5|$|Though never {{believed}} to be common, pallid <b>sturgeon</b> populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government {{and most of the}} states with pallid <b>sturgeon</b> populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid <b>sturgeon</b> is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid <b>sturgeon</b> were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid <b>sturgeon</b> must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar.|$|E

5|$|Two {{populations of}} pallid <b>sturgeon</b> in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both {{at risk of}} extinction, and current {{projections}} are that wild pallid <b>sturgeon</b> populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid <b>sturgeon</b> females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber Dam every four to fiveyears to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done {{in an effort to}} restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the species from {{becoming}} extinct have had modest success. Pallid <b>sturgeon</b> are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid <b>sturgeon</b> behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is {{to survive in the}} wild.|$|E
