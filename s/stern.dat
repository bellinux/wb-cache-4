5|$|According to Paul D. Colford, {{a former}} writer for Long Island Newsday, Howard <b>Stern</b> listened to tapes of Steve and Garry sent from Chicago {{by a friend}} of the chief {{engineer}} at WCCC Hartford. Colford claims <b>Stern</b> eventually developed his on-air style {{as a result of these}} tapes. Later, <b>Stern</b> was hired at WWWW Detroit (which Dahl had left when he moved to Chicago).|$|E

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the <b>stern</b> to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the <b>stern</b> had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the <b>stern</b> estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the <b>stern</b> of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the <b>stern</b> of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' <b>stern</b> repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Temple Sinai hired William M. <b>Stern</b> (originally Sternheser) as rabbi.

5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that <b>Stern</b> plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that <b>Stern</b> wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at <b>Stern</b> after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. <b>Stern</b> also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E

5000|$|A former schoolmate of Bruce Banner, <b>Sterns</b> {{develops}} a deranged love/obsession with Banner's [...] "career" [...] as the Hulk. <b>Sterns</b> subjects {{himself to a}} multitude of experiments involving gamma-radiation to emulate his [...] "hero." [...] This results in <b>Sterns</b> turning into a distorted monstrosity with vast superhuman strength, and develops multiple personality disorder. From this point, a much stronger, arguably deranged, personality gives him ‘orders’ to carry out.|$|R

5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan.

Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to <b>Stern.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>stern</b> section {{remained}} aground, but did {{not pose}} a significant oil spill threat as {{the majority of the}} oil on board had already leaked or burned. Some remaining oil that was found on board was skimmed or pumped out manually. In June 1999, Green Atlas awarded a ship breaking contract to Donjon Marine Co. and Fred Devine Diving and Salvage. Although the two companies were able to remove approximately one-third of the <b>stern,</b> their attempts to dismantle the largest section or tow it to sea were unsuccessful and had to be abandoned over the winter. However, work did not resume in the spring of 2000, and in 2001, a salvage expert hired by Green Atlas claimed the <b>stern</b> should not be removed because it would create a dangerous work environment. The state later accused Green Atlas of sabotaging the <b>stern</b> removal effort in order to save money; a protracted legal battle ensued.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. <b>Stern</b> asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts <b>Stern</b> for bringing up the bribery file in the case. <b>Stern</b> swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. <b>Stern</b> also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E
