5|$|A {{wide variety}} of AAC systems have been used with {{children}} with developmental verbal dyspraxia. Manual <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can {{include the use of}} fingerspelling alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation. Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices. A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that the child {{can take advantage of the}} most effective method for a particular situation.|$|E

Thus, it is recommended to explicitly specify <b>signed</b> <b>or</b> unsigned on all structure members for portability.|$|R

5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
5|$|Plasma and ionised gases have unique {{properties}} and display behaviors unlike {{those of the}} other states, and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation. Based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density, partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E
5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of {{covenants}} between God and people. They believe that when God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E

5|$|Viruses are {{important}} pathogens of livestock. Diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue {{are caused by}} viruses. Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. Canine parvovirus {{is caused by a}} small DNA virus and infections are often fatal in pups. Like all invertebrates, the honey bee is susceptible to many viral infections. However, most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and cause no <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> symptoms of disease.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> on spines of books.|$|E

5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects. In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks. In {{areas of the world}} with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E
5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no <b>signs</b> <b>or</b> symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
