The attractive optical properties of lead glass {{result from the}} high content of the heavy metal lead.

2500|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its viscosity, rendering it more fluid than ordinary <b>soda</b> <b>glass</b> above softening temperature (about [...] ), with a working point of [...] The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, {{but that of}} lead glass is roughly 100 times {{less than that of}} ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to [...] ). From the glassmaker’s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in enamelling, and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a soda-lime glass, the former when struck absorbs more energy. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the glass solders.|$|E

40|$|We {{have succeeded}} in forming {{polycrystalline}} silicon (poly-Si) films with thicknesses of over 4 μm on <b>soda</b> lime <b>glass</b> by flash lamp annealing (FLA) of precursor amorphous Si (a-Si) films deposited by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Cat-CVD). The insertion of Cr thin films between glass substrates and a-Si significantly improves the adhesion of Si films to the glass substrates, resulting in uniform crystallization of a-Si in 20 × 20 mm^ 2 area.

50|$|This {{demonstration}} {{appears to}} suggest that capacitors store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar. In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred {{to the surface of}} the glass cup by corona discharge when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the residual charge after the jar is reassembled. Handling the cup while disassembled does not provide enough contact to remove all the surface charge. <b>Soda</b> <b>glass</b> is hygroscopic and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which holds the charge. Addenbrook (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, the charge remained on the metal plates. Zeleny (1944) confirmed these results and observed the corona charge transfer. In capacitors generally, the charge is not stored in the dielectric, but on the inside surfaces of the plates, as can be observed from capacitors that can function with a vacuum between their plates.|$|E
50|$|Glass {{shows up}} in Northern India {{at the end of}} the 2nd {{millennium}} BC becoming more common throughout South East Asia during the following millennium. Glass beads in particular become extremely popular and together with bangles form the largest group of glass finds. From its Indian origins, glass beads spread to an area from Africa to Japan, sailing with the monsoon winds and leading to their christening as 'Trade wind beads'. The most common compositional type, representing 40% of the glass finds for the region, is known as mineral soda-alumina glass and is found from the 4th century BC to the 16th century AD. As the name indicates this it is typically characterized by a high alumina content and was made by the probably melting of reh with local, alumina rich, sands.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Soda</b> lime <b>glass</b> is used {{extensively}} in camera lens, micro gas turbines, light bulbs, tablewares, optics, and chemical apparatus owing to its high hardness, excellent optical properties, and good corrosion and chemical resistance. Such applications of <b>soda</b> lime <b>glass</b> demand high machining and finishing precision. On the other hand, machining of glass poses significant challenges {{due to its}} inherent brittleness. The process of removal of material from glass, if not done in ductile mode, can generate subsurface cracks and brittle fractures which have adverse effects on its functionality. This research investigates the high speed micro-end milling of <b>soda</b> lime <b>glass</b> {{in order to obtain}} ductile regime machining. It has been found by other researchers that ductile mode machining can avoid sub-surface cracks and brittle fractures. However, in ductile mode machining, the gummy chips settle permanently on the machined surface affecting adversely the surface finish. In order to avoid such chip settlement, compressed air was directed using a special air delivery nozzle to blow away the resultant gummy chips, thereby preventing them from settling on the machined surface. Response surface methodology (RSM) and a commercial NC end mill were used to design and perform the machining runs, respectively. Machining was done using: high spindle speeds from 30, 000 to 50, 000 rpm, feed rates from 5 to 15 mm/min, and depth of cuts from 3 to 7 µm. Thre...|$|R
