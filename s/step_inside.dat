500|$|In 1955, {{an eastern}} hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) {{measuring}} [...] in height grew from a rotten knothole in the tree's main south fork. By 1963, the hemlock {{that had taken}} root in the tree's south fork remained. In describing {{the growth of the}} hemlock from an upper tree fork of the Webster Sycamore, writer William C. Blizzard referenced the idiom of Pelion piled upon Ossa. No tree hollows or visible outer blemishes were reported on the sycamore at that time; however, by 2007, the tree's trunk had developed an opening into its hollow center at its base, which allowed visitors to <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> of it.|$|E
500|$|Another {{guest on}} the Marala was Cilla Black, singer {{and a friend}} to the Beatles since the 1960s, who recalls Starr and Harrison playing [...] "Photograph" [...] during an evening get-together, with [...] "everyone on board" [...] {{contributing}} ideas for the lyrics. As with Starr's two singles over 1971–72, [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] and [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", Harrison helped write the melody, although [...] "Photograph" [...] would mark {{the first time that}} he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. In her autobiography, <b>Step</b> <b>Inside</b> Love, Black says she had hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: [...] "No, it's too bloody good for you. I'm having it myself." ...|$|E
500|$|A diesel {{generator}} is housed within the enclosure to supply electricity when external power is unavailable. Of the constant tone output capability, designer Tom Danley {{wrote that the}} [...] "target 94dB at 250 meters is not the essentially fictional 'burst' or 'peak SPL' nonsense in pro sound, or like the 'death burp' signal used in car sound contests." [...] At the annual National Systems Contractors Association (NSCA) convention in March 2007, the Matterhorn was barred from making any loud demonstrations of its power {{because of concerns about}} damaging the building of the Orange County Convention Center. Instead, using only a single 20 amp electrical circuit for safety, visitors were allowed to <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> the horn of the subwoofer for an [...] "acoustic massage" [...] as the fractionally powered Matterhorn reproduced low level 10–15Hz waves.|$|E

500|$|The Roadhouse is {{destroyed}} by demons in [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One", and her whereabouts are unknown throughout the episode. It {{is revealed in}} [...] "Part Two" [...] that {{she had left the}} Roadhouse to run a few errands. She, the Winchesters, and fellow hunter Bobby Singer track Azazel's activities to a cemetery surrounded by a giant devil's trap made of railroad tracks. Unable to <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> the giant symbol without becoming trapped and powerless, Azazel forces the human Jake Talley to do his bidding. The hunters are unable to stop Jake from opening a gateway to Hell in a mausoleum there, and the devil's trap is broken as hundreds of demons are released into the world. As the brothers then kill Azazel, Ellen and Bobby close the gateway.|$|E
500|$|Moscone {{planned to}} {{announce}} White's replacement on November 27, 1978. A half {{hour before the}} press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window, and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head. White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk {{face down on the}} floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, [...] "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty to inform you that both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White." [...] Milk was 48years old. Moscone was 49.|$|E
500|$|As {{subsequent}} Conciliation Bills were introduced, WSPU leaders {{advocated a}} halt to militant tactics. In March 1912 the second bill was in jeopardy and Pankhurst joined a fresh outbreak of window-smashing. Extensive property damage led police to raid the WSPU offices. Pankhurst and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence were tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of conspiracy to commit property damage. Christabel, who by 1912 was the chief coordinator for the organisation, was also wanted by police. She fled to Paris, where she directed WSPU strategy in exile. Inside Holloway Prison Emmeline Pankhurst staged her first hunger strike to improve conditions for other suffragettes in nearby cells; she was quickly joined by Pethick-Lawrence and other WSPU members. She described in her autobiography the trauma caused by force-feeding during the strike: [...] "Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office." [...] When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst raised a clay jug {{over her head and}} announced: [...] "If any of you dares so much as to take one <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> this cell I shall defend myself." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009 Peggy ran as an {{independent}} candidate in the local council elections against Archie's wishes. Writers wanted a storyline that allowed Peggy {{to stand up for}} her beliefs, and felt that running for local government would allow her to speak passionately about the community. After a scene showed Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) asking Peggy, [...] "Where would Tony Blair have been without Alastair Campbell?", Campbell responded by giving advice to Peggy in a video blog. A response from Peggy was then recorded, thanking Campbell for his input. Peggy pulled out of the election at Archie's request ahead of their wedding, however the storyline set up a later episode in which Boris Johnson, Mayor of London made a guest appearance in EastEnders. On 1 October 2009, Johnson appeared in the show as himself, visiting Walford and The Queen Victoria and conversing with Peggy. Johnson commented on his appearance: [...] "It was, of course, a tremendous honour to <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> that most venerable of London landmarks, The Queen Vic, and share a scene with another of the capital's icons, the fabulous Barbara Windsor." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer stated: [...] "We couldn't let the visit pass without the Mayor entering London's most famous pub, The Queen Vic, and meeting its formidable and politically active landlady Peggy Mitchell." [...] The episode was watched by 8 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 38% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E
2500|$|Campese scored {{his world}} record 25th Test try after halftime, surpassing Scottish winger Ian Smith's 54-year-old {{record for most}} {{international}} Test tries. In Blindsided Michael Lynagh recalls the try that gave Campese the world-record for tries at Test level by writing that, [...] "My dummy to wrong-foot Franck Mesnel and a <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> Philippe Sella [...] set up a break deep inside French territory. As he usually did, Campo {{showed up at the}} end of the move to score in the corner after Peter Grigg popped the ball inside to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} day, Stacy and Clinton would {{sort through the}} nominee's current wardrobe, and she would <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> a {{360-degree}} mirror to explain what she liked about her regular outfits and why she thought they looked good on her. After critiquing each outfit, Stacy and Clinton presented a more [...] "appropriate" [...] outfit to the participant to help illustrate the [...] "rules" [...] for the participant to follow when shopping for new clothes. Throughout the sorting process, most of the clothes were symbolically tossed in a large garbage can; however, they were actually donated to charity {{as long as they}} were not torn or damaged.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{the number}} of players on the field, {{as well as the}} general set up of the field, differ from men's lacrosse. [...] Female players must abide by certain {{boundaries}} that do not exist in men's play. The three specific boundaries are the 8-meter [...] "fan" [...] in front of the goal (11 meters internationally), the 12-meter (15 meters internationally) half circle that surrounds the 8-meter half circle, and the draw circle {{in the center of the}} field, which is used for the women's version of [...] "face-offs", known as [...] "draws". The goal circle is also positioned slightly closer to the end line in women's lacrosse, compared to men's. In women's lacrosse on either the offensive or defensive end, the players are not able to <b>step</b> <b>inside</b> the goal circle for any reason, except when the goalkeeper has stepped out of the circle and one defensive player has stepped in as her deputy; this becomes a [...] "goal-circle violation". [...] However, at the women's collegiate level, a new rule has been established that allows defenders to pass through the goal circle.|$|E
