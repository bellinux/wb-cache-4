He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only lay out the conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
25|$|Governments {{often do}} not <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> money to get quality {{infection}} surveillance because they have other budget priorities, {{do not want to}} acknowledge the extent of the epidemic, and the drug users and prostitutes at high risk of infection are not key political constituencies.|$|E
25|$|In {{defense of}} the APL community, APL {{requires}} less coding to type in, and keyboard mappings become memorized over time. Also, special APL keyboards are manufactured and in use today, as are freely available downloadable fonts for operating system platforms such as Microsoft Windows.

50|$|At {{the start}} of March 2001, the Antigua Workers Union (AWU), the trade union which {{represents}} close to 7,000 workers in the tourism industry, described tourism as an industry in crisis. The AWU claimed the industry is on the decline because some airlines are {{pulling out of the}} country, and government was not <b>spending</b> <b>enough</b> money to promote tourism. While the government has conceded that it was not <b>spending</b> <b>enough</b> on marketing because of cash flow problems, it has rejected the AWU's contention that the industry is in crisis.|$|R

25|$|While Livingstone had a {{great impact}} on British Imperialism, he did so at a {{tremendous}} cost to his family. In his absences, his children grew up missing their father, and his wife Mary (daughter of Mary and Robert Moffat), whom he wed in 1845, endured very poor health, and died of malaria on 27 April 1862 trying to follow him in Africa. He had six children: Robert reportedly died in the American Civil War; Agnes (b. 1847), Thomas, Elizabeth (who died at two months), William Oswell (nicknamed Zouga because of the river along which he was born, in 1851) and Anna Mary (b. 1858). Only Agnes, William Oswell and Anna Mary married and had children. His one regret in later life was that he did not <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> time with his children.|$|E
25|$|Champe Ransom, whom Stevenson {{hired as}} an {{assistant}} in the 1970s, wrote an unpublished report about Stevenson's work, which Edwards cites in his Immortality (1992) and Reincarnation (1996). According to Ransom, Edwards wrote, Stevenson asked the children leading questions, filled in gaps in the narrative, did not <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> time interviewing them, and left too long a period between the claimed recall and the interview; it was often {{years after the first}} mention of a recall that Stevenson learned about it. In only eleven of the 1,111 cases Ransom looked at had there been no contact between the families of the deceased and of the child before the interview; in addition, according to Ransom, seven of those eleven cases were seriously flawed. He also wrote that there were problems with the way Stevenson presented the cases, in that he would report his witnesses' conclusions, rather than the data upon which the conclusions rested. Weaknesses in cases would be reported in a separate part of his books, rather than during the discussion of the cases themselves. Ransom concluded that it all amounted to anecdotal evidence of the weakest kind.|$|E

500|$|Thomas was {{concerned}} that the United States did not <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> money on basic research. To this end he donated $600,000 to Washington University in St. Louis as an endowment for a chair, the Charles Allen Thomas Professor of Chemistry. He rejected the notion large corporations as being driven solely or mainly by greed. In a 1952 speech he enjoined his fellow businessmen to [...] "remember that our businesses and their profits are only {{a means to an}} end, a means toward making Americans happier and America a stronger and more unified nation." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the product}} was not {{publicly}} released, many questioned whether [...] "Microsoft had lost its senses" [...] and {{the product was}} widely derided. Critics contended that the product {{was a waste of}} money and doomed to fail. Concerns were raised about how the iLoo would serve to extend waiting lines, how hygienic it would be to share keyboards in a public loo, and {{what would happen if the}} keyboard were to be urinated upon. Critics also questioned whether users would <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> time in the loo to make use of the internet facilities, noting that [...] "most port-a-potty users stay only long enough to relieve themselves without having to inhale." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story and}} {{characters}} were generally criticised, with Game Informer stating that [...] "Amanda exhibits little growth or personality, other than concern for her fellow humans {{and a desire}} not to die gruesomely." [...] Similarly, Blake Peterson of Game Revolution noted that none of characters are fully developed. According to him, [...] "we never <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> time with them to build the emotional bond necessary for their inevitable deaths to mean anything." [...] GameTrailers said {{that most of the}} computer terminals found in the game contain unoriginal logs to describe predictable events, but also remarked that reading reports from different computer terminals [...] "grounds Sevastopol in an appreciable way." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Buczynski got {{in contact}} with Harold Moss, {{the founder of the}} Church of the Eternal Source (CEW), a Kemetic Pagan group which he had created in 1970. Fascinated by the {{religion}} of Ancient Egypt which the CES wanted to revive, Buczynski joined the order, being ordained as a priest on July 19. Adopting the ritual name of [...] "Un-Nefer", he devoted himself to the worship of the goddess Isis, organizing a temple based in New York and beginning the publication of a newsletter, which he titled Esbat. His relationship with Moss, and with the CES' secretary Ron Myron, was however strained. Although Moss was himself a homosexual, he disagreed with Buczynski's effeminate nature, while Myron had taken a dislike to Buczynski as soon as the latter had been ordained, in particular believing that he didn't <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> time responding to enquiries.|$|E
500|$|The Viceroy of India {{had already}} warned the Emir of {{approaching}} [...] "German agents and hired assassins", and the Emir had promised he would arrest the expedition if it managed to reach Afghanistan. However, under a close watch, the expedition members {{were given the}} freedom of Herat. The governor promised to arrange for the 400-mile trip east to Kabul in another two weeks. Suits were tailored and horses given new saddles to make everything presentable for the meeting with the Emir. The southern route {{and the city of}} Kandahar were avoided, possibly because Afghan officials wished to prevent fomenting unrest in the Pathan region close to India. On 7 September, the group left Herat for Kabul with Afghan guides on a 24-day trip via the harsher northern route through Hazarajat, over the barren mountains of central Afghanistan. En route the expedition was careful to <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> money and gold to ensure popularity amongst the local people. Finally, on 2 October 1915, the expedition reached Kabul. It was received with a salaam from the local Turkish community and a Guard of honour from Afghan troops in Turkish uniform. Von Hentig later described receiving cheers and a grand welcome from the inhabitants of Kabul.|$|E

2500|$|Blagojevich {{was often}} {{at odds with}} members of both parties in the state legislature.

[...] "That’s a real reason he has such poor relations with the Legislature and can’t get any of his agenda passed, because he doesn’t talk to anybody." [...] When lawmakers working on a budget during a special session met at 10am rather than 2pm, and Blagojevich's attorney threatened that the Governor was considering legal action against the involved representatives, Democratic Rep. Joe Lyons told reporters, [...] "We have a madman. The man is insane." ...|$|E

The child comes, and is smitten to the heart with remorse: then, with bitter tears and lamentations, it calls its mates, and they bury the bird with elaborate pomp and the tenderest grief, without knowing, poor things, that it isn't children only who starve poets to death and then <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> on their funerals and monuments to have kept them alive and made them easy and comfortable.
