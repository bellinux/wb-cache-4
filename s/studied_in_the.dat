40|$|Background: Mothers whose {{children}} <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands {{tend to be}} concerned about welfare of her child, increased economic needs due to the remote location and a long separation causing anxiety simptoms. Objectives: Analyzing the differences anxiety level between mothers {{whose children}} <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands with mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District Kumai West Kotawaringin Central Kalimantan Province. Methods: Reseach design is analytical observational with cross-sectional approach and use consecutive sampling. There are 96 respondents consist 48 mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands and 48 mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island. The research used L-MMPI questionnaire to determine the number of lies and TMAS questionnaire to measure the level of anxiety. The avaible data were analyzed using t-test statistical test.

5|$|In astrophysical plasmas, Debye {{screening}} prevents electric fields from directly {{affecting the}} plasma over large distances, i.e., {{greater than the}} Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} factors which can influence Chinese students’ intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. Variables to be investigated include attitudes, subjective norms, internal control, external control, and intention. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> effects of past experience were also examined. This dissertation employed questionnaire survey to collect primary data in both Chinese campus and UK campus of Nottingham University. A total of 100 students participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survey. Among them, 50 students have past experience of <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK, and another 50 have no past experience of <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. The findings showed that Chinese students’ attitudes towards <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree, their subjective norms, and their internal control are direct predictors of Chinese students’ intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. External control cannot predict intention directly, but it has a direct relationship with internal control, thus external control has an indirect relationship with intention. For Chinese students who have past experience, their attitude is the strongest predictor of their intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. And for Chinese students who have no past experience, subjective norm is the strongest predictor of their intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. In addition, Chinese students with past experience tend to hold more positive beliefs about <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. Also, they have stronger intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK...|$|R
