50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, a <b>sound</b> <b>trap</b> {{consists of}} an offset in the ductwork to reflect the sound back to its source. This configuration is often combined {{with the use of}} sound-absorbing material inside the trap. The physical dimensions of the <b>sound</b> <b>trap</b> may be selected to tune the trap to specific frequencies of sound. As such, it is then essentially a Helmholtz resonator used as a passive noise-control device.|$|E

5000|$|London is invaded. The Doctor {{recalls his}} visit to planet Pesca, where he fell down a chasm into a cavern and met Zor, the Pescaton leader. Zor said he would use the Doctor {{to find a new}} home; Pesca was drying out and falling towards its sun. Zor used his {{hypnotic}} powers on the Doctor, who fought back and escaped. Back in London, Sarah Jane finds an abandoned baby while the military shoot rounds at the invading Pescatons with no effect. The Doctor distracts a Pescaton by singing [...] "Hello, Dolly!" [...] and doing a dance so that Sarah Jane can get away with the child. Finally the Pescatons fall back to the salt water, except for one trapped in a London Underground tunnel. The Doctor and Sarah Jane search for it, and the Doctor plays a piccolo to calm his nerves. The Pescaton retreats at the sound. Professor Emerson helps the Doctor build a high frequency <b>sound</b> <b>trap</b> inside a sewer, and Zor is lured there to be destroyed as the planet Pesca disintegrates in its orbit. Without Zor to control it, the Pescaton invasion ends.|$|E

In 2008 the band released their fourth album titled Killer. To promote the album the band toured extensively both in the United States and in Europe, sharing the stage with bands like Coliseum, Rotten <b>Sound,</b> <b>Trap</b> Them and The Ocean. During the tour British Gareth Smith joined the band as their second guitar player. With this new line-up Victims got {{back on the road}} and toured the US with Trap Them and Black Breath. They also toured Europe with Municipal Waste and appeared at some festivals such as Obscene Extreme. In 2008 Victims recorded an EP titled Lies, Lies, Lies and in 2009 a split EP with Kylesa.Before touring for the Killer album was completed, a new member was on board. Englishman Gareth Smith, long time acquaintance of Johan, had recently split up his band of ten years, Raging Speedhorn. After two rehearsals together, the guys in the band decided they {{wanted to go back to}} being a four piece, although this time with two guitarists. This version of the band was soon back on the road in the US, with Trap Them and Black Breath..|$|E

40|$|We have {{constructed}} an interface which separates {{two different}} phononic crystals (PCs) with respectively effective negative density and negative bulk modulus through band inversion.

From the layered multiple scattering theory, we have uncovered that the underlying physics for these unique interface states in the hetero-structured PC are due to nontrivial constructive interferences of high-ordered Mie-scattered acoustic waves from the mismatched cylinders. The intriguing features include interface resonances of enormous quality factors (∼ 3 × 104) and chiral field patterns along the dislocation line.

40|$|Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) {{represent}} a key threat {{for millions of}} humans and animals worldwide, since they act as vectors for important parasites and pathogens, including malaria, filariasis and a wide number of arboviruses. The recent outbreaks of Zika virus infections occurring in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, represent the most recent four arrivals of important arboviruses in the western hemisphere, over the last 20 years, namely dengue, West Nile virus, and chikungunya. Since there are no specific treatments for Zika virus and the other arboviruses mentioned above, it should be highlighted that the eco-friendly and effective control of mosquito vectors is of pivotal importance. Besides radiation, transgenic and symbiont-based mosquito control approaches, an effective option may be the employ of biological control agents of mosquito young instars, in presence of ultra-low quantities of green-synthesized nanoparticles, which magnify their predation efficiency. Furthermore, behaviour-based control tools relying on the employ of swarming behaviour manipulation (i. e. the "lure and kill" approach), pheromone <b>traps,</b> <b>sound</b> <b>traps</b> need further research attention.

50|$|Trap music {{employs a}} heavy use of multi-layered hard-lined and melodic synthesizers; crisp, grimy, and rhythmic snares; deep 808 kick drums; double-time, triple-time and {{similarly}} divided hi-hats; and a cinematic and symphonic utilization of string, brass, woodwind, and keyboard instruments creating an overall dark, harsh, grim, and bleak atmosphere for the listener. These primary characteristics {{would go on}} to be the signature <b>sound</b> of <b>trap</b> music originating from producer Shawty Redd. The tempo of a typical trap beat is around 140 BPM.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the mating}} {{competitiveness}} of male mosquitoes in field settings {{is essential to}} programs relying on the mass release of modified male mosquitoes, yet studies on male ecology have been hampered {{by the lack of}} a convenient trapping method. An existing promising method makes use of the innate attraction of males to female flight tones. Here, we present laboratory, greenhouse, and field experiments on the efficacy of <b>sound</b> <b>traps</b> for the collection of Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes polynesiensis Marks, and laboratory experiments with Ae. aegypti on the effects of male age, size, and mating status on responsiveness to a range of frequencies. Age and mating status influenced the overall responsiveness to sound, whereas male size did not. There were no interactions between these factors and sound frequency. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light trap modified to produce a tone of 465 Hz collected 76. 2 % of Ae. aegypti males in laboratory cages, and 49. 7 % of males in a greenhouse enclosure. In two sets of experiments in laboratory cages, 50. 8 and 46. 5 % of male Ae. polynesiensis were captured with a trap producing a tone of 440 Hz. In the field, CDC miniature light traps or BG-Sentinel traps fitted with a portable speaker producing tones of 440 or 465 Hz captured significantly more male Ae. polynesiensis when placed near a male swarm than did traps that did not produce <b>sound.</b> When the <b>trap</b> was placed at a distance of 16. 5 m from the nearest swarm, {{there was no significant difference}} in the number of males caught between control and sound-producing traps.

5000|$|The {{sonobuoy}} {{recording of}} the last few moments of I-52's sound still survives in the US National Archives in Washington D.C. in the form of two thin film canisters marked [...] "Gordon wire No. 1" [...] and [...] "Gordon wire No. 2" [...] dated 24 June 1944. The wire from Taylor's attack has not been found; however, a set of 78 rpm vinyl recordings that include segments of Taylor's wire recordings has been located. These records were produced during the war for training pilots. On the wire and vinyl recordings Lieutenant Gordon can be heard talking to his crew, along with the sound of a torpedo exploding, and metal twisting. Subsequent to the discovery of the wreck (see below), analysts at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, experts in analyzing modern submarine sounds, studied these recordings and concluded that the I-52 was sunk by Taylor. The propeller sounds heard by Gordon were actually from the U-Boat, nearly 20 mi away, reaching Gordon's sonobuoys through a [...] "surface duct". This quirk of underwater <b>sound</b> propagation <b>traps</b> <b>sounds</b> in a channel near the surface and can transmit them for many miles.

40|$|The {{fight against}} mosquito-borne {{diseases}} {{is a challenge}} of huge public health importance. To our mind, 2015 was an extraordinary year for malaria control, due to three hot news: the Nobel Prize to Youyou Tu for the discovery of artemisinin, {{the development of the}} first vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria [i. e. RTS,S/AS 01 (RTS,S) ], and the fall of malaria infection rates worldwide, with special reference to sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are major challenges that still deserve attention, in order to boost malaria prevention and control. Indeed, parasite strains resistant to artemisinin have been detected, and RTS,S vaccine does not offer protection against Plasmodium vivax malaria, which predominates in many countries outside of Africa. Furthermore, the recent outbreaks of Zika virus infections, occurring in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, represent the most recent of four arrivals of important arboviruses in the Western Hemisphere, over the last 20  years. Zika virus follows dengue (which slyly arrived in the hemisphere over decades and became more aggressive in the 1990 s), West Nile virus (emerged in 1999) and chikungunya (emerged in 2013). Notably, there are no specific treatments for these arboviruses. The emerging scenario highlights that the effective and eco-friendly control of mosquito vectors, with special reference to highly invasive species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, is crucial. The concrete potential of screening plant species as sources of metabolites for parasitological purposes is worthy of attention, as elucidated by the Y. Tu’s example. Notably, plant-borne molecules are often effective at few parts per million against Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Anopheles and Culex young instars, can be used for the rapid synthesis of mosquitocidal nanoformulations and even employed to prepare cheap repellents with low human toxicity. In addition, behaviour-based control tools relying to the employ of <b>sound</b> <b>traps</b> and the manipulation of swarming behaviour (i. e. “lure and kill” approach) are discussed.
