40|$|Intravenous fluids are arguably one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} administered inpatient therapies {{and for the most part}} have been viewed as part of the nephrologist’s toolkit in the management of acute kidney disease. Recently, findings have suggested that intravenous fluids may be harmful if given in excess (quantitative toxicity) and that some may be more harmful than others (qualitative toxicity), particularly for patients who already have AKI. Recent clinical trials have investigated hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> <b>solutions</b> and found worrying results for the renal community.

50|$|Starch {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of various adhesives or glues for book-binding, wallpaper adhesives, paper sack production, tube winding, gummed paper, envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or soda ash, which are mixed with the <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> at 50 - 70 C to create a very good adhesive.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{experiment}} {{the effects of}} low and high temperature upon the enzyme activity, the author used papayotin and taka-diastase {{and he came to}} the following conclusions: 1) In refregirathing experiment in 0 ℃, - 18 ℃, - 48 ℃ and - 52 ℃, optimum pH in the activity of papayotin and taka-diastase is found 4. 6 ~ 5. 0. 2) The activity of papayotin and taka-diastase is not reduced even when the enzyme is iced in 0 ℃ for ten days. 3) After refregirating just papayotin powder in - 18 ℃ and working it on gelatin solution, the enzyme activity increases; and on the contrary, after refregirating gelatin solution in - 18 ℃ and working it on the papayotin powder, the enzyme activity decreases; and lastly, it is found out that the influence of refregirating on the enzyme activity is stronger when refregirated in - 18 ℃ for two hours han only thirty minutes in the same degree of temperature. In the experiment used taka-diastase, when either just enzyme powder, or <b>starch</b> <b>solution,</b> or mixed solution of enzyme powder and buffer solution or of enzyme powder, <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> and buffer solution are iced in - 18 ℃ the enzyme activity has tendency to increase a little. In case of refregirating just <b>starch</b> <b>solution,</b> the increase of taka-diastase is seen very clearly; and two hours' refregirating in - 18 ℃ is much stronger in activity of increase than of thirty minutes. 4) In the experiment in - 48 ℃, papayotin iced for thirty minutes and worked upon gelatin solution shows a little increase in its activity; but in the case when just gelatin solution is iced, it is not clear of any influence of refregirating. In the same experiment, when either or taka-diastase or <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> or mixed solution of these two is iced in - 48 ℃, the activity of taka-diastase begins to increase a little and stronger increase is found always in just <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> which is iced for two hours rather than thirty minutes. 5) In the experiment is - 52 ℃, just papayotin is iced and its activity with a little increase is more clealy shown in thirty minutes' refregirating rather than that of one or two hours. Either just <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> or mixed solution of taka-diastase and <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> is iced, the influence of refregirating on the activity of papayotin is not clear. In the experiment used take-diastase, its activity increases when just <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> is iced, and on the other hand, the influence of refregirating upon the activity is not clear when either of taka-diastase or mixed solution of taka-diastase and <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> is iced. 6) In short, it is found out that the papayotin in the decomposition of gelatin increases when the papayotin powder is iced; and taka-diastase in the decomposition of starch increases when the <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> is iced: the former is the increase of papayotin based on the disaggregation of colloidal granule (F, Nord) and the latter is that the activity of taka-diastase could be made easier by refregirating <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> and making granule into smaller pieces. 7) In heating take-diastase solution in 70 ℃ for thirty minutes, the influence of heat upon the activity of taka-diastase is not shown; but the slight decrease of activity would be seen in case of heating in 80 ℃ for thirty minutes. 8) In heating taka-diastase solution in 100 ℃ for thirty minutes, the activity is gone completely which will never come back even when taka-diastase is iced in - 18 ℃...|$|E
40|$|In the {{saccharification}} of starch by taka-diastase, {{in order}} to clarify to certain extent the correlation that exists between the concentration for both and their final decomposition product, i. e., the quantity of glucose, we have carried out several experiments; the results of which are as follows: (1) Saccharification of starch (2. 0, 1. 0 and 0. 5 % solution) by taka-diastase (1. 0, 0. 5 and 0. 1 % solution) is brought about very rapidly at the earlier stage of reaction; however, it relaxes rather rapidly, reaching its limit in a certain time. (2) In {{saccharification of starch}}, after it has reached its limit, the glucose quantity does not manifest any increase, even if we augment the concentration of taka-diastase solution (ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 0 %), or lengthen the incubation time (to the extent of 72 hours). (3) In case the concentration of <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> proves fixed (in 0. 5, 1. 0 or 2. 0 %), (a) the greater the concentration of taka-diastase solution is, (as to range from 0. 1 to 1. 0 %), the rapider in its saccharification; besides, time {{needed in order to}} reach limit, short, and, glucose amount at a certain time (1 / 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours) proves abundant, but not correspond to the concentration of enzyme solution. (b) When concentration of takadiastase solution is 1. 0 and 0. 5 %, glucose quantity for both at the limit of saccharification proves equal, which has been estimated as about 80 % or more of the amount of the final product of starch hydrolysis (by Liebermann's method); moreover, nearly corresponds to concentration of enzyme solution. (c) If the concentration for taka-diastase solution indicates 0. 1 %, the glucose quantity at the limit of saccharification is to prove approximately 70 % or more of the amount of the final product of starch hydrolysis, proving less compared to that shown in 1. 0 and 0. 5 % cases of enzyme solution. (4) When the concentration of taka-diastase solution remains fixed (in 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 %), (a) as the concentration (that ranges from 0. 5 to 2. 0 %) of <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> proves higher, time needed for it to reach saccharification limit becomes longer. (b) In case the concentration of taka-diastase solution indicates to be 1. 0 and 0. 5 %, glucose amount at the limit of saccharification of 1. 0 % <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> proves twice as much; while, that of 2. 0 % <b>starch</b> <b>solution,</b> compared to that of 0. 5 % <b>starch</b> <b>solution,</b> proves four times as much. (c) In case the concentration of taka-diastase solution is 0. 1 %, it is not enough for its saccharification, if <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> proves 2. 0 %; while glucose quantity at the limit of saccharification of 1. 0 % <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> indicates twice as much of that of 0. 5 % <b>starch</b> <b>solution,</b> that of 2. 0 % <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> does not prove 4 times as much as that of 0. 5 % <b>starch</b> <b>solution...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: The fluid {{kinetics}} of intravenously infused colloid during inhalation anesthesia and hemorrhage {{have not}} been investigated. We therefore assessed fluid space changes during infusion of hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> after hemorrhage in conscious and desflurane-anesthetized individuals. Methods: Following the donation of 400 ml of blood, 500 ml of hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> <b>solution</b> was infused over 20 minutes into wakeful and desflurane-anesthetized volunteers. Blood was repeatedly sampled to measure hemo-globin concentration, a marker of plasma dilution, and fluid kinetic analysis was performed to evaluate changes in fluid space. Results: Using a fluid kinetic model, {{we found that the}} mean volume of fluid space was 7, 724 ± 1, 788 ml in wakeful volunteers and 6, 818 ± 4, 221 ml in anesthetized volunteers, and the elimination rate constants were 7. 1 ± 3. 5 ml/min and 19. 4 ± 4. 6 ml/min, respectively. Conclusions: Infusion of colloid after mild hemorrhage resulted in similar expansions of plasma volume in desflurane-anesthetized and conscious individuals. During anesthesia, however, the expansion of plasma volume by colloid was decreased and of shorter duration than observed in conscious patients.
