40|$|Sensing {{coverage}} and network connectivity {{are two main}} requirements which maintain perfect operation of wireless sensor network. Joint scheduling method has considered both requirements by using random scheduling for sensing coverage, which divides sensor nodes to k subsets. Each sensor nodes randomly selects one defined subset. Then, the algorithm turns on extra sensor nodes, if necessary for network connectivity. As Extra-on sensor nodes participate in other nodes routing, {{some of them may}} be subject of many times transmission and reception. Furthermore, some of Extra-on nodes should be active the whole time to create network connectivity. Both mentioned reasons can drain out energy of those extra active nodes and may lead to network partitioning. Hence, reducing number of Extra-on nodes is important. In this study, we utilize probing mechanism scheduling in joint scheduling method {{to reduce the number of}} extra on sensor nodes. By using probing mechanism that some nodes change their working <b>schedule,</b> <b>number</b> of extra on nodes reduces by 20 %...|$|E

The Kanban system is one of the manufacturing strategies for lean production with minimal inventory and reduced costs. Kanban system is essential in ensuring success of Just in time practice and to create smooth flow throughout manufacturing system. Kanban system mainly deals with smoothing production <b>schedule.</b> <b>Number</b> of kanban and kanban quantity are the main design parameters of kanban system. It is important to state that there is a significant relationship between the design parameters of kanban system such as the number of kanbans, kanban quantity and factor of safety i. e safety stock. Safety stock is important parameter which is responsible for deciding number of kanban and kanban quantity. Kanban system requires more elaboration and fine tunning under different conditions where demand may be variable, setup time may be high and system may be balanced. The paper reviews various literatures and forms methodology for deciding safety stock for number of kanban and kanban quantity which will be useful for research in current field...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{high-performance}} computing community has realized that {{power is a}} performance-limiting factor. One {{reason for this is}} that supercomputing centers have limited power capacity and machines are starting to hit that limit. In addition, the cost of energy has become increasingly significant, and the heat produced by higher-energy components tends to reduce their reliability. One way to reduce power (and therefore energy) requirements is to use high-performance cluster nodes that are frequency- and voltagescalable (e. g., AMD- 64 processors). The problem we address in this paper is: given a target program, a power-scalable cluster, and an upper limit for energy consumption, choose a <b>schedule</b> (<b>number</b> of nodes and CPU frequency) that simultaneously (1) satisfies an external upper limit for energy consumption and (2) minimizes execution time. There are too many schedules for an exhaustive search. Therefore, we find a schedule through a novel combination of performance modeling, performance prediction, and program execution. Using our technique, we are able to find a near-optimal schedule for all of our benchmarks in just a handful of partial program executions...|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{increasingly}} recognized that healthcare {{is a complex}} system with limited resources and many interacting sources of {{both positive and negative}} feedback. Discrete-event simulation (DES) is a tool that readily accommodates questions of capacity planning, throughput management and interacting resources. As a result the use of DES in informing healthcare decision making is increasing. However, understanding when and how to build a DES model and use it for policy making is not yet a common knowledge. Methods: The steps in building a DES model will be demonstrated using a real-world example, i. e., pediatric ultrasound screening for hip dysplasia. The main components of a DES model such as entities, resources and queues will be introduced and we will examine questions such as referral <b>schedule,</b> <b>number</b> of ultrasound machines and type of screeners and how these entities interact. Finally a review of the statistical techniques appropriate to DES will be provided. Conclusion: Discrete-event simulation is a valuable tool in the policymakers armentarium. It can be used effectively to analyze and understand complex healthcare systems and policy problems such as population screening. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The aim of this project was to analyse population, economy and social and family structure in mid- 19 th century Hertfordshire, in comparative perspective. The 1851 census {{was the first to}} provide details of both county and town or parish of birth of each individual, whilst clearer instructions were provided for the recording of occupations, the work of members of the head's family and for recording details of farm size and agricultural labour force. There is therefore a wealth of economic, social and demographic information contained in the 1851 census, whilst its consistent and highly structured format renders it ideally suited to treatment by database management systems.

40|$|Laboratory {{studies of}} {{consumer}} demand theory require assumptions regarding {{the definition of}} price {{in the absence of}} a medium of exchange (money). In this study we test the proposition that the fundamental dimension of price is a cost-benefit ratio expressed as the effort expended per unit of food value consumed. Using rats as subjects, we tested the generality of this "unit price" concept by varying four dimensions of price: fixed-ratio <b>schedule,</b> <b>number</b> of food pellets per fixed-ratio completion, probability of reinforcement, and response lever weight or effort. Two levels of the last three factors were combined in a 2 x 2 x 2 design giving eight groups. Each group was studied under a series of six FR schedules. Using the nominal values of all factors to determine unit price, we found that grams of food consumed plotted as a function of unit price followed a single demand curve. Similarly, total work output (responses x effort) conformed to a single function when plotted in terms of unit price. These observations provided a template for interpreting the effects of biological factors, such as brain lesions or drugs, that might alter the cost-benefit ratio...|$|E
40|$|Shiftwork, {{regarded}} as a significant occupational stressor, has become increasingly prevalent across {{a wide range of}} occupations. The adverse health outcomes associated with shiftwork are well documented. Shiftwork {{is an integral part of}} law enforcement, a high-stress occupation with elevated risks of chronic disease and mortality. Sickness absence is an important source of productivity loss and may also serve as an indirect measure of workers' morbidity. Prior studies of shiftwork and sickness absenteeism have yielded varying results and the association has not been examined specifically among police officers. The objective of this study was to compare the incidence rate of sick leave (any, 22 ̆ 03053 consecutive days) among day-, afternoon-, and night-shift workers in a cohort of police officers and also examine the role of lifestyle factors as potential moderators of the association.

30|$|This {{category}} {{is the least}} explored in warehousing literature during the last decade, and practitioners also found very low interest in this area. One reason can be its low contribution in deriving costs for the warehouse in comparison with other operations (i.e., storage and picking). Papers on managing the receiving and shipping operations are very scarce, {{and most of the}} literature in this category focuses on resource assignment (e.g., truck and dock) independent from other operations in the warehouse. Receiving and shipping operations have the potential to be investigated more, independent from other operations and in integration with them. Before shipping, the picked and packed items are usually required to wait in the buffer zone until delivery time. Planning the shipping schedule in integration with picking can help save the required space for in-process items. This is particularly important for warehouses with severe space problems, as this was observed by one of the interviewees. Furthermore, integrated schedule planning of storage/picking and receiving/shipping operations can provide the opportunity to assign staff more efficiently. Another potential opportunity for research is integration of dock assignment and receiving/shipping <b>schedule.</b> <b>Number</b> of docks is limited, and if the transportation is not planned accordingly, the transport operators should wait until a vacant dock is available for loading/unloading. Integration of these two problems can make a considerable contribution to reducing the transport cost, because the transport operators charge companies for the waiting time as well as the operation. This integrated problem can be explored under setups of both separate and common docks for receiving and shipping operations.|$|E

40|$|The rate of autopsies of {{patients}} dying in hospital has now decreased {{not only in}} Japan {{but also in the}} United States and European countries. Nara Medical University Hospital now averages an autopsy rate of about 10 % for the last several years. We sent out a questionnaire on autopsy to all 80 Medical University Hospitals in Japan, and received replies from 65 University Hospitals (81 %). Autopsy time <b>schedule,</b> <b>number</b> of participant pathologists and autopsy assistants were very variable from hospital to hospital. Autopsy time schedules of the hospitals were classified into four groups. Seven university hospitals have performed autopsy on business time schedules only, eleven hospitals on business time schedules including Saturdays, forty hospitals on daytime schedules irrespective of off-days and holidays, and the remaining seven hospitals on 24 -hour schedules. However, the most interesting point was that the mean autopsy rate was not fundamentally different in the 4 groups with different autopsy time schedules, that is; 16. 3 %, 19. 7 %, 16. 4 %, and 18. 9 %, respectively. The number of pathologists and, especially, autopsy assistants is insufficient to establish a 24 -hour autopsy system at present in Nara Medical University Hospital. Cooperation with clinicians and reconsideration of the allotted jobs of paramedical technologists in the university hospital are indispensable to perform autopsies on a 24 -hour schedule system in our university hospital.
