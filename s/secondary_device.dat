The secondary was situated in the cylindrical end of the device, where its end was locked to the radiation case by a type of mortise and tenon joint.

The other end of the radiation case was shaped like a parabola to focus the radiation emitted by the fission device. The secondary assembly was an elongated truncated cone. From its front part to its aft section it was steeply tapered. Tapering was used for two reasons. First, radiation drops sharply by distance, as a function divided by the square of the distance, and radiation coupling is relatively poor. This made the use of a higher mass of the then scarce fusion fuel in the rear end of the secondary assembly inefficient and the whole device wasteful. This was also the reason why the lower-enriched slugs of fusion fuel were placed far aft of the fuel capsule. Second, as the primary could not illuminate the whole surface of the hohlraum, in part due to the large axial length of the secondary, relatively small solid angles would be effective to compress the secondary, leading to poor radiation focusing. By tapering, the hohlraum acted in a form of a quasi-parabola in its aft section without having to machine the radiation case to a parabola at both ends, amplifying the radiation focusing and enabling a streamlined production line, as it was cheaper, faster and easier to manufacture the radiation case with only one parabolic end. The tapering in this design was much steeper than its cousins, the RUNT, and the ALARM CLOCK devices. SHRIMP's tapering apparently made the whole secondary assembly resemble the body of a shrimp.

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic {{spectrum}} {{access networks}} {{are designed to}} allow today’s bandwidth-hungry “secondary devices ” to share spectrum allocated to legacy devices, or “primary users. ” The success of this wireless communication model relies {{on the availability of}} unused spectrum and the ability of <b>secondary</b> <b>devices</b> to utilize spectrum without disrupting transmissions of primary users. While recent measurement studies have shown that there is sufficient underutilized spectrum available, little is known about whether <b>secondary</b> <b>devices</b> can efficiently make use of available spectrum while minimizing disruptions to primary users. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the presence of “usable ” spectrum in opportunistic spectrum access systems, and whether sufficient spectrum can be extracted by <b>secondary</b> <b>devices</b> to support traditional networking applications. We use for our study fine-grain usage traces of a wide spectrum range (20 MHz– 6 GHz) taken at four locations in Germany, the Netherlands, and Santa Barbara, CA. Our study shows that on average, 54 % of spectrum is never used and 26 % is only partially used. Surprisingly, in this 26 % of partially used spectrum, <b>secondary</b> <b>devices</b> can utilize very little spectrum using conservative access policies to minimize interference with primary users. Even assuming an optimal access scheme and extensive statistical knowledge of primary-user access patterns, a user can only extract between 20 %– 30 % of the total available spectrum. To provide better spectrum availability, we propose frequency bundling, where <b>secondary</b> <b>devices</b> build reliable channels by combining multiple unreliable frequencies into virtual frequency bundles. Analyzing our traces, we find that there is little correlation of spectrum availability across channels, and that bundling random channels together can provide sustained periods of reliable transmission with only short interruptions.

50|$|Waste {{heat from}} {{operation}} {{is difficult to}} remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used heat sinks placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on heat pipes to rapidly move waste heat towards {{the edges of the}} device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. <b>Secondary</b> <b>device</b> temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Such a condition has the potential to melt plastics or ignite a fire. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with most laptops to reduce operating temperatures.|$|E
