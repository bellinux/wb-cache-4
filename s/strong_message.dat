With the administration taking no stand on the bill, it passed both houses with strong bipartisan support. A clear majority of House Democrats voted for the bill, while Democrats in the Senate split evenly, 21–21.|$|E

On May 10–11, 1945, the Target Committee at Los Alamos, led by Oppenheimer, recommended Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, and Kokura as possible targets. Concerns about Kyoto's cultural heritage led to it being replaced by Nagasaki.|$|E
25|$|On {{learning}} that officer José Víctor Zavala {{had been appointed}} as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend. Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a <b>strong</b> <b>message</b> to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City {{that they would have}} to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa. Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver. Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased. When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.|$|E

500|$|Historian and {{political}} philosopher Quentin Skinner {{points out that}} Otto of Freising (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form {{of political and social}} organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from Feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle Allegory of Good and Bad Government in Siena by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338–1340), whose <b>strong</b> <b>message</b> is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but [...] "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social {{and political}} philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time".|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very <b>strong</b> <b>message</b> that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

[...] When describing Obama he stated that [...] "Barack Obama is not speaking {{as a friend of}} the community; he's part of the community...He doesn't always tell people what they want to hear.

[...] During the campaign, he described Obama as the first [...] "successor" [...] of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate {{in a way that is}} unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.|$|E

500|$|Ross rebuked Nogueira for {{allowing}} the broadcast, saying its content was insidious and goading. Nogueira agreed that Reedman's words were provocative, but said Portugal {{could not be}} blamed as it did not censor public broadcasts. Britain considered withdrawing Ross in protest, but its Foreign Office ruled this out, saying Britain {{could not afford to}} be without an ambassador in Lisbon to influence Portugal's actions in the event of UDI. British Cabinet Secretary Burke Trend rejected this view, pointing to Lisbon's conduct regarding Reedman, which he said showed the Portuguese [...] "ha very clearly made up their minds" [...] to support a Rhodesian UDI. The British ambassador {{would not be able to}} affect matters, he surmised, and British interests would be better served by immediately taking a firm hand against Portugal, in the hope that this would send a <b>strong</b> <b>message</b> to Rhodesia. Ross then protested to the Portuguese about Reedman's calling himself [...] "head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission" [...] on the radio; Lisbon replied impassively that this was a private expression of views by Reedman, and not Portugal's responsibility.|$|E
500|$|Boogie Down's {{first album}} Criminal Minded (B-Boy, 1987) {{admitted}} a reggae influence and had KRS-One imititating the Beatles' [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{on the title}} track. It also contained two tales of grim street life, yet played for callous laughs: [...] "The P Is Free", in which KRS speals of throwing out his girl who wants crack cocaine in exchange for sex, and [...] "9mm Goes Bang", in which he shoots a drug dealer then cheerfully sings [...] "la la la la la la". Songs like these presaged the rise of an underground that matched violent lyrics to the hardcore drum machine tracks of the new school. The cover of Criminal Minded was a further reflection of a move towards this sort of radical image, depicting the group in a half-light, holding firearms. The next album By All Means Necessary (B-Boy, 1988) left that element behind for political radicalism following the murder of Scott La Rock, with the title and cover alluding to Malcolm X. KRS-One became involved with the Stop the Violence Movement at this time. Boogie Down Productions, along with Run-D.M.C. and Public Enemy, associated the new school as rap music with a <b>strong</b> <b>message.</b>|$|E
500|$|When Thatgamecompany designs a game, {{they begin}} by {{deciding}} on the emotions and feelings {{they wish to}} invoke in the player. This differs from the approach of most developers, who build from game mechanics or genre features. According to Santiago, the company creates emotional responses to demonstrate {{the wide range of}} possible experiences in video games, which she believes is larger than the few—excitement and fear, for example—that are typically presented. Chen has said that the company's games are meant to evoke emotions more than a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt that the game promoted green energy. Chen believes that he is [...] "too young" [...] to make a game with a <b>strong</b> <b>message,</b> and so designs the company's products to avoid overt meanings. Santiago has said that Thatgamecompany's goal is [...] "to create games that push the boundaries of videogames as a communicative medium, and to create games that appeal {{to a wide variety of}} people". She hopes to change the video game industry with this process, so that other companies approach video games as a [...] "creative medium" [...] instead of a mass product.|$|E

500|$|St Ethelbert's Gate {{is one of}} {{the entrances}} to the south section of the Close. The room above the gateway was {{originally}} a chapel dedicated to Saint Ethelbert the King and came to be used by the school in 1944. It was used as an art room before its conversion into the Barbirolli music practice room, named after Lady Barbirolli, under Philip Stibbe's headship (1975–1984), a project financed by the Dyers. A scheduled monument, the gateway was built in 1316 by the citizens of Norwich as penance for a riot in 1272 which damaged many of the priory buildings. It was substantially restored in 1815 by William Wilkins, an Old Norvicensian, and underwent further renovations in 1964 which saw the stonework and carvings replaced under the supervision of Sir Bernard Feilden. Art historian Veronica Sekules describes the St Ethelbert's Gate {{as it was in the}} 14th century as [...] "a highly decorative building presenting a façade rich in images, which the cathedral otherwise lacked. In a sense it would have operated as a principal façade and, in as far as one can glean from the remaining images, it communicated a <b>strong</b> <b>message</b> designating the gate as the opening to hallowed ground beyond." ...|$|E

Brown contrasted Norway's courage with the [...] "sheer ignorance and gutlessness of most of Australia's politicians on the plight of campaigning democrats in China".
