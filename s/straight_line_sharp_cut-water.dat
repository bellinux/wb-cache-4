50|$|The {{production}} Dino 206 GT {{was designed}} by Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina and built by Scaglietti. It had the soft edges and curving lines typical of earlier Italian cars, unlike its angular successor, the Marcello Gandini designed 308 GT4, which had the <b>straighter</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>sharp</b> edges seen most boldly in Gandini's later Fiat X1/9.|$|R
60|$|When {{we begin}} to move in <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> and turn <b>sharp</b> corners our natures begin to change. The {{consequence}} is that Nature, being more adaptive than Art, tries to conform to its sterner regulations.

Velocity/hydraulic gradient relationship plotted, yielding a series of <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> with <b>sharp</b> discontinuities of slope between each regime, rather than a curved transition from the low Darcy-type flow to the high turbulent flow region. For each material and its packing, the V-S relationship is characterised by a discontinuous exponential relationship. The upper limit of Darcy's law could be predicted more accurately from a correlation between coefficient of permeability and limited hydraulic gradient than from a Reynolds number.

50|$|The {{shape of}} cars was {{changing}} dramatically during the 1950s as soft rounded curves {{gave way to}} <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>sharp</b> corners. Improvements in construction enabled engineers to dispense with a separate chassis, allowing passengers to sit lower in the vehicle. The development of curved glass also gave stylists new opportunities. A visit to the 1955 Paris Auto Show would {{have a profound effect}} on Bache's style vocabulary. He was very taken with the revolutionary new Citroen DS, as well as the imposing Facel Vega. Other influences were the Italian coach-builder Ghia's designs for Chrysler, and work of Pininfarina, who had been commissioned to produce a coupé and convertible on the Rover P4 chassis prior to Bache's arrival.|$|R
5000|$|Vair {{represents}} the winter coat {{of the red}} squirrel, which is blue-grey on top and white underneath. To form the linings of cloaks, the pelts were sewn together, forming an undulating, bell-shaped pattern, with interlocking light and dark rows. The heraldic fur is depicted with interlocking rows of argent and azure, although {{the shape of the}} pelts, usually referred to as [...] "vair bells", is usually left to the artist's discretion. In the modern form, the bells are depicted with <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>sharp</b> angles, and meet only at points; in the older, undulating pattern, now known as vair ondé or vair ancien, the bells of each tincture are curved and joined at the base. There is no fixed rule as to whether the argent bells should be at the top or the bottom of each row. At one time vair commonly came in three sizes, and this distinction is sometimes encountered in continental heraldry; if the field contains fewer than four rows, the fur is termed gros vair or beffroi; if of six or more, it is menu-vair, or miniver.|$|R
50|$|Nearly 70 {{percent of}} the line was built on a <b>straight</b> <b>line.</b> The only <b>sharp</b> curve, which had a radius of just 200 metres, was between Staufen station and the bridge over the Neumagen. The {{gradient}}s, on the other hand, were not so favourable. Not even 20 {{percent of the}} line was horizontal. A total of at least 2,350 metres had a gradient of 1 in 50 (or 2.0%) to overcome. In February 1895, the line {{was added to the}} list of those to which the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail would apply. The operation developed very favourably until the end of World War I; revenues were higher than were initially estimated. Already in 1904-05 the loading areas at Sulzburg station had to be increased.|$|R
2500|$|Vair (Ger. Feh) derives {{its name}} from Latin varius, [...] "variegated". [...] It is usually {{depicted}} {{as a series of}} alternating shapes, conventionally known as panes or [...] "vair bells", of argent and azure, arranged in horizontal rows, so that the panes of one tincture form {{the upper part of the}} row, while those of the opposite tincture are on the bottom. [...] Succeeding rows are staggered, so that the bases of the panes making up each row are opposite those of the other tincture in the rows above and below. [...] As with ermine, the argent panes may be depicted as either white or silver; silver is used more often with vair than with ermine, but the natural fur is white. [...] In the earliest period of heraldry, vair was depicted by alternating straight and wavy or nebuly lines; today this form is known as vair ondé or vair ancien (Ger. Wolkenfeh, [...] "cloud vair"). [...] Through a series of intermediate forms, the panes evolved their modern shape, consisting entirely of <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>sharp</b> angles; but the heraldic artist is normally at liberty to use any of these forms.|$|R

After breakfast she would {{go out for a}} walk, usually to Kensington Gardens, and {{returning}} by way of Westbourne Grove, to execute some small commissions for her mistress. Between dinner and tea the time was mostly spent in the back room on the first floor, which nobody else used; and when the weather permitted she sat with the window open, and read aloud to improve herself in the art, and practised writing and drawing, or read in some book Miss Starbrow had recommended to her. With all her time so agreeably filled she did not feel her loneliness, and the life of ease and plenty soon began to tell on her appearance. Her skin became more pure and transparent, although naturally pale; her eyes grew brighter, and could look glad as well as sorrowful; her face lost its painfully bony look, and was rounder and softer, and the <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>sharp</b> angles of her girlish form changed to graceful curves from day to day.

40|$|ABSTRACT The efflux of salt {{from human}} {{red blood cells}} {{suspended}} in isotonic sucrose plus low concentrations of salt, was measured under steadystate conditions. The relationship between the efflux and the log of the salt concentration can be fitted by two <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> with a <b>sharp</b> inflection point, the steeper slope occurring at concentrations below 0. 2 mm NaCl. The determining factor {{in the rate of}} efflux is the ionic strength rather than the specific monovalent cations or anions and the effects are completely reversible. With an increase in temperature, the effects of reduced ionic strength are more pronounced and the inflection point is shifted toward higher salt concentrations. An increase in pH leads to an increased efflux at a given ionic strength, but the size of the pH effect is small at low ionic strength. At a given pH, the data can be fitted by a simplified form of the Goldman equation suggesting that with reduction in ionic strength, the permeability remains constant until the inflection point is reached. At that ionic strength, a sharp reversible transition to a new permeability state occurs. The permeability increases with an increas...|$|R

40|$|Angles and {{junctions}} {{embedded within}} contours are important features {{to represent the}} shape of objects. To study the neuronal basis to extract these features, we conducted extracellular recordings while two macaque monkeys performed a fixation task. Angle stimuli were the combination of two straight half-lines larger than {{the size of the}} classical receptive fields (CRFs). Each line was drawn from the center to outside the CRFs in 1 of 12 directions, so that the stimuli passed through the CRFs and formed angles {{at the center of the}} CRFs. Of 114 neurons recorded from the superficial layer of area V 2, 91 neurons showed selective responses to these angle stimuli. Of these, 41 neurons (36. 0 %) showed selective responses to wide angles between 60 ° and 150 ° that were distinct from responses to <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> or <b>sharp</b> angles (30 °). Responses were highly selective to a particular angle in approximately one-fourth of neurons. When we tested the selectivity of the same neurons to individual half-lines, the preferred direction was more or less consistent with one or two components of the optimal angle stimuli. These results suggest that the selectivity of the neurons depends on both the combination of two components and the responses to individual components. Angle-selective V 2 neurons are unlikely to be specific angle detectors, because the magnitude of their responses to the optimal angle was indistinguishable from that to the optimal half-lines. We suggest that the extraction of information of angles embedded within contour stimuli may start in area V 2. Key words: angle; contour; area V 2; primate; visual cortex; corne...|$|R
