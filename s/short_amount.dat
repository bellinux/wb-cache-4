This allowed the remaining trainees to further their banking careers in a relatively <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time; however, despite these opportunities, Gröning and his colleagues were inspired by Germany's quick victories in France and Poland and wanted to contribute.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Emilia reached the southwestern United States. In {{southern}} Arizona, {{a surge of}} moisture from the storm produced scattered thunderstorms, including one severe thunderstorm in Santa Cruz County. The cell dropped heavy rainfall and large hailstones in a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time; one location reported hail of 1.75inches (44.5mm) in diameter. The rainfall, which totaled several inches in some areas, caused flash flooding, with 8inches (205mm) of floodwater reported at one location along Interstate 19. Thunderstorms in Graham County produced a wind gust of 64mph (103km/h) {{at the airport in}} Safford. Unsettled conditions persisted across Arizona for about a week. In southern California, the storm dropped light rainfall, which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.|$|E

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in {{the breakdown of the}} cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{negotiated}} a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, {{in which he}} retained {{a large portion of}} revenue from merchandising. To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo, a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons cheaply. Brooks initially just wanted to animate the shorts through the basic line drawings, and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost. The studio only employed three young animators—CalArts graduates Bill Kopp, Wes Archer, and David Silverman—who adapted Groening's scripts for animation in one week, doing layouts, animation and inbetweening by hand in the very <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three, and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E

5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E
5|$|The combat that peasant men {{had engaged}} in prior to the revolt was {{restricted}} to the vicinity in which they lived. During armed conflicts, they would often fight for a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of days before returning to cultivate their lands, which remained their main preoccupation. When their service was needed, they were commanded by a local chief who in turn was subordinate to a regional leader. Most armed conflict revolved around the chiefs' bids for local influence and control or protection of villages from Bedouin plundering. There were also instances where peasant fighters would be assembled to back Ottoman authority {{in the face of}} local or external challengers, such as during the 1799 Napoleonic invasion, or against Ottoman authority when it interfered in the unofficial local autonomy that was enjoyed in the mountain regions. In most of the conflicts in which the peasant fighters participated, they fought alongside their kinsmen or neighbors.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time.|$|E

5|$|Thunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, {{and a high}} {{definition}} FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models. The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbit/s, which is up to {{twice as fast as}} the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800.

5|$|Tropical Storm Karen {{produced}} {{light to}} moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with {{a gust of}} 64mph (103km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26mph (42km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 1.8inches (46mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and 1.4inches (35mm) in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time. Skewed {{to the left side}} of the transitioning storm, the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast-moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around half an inch of rain. A buoy in Halifax Harbour reported wave heights of up to 16.7feet (5.1m), causing breaking waves at docks white caps along the ocean. Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches. There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Benfica started November by hosting Beira-Mar on the 2nd in the {{official}} opening of their new stadium. Beira-Mar won 2–1, inflicting Benfica's second league defeat, which opened an 11-point gap to Porto. Camacho blamed the defeat {{on the lack of}} goal opportunities. Four days later, Benfica received Molde for the UEFA Cup, beating them 3–1 and assuring a two-goal lead for the second leg. Camacho recognized the team was struggling to defend against corner-kicks, as both Beira-Mar and Molde had scored in corners. On 9 November, the team visited Alverca and won three-nil, with two goals from Tiago and one from Geovanni. Camacho was pleased with the performance, but said that Benfica should have scored more. On 12 November, Benfica played Marítimo, in a fixture transferred from October. Weakened by injuries in some of the regular players, Benfica could not do better than a one-all draw. Camacho attributed the result to the excessive number of games in <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time, something most of the players were not accustomed to. After a 10-day international break, Benfica opened the Portuguese Cup campaign against Estrela da Amadora on the 22nd. They won 3–1 with all of the goals arriving late in the game. Benfica closed the month with a 2–0 win to Molde, on the second leg of the UEFA Cup, with Tiago again scoring twice.|$|E

5|$|Episodes one and {{two were}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, episode three by Simon Delaney and episode four by Tim Sullivan. Ripley was in the late stages of pregnancy and permitted to work for only a <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time, so the fourth episode was filmed before the third. Ripley did not travel to Portmeirion {{with the rest of}} the cast, so a make-up artist stood in as Jenny in the beach and clifftop scenes, wearing the prosthetic stomach originally made for Ripley in the first series. A close-up of Jenny standing next to Jo was filmed in front of a similar backdrop in Manchester and edited into the location footage. The producers endeavoured to film on location once per series but the high cost of the Sydney episode and the rising salaries of the cast meant the budget could not permit travel any further than Portmeirion, a village most famous as the location in The Prisoner. Rachel's car accident was filmed on location in Moston, Greater Manchester in the early hours of 6 October 2002. Following the completion of filming, the sets were dismantled and moved to landfill sites.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem fetal extrusion were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, {{it is unclear whether}} the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E
5|$|Rukia meets Ichigo in {{the midst}} of a hollow attack. After {{suffering}} her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others. Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively <b>short</b> <b>amount</b> of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling. During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety.|$|E
