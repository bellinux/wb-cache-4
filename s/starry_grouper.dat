5000|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>grouper</b> is {{medium-sized}} fish which {{grows up}} to 60 cm.From:"The {{body of the}} <b>starry</b> <b>grouper</b> is robust and compressed. The end of the top jaw is exposed. The operculum edge has 3 flat spines; the pre-operculum is without spines. The caudal fin is rounded. The lateral line is complete, it ends at the caudal fin base and is smoothly arched. The scales are rough and relatively small." ...|$|E

40|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} between fishes is an interspecific {{interaction in}} which a fish (the cleaner) seeks food on the body surface of other fishes (the clients) which, in turn, become free of parasites and debris (Côte ́ 2000). About 110 reef fish species in 21 fam-ilies are known as cleaners (Côte ́ 2000), and no doubt this figure will increase with additional field studies. Here, we report {{for the first time}} cleaning by a triplefin blenny (Tripterygiidae) in the Tropical Eastern Pacific. An en-demic to Malpelo Island, the twin-spot triplefin, Lepidonetes bimaculatus was observed cleaning the <b>starry</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epi-nephelus labriformis (Fig. 1) in August 2009 and February 2010. The cleaning interactions (n 10) were always initiated by the cleaner, which moved slowly towards and climbed on the client, which posed almost motionless on the reef. The snout and dorsal fin of the clients were the most inspected body parts, at which the blenny occasionally pounced. All interactions lasted 1 – 2 min. Species of Tripterygiidae feed mostly on small benthic invertebrates (Feary et al. 2009), but three species from coastal New Zealand (temperate South Western Pacific) were observe...|$|E
