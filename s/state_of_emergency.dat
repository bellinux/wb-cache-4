40|$|This article {{suggests}} that the current rise {{of the rule of}} law as a mobilising political principle may be understood as a response to contemporary anxiety about authority. It also argues that the recent increase in <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> is complemented by an expansive legalism. First, the paper reviews Giorgio Agamben's description of legal expansion through <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> (or 'exception') dictated by a language of fear. Second, in a philological inquiry, it accompanies the 'founding father' {{of the rule of law}}, Aristotle, in his discussion of law's sovereignty. The core question posed by Aristotle — regarding the inquiry into the ideal relationship between law and its administration — remains unresolved in his Politics. Finally, the analysis is grounded in judicial responses to <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> In recent case law, the courts both facilitate the production <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> regimes and provide a locus for contestation of their parameters...|$|R
