5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light <b>signal</b> <b>mast</b> directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E

25|$|The U.S.S. Arizona <b>Signal</b> <b>Mast</b> Committee {{purchased}} the upper 26 feet of <b>signal</b> <b>mast</b> of the Arizona and transported it to Arizona {{and had it}} erected in Wesley Bolin Plaza. It was dedicated and donated {{to the state of}} Arizona on December 7, 1990. The 16,000 pound anchor was salvaged from the Arizona after she was sunk by the Japanese in Pearl Harbor. The restored gun barrel is one of two gun barrels on display. The gun barrel is measures 55 feet long and weighs 70 tons. It was officially placed on display at the plaza on December 7, 2013. The other restored gun barrel belonged to the USS Missouri.|$|E

25|$|The Capitol {{complex is}} fronted and {{highlighted}} by the richly landscaped Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, named after Wesley Bolin, a governor who died in office in the 1970s. Numerous monuments and memorials are on the site, including the anchor and <b>signal</b> <b>mast</b> from the USS Arizona (one of the U.S. Navy ships sunk in Pearl Harbor) and a granite version of the Ten Commandments.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, a customs {{house and}} pilot station were built at Pouto. A <b>signal</b> <b>mast</b> was erected in the sandhills at North Head in 1876, 5–6 {{miles west of}} the station. The {{following}} year, a telegraph system was set up between the two. A lighthouse was built at North Head in 1884. The customs office was shifted to Te Kopuru in 1903. The lighthouse was automated in 1947, and closed in the mid 1950s. The structure still exists and was renovated in 1982-84.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{completion}} in 1944, Taihō was fitted with two Type 21 air search radars, one mounted atop the island on the anti-aircraft control platform {{and one on}} the lower bridge deck at the aft end of the island.

50|$|The {{track spacing}} is {{also called the}} center-to-center spacing to {{differentiate}} it from the edge-to-center spacing of a railway. These two values may be different depending on how <b>signal</b> <b>masts</b> {{are added to the}} overall track geometry.|$|R
50|$|The station {{building}} on the Up platform was refurbished in 1984. The light refreshment booth was demolished around this time, along with repairs and repainting of the footbridge and ironwork. Additional facilities and refurbishment occurred in 1988. During 1990, much of the station and yard was rearranged, and included the abolition of signal boxes 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D', new <b>signal</b> <b>masts</b> and turnouts.|$|R
5000|$|The Green and Sea Point {{municipal}} council assumed {{a coat of}} arms in 1901. [...] The shield was divided vertically, one half depicting <b>signal</b> <b>masts</b> on <b>Signal</b> Hill, the other a golden lion's head, shoulders and forepaws; in the centre, near the top, was a small blue shield displaying three anchors. An imperial crown was placed above the shield. The coat of arms has been incorporated into the emblem of the Metropolitan Golf Club.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tower was}} {{intended}} as a <b>signal</b> <b>mast,</b> attended by sailors who would be accommodated within the ground floor rooms, although these were in use as a tea room by 1820. Public access was available from the start, for a small fee. The rooms were later used to house the monument's caretaker. In 2009, as part of the [...] "Twelve Monuments Restoration Project", the tower was comprehensively restored, including repairs to stonework and metalwork. The monument is a category A listed building.|$|E

5|$|Zhiyuen {{first saw}} action {{during one of}} the opening engagements of the First Sino-Japanese War, in the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894. Each Chinese ship was paired with another in a {{supporting}} role in case of a signalling failure, with Zhiyuen and her sister ship grouped together. Shortly after the start of the battle, Admiral Ruchang's <b>signalling</b> <b>mast</b> aboard Dingyuan was disabled by its own weapons. This meant that the entire Chinese fleet operated in these pairs throughout the battle without any central organisation.|$|R

50|$|All PWSSs {{were closed}} down after September 1945. In 1946, {{with its own}} Signal Station {{in a state of}} disrepair, the Department of Public Works in Queensland entered into {{negotiations}} with the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, for the purchase of the former Naval <b>Signal</b> Station, <b>mast</b> and a nearby cottage. Although consideration was given to acquiring and relocating the former Naval Signal Station, it was decided that to shift the building to another site would risk extensive damage to the fibro walls and roof, and that the building in its present position is an ideal situation for Signal Station, with <b>Signal</b> tower <b>mast</b> and flag room close by. This position has a commanding view of Bay and is more suitable than existing site of old signal station. The former Naval <b>Signal</b> Station, including <b>mast,</b> and a residence were acquired by the Queensland Government in May 1947, for a sum of £1,300.|$|R
40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} {{has shown the}} importance of Stat 6 -mediated signaling in allergic diseases. In this study, we show a novel regulatory mechanism of Stat 6 -mediated <b>signaling</b> in <b>mast</b> cells. When Stat 6 is activated by interleukin (IL) - 4 and translocated to the nucleus, Stat 6 is cleaved by a nucleus-associated protease in mast cells. The cleaved 65 -kD Stat 6 lacks the COOH-terminal transactivation domain and functions as a dominant-negative molecule to Stat 6 -mediated transcription. The retrovirus-mediated expression of cleavage-resistant Stat 6 mutants prolongs the nuclear accumulation of Stat 6 upon IL- 4 stimulation and enhances IL- 4 – induced gene expression and growth inhibition in mast cells. These {{results indicate that the}} proteolytic processing of Stat 6 functions as a lineage-specific negative regulator of Stat 6 -dependent <b>signaling</b> in <b>mast</b> cells, and thus suggest that it may account for the limited role of Stat 6 in IL- 4 <b>signaling</b> in <b>mast</b> cells.

40|$|The {{aggregation}} of high-affinity IgE receptors (FcepsilonRI) on {{mast cells}} and basophils {{has long been}} known as the critical event that initiates allergic reactions. Monomeric IgE was recently found to induce a variety of effects when binding to FcepsilonRI. Upregulation of FcepsilonRI only requires binding, whereas other responses require FcepsilonRI aggregation. Interestingly, FcepsilonRI aggregation has recently been understood to generate a mixture of positive and negative intracellular <b>signals.</b> <b>Mast</b> cells and basophils also express low-affinity and, under specific conditions, high-affinity IgG receptors. When co-engaging these receptors with FcepsilonRI, IgG antibodies can amplify or dampen IgE-induced mast cell activation. On the basis of these findings, it has been proposed that FcRs can be used as targets and/or tools for new therapeutic approaches to allergies...|$|R

Each Parish had its quota and if they were quartered in public houses or private dwellings, the parish authorities were liable for the cost. Non British units, which were not allowed on the UK mainland, were sometimes based in Guernsey, including from 1793 to 1796 French Royalists and in 1799, 6,000 Russian troops, who were quartered at Delancey.
