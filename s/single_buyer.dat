25|$|For {{a market}} to be competitive, {{there must be}} more than a <b>single</b> <b>buyer</b> or seller. It has been {{suggested}} that two people may trade, but it takes at least three persons to have a market, so that there is competition in at least one of its two sides.|$|E

Options are part of a larger class of financial instruments known as derivative products, or simply, derivatives.|$|E
50|$|Luv {{was a more}} {{successful}} band on the singles charts (at {{a time when it}} was significant for the music industry) than on the album charts because the trios first fans were, in the late 1970s, were mainly teenagers (known to be vinyl <b>singles</b> <b>buyers).</b>|$|R

After selling more records than any other customer in the south-west of England he was offered the position of manager of Revolver by owner Mike Chadwick. The shop enjoyed close ties with the emerging reggae, post-punk and trip-hop scenes of Bristol, as documented in the 2015 book Original Rockers by Richard King.|$|R
25|$|The {{bank was}} {{split into two}} parts, assets and banking on 1 January 2010. On 15 June 2011, it was {{announced}} that the bank was to be sold to a <b>single</b> <b>buyer</b> in the private sector {{by the end of the}} year. On 22 March 2011, the bank issued its first mortgage securitisation since the 2007 recession which nearly brought the bank down. On 17 November 2011 {{it was announced that}} Virgin Money were going to buy Northern Rock plc for £747 million. The sale was completed on 1 January 2012 and by July of that year a further £73 million deferred consideration was paid by Virgin. In 2014 Virgin Money repaid a further £154.5 million that it had received as part of the refinancing package.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Washington, DC, area, Tankersley recreated Al-Marah Arabians in Montgomery County, near Washington. The Al-Marah {{property}} in Potomac, Maryland, consisted of , {{and for a time}} the Tankersleys also raised cattle there. The farm later moved to Barnesville, Maryland. Al-Marah was not only a horse breeding facility; the Tankersleys also hosted a number of political and social events. By 1957, Al-Marah was the largest Arabian horse farm in the United States. In that year, Lady Wentworth, owner of the Crabbet Arabian Stud, died and a number of horses were made available for sale. Tankersley bought 32 horses, the largest importation of Crabbet bloodstock to the United States in history. [...] Lady Gladys Yule of the Hanstead Stud died within a few weeks of Lady Wentworth, and more top-quality Arabians bred in the UK were put on the market. Tankersley purchased 14 Hanstead horses, the largest group from that estate sold to a <b>single</b> <b>buyer.</b> [...] The arrival of the English horses was, in Tankersley's view, an opportunity to preserve the core bloodlines tracing back to the horses originally gathered by Abbas Pasha.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{competitive}} markets, as {{understood in}} formal economic theory, rely on much {{larger numbers of}} both buyers and sellers. A market with a single seller and multiple buyers is a monopoly. A market with a <b>single</b> <b>buyer</b> and multiple sellers is a monopsony. These are [...] "the polar opposites of perfect competition". As an argument against such a logic {{there is a second}} view that suggests that the source of market failures is inside the market system itself, therefore the removal of other interfering systems would not result in markets with a structure of perfect competition. As an analogy, such an argument may suggest that capitalists don't want to enhance the structure of markets, just like a coach of a football team would influence the referees or would break the rules if he could while he is pursuing his target of winning the game. Thus according to this view, capitalists are not enhancing the balance of their team versus the team of consumer-workers, so the market system needs a [...] "referee" [...] from outside that balances the game. In this second framework, the role of a [...] "referee" [...] of the market system is usually to be given to a democratic government.|$|E
50|$|Unlike future similar {{sales in}} the UK, the sale of Grampian Regional Transport was done voluntarily by the council which had no overall {{majority}} party and had no deep rooted objection to the sale. At the time, councils could negotiate privately with <b>single</b> <b>buyers,</b> rather than the later practice of competitive bidding. It was a sale of a going concern, rather than as seen in other areas in later years, a distress sale, or a forced sale for political reasons.|$|R

50|$|A simple {{example of}} a double auction is a {{bilateral}} trade scenario, {{in which there is}} a single seller who values his product as S (e.g. the cost of producing the product), and a <b>single</b> <b>buyer</b> who values that product as B.|$|E
50|$|In the {{simplest}} setting, the seller {{has a single}} item to sell (with zero cost), {{and there is a}} <b>single</b> potential <b>buyer.</b> The highest price that the buyer is willing to pay for the item is called the valuation of the buyer. The seller would like to set the price exactly at the buyer's valuation. Unfortunately, the seller does not know the buyer's valuation. In the Bayesian model, it is assumed that the buyer's valuation is a random variable drawn from a known probability distribution.|$|R
50|$|In crowdreviewing {{the crowd}} becomes {{the source of}} {{information}} used in determining the relative performance of products and services.

The responsibility of identifying strengths and weaknesses falls to multiple individuals which each have had their own experience rather than on a <b>single</b> individual. <b>Buyers</b> will therefore be more likely to trust the feedback of a collective group of people rather than a single individual.|$|R

40|$|A dynamic trading game is {{examined}} {{in which two}} uninformed buyers engage in Bertrand-like competition to attempt to purchase a single object of uncertain quality from an informed seller. It is shown that there exists a unique perfect sequential equilibrium. The game is compared to an analogous bargaining game in which a <b>single</b> uninformed <b>buyer</b> makes offers to a single seller. Despite the fact that, in the equilibrium of the competitive game, buyers compete away their surplus, it is shown that sellers can often gain a higher ex ante surplus in the bargaining game.
