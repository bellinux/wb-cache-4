50|$|Body shells {{are painted}} in a semi-clean {{environment}} using solvent-based paint. Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any oils {{picked up on}} the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an anti-corrosion paint dip called ED (Electrocoat Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, both inside and outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant, to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads are added to the floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's wheel arches are sealed using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the underseal to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the <b>Surfacer</b> Coat, then into the <b>Surfacer</b> Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections picked up within the <b>Surfacer</b> coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections picked up in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await {{the next step in the}} production process.|$|E
5000|$|... "Laminated" [...] or [...] "engineered" [...] logs are a {{different}} approach to log-house building. Full trees or (alternatively) sawn cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) are brought to a mill with a dry kiln, the bark is removed and the trees are sawn into boards usually no more than two inches thick. These boards are then taken to the dry kiln, where (because of their size) they can be dried without causing severe damage to the wood. Timber destined for glue lamination must be brought down below 15% moisture before the lamination process will work, so typically these timbers are dried to around 8-10% moisture. The drying process varies on the species of lumber, but can be done in as little as a week. Once the drying process is complete the planks are sent through a <b>surfacer</b> (or planer), which makes the face of the lumber perfectly smooth. These planks travel to a machine, which then spreads a special glue on the interior boards. Depending on the type of glue and type of mill, {{there are two ways to}} finish the lamination process. One type of glue reacts with radio-frequency (RF) energy to cure the glue in minutes; the other uses a high-pressure clamp, which holds the newly reassembled timbers under pressure for 24 hours. Once the glue has dried, the result is a [...] "log cant" [...] that is slightly larger than the buyer's desired profile. These log cants are run through a profiler, and the end result is a log that is perfectly straight and uniform. Some mills are capable of joining together small timbers by using a combination of face and edge gluing and a process known as finger- jointing. Boards which would be scrap at another mill may be used in the center of a laminated log or beam to minimize waste.|$|E

40|$|Synchrotron FTIR {{microspectroscopy}} {{was used}} to characterise and assess the chemical diversity of electrocoat primer, primer <b>surfacer</b> and basecoats of automotive paint samples from 75 vehicles representing a range of international car manufacturers. Significant diversity {{was found in the}} synchrotron FTIR data from the primer <b>surfacer</b> coats. Classification using principal component analysis revealed 14 discrete groups, which could be associated with the country of manufacture, the specific manufacturer and manufacturing plant, the year of manufacture of the vehicle and in some instances the number of layers in the paint system. The model generated from the primer <b>surfacer</b> was significantly more discriminating than a previous model generated from FTIR analysis of clear coats of the same vehicles. Analysis of the primer <b>surfacer</b> also avoids issues of possible environmental degradation and component migration seen with FTIR analysis of automotive clear coats. Providing such information concerning vehicle origin would aid in the development of investigative leads from the analysis of questioned automotive paint samples located at the scene of a crime or on the body/clothing of a hit and run victim...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure the {{thickness}} of paint on graphite/epoxy composite structures directly would be of benefit in the aerospace industry. The weight reduction would increase fuel mileage for the airline customer. An additional reason for reducing the thickness of paint on graphite/epoxy composites is not as obvious as the weight savings. A concern {{in the use of}} composite structures has been the effect of paint chipping after 2 to 3 years of service life. It has been postulated that the primary cause has been the application of <b>surfacer</b> or primer. The primer is less plastic than the top layer of paint and cracks form as the primer goes through temperature cycles. If the primer or <b>surfacer</b> is too thick, the crazing is more likely than with thinner applications of primer or <b>surfacer...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem {{which must be}} resolved in virtually all non-trivial robotic operations is the well-known inverse kinematic question. More specifically, most of the tasks which robots {{are called upon to}} perform are specified in Cartesian (x,y,z) space, such as simple tracking along one or more straight line paths or following a specified <b>surfacer</b> with compliant force sensors and/or visual feedback. In all cases, control is actually implemented through coordinated motion of the various links which comprise the manipulator; i. e., in link space. As a consequence, the control computer of every sophisticated anthropomorphic robot must contain provisions for solving the inverse kinematic problem which, in the case of simple, non-redundant position control, involves the determination of the first three link angles, theta sub 1, theta sub 2, and theta sub 3, which produce a desired wrist origin position P sub xw, P sub yw, and P sub zw at the end of link 3 relative to some fixed base frame. Researchers outline a new inverse kinematic solution and demonstrate its potential via some recent computer simulations. They also compare it to current inverse kinematic methods and outline some of the remaining problems which will be addressed in order to render it fully operational. Also discussed are a number of practical consequences of this technique beyond its obvious use in solving the inverse kinematic question...|$|E

40|$|Marine turtles {{spend more}} than 90 % of their life {{underwater}} and have been termed <b>surfacers</b> as opposed to divers. Nonetheless turtles have been reported occasionally to float motionless at the surface but {{the reasons for this}} behaviour are not clear. We investigated the location, timing and duration of extended surface times (ESTs) in 10 free-ranging loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and the possible relationship to water temperature and diving activity recorded via satellite relay data loggers for 101 – 450 days. For one turtle that dived only in offshore areas, ESTs contributed 12 % of the time whereas for the other turtles ESTs contributed 0. 4 – 1. 8 % of the time. ESTs lasted on average 90 min but were mostly infrequent and irregular, excluding the involvement of a fundamental regulatory function. However, 82 % of the ESTs occurred during daylight, mostly around noon, suggesting a dependence on solar radiation. For three turtles, there was an appreciable (7 °C to 10. 5 °C) temperature decrease with depth for dives during periods when ESTs occurred frequently, suggesting a re-warming function of EST to compensate for decreased body temperatures, possibly to enhance digestive efficiency. A positive correlation between body mass and EST duration supported this explanation. By contrast, night-active turtles that exceeded their calculated aerobic dive limits in 7. 6 – 16 % of the dives engaged in nocturnal ESTs, probably for lactate clearance. This is the first evidence that loggerhead turtles may refrain from diving for at least two reasons, either to absorb solar radiation or to recover from anaerobic activity...|$|R
40|$|High quality {{silicon nitride}} {{ceramics}} have shown some advantages for {{rolling element bearing}} applications. In particular hybrid bearings (silicon nitride rolling elements and steel races) {{have the ability to}} withstand high loads, severe environments and high speeds. However, the difficulties of both sintering and machining the material may result in surfacedefects,such as surface ring cracks. It is difficult to detect surface ring cracks during high volume production processes and hence it is crucially important to understand their influence and the fundamental mechanism of the failures they cause. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the contact fatigue failure modes of silicon nitride rolling elements with surface ring crack defects. In this study, new experimental and computational techniques are developed to measure and model the interaction of the surface with pre-existing crack defects. A rolling contact fatigue test method is devised for positioning the ring crack in the contact path. Rolling contact fatigue tests are conducted using a modified four-ball machine in a hybrid ceramic/steel combination. A three-dimensional boundary element model is used to determine the stress intensity factors and to carry out the crack face contact analysis. Research shows that the RCF life performance of silicon nitride bearing elements is dependent upon the crack location and fatigue spall happens only at a few crack orientations. The spalling fatigue failure is not only influenced by the original ring crack propagation but also strongly influenced by the subsequent crack face contact. Secondary surface cracks play an important role in the forination of a fatigue spall. The crack gap and crack face friction coefficients significantly affect the formation of secondary surface cracks. Numerical calculation results are consistent with the experimental observations. A quantitative three-dimensional boundary element model has been developed, which can be used to determine the geometry of acceptable <b>surfacering</b> cracks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{segregation}} to the (110) {{surface of}} a Cu 75 Pd 25 single crystal is modelled {{as a function of}} temperature by Monte Carlo simulations combined with the embedded atom method (EAM). Using EAM parameters from literature, optimised for the six transition metals of the Cu and Ni groups, does not yield satisfactory results: too low a bulk order disorder transition temperature T-c and, contrary to experimental evidence, Pd surface segregation and a disordered surface layer are obtained. These observations are contradicted by the LEIS results of Bergmans et al. [Surf. Sci. 345 (1996) 303] that revealed an ordered bulk with an oscillating concentration profile at least up to 600 K and a Cu-enriched <b>surfacer</b> They also observed a (2 x 1) LEED pattern caused by ordering in the second layer.

Cu segregation to the surface and a second atomic layer exhibiting a substantial degree of ordering that accounts for the observed (2 x 1) LEED pattern. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Abstract: Wear loss {{is defined}} as volume, weight and length {{difference}} due to the wear process. In practice, measurement of wear loss is difficult because {{most parts of the}} machine have no simple shape and are not easy or even impossible to measure the changes of volume, weight or length. In this paper, a particular method of wear loss measurement based on computer image collection and analysis was developed to measure the length changes of some particular parts such as ball grooves of the muster clutch’s release ring of a type of tracked vehicle. Macro-surface profiles of a worn surface of a groove on a release ring were taken by a digital camera first and were demarcated. Then worn scars of these digital photos were scaled in length by a computer image processing software of DT vision foundry. The geometrical relationship between wear length and depth was analyzed so that the wear depth was available as well. Results show that the length of the scar is 15. 9 mm and the depth is 1. 48 mm. Then the surface of the wear scar was measured by a type of 3 D laser scanning machine and the points cloud was rearranged and edited by a reverse software of <b>Surfacer.</b> Results of 3 D scanning show that the length of the scar is 15. 7 mm and the depth is 1. 56 mm, which is well consistent with the results of the method mentioned above. It demonstrates the effectiveness and economy of using the method of computer image collection and analysis for wear loss measurement. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES While {{permanent}} retention {{is today}} {{the method of}} choice to stabilize orthodontic treatment outcomes, recent studies have increasingly reported posttreatment changes in tooth position during permanent retention. We conducted this study to analyze changes in the anterior mandible, whether the changes follow an underlying movement pattern, and, aiming for a preventive strategy, whether any risk factors could be identified comparing findings with the pretreatment situations. METHODS We included 30 patients who had worn fixed Twistflex retainers (UK 3 - 3) extending from canine to canine in the mandible. Casts reflecting the intraoral situations before orthodontic treatment (T 0), directly after completion of active therapy (T 1), and 6 months later (T 2) were scanned and superimposed using Imageware <b>Surfacer</b> software. Posttreatment changes (T 2 -T 1) of tooth position within the retainer block were analyzed on 3 D virtual models and were compared to pretreatment (T 0) and treatment-related (T 1 -T 0) findings to identify potential risk factors. RESULTS Almost all analyzed patients revealed three-dimensional changes in tooth position within the retainer block. Comparing these movements, we repeatedly found rotated retainer blocks in labio-oral direction, while the center of rotation was located at the first incisors. This pattern was associated with intercanine expansion and excessive overjet correction during orthodontic treatment. The canines underwent the most pronounced (rotational and translational) movements. CONCLUSIONS In general permanent lingual retainers are safe but in special clinical cases retainers can induce undesired tooth movement. Risk factors seem to be intercanine expansion and excessive overjet correction during orthodontic treatment. In specific cases an additional retention device might be needed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) have unique properties, {{including}} high proliferation rates, self-renewal, multilineage differentiation ability, wide multipotency, hypoimmunogenicity, noninduction of teratomas, and anticancer properties. MSCs can be isolated from embryonic and extraembryonic tissues {{as well as}} adult organs. Human Wharton's jelly stem cell-conditioned medium possesses anticancer properties and inhibits the growth of solid tumors. Lower oxygen concentration or hypoxic condition can increase the proliferation of MSCs, {{but there are no}} differences in surface markers. We determined the osteocyte, chondrocyte, and adipocyte differentiation of normoxic WJMSCs (nor-WJMSCs) and hypoxic 2. 5 %, hypoxic 5 % (hypo-WJMSCs); from a different passage (P 4 and P 8), we determined the inhibitory effect of WJMSCs-norCM and WJMSCs-hypoCM on the proliferation of human cancer cells including cervical (HeLa), liver (HepG 2), prostate (pc 3), ovarian (skov 3), and oral squamous (hsc 3) cancer cell lines compared to normal cells including mouse fibroblast (NIH 3 T 3), human fibroblast, and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). <b>Surfacer</b> marker expression of nor-WJMSCs-and hypo-WJMSCs from P 4 and P 8 were > 95 % for CD 90, CD 73 and CD 105 and < 2 % for CD 14, CD 19, CD 34, CD 45, and HLDA-II. Nor-WJMSCs and hypo-WJMSCs from P 4 and P 8 underwent differentiation to osteocyte, chondrocyte, and adipocyte. WJMSCs-norCM and WJMSCs-hypoCM could inhibit proliferation of various cancer cell lines with minimum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) 51. 690 – 81. 440 % and cause low inhibition of the normal cells with IC 50 136. 290 – 185. 339 %. WJMSCs-norCM and WJMSCs-hypoCM were not cytotoxic toward normal cells. Nor-WJMSCs and hypo-WJMSCs from P 4 and P 8 showed no significant differences in MSC surface marker expression or differentiation.

40|$|Margaret Atwood’s novel Surfacing has {{received}} considerable critical {{attention on the}} issue of “a positive female identity” in a patriarchal society. However, given Atwood’s own stress {{on the fact that the}} novel is about the ways both genders work in relation to each other, this criticism has lacked in scrutiny of the novel’s male characters. With a relational approach to the female and male characters, this thesis argues that while creating a positive identity for its female protagonist, the novel effectively creates a rather negative one for its male characters. In order to examine certain sets of relations and the qualities which represent the most honored way of being a man in the novel, I apply the concept of “hegemonic masculinity,” which can be understood as the pattern of practices that explain male domination over women. It is indeed this hegemonic masculinity that the <b>Surfacer</b> rejects in her quest for emancipation. By looking at the hegemonic masculinity in Surfacing, I argue that the novel depicts very typically patriarchal characters in Joe and David and that the society is typically patriarchal. The thesis is divided into three main sections, each examining the most important sets of relations concerning Atwood’s female emancipation. First, I analyze hegemonic structures in the world of the protagonist, including the issues of power, emancipation, and complicity. Then I look into the sexual division of labor to show that the characters assume their default roles without much reflection. Finally, I scrutinize the characters’ relation to the Symbolic and how it affects their sense of identity. In each section, the analyses show that the male characters are reduced to tropes who only serve one function: to be stereotypically oppressive, patriarchal figures in order to facilitate the protagonist’s positive change and empowerment. I argue that Atwood’s failure to imagine male emancipation somewhat taints the development of female identity because the female emancipation becomes arrested...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle coating is an {{important}} component of automotive manufacturing. The paint shop constitutes the plurality of initial investment in an automotive assembly plant, consumes the majority of energy used in the plant's operation, and generates significant waste from paint overspray. The coating process also results in the emission of polluting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). New paint technologies based upon powder coatings offer reductions in VOC emissions along with potentially reduced energy usage and the ability to reuse paint overspray. However, quantification of these advantages requires clear understanding of the life cycle costs associated with each paint technology, modeled over the decades-long time horizons within which a paint shop operates. Life cycle cost models go beyond acquisition cost to consider all relevant cost drivers for a given system. This includes obvious candidates such as investment and operating costs, but also may include more subtle factors such as costs associated with variation, disruption, or flexibility, hereafter referred to as hidden costs. (cont.) In this thesis, methods for estimating these costs for a paint shop are explored. First, the development of a life cycle cost modeling tool, capable of quickly forecasting investment and operating costs and testing the sensitivity of life cycle cost to changes in input costs, is discussed. This tool is then used to compare the life cycle cost of three different primer <b>surfacer</b> application technologies. Next, the potential impact of hidden costs on life cycle cost for manufacturing systems are investigated, both through real-world examples and simulations. Finally, this thesis explores the wider implications of a shift to life cycle cost analysis for General Motors, in terms of both internal and external relationships for the Global Paint and Polymers Center at General Motors, and identifies situations in which a focus on life cycle cost can bolster managerial objectives. by Christopher W.
