5000|$|The <b>salsifies</b> {{are mostly}} natives of Europe and Asia, but several {{species have been}} {{introduced}} into North America and Australia and have spread widely there. There is one species considered native to North America, Tragopogon mirus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salsifies</b> are forbs {{growing as}} {{biennial}} or perennial plants. They {{have a strong}} taproot and milky sap. They generally have few branches, and those there are tend to be upright. Their leaves are somewhat grass-like. Flower colour varies within the genus, with some yellow species, and some bronze or purple. Seeds are borne in a globe {{like that of a}} dandelion but larger, and are dispersed by the wind.|$|E
50|$|Western salsify {{is quite}} similar to the {{generally}} commoner meadow salsify, T. pratensis, but the bracts which show behind the flower head, a distinctive feature of <b>salsifies,</b> are longer and more noticeable. Although not particularly closely related to meadow salsify or the common salsify or oyster plant (T. porrifolius), the western salsify hybridises readily with both, and in North America its hybrids {{have given rise to}} the new alloploid hybrid species T. mirus and T. miscellus.|$|E
50|$|Tragopogon dubius (yellow <b>salsify,</b> western <b>salsify,</b> western goat's-beard, wild oysterplant, yellow goat's beard, goat's beard, goatsbeard, common <b>salsify,</b> <b>salsify)</b> is {{a species}} of <b>salsify</b> native to {{southern}} and central Europe and western Asia and found as far north and west as northern France. Although {{it has been reported}} from Kashmir and India, recent evidence suggests that specimens from these areas may be a different species. Western <b>salsify</b> has been introduced into North America where it has become widespread, being reported from all the continental United States except for a few in the far south-east, and all provinces of Canada except Newfoundland and the northern territories.|$|R
50|$|Because western <b>salsify</b> is a {{widespread}} plant, it has {{a large number of}} alternative common names. They include western goat's beard, wild oysterplant, yellow <b>salsify,</b> yellow goat's beard, meadow goat's beard, goat's beard, goatsbeard, common <b>salsify,</b> or <b>salsify.</b> Some of these are also, or more commonly, used for other species, and are better avoided. A synonym, Tragopogon major, may also be encountered.|$|R
40|$|Scorzonera hispanica L. {{is a very}} {{interesting}} vegetable species. It is grown in Poland, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and other countries. Growing of black <b>salsify</b> in the Czech Republic is almost nonexistent. Due to its nutritional value and taste it is vegetable worthy of including into our diet. In terms of positive health effects of black <b>salsify,</b> it is important to accentuate high inulin content. This makes it suitable for diabetics, whose numbers are increasing nowadays. Black <b>salsify</b> can be widely used for food preparation. For the purpose of this bachelor thesis, there was a degustation arranged. Apparently, there is a demand for meals containing the black <b>salsify,</b> as well as black <b>salsify</b> by itself. We can certainly say that black <b>salsify</b> is perspective vegetable for Czech Republic, both for farmers and the food industry, partly for the pharmaceutical industry and, last but not least, for consumers. It is worthy to research new ways of black <b>salsify</b> use for the pharmaceutical industry as well as the development of methods and use of special mechanization for cultivation and harvesting simplification...|$|R
50|$|Like most <b>salsifies,</b> {{the western}} salsify grows as an annual or {{occasionally}} biennial forb, reaching {{a height of}} typically 20-60 cm but sometimes almost a metre. It grows typically in warm, sheltered spots with moist soil. Its yellow flower head is 4-6 cm in diameter {{and is likely to}} be seen in late spring or early summer. Buds are blue-green, tall, and tapered. The inflorescence opens {{early in the morning and}} often closes up by late afternoon. Later the plant forms a seed head that resembles that of the dandelions but is distinctly larger. The seeds themselves (known as achenes) are 2-4 cm long but featherweight, weighing about 8 mg each on average. There is some natural variation between the central and peripheral achenes in the seedhead, with the peripheral ones being generally darker and heavier, and having a higher concentration of phenolic compounds; this may enhance their survival potential.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Salsifies</b> are {{one example}} where hybrid {{speciation}} has been observed. In the early 1900s, humans introduced three species of goatsbeard into North America. These species, the western salsify (T. dubius), the meadow salsify (T. pratensis), and the oyster plant (T. porrifolius), are now common weeds in urban wastelands. In the 1950s, botanists found two new {{species in the}} regions of Idaho and Washington, where the three already known species overlapped. One new species, Tragopogon miscellus, is a tetraploid hybrid of T. dubius and T. pratensis. The other species, Tragopogon mirus, is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors were T. dubius and T. porrifolius. These new species are usually referred to as [...] "the Ownbey hybrids" [...] after the botanist who first described them. The T. mirus population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, but additional episodes of hybridization continue {{to add to the}} T. mirus population.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Germany, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from BASF to modify the existing MRLs for pendimethalin in various crops. In order to accommodate for the intended uses Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 2 mg/kg on <b>salsify,</b> to 0. 5 mg/kg for the group of herbal infusions (roots) and to 0. 3 mg/kg on spices (seeds) and on caraway, whereas the intended uses on swedes, turnips, celeriac and celery were not sufficiently supported by data and no amendment of the MRLs was proposed. Germany drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to propose a MRL of 0. 2 mg/kg on <b>salsify,</b> 0. 5 mg/kg on herbal infusions (roots) and 0. 05 mg/kg (LOQ) on spices (seeds) and on caraway. The intended uses on swedes, turnips, celeriac and celery are not adequately supported by residue data and no MRL proposals can be therefore derived. Analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of pendimethalin in the crops under consideration, which are fully validated on <b>salsify</b> matrices; further validation data would be desirable on herbal infusions and spices. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of pendimethalin on <b>salsify,</b> herbal infusions (roots), spices (seeds) and caraway will not result in a exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R

40|$|N°CNRS : UMR 6265 Centre des Sciences du Goût et de l'AlimentationChildren's {{vegetable}} intake {{is below}} the recommended amounts. No studies to date have tested the relevance of using salt or spices to increase children's vegetable acceptance. Our objective was to compare the effect of repeated exposure (RE) and of flavor-flavor learning (FFL) on toddlers' acceptance of a nonfamiliar vegetable. Two unconditioned stimuli were used: salt and a salt-associated spice. Toddlers attending six nurseries were assigned to 3 groups in a between subject design. Groups were exposed 8 times to a basic <b>salsify</b> puree (0. 2 % salt w/w; RE group; n = 47), a salty <b>salsify</b> puree (0. 5 % salt w/w; FFL-Salt group; n = 54) or a spiced <b>salsify</b> puree (0. 2 % salt and 0. 02 % nutmeg w/w; FFL-Nutmeg group; n = 50). Acceptance (intake and liking) of the target vegetable (basic <b>salsify</b> puree) and of a control vegetable (carrot puree) was evaluated at pre-exposure, at each exposure of the learning period, at post-exposure, and at 1, 3 and 6 months after exposure. In all groups, intake of the target vegetable increased from pre- to post-exposure. This increase was significantly higher in the RE group (64 +/- 11 g) than in the FFL-Salt group (23 +/- 11 g) and marginally {{higher than in the}} FFL-Nutmeg group (36 +/- 11 g). No difference between groups was observed on the increase in liking of the target vegetable from pre- to post-exposure. The increase of the target vegetable intake was still observed after 6 months for all groups. Thus, repeated exposure appears to be the simplest choice to increase vegetable intake on the short and long term in toddlers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
