5|$|The Forgotten Realms, {{the high}} fantasy {{campaign}} <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Baldur's Gate II is set, is a fictional world {{similar to a}} medieval Earth, but with its own peoples, geography, and history. In the Realms, as its inhabitants call it, fantastic creatures and magic are common.|$|E
5|$|D {{departs from}} {{traditional}} wargaming and assigns each player a specific character to play {{instead of a}} military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master serves as the game's referee and storyteller while maintaining the <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the adventures occur, and {{playing the role of}} the inhabitants. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants, and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.|$|E
5|$|Horror LARPs are {{inspired}} by horror fiction. Popular subgenres include zombie apocalypse and Cthulhu Mythos, sometimes using the published Cthulhu Live rules. The World of Darkness, published by White Wolf Publishing, is a widely used gothpunk horror <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> players usually portray secretive supernatural creatures such as vampires and werewolves. This setting can be played using Mind's Eye Theatre, which {{is a set of}} LARP rules also published by White Wolf. World of Darkness LARPs are usually played in a chronicle, a series of short events held at regular intervals, and are also popular at conventions. An international chronicle is run by White Wolf's official fan club, the Camarilla.|$|E

5|$|On Cape Cod, Vonnegut made most of {{his money}} writing pieces for {{magazines}} such as Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and Cosmopolitan. He also did a stint as an English teacher, wrote copy for an advertising agency, and opened the first American Saab dealership, which eventually failed. In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War <b>setting,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> factory workers {{have been replaced by}} machines.|$|E

25|$|A {{field is}} a <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> agents and their social {{positions}} are located. The position of each particular {{agent in the}} field is a result of interaction between the specific rules of the field, agent's habitus and agent's capital (social, economic and cultural). Fields interact with each other, and are hierarchical: Most are subordinate to the larger field of power and class relations.|$|E
25|$|The Card Players is {{a series}} of oil {{paintings}} by the French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Cézanne. Painted during Cézanne's final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size, the number of players, and the <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the game takes place. Cézanne also completed numerous drawings and studies in preparation for The Card Players series.|$|E

25|$|Extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) are a {{group of}} autoantigens that were {{originally}} identified as antibody targets in people with autoimmune disorders. They are termed ENA {{because they can be}} extracted from the cell nucleus with saline. The ENAs consist of ribonucleoproteins and non-histone proteins, named by either the name of the donor who provided the prototype serum (Sm, Ro, La, Jo), or the name of the disease <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the antibodies were found (SS-A, SS-B, Scl-70).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} purification {{element to}} the ancient Maya was the sweat bath, or 'temezcal. Similar to a modern-day sauna, sweat baths were constructed of stone walls and ceilings, with a small opening {{in the top of}} the ceiling. Water poured onto the hot rocks in the room created steam, offering a <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> to sweat out impurities. Sweat baths were used for a range of conditions and situations. New mothers who had recently conceived a child would seek revitalization in them, while individuals who were sick could find healing power in sweating.|$|E

25|$|Another form of {{descriptive}} FBA {{is called}} a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, {{it can be used}} to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest.|$|E
25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are used by}} DJs {{as a means to}} better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.|$|E
25|$|On a macro scale, one of {{the state}} and social organisations like {{multinational}} capitalist corporations, consider the example of globalization, which offers vast new opportunities for investment and development, but crises — like the Asian financial crisis — can affect the entire world, spreading far outside the local <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they first developed, and last but not least directly influences individuals. A serious explanation of such issues must lie somewhere within the network of macro and micro forces. These levels should not be treated as unconnected; in fact they have significant relation to one another.|$|E

25|$|In a {{discovery}} setting, {{the goal is}} to identify and describe cell populations correlated with an external variable (as opposed to the diagnosis <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{the goal is to}} combine the predictive power of multiple cell types to maximize the accuracy of the results). Similar to the diagnosis use-case, cluster matching in high-dimensional space can be used for exploratory analysis but the descriptive power of this approach is very limited, as it is hard to characterize and visualize a cell population in a high-dimensional space without first reducing the dimensionality. Finally, combinatorial gating approaches have been particularly successful in exploratory analysis of FCM data. Simplified Presentation of Incredibly Complex Evaluations (SPICE) is a software package that can use the gating functionality of FlowJo to statistically evaluate a wide range of different cell populations and visualize those that are correlated with the external outcome. flowType and RchyOptimyx (as discussed above) expand this technique by adding the ability of exploring the impact of independent markers on the overall correlation with the external outcome. This enables the removal of unnecessary markers and provides a simple visualization of all identified cell types. In a recent analysis of a large (n=466) cohort of HIV+ patients, this pipeline identified three correlates of protection against HIV, only one of which had been previously identified through extensive manual analysis of the same dataset.|$|E
500|$|The novel's setting {{provides}} {{the backdrop for}} a meditation {{in the style of}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who promoted an educational <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> lessons are provided by direct interactions with the natural world rather than by books and coercive teachers. Singh points out that Rousseau, in Emile, or On Education, promotes the reading and even imitation of Robinson Crusoe; literary critic Fiona McCulloch argues that the unmediated knowledge the boys gain on their coral island resembles the [...] "direct language for children" [...] Rousseau advocates in Emile.|$|E
