In other words, the after-subsidy cost would not rise for those with premium tax credit subsidies.

In 2000, while U.S. trains moved 2,390 billion ton-kilometers of freight, the 15-nation European Union moved only 304 billion ton-kilometers of freight. In terms of ton-miles, railroads annually move more than 25% of the United States' freight and connect businesses with each other across the country and with markets overseas.|$|E

25|$|The Polish Underground {{urged the}} Poles to support smuggling. The {{punishment}} for smuggling was death, {{carried out on}} the spot. Among the Jewish smuggler victims were scores of Jewish children aged five or six, whom the German shot at the ghetto exits and near the walls. While communal rescue was impossible under these circumstances, many Polish Christians concealed their Jewish neighbors. For example, Zofia Baniecka and her mother rescued over 50 Jews in their home between 1941 and 1944.

25|$|Anxious to {{pay homage}} to Stalin, Albania's rulers {{implemented}} elements of the Stalinist economic system. In 1949 Albania adopted the basic elements of the Soviet fiscal system, under which state enterprises paid direct contributions to the treasury from their profits and kept only a share authorized for self-financed investments and other purposes. In 1951 the Albanian government launched its first five-year plan, which emphasized exploiting the country's oil, chromite, copper, nickel, asphalt, and coal resources; expanding electricity production and the power grid; increasing agricultural output; and improving transportation. The government began a program of rapid industrialization after the APL's Second Party Congress and a campaign of forced collectivization of farmland in 1955. At the time, private farms still produced about 87% of Albania's agricultural output, but by 1960 the <b>same</b> <b>percentage</b> came from collective or state farms.|$|E
25|$|In versus-fighting games, a draw {{occurs when}} both players end the match through a double KO; or via time over, with the <b>same</b> <b>percentage</b> of life bar. For example, {{some of these}} games, such as Street Fighter and Tekken, require two winning rounds to win the match, and if after a third round the score ends in a 1–1 draw, the players have to fight again in an extra round. If this extra round ends in a draw, the game will end for both players. In Mortal Kombat, if a round ends when the time runs out and both players have {{complete}} life bars, the game ends for both players, because due to Mortal Kombats gameplay (in which every common hit takes block damage) {{it is virtually impossible}} for a round to end tied, and that means the players were not playing for real. In the Super Smash Bros. series, if two players have equal lives {{at the end of a}} tied match a sudden death period begins with each player having 300% damage, essentially making it so a single hit can win the game.|$|E

Heavier metals, such as iron, are partially ionized and have lost most of the external electrons. The ionization state of a chemical element depends strictly on the temperature and is regulated by the Saha equation. Historically, the presence of the spectral lines emitted from highly ionized states of iron allowed determination of the high temperature of the coronal plasma, revealing that the corona is much hotter than the internal layers of the chromosphere.|$|R
