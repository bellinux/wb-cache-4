40|$|Discussion paper. Final version {{published}} in Review of Behavioral Finance, Vol. 3 Iss: 1, pp. 1 - 26 In this paper, {{it is argued}} that previous estimates of the expected cost of equity and the expected arithmetic risk premium in the UK show a degree of upward bias. Given the importance of the risk premium in regulatory cost of capital in the UK, this has important policy implications. There are three reasons why previous estimates could be upward biased. The first two arise from the comparison of estimates of the realised returns on Government Bond (“Gilt”) to realised and expected returns on equities. These estimates are frequently used to infer a risk premium relative to either the current yield on index-linked gilts or an “adjusted” current yield measure. This is incorrect on two counts; first, inconsistent estimates of the risk free rate are implied on the right hand side of the CAPM (Jenkinson, 1993); second, they compare realised returns from a bond which carried inflation risk with realised and expected returns from equities which may be expected to have at least some protection from inflation risk. The third, and most important, source of bias arises from uplifts to expected returns. If markets exhibit “excess volatility” (Shiller 1981), or if part of the historical return arises because of revisions to expected future cash flows, then estimates of variance derived from historical returns or price growth must be used with great care when uplifting average expected returns to derive <b>simple</b> <b>discount</b> rates. Adjusting expected returns for the effect of such biases leads to lower expected cost of equity and risk premia than those that are typically quoted...|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} the degree of public {{attention}} influences the price level of stocks in a systematic way.

In particular, the financial theories first proposed by Modigliani and Miller and subsequently developed by others {{have been used to}} highlight serious weaknesses in typical actuarial thinking.

Firstly, a brief summary {{of the types of}} systems is addressed with a cost of implementation implicitly attached to each system of choice. The three major routes considered to meet the various legislated limits are: a diesel particulate filter coupled with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system based on urea, and a combination of both a filter and SCR. The systems are reviewed with an emphasis on emissions reduction potential as well as possible diesel fuel savings where applicable.

40|$|The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) {{formula is}} {{probably}} the most well-known formula in inventory theory. It determines the optimal value of the ordering quantity by minimizing the average cost in an ordering cycle. It is based on the assumptions that there is a fixed lead time and a constant demand rate. These assumptions are usually not fulfilled in practice. Especially when dealing with slow-moving items, demand seems to fluctuate. Furthermore, since the time between two successive orderings is often large for slow moving items, discounted costs instead of average costs should be minimized. In this paper we determine the optimal ordering quantity if demand is modelled by a Poisson process and the expected discounted costs are minimized. We also analyze the case where demand is uniform and/or the average cost criterion is used. We give graphical presentations of the optimal ordering quantities. Besides easily determining the optimal values, these allow us to show what the effects of changing the objective function and of changing the demand distribution are. We derive a <b>simple</b> (<b>discounted</b> cost) ordering quantity formula, denoted by EOQ(d), for slow moving items. We show that for items with a small demand rate and high fixed ordering costs the EOQ(d) is much closer to the optimal (discounted cost) ordering quantity than the traditional EOQ-formula.

40|$|Abstract Background Market Access Agreements (MAA) between {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{and health care}} payers have been proliferating in Europe in the last years. MAA can be <b>simple</b> <b>discounts</b> from the list price or very sophisticated schemes with inarguably high administrative burden. Discussion We distinguished and defined from the health care payer perspective three kinds of MAA: Commercial Agreements (CA), Payment for Performance Agreements (P 4 P) and Coverage with Evidence Development (CED). Apart from CA, the agreements assumed collection and analysis of real-life health outcomes data, either from a cohort of patients (CED) or on per patient basis (P 4 P). We argue that while P 4 P aim at reducing drug cost to payers without a systematic approach to addressing uncertainty about drugs' value, CED were implemented provisionally to reduce payer's uncertainty about value of a medicine within a defined time period. Summary We are of opinion that while CA and P 4 P have a potential to reduce payers' expenditure on costly drugs while maintaining a high list price, CED address initial uncertainty related to assessing the real-life value of new drugs and enable a final HTA recommendation or reimbursement and pricing decisions. Further, we suggest that real cost to health care payers of drugs in CA and P 4 P should be made publicly available in a systematic manner, to avoid a perverse impact of these MAA types on the international reference pricing system. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{date of receipt}} and {{acceptance}} will be inserted by the editor Abstract We study the equilibrium behavior of informed traders interacting with market scoring rule (MSR) market makers. One attractive feature of MSR {{is that it is}} myopically incentive compatible: it is optimal for traders to report their true be-liefs about the likelihood of an event provided that they ignore the impact of their reports on the profit they might garner from future trades. In this paper, we ana-lyze non-myopic strategies and examine what information structures lead to truth-ful betting by traders. Specifically, we analyze the behavior of risk-neutral traders with incomplete information playing in a dynamic game. We consider finite-stage and infinite-stage game models. For each model, we study the logarithmic mar-ket scoring rule (LMSR) with two different information structures: conditionally independent signals and (unconditionally) independent signals. In the finite-stage model, when signals of traders are independent conditional {{on the state of the}} world, truthful betting is a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE). Moreover, it is the unique Weak Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (WPBE) of the game. In contrast, when signals of traders are unconditionally independent, truthful betting is not a WPBE. In the infinite-stage model with unconditionally independent signals, there does not exist an equilibrium in which all information is revealed in a finite amount of time. We propose a <b>simple</b> <b>discounted</b> market scoring rule that reduces the op-portunity for bluffing strategies.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to study the}} dynamics of a <b>simple</b> <b>discounted</b> present value asset price model where agents have different risk attitudes and follow different expectation formulation schemes for both first and second moments of the price distribution. Instead of using a Walrasian auctioneer scenario as the market clearing mechanism, a market maker scenario is used. In particular, the paper concentrates on models of fundamentalists and trend traders who follow least squares learning processes. An analysis is made {{of the effects of}} lag lengths on the stability of the fundamental equilibrium. Some necessary and/or sufficient conditions on the stability of the fundamental equilibrium associated with the speed of the adjustment of the market maker, different risk attitudes and different risk attitudes and different values of lags (used in the learning process) are established. The results lead to the following observations: (I) Compared with the findings with the Walrasian market clearing scenario in Brock and Hommes [8] and Chiarella and He [14], different price dynamics are obtained when the speed of the adjustment of the market maker increases and, in particular, when the contrarians are involved in the model; (ii) In contrast to homogeneous beliefs, where the larger is the lag length the more stable is that in general (for both the Walrasian and the market maker equilibrium) different lag lengths can complicate the price dynamics; (iii) In the model of trend followers versus contrarians, the stability of the fundamental equilibrium is determined by risk-adjusted aggregated extrapolation rates. This indicates that although every individual forecasting rule may lead to divergence from the equilibrium, these may "cancel out" in the aggregate and the actual dynamics with learning may thus be locally stable. On the other hand, only a small group of traders with expectation functions involving significant divergence can in fact destabilize the whole system. ...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{have the}} potential to reduce transportation sector CO₂ emissions in São Miguel, an island in the Azores, while simultaneously reducing mobility operating costs. This thesis attempts to quantify the cost and environmental impacts of using EVs on São Miguel, using an economic dispatch and unit commitment model. The number of EVs and the ways that they charge are varied. The composition of São Miguel's electric power generation portfolio is varied from its current composition to one that incorporates higher levels of renewable generation. Emissions reductions stemming from EVs vary according to how the vehicles are charged and when renewable generation, which is less expensive and less CO 2 - intensive than thermal generation, is available. Charging "optimally" can save hundreds of thousands of Euros in system mobility costs per week and, in some cases, halve transportation CO₂ emissions. Optimal charging results also show that, in certain cases, charging during periods of high electric demand is acceptable. This result is contrary to previous literature on vehicle charging, and is due primarily to the limited number of generators on S~ao Miguel. CO₂ abatement costs stemming from the use of EVs vary from 26 to 160 Euros per tonne of CO₂. Portugal's tax on gasoline and subsidization of EVs make calculating the exact cost of EVs in São Miguel difficult, but a <b>simple</b> <b>discounted</b> cash flow shows that, for a 950 electric vehicle fleet, the internal rate of return over a ten year period is 8. 24 %. Other costs associated with EVs, including the installation of new grid infrastructure and charging stations, are also considered. by Maximilian Parness. Thesis (S.

In children with ADHD, the frequency of risky choices was correlated with neuropsychological measures of response time variability but unrelated to measures of inhibitory control.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a <b>simple</b> dividend <b>discount</b> model {{to resolve the}} conflicting evidence of a large negative (Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (AHXZ, 2006)) versus large positive (Fu (2009)) rela-tion between idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) and average returns. In the proposed model, IVOL strongly predicts the cross section of average returns, {{even when it is}} unpriced. That predictive ability is attributable to the relations of IVOL with dividend size and expected dividend growth, both of which are related to risk premiums. In particular, firms with small dividends exhibit high IVOL and high expected returns, while low dividend growth firms have high IVOL and low expected returns. Empirical evidence strongly supports the model’s novel prediction of a negative relation between IVOL and firm growth. Moreover, consistent with model predictions, IVOL is positively related to returns in the dividend size dimension and negatively along the dividend growth dimension. Finally, the AHXZ and Fu measures are more closely aligned with dividend growth and dividend size, respectively, consistent with their opposing relations with IVOL...|$|R
