From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics. [...] According to Lethem, the book was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called [...] "the unformed posturing phase of life". [...] The novel received mixed reviews.|$|E

500|$|For the Vertigo Tour, {{the group}} {{originally}} considered dropping the song from their set lists, but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this. All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured {{a performance of}} the song, which were accompanied by the stage's LED video curtains displaying African flags. On the tour's opening night, this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village. He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle, saying, [...] "And here it was, nearly twenty years later, coming back to Africa, all the <b>stuff</b> <b>about</b> parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time." [...] The song was also played at the preview screening of the band's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.

500|$|Since airing, {{this episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that though it was [...] "funny {{in all the right}} places, this is an episode of two distinct stories, neither of which mesh together. The whole Ed Begley, Jr. saving the forest bit seems to have been tacked on, as if the <b>stuff</b> <b>about</b> Homer finding his name being abused (shades of Mr. Sparkle again?) ran out of steam. Not a bad show, more a sort of 'So what?' show." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating, commenting that [...] "it has a number of really funny scenes and memorable lines", but overall [...] "the storyline didn't really have anywhere to go and the final half of the third act is a complete waste of time."

[...] The Gale Group publication, VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, gave it one bone out of four in its 1992 edition, but revised it to two later on.

500|$|Culturally, the album's {{glorification of}} teenage freedom {{made a very}} big impact on the overall Britpop music scene. The whole genre {{was seen as the}} voice of youth, but Supergrass, still teens {{themselves}} when the album was made, addressed the subject with more insight than most. The most well-known song from the album, [...] "Alright", is still played regularly in Britain and Ireland, and held up as a musical example of teenage rebellion. Though it is one of their most popular songs, the band rarely play [...] "Alright" [...] in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, [...] "We don't play 'Alright' anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense." [...] Around the time of its release Coombes said that [...] "it wasn't written as an anthem. It isn't supposed to be a rally cry for our generation. The <b>stuff</b> <b>about</b> We are young/We run green... isn't about being 19 but really 13 or 14 and just discovering girls and drinking. It's meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms." [...] Danny Goffey noted, [...] "It certainly wasn't written in a very summery vibe.

Berman originally described the episode as a press junket when talking about [...] at an event held by UPN for the Television Critics Association. He {{said it was a}} [...] "very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an 'Odd Couple' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun." [...] Bakula also explained {{in an interview with the}} website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will [...] "find out a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>about</b> [...] that we may not have wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!"

500|$|James Reed from The Boston Globe {{gave the}} album a {{negative}} review and criticized it {{for being too}} dated, commenting that its [...] "release date is 2010, but its freshness seal is clearly stamped 2000 (circa Minogue's Light Years) [...] ". He called the album Minogue's [...] "least interesting work she's made in a decade" [...] and a [...] "letdown", and concluded by saying that [...] "simply being fabulous isn't enough". Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian acknowledged the album's [...] "sharp production", but commented that the album is [...] "only as good as Kylie herself" [...] and criticized it for being uninteresting; she concluded by saying that [...] "Perhaps thinking outside the box – an acoustic album? – is what's needed next". Margaret Wappler from the Los Angeles Times commented on the album's dependency on [...] "old reliable" [...] music and concluded [...] "Our midnight bird (Minogue) {{has been in the}} club for a long time, however, and it shows". Sophia Money-Coutts from The National was not impressed with Minogue for bringing [...] "the usual <b>stuff</b> <b>about</b> being completely herself on this album and how happy that has made her" [...] and also criticized Price for not producing anything inventive. The critic was specifically negative towards billing Aphrodite as a comeback similar to Fever, because she felt it lacked new and diverse material from Minogue's previous efforts; she summed up by saying that [...] "Criticising Kylie feels like swearing at the Dalai Lama, but this is a princess that needs a slight prod".|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for The Boston Globe, John Freeman observes that Clarke's fantasy, {{like that of}} Franz Kafka and Neil Gaiman, is imbued with realism. He argues that the {{footnotes}} in particular lend an air of credibility to the narrative: for example, they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and list where particular paintings in Norrell’s house are located. In an interview, Clarke describes how she creates this realist fantasy: [...] "One way of grounding the magic is by putting in lots of <b>stuff</b> <b>about</b> street lamps, carriages and {{how difficult it is}} to get good servants." [...] To create this effect, the novel includes many references to real early-nineteenth century people and things, such as: artists Francisco Goya, Cruikshank, and Rowlandson; writers Frances Burney, William Beckford, Monk Lewis, Lord Byron, and Ann Radcliffe; Maria Edgeworth's Belinda and Austen's Emma; publisher John Murray; politicians Lord Castlereagh and George Canning; The Gentleman's Magazine and The Edinburgh Review; Chippendale and Wedgwood furnishings; and the madness of King George III. Clarke has said that she hopes the magic is as realistic as that in Le Guin's Earthsea trilogy. This realism has led other reviewers, such as Polly Shulman, to argue that Clarke's book is more of an historical fiction, akin to the works of Patrick O'Brian. As she explains, [...] "Both Clarke's and O'Brian's stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession; both are set during the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape." [...] Shulman sees fantasy and historical fiction as similar because both must follow rigid rules or risk a breakdown of the narrative.|$|E

John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter pointed out the limited scope of the film, calling it [...] "neither a comprehensive portrait nor one of those tossed-off featurettes that would be at home only as the filler for a commemorative Achtung Baby boxed set". Commenting on Guggenheim's filmmaking style, DeFore judged that some of his attempts to make the film more [...] "movie-ish" [...] failed to enhance the subject material.
