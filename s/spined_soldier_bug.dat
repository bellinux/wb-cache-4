50|$|The <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris is {{used and}} {{developed}} as a biological control agent against the beetle.|$|E

50|$|Spiders {{and many}} insects {{are the major}} predators of Karner blue butterflies. The seven-spotted lady beetle {{is one of the}} few {{confirmed}} predators of Karner blue butterfly larvae. Paper wasps (Polistes spp.), <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bugs,</b> and ants (Formica spp.) have been observed removing larvae, and the ant Monomorium emarginatum has been seen chewing on Karner blue butterfly eggs. There is currently no explanation for the removal of larvae or chewing of eggs by some of the same ant species that tend larvae. Other potential predators of Karner blue butterfly larvae include green lacewings, soldier beetles, and damsel bugs. Predators of adult Karner blue butterflies include dragonflies, robber flies, ambush bugs (Phymatidae) and spiders, such as crab spiders. Assassin bugs (Reduviidae) are also likely predators of adult Karner blue butterflies.|$|R
50|$|Other foliar-foraging predators {{that are}} present North American soybean fields that {{may play a}} role in {{suppression}} of soybean aphid populations include green lacewings (Chrysoperla spp.), brown lacewings (Hemerobius spp.), damsel bugs (Nabis spp.), big eyed <b>bugs</b> (Geocoris spp.), <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bugs</b> (Podisus maculiventris (Say)), hover flies (Syrphidae spp.), and the aphid midge (Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani)). Another group of predators that are present in soybean fields is ground beetles (Carabidae spp.); however, field experiments have shown limited to no impact from these predators on populations of soybean aphids due to the fact that ground beetles rarely scale soybean plants for prey. While parasitoids of the soybean aphid have a large impact on colonies in Asia—Lysiphlebia japonica (Ashmead) can have a soybean aphid parasitism rate as high as 52.6% in China—parasitoids are thought to exert only minimal pressure on soybean aphids in North America.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bugs,</b> Podisus maculiventris, are heteropteran {{insects that}} feed voraciously on other insects, {{particular}} the soft bodied larval forms of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. The response of P. maculiventris Malpighian tubules (MTs) to serotonin and known diuretic and antidiuretic peptides has been investigated, and is {{compared with that}} of MT from the hematophagous and phytophagous heteropteran bugs Rhodnius prolixus and Acrosternum hilare, respectively. A CRF-related peptide diuretic hormone (DH) from the termite Zootermopsis nevadensis (Zoone-DH) stimulated MT secretion, which was reversed {{by a member of the}} CAP(2 b) family of peptides from A. hilare (Acrhi-CAP(2 b) - 2), an antidiuretic effect. Serotonin had no effect on secretion, neither did a representative calcitonin-like DH, kinin, tachykinin-related peptide, and an antidiuretic factor from the mealworm Tenebrio molitor (Tenmo-ADFb) in both P. maculiventris or A. hilare. Serotonin is a DH in R. prolixus, and its lack of effect on MT from P. maculiventris and A. hilare suggests this is an adaptation to hematophagy. On the other hand, the antidiuretic activity of members of the CAP(2 b) family in all three bugs is consistent with this being a heteropteran feature rather than a specialism for hematophagy...|$|R
50|$|Some species attack pest {{insects and}} are used in {{biological}} control. One {{of these is the}} <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> (Podisus maculiventris) that sucks body fluids from larvae of the Colorado beetle and the Mexican bean beetle.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} predators of Z. exclamationis in its {{different}} life stages. Eggs are predated by the melyrid beetle Collops vittatus, the thirteen spotted ladybird Hippodamia tredecimpunctata, and the convergent ladybird H. convergens. Larvae {{of the common}} green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea consume both eggs and larvae. The <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> Podius maculiventris predates both larvae and adults.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> (Podisus maculiventris) is {{a species}} of insect common in North America. They are predators of gypsy moth {{caterpillars}} and the larvae of beetles such as the Colorado potato beetle and the Mexican bean beetle. Since the Mexican bean beetle {{is widely regarded as}} a notorious agricultural pest in North America, soldier bugs are generally considered useful garden insects.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} how plant defensive traits will evolve, {{we need to}} consider the biotic context for plant-herbivore interactions. I investigated how predators affect selection on defensive traits in plants. First, I established the timing of resistance in three soybean genotypes. Next, I examined the combined effects of resistance and predators on plant fitness. I reared Mexican bean beetles (MBBs) with or without <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bugs</b> (SSBs) on soybeans with constitutive resistance (CR) or no resistance (NR). SSBs fed more on MBBs that fed on NR than on CR plants, and this translated into an increased fitness benefit from predators for NR plants over CR plants. Selection for some types of resistance in plants should thus be stronger with lower predation rates. Similarly, I reared MBBs with or without SSBs on soybeans with early induced resistance (EI), late induced resistance (LI), or CR. SSBs fed more on MBBs reared on LI plants than on beetles raised on CR plants, but no more on beetles reared on EI plants than on beetles reared on CR plants. LI plants were the only of the three soybean varieties to receive a fitness benefit from predators, which could help explain the evolution of this type of plant defense. The results of both experiments also suggest that predator introductions may be more beneficial to LI or NR crop plants than EI or CR crops. Finally, I present a model that determines the optimum amount of induced resistance (IR) and CR for a plant growing with and without neighbors. Unlike earlier models, our plants have a probability of being attacked that is modified by short- and long-term feedback of plant defenses to herbivores. Higher costs of defense favor IR over CR, while increasing herbivore attack rates or increasing the overall effectiveness of defense results in more CR. Plants with neighbors might be selected to evolve higher or lower levels of CR than if they were growing alone. Adding neighbors also selects for more mixed induced/constitutive strategies for all parameters. Having defended neighbors could thus be {{part of the reason why}} plants have evolved such mixed defense strategies. Dissertatio...|$|R

50|$|The green stink <b>bug</b> {{or green}} <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> (Chinavia hilaris) is a stink bug {{belonging}} to the family Pentatomidae.|$|R
50|$|This insect is a generalist {{predator}} {{with a broad}} host range, reportedly attacking 90 insect species, {{which includes}} several important economic pests. Reported prey include the larvae of Mexican bean beetle, European corn borer, diamondback moth, corn earworm, beet armyworm, fall armyworm, cabbage looper, imported cabbageworm, Colorado potato beetle, velvetbean caterpillar, and flea beetles. When prey are scarce, the <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> may feed on plant juices, but this feeding is not reported to cause plant damage. Podisus maculiventris is associated with several crops including alfalfa, apples, asparagus, beans, celery, cotton, crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, potatoes, onions, soybeans, sweet corn and tomatoes. The effectiveness of this species in preying on economic pests resulted in its use in classical biological control programs in other countries, including Eastern Europe and Russia. However, {{this has not been}} successful in colder climates, perhaps due to an inability of overwinter. Podisus maculiventris eggs are also sold commercially for use in control programs and this has proven successful in controlling pests in European and North American heated greenhouses. Use in large area field crops is often not economically viable due to the production costs of raising the bug. In addition, naturally occurring populations often are not numerous enough to overpower large populations of pests in the spring. Pheromones have been used to draw naturally occurring and newly emerging populations of this stink bug to target crops in the spring.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the lethal}} effect of predators on their prey is well established, we {{know little about}} how prey in {{terrestrial}} insect systems perceive and respond to non-lethal predation threat (non-consumptive effects). By investigating {{the relationship between the}} Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata and its predator, the <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris, we examined prey behavioral responses when there was a risk of predation as well as the mechanism of prey perception of predators. When exposed to predation risk, beetle adults and larvae reduce their feeding. This effect was still present when larvae were exposed predator volatiles alone. Further, adult beetles reduced oviposition in the presence of non-lethal predators. These results are particularly interesting in attempting to understand the full effect of predators, like the <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> as biological control agents in agricultural systems. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|The <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris (Say), is an {{important}} biological control agent of agricultural and forest pests; and it preys on eggs and larvae of lepidopteran and coleopteran species. Genetic variability among field samples collected from Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Florida and established laboratory colonies was examined using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism-Polymerase Chain Reaction (AFLP-PCR). Four AFLP primer pairs generated a total of 340 molecular markers for evaluation. Results from Analysis of Molecular Variance showed {{that the majority of}} the genetic variation occurred within populations (individuals from each sample site). Nei’s method indicated reduced genetic diversity in laboratory populations compared to field populations. No major differences or deficiencies were apparent among the field samples from different areas or among the laboratory reared samples. We conclude that field populations are panmictic and laboratory reared <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> could be useful as biological control agents in the field...|$|E
50|$|Cermatulus nasalis is {{a species}} of predatory shield bug in the family Pentatomidae. It is {{commonly}} known as the brown <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> or glossy shield bug and is native to Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|There {{are about}} six species. The best known by far is Pyrrhocoris apterus, {{commonly}} called the firebug, red firebug, linden bug, sap sucking <b>bug,</b> and red <b>soldier</b> <b>bug.</b> Many {{aspects of the}} biology of this species have been studied extensively.|$|R
5000|$|Perillus bioculatus, the two-spotted stink <b>bug</b> or double-eyed <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> is {{a species}} of insect in the family Pentatomidae native to North America.

40|$|As {{fields are}} being scouted for second-generation bean leaf beetles, stink bugs are being found in greater {{abundance}} than usual during late summer. These stink bugs {{are unlikely to}} cause any economic damage (i. e., damage that would justify an insecticide application). There are three species of stink bugs that are fairly common in Iowa soybean: the green stink bug, brown stink bug, and <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug.</b> The green stink bug and brown stink bug are both pests and can damage pods.

30|$|Among {{different}} Amps, a recombinant thanatin {{has been}} synthetized and evaluated in this study. Thanatin was originated from the <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> (Podisus maculiventris). It {{is the first}} inducible insect peptide with {{a broad range of}} activity against bacteria and fungi at physiological concentrations. Thanatin contains two amino acids including two cysteine residues that form a disulfide bridge (Mandard et al. 1998). So far, several studies have been performed on this peptide. For example, the transgenic rice encoded thanatin was resistant to blast disease in field evaluations (Imamura et al. 2010). Another study showed that the transgenic Arabidopsis encoded thanatin was resistant to the fungal and bacterial pathogens (Wu et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|The predatory <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), is an {{economically}} important and highly valued biological control agent. There is substantial {{information on the}} biology, ecology, behavior, and rearing of this stink bug. However, virtually nothing is known of its genetic variation, in natural or domesticated populations. To address this lacuna, we used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to assess the genetic variability of field and laboratory populations. Four AFLP universal primer combinations yielded a total of 209 usable loci. The AFLP results showed greater genetic variability between populations from Missouri and Mississippi (both USA), and relatively low variability within Missouri populations. We infer little genetic isolation among Missouri field populations and within laboratory populations but a significant genetic isolation between Missouri and Mississippi populations...|$|E

40|$|Nymphal instars {{and adults}} of the <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris, preferably feed on {{lepidopteran}} and colopteran larvae. Different prey diets can change fitness including energy reservoirs of the predator. In the present study, effects of different artificial and natural diets {{as well as}} starvation was studied on energy contents of {{the third and fourth}} nymphal instars of P. maculiventris. Total available energy calculated as the sum of the energy contents of lipids, carbohydrates, glycogen, and proteins did not significantly differ in the third and fourth nymphal instars fed on natural and artificial diets. Among the energy reservoirs, only total lipid storage of the starved nymphal instars was significantly different from that in the bugs fed on the natural diet. In conclusion, total energy reserves cannot be changed in response to artificial diet. A better understanding of the impact of artificial diets on the energy reserves of natural enemies can be considered as a biomarker for more appropriate mass rearing approaches of natural enemies. ...|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxin-producing fungi can {{contaminate}} {{plants and}} plant-derived products with carcinogenic secondary metabolites that present {{a risk to}} human and animal health. In this study, we investigated the effect of antimicrobial peptides on the major aflatoxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. In vitro assays with different chemically-synthesized peptides demonstrated that the broad-spectrum peptide thanatin from the <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> (Podisus maculiventris) had the greatest potential to eliminate aflatoxigenic fungi. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of thanatin against A. flavus and A. parasiticus were 3. 13 and 12. 5 µM, respectively. A thanatin cDNA was subsequently cloned in a plant expression vector {{under the control of}} the ubiquitin- 1 promoter allowing the recombinant peptide to be directed to the apoplast in transgenic maize plants. Successful integration of the thanatin expression cassette was confirmed by PCR and expression was demonstrated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in transgenic maize kernels. Infection assays with maize kernels from T 1 transgenic plants showed up to three-fold greater resistance against Aspergillus spp. infections compared to non-transgenic kernels. We demonstrated for the first time that heterologous expression of the antimicrobial peptide thanatin inhibits the growth of Aspergillus spp. in transgenic maize plants offering a solution to protect crops from aflatoxin-producing fungi and the resulting aflatoxin contamination in the field and under storage conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of potato plants expressing a barley cystatin on a {{potentially}} cystatin-susceptible natural enemy by predation on susceptible and non-susceptible preys feeding on the plant. We have focussed on the impact of the variant HvCPI- 1 C 68 → G, in which the only cysteine residue was changed by a glycine, on the growth and digestive physiology of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and the Egyptian cotton leafworm (ECW), Spodoptera littoralis. Moreover, we have studied the prey-mediated effects of the barley cystatin at the third trophic level, using the predatory <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug</b> (SSB), Podisus maculiventris, as a model. Feeding trials conducted with CPB larvae reared on transgenic potato plants expressing the C 68 → G variant resulted in significantly lower weight gains compared to those fed on non-transformed (NT) plants. On the contrary, larger weight gains were obtained when ECW larvae, that lack digestive cysteine proteases, were reared on transgenic potato expressing the cystatin, as compared to larvae fed on NT plants. No negative effects on survival and growth were observed when SSB nymphs were exposed to HvCPI- 1 C 68 → G by predation on either CPB or ECW larvae reared on transgenic potato plants expressing the barley cystatin, despite the fact that the inhibitor suppressed in vitro gut proteolysis of the predatory bug. To investigate the physiological background, biochemical analysis were carried out on guts of insects dissected at the end of the feeding assaysPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} begun in June 1935, and {{continued}} {{up to and}} including the fall of 1937. The work was carried out at the Davis county Experiment Farm at Farmington, Utah, with some survey work also having been done in the central and northern parts of the state. This work was made possible through the cooperation of the Entomological and Horticultural Departments of the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station. The green <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Acrosternum hilaris (Say), is also called the green stinkbug. Thomas Say was the first to describe this insect as belonging to the genus Pentatoma, but in some publications one may find it also listed under genera Nezara and Raphigaster.

40|$|In some {{parasitic}} Hymenoptera {{the dying}} caterpillars remain attached {{or close to}} the parasitoid cocoons. It {{has been suggested that}} the caterpillars act as ‘bodyguards’ for the vulnerable cocoons and therefore protect them against predators and/or hyperparasitoids (the ‘usurpation hypothesis’). This hypothesis has been demonstrated in associations where the caterpillars remain active and/or aggressive after parasitism. However, in other associations the caterpillars are so physiologically depleted after parasitism that they are unable to physically defend the cocoons and instead sit atop them in a moribund state. In this study a generalist predator, the <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris Say (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), was provided with cocoons of the gregarious endoparasitoid Cotesia glomerata L. and the solitary endoparasitoid Microplitis mediator Haliday (both Hymenoptera: Braconidae), in turn attended by their hosts, Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) and Mamestra brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), respectively. Cotesia glomerata produces broods of up to 40 cocoons and the dying caterpillars sit atop the cocoons where they exhibit little response to physical stimuli. Previous studies reported that dying P. brassicae caterpillars were ineffective bodyguards against two species of hyperparasitoids. In both associations, the dying host caterpillars were significantly preferred as food by P. maculiventris over the parasitoid cocoons. However, in absence of caterpillars, the bugs readily attacked the C. glomerata cocoons. Alternatively, the survival of M. mediator was very low, irrespective of whether a caterpillar was present or not. Caterpillars attacked by M. mediator are several times smaller than those attacked by C. glomerata. Consequently, the predators ran out of food much more quickly in the former and switched from one prey to the other. We show that in some host–parasitoid associations the dying caterpillars provide more visually apparent or nutritionally superior prey, rather than acting as bodyguards. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} {{and complexity of}} agro-ecosystems are important factors influencing the population dynamics of insect pests. Understanding these interactions may improve our ability to predict the spatial occurrence of pest outbreaks, thereby informing scouting and management decisions. In 2012 and 2013, two concurrent studies were conducted {{to examine the relationship}} between landscapes surrounding Iowa soybean, Glycine max [L. ] Merrill, fields and two polyphagous pest groups; Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), and stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Population densities were monitored in soybean within simple and complex agricultural landscapes to determine the response of these pests to landscape complexity. Results revealed P. japonica populations were significantly greater in soybean fields within complex landscapes and were positively associated with area of uncultivated land. The specific compositions of surrounding landscapes were also analyzed to determine the landscape features that explain the greatest variation in P. japonica and stink bug population densities. Results suggested that the area of wooded and grass habitat around fields accounted for the greatest variation in P. japonica populations; however, no discernable relationships were observed with stink bug populations. Sampling also sought to survey the community of stink bugs present in Iowa soybean. The community was predominantly comprised of stink bugs in the genus Euschistus, comprising a combined 91. 04 % of all captures. Additional species included the green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say) (4. 48 %); <b>spined</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris (Say) (2. 99 %); and red shouldered stink bug, Thyanta custator accerra (McAtee) (1. 49 %). Future work will be needed to determine if the landscape effects on P. japonica in soybean reported here are representative of other similar polyphagous pests of soybean and if they extend to other host plants as well. Furthermore, additional comprehensive surveys will be needed to better characterize the existing community of stink bug species present in Iowa field crops...|$|E

Previously, a correlation between female body sire and reproduction has been proved for field-collected specimens of the predatory stink bug Podisus maculiventris. The current investigation was carried out using P. maculiventris and Podisus nigrispinus reared for several years under laboratory conditions. For each species, three weight groups were selected from seven-day-old adults with mean body weights (+/-SD) of 62. 6 +/- 1. 6, 72. 5 +/- 1. 3, and 83. 9 +/- 3. 2 mg and 93. 6 +/- 4. 5, 104. 8 +/- 2. 7, and 115. 7 +/- 4. 6 mg for P. nigrispinus and P. maculiventris, respectively. Evaluated characteristics were: preoviposition period, total number of eggs, eggs per batch, eggs per female per day, egg load {{at the time of}} death, percentage egg hatch and female longevity. Generally, {{no significant differences were found}} among the weight groups in both species indicating that there is no clear relationship between weight and fecundity of laboratory-reared Podisus bugs.

40|$|Determining when {{multiple}} predator species {{provide better}} pest suppression than single species {{is a key}} step towards developing ecologically–informed biological control strategies. Theory and experiments predict that resource partitioning among functionally different predator species can strengthen prey suppression, because as a group they can access more prey types than functionally redundant predators. However, this prediction assumes that competition limits predation by functionally similar predators. Differences in prey density can alter the strength of competition, suggesting that prey abundance may modulate the effect of combining functionally diverse species. The experiment documented here examined the potential for functional differences among predator species to promote suppression of an insect pest, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), at different prey densities. Predation was compared at two prey densities between microcosms that contained one predator species or two functionally distinct species: the lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) that kills early L. decemlineata instars, and the <b>soldier</b> <b>bug,</b> Podisus maculiventris Say (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) that kills late instars.
