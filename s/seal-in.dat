Qualitative {{study of}} {{prosthetic}} suspension systems on transtibial amputees' satisfaction and perceived {{problems with their}} prosthetic devices. Objective To investigate the effects of 3 dissimilar suspension systems on participants' satisfaction and perceived problems with their prostheses. Design Questionnaire survey. Setting A medical and engineering research center and a university biomedical engineering department. Participants Persons with unilateral transtibial amputation (N= 243), using prostheses with polyethylene foam liner, silicone liner with shuttle lock, and <b>seal-in</b> liner. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Descriptive analyses were performed on the demographic information, satisfaction, and prosthesis-related problems of the study participants. Results The results showed {{significant differences between the}} 3 groups regarding the degree of satisfaction and perceived problems with the prosthetic device. Analyses of the individual items revealed that the study participants were more satisfied with the <b>seal-in</b> liner and experienced fewer problems with this liner. The silicone liner with shuttle lock and <b>seal-in</b> liner users reported significant differences in maintenance time compared with the polyethylene foam liner. Users of the silicone liner with shuttle lock experienced more sweating, while those who used the <b>seal-in</b> liner had greater problems with donning and doffing the device. Conclusions The results of the survey provide a good indication that prosthetic suspension is improved with the <b>seal-in</b> liner as compared with the polyethylene foam liner and silicone liner with shuttle lock.

Material and Methods. A total of thirty transtibial amputees (17 male, 13 female) volunteered {{to take part in}} this research. Two prostheses were fabricated for each participant. Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) was filled in by the participants with the three liners. Results. The statistics highlight that Dermo liner showed significantly higher score (P= 0. 05) in walking, walking on uneven surfaces, stairs walking, fitting, donning/doffing, sitting, suspension, and overall satisfaction with Dermo liner compared with <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 and Pelite liners. Overall satisfaction was 34 % higher with Dermo liner than <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 liner and 28 % higher than Pelite liner. Participants reported less problems with Dermo liner and significant differences (P< 0. 05) were recorded between the three liners in sweating, skin irritation, frustration, and pain compared with <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 and Pelite liners. Conclusion. Participants experienced high level of satisfaction and practiced fewer problems with Dermo liner. These results showed that there is good indication to believe that Dermo liner might be a good choice for transtibial users and might help the clinicians and prosthetic practitioners in selection criteria of prosthetic liners...|$|E

40|$|Transtibial {{amputation}} patients need prosthetic {{devices in}} order to regain their functional mobility and appearance. The socket and its design {{play a significant role}} in determining the wearer’s quality of the fit [...] Prosthetic users experience pressure between the socket and residual limb during daily activities. The underlying soft tissues and skin of the residual limb are not accustomed to weight bearing; thus, there is the risk of degenerative tissue ulcer in the residual limb because of constant or repetitive peak pressure applied by the socket. The prosthetic users experience different pathways such as level ground, ramps, stairs and other uneven surfaces during their daily activities. An amputee is greatly affected when dealing with the environmental barriers such as slopes and stairs because of the reported high interface pressure between socket and residual limb. The interface pressure between the residual limb and prosthetic socket has a significant effect on an amputee’s satisfaction and comfort. Suspension system and socket fitting in prosthetic devices significantly affect the amputee’s comfort, mobility, and satisfaction. Prosthetic users required a comfortable liner, good suspension, and quality socket to avoid skin problems and to prevent discomfort while using the prosthesis for daily activities. Liners provide a comfortable interface by adding a soft cushion between the residual limb and the socket. Dermo and <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 liners are two new interface systems and, due to their relative infancy, no literature were found about their interface pressure during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations and their effect on patient’s satisfaction. Therefore, the objectives of this study was to compare the interface pressure for these two liners during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations and their effect on patients satisfaction and to compare it with the most common liner in today use (Pelite liner) and its effect on patient’s satisfaction and perceived problems. In addition, investigation were carried out on the effect of suspension system on patient satisfaction and perceived problems associated with thethree liners. The selection of good prosthetic liner presents a challenging task in amputee rehabilitation. Two prostheses were fabricated for each of the 10 amputees, one with the <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 liner and one with the Dermo liner for comparison between Dermo, Pelite, and <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 liners, 60 prostheses were fabricated. Interface pressure was measured during level walking, stairs and ramp negotiations. Each subject filled in a Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) questionnaire regarding his satisfaction with the three liners. Mean Peak Pressure (MPP) was significantly (P< 0. 05) low with Dermo liner during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations compared with <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 Liner. Participants were significantly (P< 0. 05) satisfied and fewer problems were recorded with Dermo liner compared with <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 and Pelite liners. Hence, it can be concluded that the Dermo liner provides more comfortable socket-residual limb interface than the <b>Seal-In</b> X 5 liner and showed that the Dermo liner is the best choice for transtibial users.

40|$|Background: The {{method of}} {{attachment}} of prosthesis to the residual limb (suspension) and socket fitting is a critical issue {{in the process of}} providing an amputee with prosthesis. Different suspension methods try to minimize the pistoning movement inside the socket. The <b>Seal-In</b> (R) X 5 and Dermo (R) Liner by Ossur are new suspension liners that intend to reduce pistoning between the socket and liner. Since the effects of these new liners on suspension are unclear, the objective {{of this study was to}} compare the pistoning effect of <b>Seal-In</b> (R) X 5 and Dermo (R) Liner by using Vicon Motion System. Methods: Six transtibial amputees, using both the Iceross <b>Seal-In</b> (R) X 5 and the Iceross Demo (R) Liner, participated in the study. The vertical displacement (pistoning) was measured between the liner and socket in single limb support on the prosthetic limb (full-weight bearing), double limb support (semi-weight bearing), and non-weight bearing on the prosthetic limb, and also under three static vertical loading conditions (30 N. 60 N, and 90 N). Findings: The results demonstrated that the pistoning within the socket when <b>Seal-In</b> (R) X 5 was used, decreased by 71 in comparison to the Iceross Dermo (R) Liner. In addition, a significant difference between the two liners under different static conditions was found (p< 0. 05). Interpretation: Participants needed to put in extra effort for donning and doffing the prosthesis with <b>Seal-In</b> (R) X 5; however, this type of liner provided less pistoning. The new approach that uses the motion analysis system in this study might be an alternative for measuring the pistoning effect in the prosthetic socket. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of {{different}} suspension methods on the interface stress inside the prosthetic sockets of transtibial amputees when negotiating ramps and stairs. DESIGN: Three transtibial prostheses, with a pin/lock system, a <b>Seal-In</b> system, and a magnetic suspension system, were created for the participants in a prospective study. Interface stress was measured as the peak pressure by using the F-socket transducers during stairs and ramp negotiation. RESULTS: Twelve individuals with transtibial amputation managed to complete the experiments. During the stair ascent and descent, the greatest peak pressure was observed in the prosthesis with the <b>Seal-In</b> system. The magnetic prosthetic suspension system caused significantly different peak pressure at the anterior proximal region compared with the pin/lock (P = 0. 022) and <b>Seal-In</b> (P = 0. 001) during the stair ascent. It was also observed during the stair descent and ramp negotiation. CONCLUSIONS: The prostheses exhibited varying pressure profiles during the stair and ramp ascent. The prostheses with the pin/lock and magnetic suspension systems exhibited lower peak pressures compared with the <b>Seal-In</b> system. The intrasystem pressure distribution at the anterior and posterior regions {{of the residual limb}} was fairly homogenous during the stair and ramp ascent and descent.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the {{interface pressure}} with these two liners and their effect on patient satisfaction. Methods: Nine unilateral transtibial amputees participated in the study. Two prostheses were fabricated for each amputee, one with the <b>Seal-In</b> liner and one with the Dermo liner. Interface pressure was measured at the anterior, posterior, medial and lateral regions during walking on the level ground.

This study aimed to compare the interface pressure of a new magnetic suspension system with the pin/lock and <b>Seal-In</b> suspension systems. Methods: Twelve unilateral transtibial amputees participated in the study. The subjects walked on a level walkway at a self-selected speed. The resultant peak pressure with the three different suspension systems was recorded using F-socket transducers. Findings: There were significant statistical differences between the three studied suspension systems.

Overall, the average peak pressure values were higher with the <b>Seal-In</b> system than they were with the new magnetic lock and pin/lock system. Interpretation: The new magnetic system might reduce the pressure within the prosthetic socket in comparison to the pin/lock and <b>Seal-In</b> system during one gait cycle.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{attachment}} of a prosthesis to the residual limb (suspension system) is a critical issue {{in the process of}} providing prosthesis to an amputee. Proper fit of the stump inside the socket and appropriate selection of prosthetic suspension positively affect the amputees’ gait, distribution of pressure within the socket, and amputees’ satisfaction. This research aimed to: (1) conduct a survey to compare the effects of <b>seal-in</b> liner and common suction socket (CSS) on transfemoral amputees’ satisfaction; (2) compare the effects of the <b>Seal-In</b> liner (suction) and Dermo liner (Pin/lock) on transtibial amputees’ gait performance; and (3) design and evaluate (mechanical testing, pressure mapping, gait evaluation, and satisfaction survey) a new prosthetic suspension system. The survey study showed that the overall satisfaction increased {{with the use of the}} <b>Seal-In</b> liner compared with the CSS (P 0. 05). Evaluation of kinetic data and subjects’ feedback showed that the participants were more confident to use the suction socket, and the sockets were more suitable for walking. However, the participants expressed more complaints with this system because of difficulty in donning and doffing. Factors influenced by the prosthetic suspension system were derived through an extensive systematic literature review, and a new suspension system (Holo) using Velcro or Hook and Loop concept was designed and fabricated. The universal testing machine was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the designed suspension system. For validation, the Holo was compared with three other common suspension systems, namely, the pin/lock, <b>seal-in,</b> and magnetic suspension system. The maximum tensile load that the new system could iv bear (before failure) was 490 N (SD, 5. 5). However, the pin/lock system could tolerate loading of 580 N (SD, 8. 5). The magnetic (MPSS) and <b>seal-in</b> (suction) could tolerate loads of 350. 9 N (SD, 7. 0) and 310 N (SD, 8. 4), respectively. Comparison (interface pressure) between the pin/lock and the Holo system showed that high pressure was applied to the residual limb at the distal region of the stump by the pin/lock system during ambulation. The new coupling system could distribute the pressure more uniformly over the residual limb. PEQ results indicated that the participants were generally pleased with the new system, particularly with easy donning and doffing procedures. Gait evaluation (case study) demonstrated a slightly higher walking speed and stride length with the new socket with Velcro suspension system than with the pin/lock system.

40|$|Momentum, gravity, {{and other}} {{ambulation}} forces tend to displace lower limb prosthesis on residual limb. Thus, suspension systems have considerable {{effects on the}} amputee’s mobility, comfort, and satisfaction with prosthesis. Negative effects of poor suspension on rehabilitation, {{as well as the}} comfort and activity level of lower limb amputees, were previously stated. This research aimed to develop a prosthetic suspension system and to explore the biomechanics of prosthesis that incorporates the new system for transtibial amputees. A prosthetic suspension system was designed and fabricated based on magnetic field. Factors that were influenced by the prosthetic suspension were derived through an extensive literature review, and an experimental protocol was subsequently developed. The mechanical properties of the designed suspension system were tested using the universal testing machine. The magnetic suspension system (MPSS) could withstand 350. 9 N of tensile loading before the coupling failed. The system was equipped with an acoustic alarm system as an added safety feature: the safety alarm system would buzz a micro-controller unit if the suspension is going to fail. For validation, the MPSS was compared with two other common suspension systems, i. e. the pin/lock and the <b>Seal-In</b> suspension for validation. The MPSS and pin/lock caused comparable amounts of pistoning, whereas the least pistoning resulted from the <b>Seal-In</b> system. Interface pressure was evaluated by the Tekscan F-Socket transducers during level walking, as well as stair and ramp negotiation. The findings indicate that the mean peak pressure (in kilopascal) was lower with the MPSS than with the pin/lock over the anterior and posterior aspects during one gait cycle (P < 0. 05). Overall, the average peak pressure values were higher with the <b>Seal-In</b> system than the MPSS and the pin/lock system. Particularly important was that the MPSS may reduce the pain and discomfort at the distal residual limb by decreasing iv the pressure within the prosthetic socket in comparison to the pin/lock system during gait. The MPSS caused significantly different peak pressures at the anterior proximal region compared with the pin/lock (P = 0. 022) and <b>Seal-In</b> (P = 0. 001) during the stair ascent and descent, and ramp negotiation. Motion analysis showed that several kinetic and kinematic variables were affected by the suspension type. The ground reaction force data revealed that lower load was applied to the joints with the MPSS compared with the pin/lock suspension. The resulting gait deviation index was considerably different from the normal with all the systems, although the index did not significantly differ among the systems. Main significant effects of the suspension type were evident in the vertical and fore-aft ground reaction forces, knee, and ankle angles. The MPSS showed comparable effects in the remaining kinetic and kinematic gait parameters. Finally, the results of the questionnaire survey revealed significantly high satisfaction rates with the MPSS, especially for donning and doffing, walking, uneven walking, and stair negotiation (P < 0. 05). The MPSS may be used as an alternative suspension system for lower limb amputees because the biomechanical findings fell within the ranges found in the literature and were comparable to two other common suspension systems...|$|E

The results revealed that there was more symmetry in temporal-spatial parameters between the prosthetic and sound limbs using the suction system. However, the difference between two systems was not significant (p, 0. 05).
