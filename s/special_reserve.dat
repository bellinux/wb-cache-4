5|$|The <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> {{was to be}} {{organised}} by regulations issued {{under the}} Reserve Forces Act 1882, forming regiments and battalions either of existing regular corps or of newly created ones. The Crown was given the power to transfer, by Order in Council, existing battalions of the Militia to the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve,</b> which were to be deemed lawfully formed battalions of special reservists as of that date. An Order in Council was accordingly made under this section on 9 April 1908, which transferred all units of the Militia, other than those which disbanded, into the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bostock {{transferred}} from the AIF to the Royal Flying Corps <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> on 18 February 1917, and was commissioned as a probationary second lieutenant. He was posted to No.48 Squadron in August, following pilot training in Egypt and England. Bostock fought on the Western Front and was awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre. He was invalided back to Britain in March 1918, after which he transferred to the newly created Royal Air Force (RAF).|$|E
5|$|The Act {{had four}} sections. Part I {{established}} the County Associations, who would administer the system, whilst Part II covered {{the formation of}} the Territorial Force from existing units of volunteers and yeomanry. Part III created the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> and arranged for the transfer of Militia units, and Part IV contained miscellaneous other provisions as well as the related schedules.|$|E

5|$|The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{reformed}} {{the auxiliary}} {{forces of the}} British Army by transferring existing Volunteer and Yeomanry units into a new Territorial Force (TF); and disbanding the Militia {{to form a new}} <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> of the Regular Army. This reorganisation formed {{a major part of the}} Haldane Reforms, named after the creator of the Act, Richard Haldane.|$|E
5|$|The reserve battalions of the {{regiment}} were also reorganised in 1908 by the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, {{with the two}} militia battalions being re-designated the 3rd (Special) and 4th (<b>Special</b> <b>Reserve)</b> battalions, and the volunteer battalions being re-designated as Territorial Force and renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions (TF): they were based at College Road in Hanley and Horninglow Street in Burton upon Trent respectively.|$|E
5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve,</b> which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1927, the Malagasy {{government}} has declared all lemurs as [...] "protected" [...] by establishing protected {{areas that are}} now classified under three categories: National Parks (Parcs Nationaux), Strict Nature Reserves (Réserves Naturelles Intégrales), and <b>Special</b> <b>Reserves</b> (Réserves Spéciales). There are currently 18 national parks, 5 strict nature <b>reserves,</b> and 22 <b>special</b> <b>reserves,</b> {{as well as several}} other small private reserves, such as Berenty Reserve and Sainte Luce Private Reserve, both near Fort Dauphin. All protected areas, excluding the private reserves, comprise approximately 3% of the land surface of Madagascar and are managed by Madagascar National Parks, formerly known as l'Association Nationale pour la Gestion des Aires Protégées (ANGAP), as well as other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Conservation International (CI), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Most lemur species are covered by this network of protected areas, and a few species can be found in multiple parks or reserves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Special</b> nature <b>reserves</b> {{are highly}} {{protected}} areas {{from which all}} people and human activities are excluded, except for conservation and scientific research. The Prince Edward Islands, which are South African territories in the Southern Ocean, have been declared as a <b>special</b> nature <b>reserve.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to Madagascar's three established sites, a further seven sites {{are listed as}} tentative and are under consideration by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee for elevation to official status. Five initial sites were inscribed on the tentative list in 1997: the Betafo Riziculture and Hydraulic Landscape, the Royal Compound of Tsinjoarivo), the Mahafaly Country of Southwestern Madagascar, the Cliff and Caves of Isandra, and Antongona. In 2008, two additional sites {{were added to the}} list: Anjanaharibe-Sud <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> (an extension of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana) and the Dry Forests of the Andrefana.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} was {{foreseen}} {{as a potential}} problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter. It issued two reports, one focusing on university and school corps, {{and one on the}} <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve.</b> The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an ad-hoc basis as part of the broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.|$|E
5|$|The Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921 {{changed the}} Territorial Force into the Territorial Army, and the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> {{returned}} to its old title of Militia. The Air Force (Constitution) Act 1917 had created a reserve and an auxiliary force for the newly constituted Royal Air Force, and the Auxiliary Air Force and Air Force Reserve Act 1924 modified the 1907 Act so as to allow County Associations to administer the Territorial Army and the Auxiliary Air Force. The Auxiliary and Reserve Forces Act 1949 gave the County Associations responsibility for the Army Cadet Force.|$|E

5|$|These {{changes were}} {{embodied}} in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments. It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry, and used them {{to create a new}} Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions, fourteen cavalry brigades, and a large number of support units, all raised, organised and financed by local organisations but liable for service under War Office command. The Militia provided the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve,</b> which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be liable for service with the regular forces in wartime.|$|E
5|$|Vergniaud {{was based}} in Beirut from May to August 1919 to monitor Turkish {{activities}} off the coasts of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. She arrived in Toulon on 6 September and was placed in <b>special</b> <b>reserve</b> on 1 October. This ship was later found to be in poor shape, decommissioned in June 1921 and condemned on 27 October. She was disarmed in 1922 and her 240mm guns handed over for coastal defence, nine being installed around Dakar, some still existing there.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did extend to the Isle of Man, the force was not reorganised there {{partly due to the}} difficulty of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} four days, the Allied troops were pushed {{south-east}} towards the city of Singapore. Throughout this time, the battalion's companies were in almost constant action, either—in the case of 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E' Companies—under separate command, or 'A' and 'HQ' Companies with Battalion Headquarters. The reinforcements of 'E' Company, detached to the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> Battalion, suffered heavily. In three days, they lost 43 men killed or missing, before the ad hoc formation was disbanded and the men returned to the 2/4th. 7 Platoon, 'B' Company, took on a mounted role, procuring four Bren carriers, with which they began patrolling in support. On 12 February they were engaged along the Buona Vista Road, while supporting the Malayan Regiment. The following day, they were attacked by a Japanese light tank, which knocked {{out one of the}} carriers before the platoon extricated themselves.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1956, Sydney met Melbourne off Kangaroo Island {{during the}} latter's {{delivery}} voyage. The two carriers sailed {{together for the}} remainder of Melbournes delivery voyage, visiting Melbourne and Jervis Bay before arriving in Sydney on 10 May. Three days later, the flagship role was transferred from Sydney to Melbourne. After this, Sydney continued on a program of training cruises throughout Australian and New Zealand waters, and visited the Far East Strategic Reserve to participate in a South East Asia Treaty Organisation multi-fleet exercise during September and October 1956. Following an appraisal process by the RAN, during which Sydneys potential usefulness as a commando carrier, aircraft transport, or troopship was considered, the ship was paid off into <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> on 30 May 1958 as surplus to requirements. Sydney could be reactivated for use as a transport, but required at least four months notice.|$|E
5|$|One of {{only two}} machine gun battalions {{available}} for the defending British and Commonwealth forces, as preparations were made to repulse the expected Japanese assault across the Johore Strait, the battalion was split up to provide support to troops from the 22nd and 27th Australian Infantry Brigades and the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade around {{the western part of}} the island, where the Japanese assault was expected. On 7 February, due to concerns about the lack of defending infantry, about 90 machine gun reinforcements, who had been hastily formed into a sixth company—'E'—were detached at this time to form part of a 400-strong <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> Battalion, initially under the command of an officer from the 2/19th Infantry Battalion and later taken over by Major Albert Saggers, formerly of the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion.|$|E
