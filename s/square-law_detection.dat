40|$|Abstract- Non-coherent pulse {{compression}} (NCPC) was suggested recently [1]. It was described using on-off keying (OOK) signals based on Manchester-coded binary {{pulse compression}} sequences (e. g., Barker, Ipatov). The present paper expands the discussion on waveform choice for both periodic and a-periodic cases, and on detection performances of this method. OOK transmitter and a receiver based on envelope-detection, suggested for the NCPC system, are simpler to implement than a binary phase-coded transmitter and a coherent receiver with I&Q synchronous detector, required for coherent pulse compression. NCPC {{can be used}} in simple radar systems where Doppler information is not required, in direct-detection laser radar systems and in ultra wide band (UWB) radar. Non-coherent processing has drawbacks in cases of reflections from multi-scatterer targets. The drawbacks and means of mitigating them are considered in section II. I. SCHEMATICS AND WAVEFORMS We shall examine the receiving scheme shown in Fig. 1. This schematic performs correlation processing by utilizing a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, shown in the figure as a vector of constants (bi, i = 1 …. n) which multiply the history of the received signal, after envelope <b>detection</b> (<b>square-law,</b> p= 2, or linear-law, p= 1). In order to achieve high range resolution with low sidelobes, as well as good detection performances, there should be some complementary relationship between the transmitted signal and the coefficients of the FIR stored in the receiver. Noting the transmitted vector as a and the FIR filter (of the same length) as b, without loss of generality we can first impose a normalization requirement...|$|R
40|$|New {{results on}} the post-filter in timing {{recovery}} based on <b>square-law</b> <b>detection</b> are presented. A phase noise model for the phase of the timing wave to be recovered is considered. The consequence of phase noise is that the sequence of recovered timing instants is non-ideal, therefore some intersymbol interference arises. This leaves space for optimization of the transfer function of the post-filter. The case of random phase walk and raised-cosine Nyquist filter is analyzed in detail. For this case, we propose a post-filter that is easily implemented and that achieves a mean-square error performance of the optimal filter within 0. 14 dB. Additionally, an elegant closed-form formula that gives the mean-square error due to the intersymbol interference that affects the sampled signal is presented...|$|E
40|$|We propose and {{experimentally}} {{demonstrate a}} chromatic dispersion (CD) -insensitive first-order polarization mode dispersion (PMD) monitoring method based on radio-frequency (RF) power measurement. In high-speed (> 10 -GSym/s) transmission systems, a narrowband fiber Bragg grating (FBG) notch filter filters out the optical components at 10 GHz {{away from the}} carrier. After <b>square-law</b> <b>detection,</b> the 10 -GHz RF tone changes with PMD and is insensitive to CD, {{which can be used}} as a PMD monitoring signal. Compared with the monitoring techniques utilizing clock tone, the PMD measurement range is increased from 26. 3 -ps to 50 -ps while the requirement of the bandwidth of photodetector is reduced from 19 GHz to 10 GHz in 19 -Gsym/s systems. It is experimentally shown that this technique is efficient on CD-insensitive first-order PMD monitoring for 38 -Gbit/s DQPSK and 57 -Gbit/s D 8 PSK systems.

40|$|Transmission in {{optical fiber}} offers long {{distance}} and high-speed, possibly tens of Terabits per second, optical communications. The {{utilization of the}} theoretically available bandwidth and/or the capacity is hindered {{by a number of}} impairments. Traditionally, these impairments are mitigated in the optical domain. The main subject of the dissertation is the investigation of performance and applicability of advanced equalization and coding methods in high-speed optical communications, which relies on processing in the electronic domain. In particular, the investigated approaches rely either on processing of the received signal in order to recover information distorted in transmission, or on encoding and/or shaping of the transmitted signal in a specific way that mitigates the signal degradations imposed by the channel. The specifics of the fiber-optic channel require that the well established approaches in other areas of communication theory, upon which the presented work leverages, be adjusted to the conditions of this communication channel (e. g. nonlinear effects in transmission, <b>square-law</b> <b>detection</b> and signal statistics).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn error probability analysis is performed for a fast frequency- hopped, frequency-shift keyed noncoherent receiver with ratio-statistic combining for a Rician channel with partial-band interference. Results are obtained for binary and M-ary FSK receivers where M is 4, 8, or 16. Both envelope and square-law detectors were analyzed. The probability of bit error is examined for {{different levels of}} diversity, thermal noise, severity of fading, fractions of bandwidth jammed, and varying jamming power. Comparisons for the different parameters are done to determine when diversity should be used. For the special case {{when there is no}} diversity, an analytic expression for receiver performance is obtained, and the performance of a receiver using envelope detection is found to be identical to that of a receiver using <b>square-law</b> <b>detection</b> for this special case. The results show that, for diversities of three and four, the envelope detector performs better than the square-law detector. It is shown that, for low signal-to-jammer ratios, diversity is generally a disadvantage, and for high signal-to-jammer ratios, diversity is generally an advantage. The transition is dependent on thermal noise and the value of M. Ratio-Statistic Combining, Fast Frequency-Hopping, Rician Fading, FSK modulation, Partial-Band Interference.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is shown}} that the {{analytic}} properties of the temporal complex degree of coherence Y(T) in the complex time plane (T complex) impose a relationship between IY(T) ~ and arg y (~) on the real time axis. This relationship involves, in general, {{the location of the}} zeros of the degree of coherence in {{the lower half of the}} complex T plane. It is suggested that the analytic continuation of the temporal degree of coherence of many spectral distributions has no zeros at all in this half plane. The spectral profiles of such distributions could be uniquely determined from measurements of I y (T) I alone. This possibility is of interest in connection with Michelson's well-known method of visibility curves. It is also of interest in connection with the recently proposed correlation and coincidence techniques (employing <b>square-law</b> <b>detection)</b> for determining narrow spectral profiles, such as those found in the output from an optical maser. WELL-KNOWN method due to Michelson (1891, 1892, see also Born and Wolf A 1959, $ 7. 5. 8) provides information about the distribution of energy in the spechum of a light beam from measurements of the visibility of interference fringes. The fringe pattern is obtained by dividing the beam into two parts and by allowing the!KO partial beams to interfere, after a time delay T has been introduced between them.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{extraction}} of weak radio frequency signals buried in noise by the technique of multichannel spectral analysis based on radio frequency lock-in detection. The technique and the developed instrument find extensive use {{in the fields of}} radio astronomy, remote sensing, and spectroscopy.;Radio frequency spectral resolution over a reception range of 0 - 512 MHz was achieved with a multichannel spectrum analyzer consisting of a radio-frequency pre-processor and a set of 64 parallel lock-in receivers. The reception range is divided uniformly into 64 evenly spaced channels of 8 MHz bandwidth. System control was facilitated through a user programmable microcomputer which performs data acquisition, data preprocessing, graphic display, and tape storage.;The technique for resolving weak radio frequency signals has been improved by the application of the concepts of parallel processing, modularity, and symmetry.;The concepts of parallel processing as applied to RF processing of weak signals were successfully employed in the multichannel spectrum analyzer. The resulting system is characterized by reduced hardware complexity, low-noise electronic circuitry, and improved reliability. The concepts of modularity and symmetry proved advantageous in reducing design and hardware development time.;The channel receiver is a novel design based on the principles of superheterodyne reception incorporating improved detection stages. A dual <b>square-law</b> <b>detection</b> scheme for thermal compensation significantly reduced the problem of thermal drift. The gated synchronous detector scheme eliminated contaminating noise that was asynchronous with the chopping signal and also chopper transition noise.;The minimum detectable power across all channels was measured to be - 138 dBm (+OR-) 1 dB.

30|$|The idea {{to use the}} FxLMS {{algorithm}} {{started from}} the observation that analogy can be seen between the control structure in Fig.  3 and the LMS algorithm. Actually, the conventional algorithms {{can be seen as}} a special case of the FxLMS algorithm. The following modifications are needed from the MFxLMS structure in Fig.  2 to the CAPC structure in Fig.  3 : (1) First, the CAPC structure uses <b>square-law</b> <b>detection</b> instead of envelope detection used in the MFxLMS structure. These have shown to provide comparable performance but the former is usually easier to analyze [46] while the latter allows a larger dynamic range [47]. (2) The CAPC method uses averaging to remove noise. The LMS algorithms are in principle based on exponential averaging [1]. An additional averaging block could be used as well, but it does not provide additional performance gain for the algorithm [48]. It is better to use instantaneous gradient estimates as is used in our power control structure. (3) Companding, i.e., going first to decibel domain (compressing) and then back to linear domain (expanding), is used in the CAPC algorithm. Compressing is used to cover the large dynamic range in a fading channel. In the practical MFxLMS structure, companding focuses on the task of nonlinear quantization, i.e., to reduce the number of bits in the power control command. (4) One-bit quantization is used in the CAPC- 1 method to simplify feedback signaling. The MFxLMS method is using quantization as in Eqs. (25)–(26). Power control command needs to be more than 1  bit for variable step power control. That is true also for the variable step algorithms that are based on the structure shown in Fig.  3. (5) The CAPC- 1 method uses a fixed scaling factor ΔP whereas in the MFxLMS method, the step size scales based on the channel state. The similarities between the CAPC methods and the LMS method are so clear that the MFxLMS method {{can be seen as a}} generalization of inverse power control approaches.|$|E
40|$|The {{optical fiber}} {{is a very}} {{attractive}} communication mediumsince it offers a large bandwidth and low attenuation and cantherefore facilitate demanding services such as high-qualityvideo transmission. As the reach of optical fiber is beingextended to the access network it is economically attractive toshare fibers between different users without adding activecomponents in the network. The most common multiple accessmethod for such passive optical networks is time divisionmultiple access (TDMA), but lately {{there has been an}} increasedinterest in using wavelength division multiple access (WDMA) and optical code division multiple access (OCDMA). This thesisevaluates forward error correction as a method to improve theperformance of passive optical networks, in particular OCDMAnetworks. Most studies of OCDMA use simple channel models focusingonly on the multiple access interference. However, beat noiseis the main performance limitation for many implementations ofOCDMA. Beat noise occurs when multiple optical fields areincident on a receiver, because of the <b>square-law</b> <b>detection.</b> Tomake a realistic evaluation of OCDMA, channel models which takeinterference, beat noise and other noise types into account arestudied in this thesis. Both direct sequencing CDMA and fastfrequency hopping are considered as spreading methods. Anefficient simulation method was developed in order to simulatesystems with forward error correction (FEC) and soft decoding. The simulations show that the performance is significantlyoverestimated when the beat noise is neglected. In order todecrease the error rate without using overly complex equipmentthe bandwidth has to be increased. Simulation results show thatit is beneficial to use error correction codes in addition tospreading codes for the bandwidth expansion. The efficiency canbe further improved by using soft decoding; therefore maximumlikelihood decoding methods for the OCDMA channels aredeveloped and demonstrate a significant reduction in the errorrate. Frequency hopping and direct sequencing are also comparedwith each other, and the results show that temporally codedOCDMA is more sensitive to beat noise. In addition, the performance of a low complexity softdecoding method for Reed-Solomon codes is evaluated. Softdecoding of Reed Solomon codes has not yet found practical usebecause the earlier proposed methods do not offer sufficientperformance gains to motivate the increased complexity. Thebit-level Chase-decoding algorithm evaluated here can be easilyimplemented using any algebraic decoder. NR 2014080...|$|E
