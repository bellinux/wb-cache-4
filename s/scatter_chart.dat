40|$|Introduction: Vitamin D has a basic role in bone {{growth and}} {{metabolism}} {{and has been}} noticed for its important role in many diseases, such as diabetes, depression, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Regarding some studies, detection of vitamin D deficiency in different places has important implication for health. This study determined prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Arak, a centrally located city in Iran. Materials and Methods: Based upon a cross-sectional study in 2010, 420 students 10 [...] 16 years old including 220 girls and 200 boys, studied at Arak secondary schools, were selected by a multistage sampling. The level of 25 (OH) D and PTH (parathormone) was measured and also the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in different intensities was evaluated and compared between girls and boys by the Student t-test. Vitamin D deficiency for the students was categorized into three intensities based on three levels of 25 (OH) D: mild deficiency - 15 ≤ 25 (OH) D < 20 ng/ml, moderate deficiency [...] 8 ≤ 25 (OH) < 15 ng/ml, severe deficiency - 25 (OH) < 8 ng/ml. The relationship between the 25 (OH) D and PTH was assessed by <b>Scatter</b> <b>chart</b> to define cut-off points for vitamin D deficiency. Results: Based on 25 (OH) D < 20 ng/ml, 84 % {{of the students had}} vitamin D deficiency including 60. 7 % mild, 22. 4 % moderate, and 0. 7 % severe. Three local cut-off points including 13, 21, and 33 ng/ml were defined in the <b>Scatter</b> <b>chart.</b> The results showed that the deficiency of vitamin D in girls is much more than that in boys (P = 0. 05). Conclusion: The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency could be probably a result of different etiologies.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{characterize}} and quantify the genetic variability of 30 elite barley malt accessions irrigated in the savannas, using traits related to the industrial quality to verify if they could be used in improvement programmes in the selection of better malt quality genotypes. The following analytical determinations were carried out: total protein content (%), extract yield M. F. i. a. (%), Hartong index VZ (45 °C), viscosity 8. 6 °P (mPa s), boiled wort colour (EBC), soluble nitrogen content (mg/ 100 g), Kolbach index (%), friability (%) and &# 946;-glucan. The descriptive analysis of data was performed and the coefficients of genetic dissimilarity were estimated for each pair. The relative contribution of each trait of genetic diversity was measured and also the correlations among them. According to the genetic dissimilarity matrix, a cluster analysis and <b>scatter</b> <b>chart</b> were constructed. Through cluster analysis, two major similarity groups were observed. The soluble nitrogen was the variable that contributed the most for the genetic variability (86. 6 %), followed by &# 946;-glucan (12. 5 %). The results indicate that the barley grown in the savanna is ready to be included in the national malt process and that there is a genetic variability among the barley genotypes evaluated for the malting quality traits. It can be concluded that the barley can be used in the Brazilian irrigated barley improvement programme. The qualitative traits that contribute the most to the genetic diversity are soluble nitrogen and &# 946;-glucan and the less variable ones are protein content and malt viscosity. 201...|$|E

These questions intimate the role of interactive visualization in the real (online) world. In this paper, we present our approach (and findings) to answering these questions. First, we introduce Beagle, which mines the web for SVG-based visualizations and automatically classifies them by type (i. e., bar, pie, etc.). With Beagle, we extract over 41, 000 visualizations across five different tools and repositories, and classify them with 86 % accuracy, across 24 visualization types.

Though controversial, pie charts are relatively rare in practice.

40|$|The {{study was}} planned and {{conducted}} {{to assess the}} benefit of C- 2 levels (blood cyclosporine levels two hours postdosing) monitoring over trough (C 0) levels (predosing) in postrenal transplant patients. The patient population included 34 postrenal transplant individuals (28 males and six females, mean age of 39. 9 ± 12. 3 years). The patients were first-transplant patients and were receiving a microemulsion form of cyclosporine A (CsA) as an immunosuppressant along with azathioprine and prednisolone. In addition, they were not on any enzyme inducer/inhibitor drugs, except for diltiazem. Timed collection of C 0 and C- 2 samples was done and the samples were immediately processed using the cedia cyclosporine plus assay kit. Estimation was done on a Beckman synchron CX 5 CE fully automated chemistry analyzer. Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were checked. Poor graft survival was found in this population with 29. 3 % patients showing graft rejection. The graft rejection patients were assigned to two groups: group I with chronic graft rejection patients (17. 6 %) and group II with acute graft rejection patients (11. 7 %). Group III consisted of graft survival patients (70. 7 %). Mean ± SD was calculated for C 0 and C 2 levels. Individual values for C 0 and C- 2 were plotted on a <b>scatter</b> <b>chart.</b> C 0 and C- 2 levels were normalized by calculating them {{as the percentage of}} their targets (data not shown) and compared using the Kruskal Wallis one-way analysis of variance. C 0 levels in all the three groups were within the recommended therapeutic range (150 – 300 ng/mL) (P < 0. 182). Blood C- 2 concentrations did not achieve the recommended target levels in these patients. One-way analysis of variance for C- 2 values when expressed as the percentage of the target values did not show any significant difference between these groups (P < 0. 84). No significant difference was found in C 0 levels between groups I, II, and group III patients when expressed as the percentage of the target values (P < 0. 182). The mean serum urea nitrogen level was 26. 4 ± 8. 1 mg/dL whereas the mean serum creatinine level was 1. 79 ± 0. 8 mg/dL. As is evident in the present study, the target C 2 levels of cyclosporine dosage were not achieved whereas the C 0 levels in all the three groups were within the optimum therapeutic range. As the incidence of graft dysfunction was also proportionately high, the importance of C 2 monitoring is further highlighted {{on the basis of this}} study The contributory factors for levels lower than the target levels, such as the use of low doses of cyclosporine and interacting drugs should be carefully monitored in clinical practice. The achievement of optimum levels of C- 2 may help in reducing the higher incidence of graft rejection in these patients. This practice is of equal importance in reducing cyclosporine-related renal toxicity, a rather irreversible process...|$|E

Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied.

Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through <b>scattering</b> <b>charts</b> and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel oil inlet passage diameter, fuel oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the fuel oil inlet passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small fuel oil inlet passage diameter contribute to a short opening delay, however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay. Moreover, a small closing delay prefers a large fuel oil inlet passage diameter.
