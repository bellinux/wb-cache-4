25|$|An {{important}} {{version of}} this experiment involves single particles (or waves—for consistency, they are called particles here). Sending particles through a double-slit apparatus {{one at a time}} results in single particles appearing on the screen, as expected. Remarkably, however, an interference pattern emerges when these particles are allowed to build up one by one (see the adjacent image). This demonstrates the wave–particle duality, which states that all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties: the particle is measured as a <b>single</b> <b>pulse</b> at a single position, while the wave describes the probability of absorbing the particle at a specific place on the screen. This phenomenon has been shown to occur with photons, electrons, atoms and even some molecules, including buckyballs. So experiments with electrons add confirmatory evidence to the view that electrons, protons, neutrons, and even larger entities that are ordinarily called particles nevertheless have their own wave nature and even a wavelength (related to their momentum).|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{circular polarization}} in pulsar radio emission through simultaneous observations of PSR B 1133 + 16 at two frequencies. In particular, we investigate {{the association of}} the handedness of circular polarization with the orthogonal polarization mode phenomenon at two different frequencies. We find the association to be significant across the pulse for PSR B 1133 + 16, making {{a strong case for}} orthogonal polarization modes determining the observed circular polarization. The association however is not perfect and decreases with frequency.

25|$|Saturation of {{the sample}} with energy applied at the {{resonant}} radiofrequency. This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; {{in the first case}} (CW) this happens by using too much continuous power that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90° pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and four to five times the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5T1) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For <b>single</b> <b>pulse</b> experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90° can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter recycle delays. The optimum there is called an Ernst angle, after the Nobel laureate. Especially in solid state NMR, or in samples with very few nuclei with spins greater than zero, (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times can be on the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more on the range of one second.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the ambient gas pressure on ablated material and the plasma state of laser-inducedplasmas using single and collinear double pulses is studied. A Q-switchedNd:YAG laser pulse is focused on iron samples in air at pressures ranging from 0. 1 to 1013 mbar. At 1013 mbar double pulses ablate up to a factor of 4. 6 more material than <b>single</b> <b>pulses</b> of the same energy. Whereas between 1013 mbar and 100 mbar a strong variation of the ablation ratio is found, the pressure dependence vanishes below 100 mbar.

While the electron density for <b>single</b> and double <b>pulses</b> at 1013 mbar {{is close to the}} same value of about 10 (17) cm(- 3), the electron temperature is more than 1500 K higher for double pulses.

60|$|We have {{observed}} that a species of greatness arises from the artificial infinite; and that this infinite consists in an uniform succession of great parts: we observed too, that the same uniform succession had a like power in sounds. But because the effects of many things are clearer {{in one of the}} senses than in another, and that all the senses bear analogy to and illustrate one another, I shall begin with this power in sounds, as the cause of the sublimity from succession is rather more obvious in the sense of hearing. And I shall here, once for all, observe, that an investigation of the natural and mechanical causes of our passions, besides the curiosity of the subject, gives, if they are discovered, a double strength and lustre to any rules we deliver on such matters. When the ear receives any simple sound, it is struck by a <b>single</b> <b>pulse</b> of the air which makes the ear-drum and the other membranous parts vibrate according to the nature and species of the stroke. If the stroke be strong, the organ of hearing suffers a considerable degree of tension. If the stroke be repeated pretty soon after, the repetition causes an expectation of another stroke. And it must be observed, that expectation itself causes a tension. This is apparent in many animals, who, when they prepare for hearing any sound, rouse themselves, and prick up their ears; so that here the effect of the sounds is considerably augmented by a new auxiliary, the expectation. But though after a number of strokes, we expect still more, not being able to ascertain the exact time of their arrival, when they arrive, they produce a sort of surprise, which increases this tension yet further. For I {{have observed}}, that when at any time I have waited very earnestly for some sound, that returned at intervals, (as the successive firing of cannon,) though I fully expected the return of the sound, when it came it always made me start a little; the ear-drum suffered a convulsion, and the whole body consented with it. The tension of the part thus increasing at every blow, by the united forces of the stroke itself, the expectation and the surprise, it is worked up to such a pitch as to be capable of the sublime; it is brought just to the verge of pain. Even when the cause has ceased, the organs of hearing being often successively struck in a similar manner, continue to vibrate in that manner for some time longer; this is an additional help to the greatness of the effect.|$|E

6000|$|There connects {{itself with}} a passage in another letter to the same {{correspondent}} a memory of my own that I have always superlatively cherished and that remains in consequence vivid enough for some light reflection here. But I first give the passage, which is of date of November '67. [...] "What a charming impression of Dickens the other night at the Nortons' dinner! How innocent and honest and sweet he is maugre his fame! Fields was merely superb on the occasion, but Dickens was saintly." [...] As a young person of twenty-four I took part, restrictedly yet exaltedly, in that occasion--and an immense privilege I held it to slip in at all--from after dinner on; at which stage of the evening I presented myself, {{in the company of}} my excellent friend Arthur Sedgwick, brother to our hostess and who still lives to testify, for the honour of introduction to the tremendous guest. How tremendously it had been laid upon young persons of our generation to feel Dickens, down to the soles of our shoes, no more modern instance that I might try to muster would give, I think, the least measure of; I can imagine no actual young person of my then age, and however like myself, so ineffably agitated, so mystically moved, in the presence of any exhibited idol of the mind who should be in that character at all conceivably [...] "like" [...] the author of Pickwick and of Copperfield. There has been since his extinction no corresponding case--as to the relation between benefactor and beneficiary, or debtor and creditor; no other debt in our time has been piled so high, for those carrying it, as the long, the purely [...] "Victorian" [...] pressure of that obligation. It was the pressure, the feeling, that made it--as it made the feeling, and no operation of feeling on any such ground has within my observation so much as attempted to emulate it. So that on the evening I speak of at Shady Hill it was as a slim and shaken vessel of the feeling that one stood there--of the feeling in the first place diffused, public and universal, and in the second place all unfathomably, undemonstrably, unassistedly and, as it were, unrewardedly, proper to one's self as an already groping and fumbling, already dreaming and yearning dabbler in the mystery, the creative, that of comedy, tragedy, evocation, representation, erect and concrete before us there as in a sublimity of mastership. I saw the master--nothing could be more evident--in the light of an intense emotion, and I trembled, I remember, in every limb, while at the same time, by a blest fortune, emotion produced no luminous blur, but left him shining indeed, only shining with august particulars. It was to be remarked that those of his dress, which managed to be splendid even while remaining the general spare uniform of the diner-out, had the effect of higher refinements, of accents stronger and better placed, than we had ever in such a connection seen so much as hinted. But the offered inscrutable mask was the great thing, the extremely handsome face, the face of symmetry yet of formidable character, as I at once recognised, and which met my dumb homage with a straight inscrutability, a merciless military eye, I might have pronounced it, an automatic hardness, in fine, which at once indicated to me, and in the most interesting way in the world, a kind of economy of apprehension. Wonderful was it thus to see, and thrilling inwardly to note, that since the question was of personal values so great no faintest fraction of the whole could succeed in not counting for interest. The confrontation was but of a moment; our introduction, my companion's and mine, once effected, by an arrest in a doorway, nothing followed, as it were, or happened (what might have happened it remained in fact impossible to conceive); but intense though the positive perception there was an immensity more left to understand--for the long aftersense, I mean; and one, or the chief, of these later things was that if our hero neither shook hands nor spoke, only meeting us by the barest act, so to say, of the trained eye, the penetration of which, to my sense, revealed again a world, there was a grim beauty, to one's subsequently panting imagination, in that very truth of his then so knowing himself (committed to his monstrous [...] "readings" [...] and with the force required for them ominously ebbing) on the outer edge of his once magnificent margin. So at any rate I was to like for long to consider of it; I was to like to let the essential radiance which had nevertheless reached me measure itself by this accompaniment of the pitying vision. He couldn't loosely spend for grace what he had to keep for life--which was the awful nightly, or all but nightly, exhibition: such the economy, as I have called it, in which I was afterwards to feel sure he had been locked up--in spite of the appearance, in the passage from my father's letter, of the opened gates of the hour or two before. These were but a reason the more, really, for the so exquisitely complicated image which was to remain with me to this day and which couldn't on any other terms have made itself nearly so important. For that was the whole sense of the matter. It hadn't been in the least important that we should have shaken hands or exchanged platitudes--it had only been supremely so that one should have had the essence of the hour, the knowledge enriched by proof that whatever the multifold or absolute reason, no accession to sensibility from any other at all [...] "similar" [...] source could have compared, for penetration, to the intimacy of this particular and prodigious glimpse. It was as if I had carried off my strange treasure just exactly from under the merciless military eye--placed there on guard of the secret.

By using the mode-locked rate as an external clock to the digital delay generator one may adjust a delay and width to select a <b>single</b> <b>pulse</b> and synchronize other events to that <b>single</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} in polarization-gating technique, {{ionization}} dynamics and three-dimensional propagation effects act as additional filters in <b>single</b> attosecond <b>pulse</b> generation. We propose a novel laser field configuration generating single harmonic bursts from multi-cycle laser pulses, allowing the use of laser pulses up to 25 fs to yield a <b>single</b> XUV <b>pulse...</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{makes it}} {{possible}} to artificially create an electric-field grating with arbitrary period, which satisfies the condition necessary for quasi-phase-matching. Periodic poling is used for efficient frequency-doubling in optical fibers. Selecting <b>single</b> <b>pulses</b> from infrared fiber lasers and frequency-doubling them with poled fibers for time-resolved spectroscopy is a main goal of EU project CHARMING.|$|R
