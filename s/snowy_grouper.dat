50|$|Kritsky, Bakenhaster & Adams (2015) {{wrote that}} Pseudorhabdosynochus firmicoleatus most closely resembles Pseudorhabdosynochus sulamericanus (a species {{described}} by Santos, Buchmann and Gibson in 2000) {{in the general}} morphology of the vaginal sclerite. The structure in both species possesses a delicate distal funnel at its attachment to the vaginal vestibule, a proximal bulge of the distal tube, and a small chamber. In P. firmicoleatus, however, the vaginal sclerite is delicate and lacks the irregular sclerites along the distal tube typical of P. sulamericanus. It further differs from P. sulamericanus in that the deep root of the ventral anchor has its proximal end directed dorsally. Finally, tegumental scales are lacking and the squamodiscs of P. firmicoleatus have 11-13 rows of rodlets, vs tegumental scales present and 14-17 rows in the squamodics of P. sulamericanus). No significant differences were observed between specimens of P. firmicoleatus collected from yellowedge and <b>snowy</b> <b>groupers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The southeastern United States {{continental}} shelf supports a diverse community of recreationally and commercially important reef fish. However, {{little is known}} about the reef fish community associated with the shelf edge between the depths of 50 and 120 m. Offshore of Broward County, Florida, the {{continental shelf}} is narrow and appears to provide limited natural fish habitat. Numerous artificial vessel-reefs have been deployed throughout this region to enhance local recreational fisheries. The reef fish assemblage has not been adequately described at these vessel-reefs and interactions between fish assemblages on vessel-reefs and those on neighboring natural habitat are unclear. Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys, were conducted at three separate vessel-reefs along with several regions of neighboring natural substrate to determine the reef fish assemblage, species richness, and abundances. During two years of study, 785 minutes of video were recorded from vessel-reefs along with 488 minutes from natural substrate. ROV surveys along the continental shelf between 50 and 120 m depths revealed no regions of exposed hardbottom with vertical relief greater than one meter. Twenty-seven different species were observed on natural substrate transects with an average of 32. 0 (+/- 39. 2 SD) fish per survey hour. Manmade artifacts, such as tires, were commonly observed during surveys and harbored a large percentage of the fish recorded along the continental shelf. Bank sea bass, Centropristis ocyurus, and tattler bass, Serranus phoebe, were common among tires along with occasional juvenile <b>snowy</b> <b>groupers,</b> Epinephelus niveatus. At a depth of 110 m, grey tilefish, Caulolatilus microps, and tilefish burrows were observed. A majority (66...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of many {{life history}} {{parameters}} {{are essential to}} properly assess and manage fish species. Although the <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus niveatus, is a commercially valuable fish, which is harvested throughout the Gulf of Mexico, {{little is known about}} its age, growth, and reproduction from this region. In this study, <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> from the northern and eastern regions of the Gulf of Mexico were examined primarily using commercially-derived samples that were collected between 1984 and 2004. A total of 1, 200 <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> with fork lengths between 242 and 1, 190 mm were collected. Sectioned saggital otoliths were used to determine the age of 774 specimens which varied from 1 to 44 years, considerably older than previously recorded. Ninety gonad samples were histologically examined; the sample population consisted of 82 females in various stages of development, 3 males, and 5 transitional fish. Female fish had ages that ranged between 3 to 14 years, with fork lengths from 330 to 880 mm and male fish had ages that were between 17 to 25 years in age, with fork lengths from 955 to 1, 080 mm. Transitional fish had ages from 6 to 13 years, with fork lengths from 474 to 930 mm. The {{results of this study suggest}} that sexual maturity in females was reached around five or six years, and transition in some fish occurred as early as five years but was observed in older fish. The few males that were collected were older and larger than those fish identified as females. <b>Snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> grow slowly but consistently throughout the first 15 years or up to approximately 1, 000 mm in length, at which point growth slows. The von Bertalanffy growth model fitted to all the observed data was L(t) = 1, 057 * (1 -e- 0. 0939 (t+ 2. 5375)). <b>Snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> recruit into the fishery at around age two, approximately 300 mm fork length. The truncated nature of the age distribution and low number of males collected suggest that <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> in the Gulf of Mexico are likely experiencing overfishing, and more research on the species is necessary to facilitate proper management and conservation...|$|E
40|$|The inshore {{environment}} of Broward County, Florida {{consists of three}} reef tracts, each separated by sand substrate, running parallel to the coastline in sequentially deeper water. A wide variety of artificial reef designs have been deployed in Broward County, many lying in sand flats between the reeftracts. From 1995 through 2002, over 1, 100 visual fish censuses (predominantly point-counts) were completed on the three natural reeftracts in water depths from 3 m to 30 m and over 1, 100 censuses were done on artificial reefs at depths of 7 m to 23 m. Curiously, the juvenile stages of two deeper-water species of the snapper/grouper complex, the blackfin snapper (Lutjanus buccanella) and the <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus niveatus), appear to prefer artificial reefs located in the sand flat separating {{the second and third}} reeftracts to nearby natural reef areas. Five hundred and forty blackfin snapper have been recorded in 64 visual censuses and nine <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> have been observed in seven counts on artificial reefs. Despite the large volume of visual census data collected thus far, these two species have never been recorded on nearby natural reef tracts. The reasons for this unanticipated observation is unclear but it provides an excellent launch-point for an examination of juvenile habitat requirements, natural availability of these requirements, and the potential for artificial substrate to be used in managing these species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Stock {{assessments}} indicate many reef {{fish species}} have declined {{in size and}} abundance in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern coast of the United States. However, commercial fishers often state that stock assessments do not match their observations. We compared fishery-independent catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species composition data between the 1970 s and 2005 – 2006 for reef fishes {{in the vicinity of}} Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Additionally, total mortality (Z) was estimated by means of a length-based catch-curve analysis. Effort (drops) by rod and reel focused on three sites, two inshore (30 m deep) and one offshore (125 m). The CPUE was compared between periods within each site and larger area (inshore, offshore). The CPUEs of red porgy Pagrus pagrus, vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens, black sea bass Centropristis striata, and gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus were greater in the 1970 s than in 2005 – 2006 at specific capture sites. Conversely, the CPUEs of red grouper Epinephelus morio, white grunt Haemulon plumieri, and bank sea bass C. ocyura were greater in 2005 – 2006 than in the 1970 s. The CPUEs of <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> E. niveatus, blueline tilefish Caulolatilus microps, and gag Mycteroperca microlepis remained steady or increased between periods. Estimates of Z for <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper,</b> blueline tilefish, red porgy, white grunt, and vermilion snapper were generally greater in 2005 – 2006 than in the 1970 s.

40|$|Sagittae (n= 2, 263) and gonads (n= 870) from <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus niveatus, caught {{primarily}} with longlines, Kali poles, snapper reels, and chevron traps off North Carolina and South Carolina were examined 1) to compare growth rates, population age structure, and sex ratio between two periods 1979 – 85 and 1993 – 94, and 2) to determine reproductive seasonality, size and age at maturity, and size and age at sex change. There were several {{indications that the}} population off North Carolina and South Carolina is overfished: 1) size at age of specimens caught with longlines and snapper reels has increased noticeably since the 1980 s (possibly a a density-dependent population response to {{a high level of}} fishing mortality); 2) 81 % of the fish caught with commercial longlines during 1993 – 94 were ages 1 – 6, the majority (56 %) of which were immature females; 3) the percentage of males in the population appears to have decreased significantly, from 7 – 23 % in the 1970 s and 1980 s to 1 % in the 1990 s; and 4) mean length of fish landed in the longline fishery has steadily decreased from 65 – 80 cm in the early 1980 s to 50 – 60 cm in the mid- 1990 s. There was a positive trend between water depth and total length in fishery-independent samples. Histological examination of gonads revealed that mature gonads were present in 4 % of the females at age 3, 52 % at age 5, 95 % at age 7, and 100 % at ages > 7 during 1993 – 94. The smallest mature female was 469 mm TL, and the largest immature female was 575 mm.

Spawning females were caught during April through September on the upper continental slope off South Carolina at depths of 176 – 232 m. The size (767 – 1090 mm) and age (8 – 29 yr) of 97 male specimens and the capture of two specimens undergoing sex change provided conclusive evidence that <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> are protogynous hermaphrodites...|$|E
40|$|The Tortugas South Ecological Reserve, {{located along}} {{the margin of}} the {{southwest}} Florida carbonate platform, is part of the largest no-take marine reserve in the U. S. Established in July 2001, the reserve is approximately 206 km 2 in area, and ranges in depths from 30 m at Riley’s Hump to over 600 m at the southern edge of the reserve. Geological and biological information for the Tortugas South Reserve is lacking, and critical for management of the area. Bathymetric surveys were conducted with a Simrad EM 3000 multibeam echosounder at Riley’s Hump and Miller’s Ledge, located in the northern and central part of the reserve. Resulting data were used to produce basemaps to obtain geological ground truth and visual surveys of biological communities, including reef fishes. Visual surveys were conducted using SCUBA and the Phantom S 2 Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at Riley’s Hump. Visual surveys were conducted using the ROV and the Deepworker 2000 research submersible along Miller’s Ledge, within and outside of the reserve. A total of 108 fishes were recorded during SCUBA, ROV, and submersible observations. Replicate survey transects resulted in over 50 fishes documented at Miller’s Ledge, and eight of the top ten most abundant species were planktivores.

40|$|Ocean {{fish are}} a vital {{renewable}} resource for human populations, providing food, employment, and recreation. Many fish stocks worldwide, however, {{are in a}} state of serious decline due to overfishing, environmental degradation, climate change, and other stressors. Fishing effort worldwide has remained relatively constant with only slight increases recorded, while the global production of marine fisheries has decreased (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2010). The South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions of the United States have witnessed significant declines in fish stocks that are important to recreational and commercial fisheries. As of 2011, nine fish populations across the two regions were officially classified as "overfished. " An additional 12 populations were classified as "subject to overfishing. " Biological overfishing occurs when harvest rates from fishing exceed the growth rates of fish stocks. The resulting declines in fish populations can impact the economy at large. This study examines an important component of the costs of overfishing in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions [...] recreational catch losses from historic overfishing and their associated economic impacts. Our analysis covers nine federally managed overfished stocks in these two regions over the period 2005  2009, the most recent years for which the necessary data were available prior to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf. Those stocks are black sea bass, red grouper, red porgy, red snapper, and <b>snowy</b> <b>grouper</b> in the South Atlantic; and gag, gray triggerfish, greater amberjack, and red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico. Recreational fishing has long been an important economic activity in these regions. The money spent by recreational fishermen on charter fishing excursions, tackle, bait, fuel, and other expenses supports employment and economic activity across those regions. Our analysis assumes that recreational fisheries could have contributed more to regional economic activity had the stocks been capable of producing greater yields over the study period of 2005  2009. We estimate the size of the recreational catch loss for each species for each year and the economic activity that could have resulted had that catch been available. To arrive at our estimates of recreational catch loss, we compared average annual recreational harvests and effort for each stock for each year over the study period to potential estimated harvests and effort had the stocks been producing at optimum yield. We sourced our measures of optimum yield and maximum sustainable yield for each individual stock from regional stock assessments and fishery management plans. We valued the resulting catch loss by using data on trip expenditures by recreational fishermen in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Effort and expenditure data were sourced from the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey and includes trips that caught, targeted, or caught and/or targeted the stocks in our analysis. 1 Economic multipliers were used to estimate the total direct, indirect, and induced economic activity that could have been generated by those recreational fishing expenditures. Our estimates of catch loss and associated economic impacts are not additive across stocks since trips and their respective expenditures may be associated with multiple stocks. Our analysis finds that recreational fisheries in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico could have contributed millions of dollars more in additional recreational expenditures and associated economic activity had the fish species been producing at optimum yield over the study period. The greatest direct losses were associated with South Atlantic black sea bass and South Atlantic red snapper. Recreational fishermen in the South Atlantic spent $ 41. 7 million on average annually to realize 44 % of the total recreational catch that could have been available had the fish population been producing optimally. We estimate that recreational expenditures on South Atlantic black sea bass could have been $ 52. 8 million greater each year over the five-year study period had the stock been producing at optimum yield. An additional $ 52. 8 million in recreational expenditures each year could have generated an additional $ 138 million in economic output and $ 40. 3 million in income, and supported 896 jobs annually for the region. In the case of South Atlantic red snapper, fishermen spent $ 9. 2 million on average annually over the study period to catch 37 % of the recreational catch that could have been available under optimum yield. We estimate that recreational expenditures on South Atlantic red snapper could have been $ 15. 9 million greater each year and could have contributed an additional $ 41. 6 million in economic output and $ 12. 2 million in income, and supported 270 jobs for the region annually between 2005  2009. In the Gulf region, the greatest losses were associated with red snapper, where recreational fishermen spent $ 22. 4 million to realize 64 % of the optimal catch that could have been available. We estimate that recreational expenditures on Gulf red snapper could have been $ 12. 7 million greater each year had the stock been producing at optimum yield. An additional $ 12. 7 million in recreational expenditures each year could have generated an additional $ 33. 2 million in economic output and $ 9. 7 million in income, and supported 215 jobs annually for the region. Our findings support the conclusion that overfished stocks can lead to significant economic losses for regional economies through forgone recreational fishing expenditures. This is only one component of the cost of overfishing. Our analysis does not estimate the value of catch losses in commercial fisheries or the broader impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. The total value of catch losses resulting from historic overfishing would be greater still if other impacts had been considered. Despite these limitations, this study provides strong economic evidence in support of maintaining healthy ocean fish populations and continuing efforts to rebuild stocks currently subject to overfishing or classified as overfished...|$|E
