25|$|In {{people who}} have {{undergone}} gallbladder removal, the bile acid <b>sequestrant</b> cholestyramine may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and flatulence. Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when {{there is evidence of}} perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and use of a skin protectant.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sequestrant</b> is a food {{additive}} which {{improves the}} quality and stability of foods. A <b>sequestrant</b> forms chelate complexes with polyvalent metal ions, especially copper, iron and nickel, which can prevent the oxidation of the fats in the food. Sequestrants are a type of preservative.|$|E
50|$|A {{trial of}} bile acid <b>sequestrant</b> therapy is {{recommended}} for bile acid diarrhoea.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to bile acids, bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> may also bind {{drugs in the}} GI tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. For this reason, it is generally advised that bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> be spaced several hours apart from other drugs.|$|R
50|$|Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> {{are large}} {{polymeric}} structures, {{and they are}} not significantly absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. Thus, bile acid <b>sequestrants,</b> along with any bile acids bound to the drug, are excreted via the feces after passage through the gastrointestinal tract.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sequestrants</b> and {{chelating}} agents {{are used to}} [...] "disarm" [...] metal ions present in the solution, which could otherwise reduce the efficiency of other components, and assist with cleaning stains, which often contain metal compounds. The most common <b>sequestrants</b> used in paint strippers are EDTA, tributyl phosphate, and sodium phosphate.|$|R

50|$|Because {{bile acid}} <b>sequestrants</b> are not well-absorbed from the gut, they are {{generally}} regarded as safe in pregnant women. However, by interfering with vitamin absorption, they could cause vitamin deficiencies that may affect the fetus. Hence, vitamin supplementation may be considered, with appropriate intervals between dosing of the vitamins and bile acid <b>sequestrants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cholestyramine {{or other}} bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> will help {{reducing}} diarrhoea in bile acid malabsorption.|$|R
50|$|Chronic {{diarrhea}} in postcholecystectomy {{syndrome is}} a type of bile acid diarrhea (type 3). This can be treated with a bile acid <b>sequestrant</b> like cholestyramine, colestipol or colesevelam, which may be better tolerated.|$|E
50|$|Monocalcium citrate is a {{compound}} with formula C12H14CaO14. It is a calcium acid salt of citric acid. It {{is used as}} a firming agent in food, and as an acidity regulator and <b>sequestrant.</b>|$|E
50|$|When these metaphosphoric acids {{lose their}} hydrogens as H+, cyclic anions called metaphosphates are formed. An {{example of a}} {{compound}} with such an anion is sodium hexametaphosphate (Na6P6O18), used as a <b>sequestrant</b> and a food additive.|$|E

5000|$|Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> (resins, e.g. cholestyramine) are {{particularly}} effective for lowering LDL-C by sequestering the cholesterol-containing bile acids {{released into the}} intestine and preventing their reabsorption from the intestine. It decreases LDL by 15-30% and raises HDL by 3-5%, with little effect on triglycerides but can cause a slight increase. Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> may cause gastrointestinal problems and may also reduce the absorption of other drugs and vitamins from the gut.|$|R
50|$|Colesevelam {{is one of}} the bile-acid <b>sequestrants,</b> which {{along with}} niacin and the statins, are the three main types of {{cholesterol-lowering}} agents. The statins are considered the first-line agents. This is because of the larger body of evidence supporting statins' ability to prevent cardiovascular disease, as well as the prominent side effects from the other two types, including bloating and constipation (bile-acid <b>sequestrants)</b> and skin flushing (niacin). These side effects often lead to low patient compliance.|$|R
5000|$|Colestipol (trade names Colestid, Cholestabyl) is a {{bile acid}} <b>sequestrant</b> used to lower blood cholesterol, {{specifically}} low-density lipoprotein (LDL). [...] It {{is also used}} to reduce stool volume and frequency, and in the treatment of chronic diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|Glucono delta-lactone (GDL), {{also known}} as gluconolactone, is a food {{additive}} with the E number E575 used as a <b>sequestrant,</b> an acidifier, or a curing, pickling, or leavening agent. It is a lactone of D-gluconic acid. Pure GDL is a white odorless crystalline powder.|$|E
50|$|Colesevelam is a {{bile acid}} <b>sequestrant</b> {{administered}} orally. It {{was developed by}} GelTex Pharmaceuticals and later acquired by Genzyme.

50|$|Bile acid {{malabsorption}} is {{also sometimes}} missed {{in patients with}} diarrhea-predominant IBS. SeHCAT tests suggest around 30% of D-IBS patients have this condition, and most respond to bile acid <b>sequestrants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> {{may also}} be used to treat {{hyperthyroidism}} as an adjunct therapy. By inhibiting the enterohepatic circulation, more L-thyroxine will be lost through defecation, thus lowering body thyroxine levels.|$|R
50|$|Colestilan (INN, {{trade name}} BindRen) is a {{medication}} {{that acts as}} a phosphate binder and bile acid <b>sequestrant.</b> It is an ion-exchange resin, is an orally administered bile acid <b>sequestrant</b> that is being developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hyperphosphataemia. It has been launched in Japan for hypercholesterolaemia. For the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, it is launched in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal and the United Kingdom, is registered in the EU. Phase III development in paediatric patients with hyperphosphataemia associated with chronic kidney disease was underway in the UK and Germany. However, the company discontinued the development. In addition, the phase II development in type-2 diabetes mellitus and phase I development in hyperphosphataemia, in Japan, was also discontinued by the company.|$|E
50|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (e.g. cholestyramine, colestipol, etc.): If taken together, {{bile acid}} resins may bind to fenofibrate, {{resulting in a}} decrease in fenofibrate absorption. To maximize absorption, patients need to separate administration by at least 1 h before or 4 h to 6 h after taking the bile acid <b>sequestrant.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} at least 18 studies of the use of SeHCAT testing in diarrhea-predominant {{irritable}} bowel syndrome patients. When these data were combined, 32% of 1223 patients had a SeHCAT 7-day retention of less than 10%, and 80% of these reported a response to cholestyramine, a bile acid <b>sequestrant.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bile acid {{malabsorption}} {{is common}} in Crohn's disease but not always recognised. Most patients with previous ileal resection and chronic diarrhea will have abnormal SeHCAT tests and can benefit from bile acid <b>sequestrants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Bile acids promote bile {{formation}} and facilitate dietary lipid absorption. Animal and human studies showing disturbed bile acid metabolism in diabetes mellitus suggest {{a link between}} bile acids and glucose control. Bile acids are activating ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor with an established role in bile acid and lipid metabolism. Evidence suggests a role for FXR also in maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Animal and human studies employing bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> (bile acid binding agents), which interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and effectively reduce plasma cholesterol, support a link between bile acid and glucose metabolism. In lipid-lowering trials, bile acid <b>sequestrants,</b> such as colesevelam hydrochloride, colestyramine (cholestyramine) and colestilan (colestimide), have {{also been shown to}} lower plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels, suggesting the utility of these agents as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes. In this article, we review the relationship between bile acid metabolism and glucose homeostasis, and present data demonstrating the utility of bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> in the management of diabetes...|$|R
50|$|In chronic liver {{diseases}} such as cirrhosis, bile acids may deposit in the skin, causing pruritus (itching). Hence, bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> {{may be used for}} the prevention of pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease.|$|R
5000|$|To relieve itching {{caused by}} bile acids in circulation, which are {{normally}} removed by the liver, cholestyramine (a bile acid <b>sequestrant)</b> may be prescribed to absorb bile acids {{in the gut}} and be eliminated, rather than re-enter the blood stream. Other drugs that do this include stanozolol, naltrexone and rifampicin.|$|E
5000|$|SHMP {{is used as}} a <b>sequestrant</b> and has {{applications}} {{within a}} wide variety of industries, including as a food additive in which it is used under the E number E452i. Sodium carbonate is sometimes added to SHMP to raise the pH to 8.0-8.6, which produces a number of SHMP products used for water softening and detergents.|$|E
50|$|Disodium citrate, more properly, {{disodium}} hydrogen citrate, is an {{acid salt}} of citric acid with the chemical formula Na2C6H6O7. It {{is used as}} an antioxidant in food {{as well as to}} improve the effects of other antioxidants. It is also used as an acidity regulator and <b>sequestrant.</b> Typical products include gelatin, jam, sweets, ice cream, carbonated beverages, milk powder, wine, and processed cheeses.|$|E
25|$|Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> such as {{cholestyramine}} can {{be effective}} in chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.|$|R
50|$|As {{bile acid}} <b>sequestrants</b> are {{designed}} {{to stay in the}} gut, in general, they do not have systemic side-effects. However, they may cause problems in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating and flatulence. Some patients complain of the bad taste.|$|R
25|$|Atorvastatin {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> and ezetimibe to increase the reduction in cholesterol levels. However, It is not recommended to combine statin drug treatment with certain other cholesterol-lowering drugs, particularly fibrates, because this may increase the risk of myopathy-related adverse effects.|$|R
