5|$|Most people recover uneventfully {{following}} a mild local reaction {{and up to}} about 3% of individuals <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> severe localised reaction. Most individuals who suffer from severe localised reactions will most likely encounter another reaction if stung again. Fatalities are rare, and venom immunotherapy can prevent fatalities.|$|E
5|$|After strong podiums in Monaco and Canada, Hill {{took his}} first career pole in France, {{finishing}} second to Prost after team orders prevented him from seriously challenging for the win. He looked set to win his home race in Britain before another engine failure put him out and led the German Grand Prix comfortably only to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> puncture with two laps left, handing the win to Prost.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, Headley's {{average in}} Test matches of 60.83 is third highest {{among those with}} 2,000 runs, behind Bradman and Graeme Pollock, and but for the Tests he played after the war, {{he would have been}} above Pollock. In all {{first-class}} matches, he has the third highest average with 69.86, behind Bradman and Vijay Merchant among those who played 50 innings. He averaged a century every fourth innings in which he batted, second again to Bradman, and did not <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> poor series in his career before the war.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, since taken over from Sparrow. Barbossa and his crew <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: the United States had yet to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> casualty, and the Russians were distracted by internal upheaval. A stalemate in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were {{in the basement of a}} nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> broken arm. They sustained themselves on the food supplies—fruit salad, pickles, and smoked ham—that were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British and allied effort in the two world wars and began to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> sharp {{industrial}} decline, going through periods of considerable political instability. The decline was particularly acute in the second half of the 20th century, but was compensated for to a degree by the development of an extensive oil industry, technological manufacturing and a growing service sector. This period also increasing debates about the place of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the rise of the Scottish National Party and after a referendum in 1999 the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament.|$|E

On 20 August, Mido made a disappointing debut for Zamalek, wasting a second-half penalty as Zamalek threw away their lead to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> late 2–1 home victory to Petrojet in the Egyptian Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Soona {{gives the}} digital {{cassette}} to Mulder at a discreet {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> similar punishment if she has lied to them.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> debilitating injury that resulted in paraplegia. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.|$|E

5|$|The Atlanta Constitution {{voted the}} 1911 team's backfield {{the best in}} the South. It {{consisted}} of: Lew Hardage, Wilson Collins, Ammie Sikes, and Ray Morrison. The team's only blemish was a one-point loss to Michigan. The 1912 team led the nation in scoring by margin of victory and lost only to national champion Harvard, though it did <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> tie with Auburn, the next season's Southern champion.|$|E
5|$|Vidya is {{revealed}} to be the widow of Arup Basu (Abir Chatterjee), an IB officer and Damji's colleague, {{who was killed in}} the poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee (Darshan Jariwala), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.|$|E
5|$|While {{meeting in}} the cafeteria, the study group reveal their plans for Christmas. Some are {{spending}} time away, disappointing Abed (Danny Pudi), who had wished to spend the holidays with the group, even renting the critically reviled Inspector Spacetime holiday special to watch with them. Their conversation is interrupted by a performance by the obnoxious Greendale glee club. Midway through, Chang (Ken Jeong) stops them with a cease and desist order from ASCAP—tipped off by Jeff (Joel McHale)—for performing copyrighted music without permission. The glee club members <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> nervous breakdown and are taken to the hospital.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Skanderbeg {{had been at}} war with Venice. Realizing the {{magnitude}} of his challenge, Skanderbeg attempted to relieve the garrison by engaging in skirmishes with the Ottoman army. His forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Turkish forces through guerrilla-style attacks. Efforts were made by Skanderbeg to use intelligence forces, operating as far as Constantinople, to gather information on Murad's plans of action. Meanwhile, near Scutari, {{he had been able}} to defeat a Venetian force and managed to considerably weaken the Venetian presence in Albania. Despite these efforts, on July 31 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered due to a disruption in the water supply. The garrison was spared and a force of Ottoman Janissaries was stationed inside the fortress instead. Two years later, Murad would march against Krujë, only to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> heavy defeat.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both innings of a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E
5000|$|The Olympic Men's 400m Final {{was held}} at the Lenin Stadium, Moscow on 30 July 1980.
