2500|$|The Colour and the Shape was {{recorded}} {{over the period}} of two months, primarily at Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood from January to February 1997. The band spent two weeks in pre-production the previous autumn, rehearsing the tracks and changing arrangements. Norton had his greatest impact during pre-production, during which he spent days with Grohl {{in his hotel room}} [...] "stripping the songs back to their absolute basics." [...] His role in production taught the band the importance of self-editing and gave them confidence to see [...] "the larger picture in a song." [...] Afterwards, the band set off for Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, where the first recording sessions for The Colour and the Shape began on November 18, 1996. Bear Creek, described by Mendel as [...] "a converted barn with a salmon stream running through it," [...] was located on a farm and the band lived in a cabin-like home adjacent to the studio. Grohl described the sessions as a [...] "bad experience," [...] deciding to scrap nearly all of the recorded tracks.
