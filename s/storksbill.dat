50|$|Erodium is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} botanical family Geraniaceae. The genus includes about 60 species, native to North Africa, Indomalaya, The Middle East, and Australia. They are perennials, annuals, or subshrubs, with five-petalled flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, that strongly resemble the better-known Geranium (cranesbill). American species are known as filarees or heron's bill, whereas Eurasian ones are usually called <b>storksbills</b> in English.|$|R

Both genera belong to the family Geraniaceae. Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, Geranium, and they were later separated into two genera by Charles L’Héritier in 1789.|$|R

50|$|This is {{a nationally}} {{important}} botanical site, for both vascular and non-vascular plants, {{situated on the}} southern escarpment of the Mendip Hills. It also contains a roosting site for two nationally rare species of bat and {{a wide range of}} butterfly species. The very thin soils here support populations of one nationally rare species, Cheddar bedstraw (Galium fleurotii) and four nationally scarce species, pale St John's wort (Hypericum montanum), sea <b>storksbill</b> (Erodium maritimum), dwarf mouse-ear (Cerastium pumilum) and spring cinquefoil (Potentilla tabernaemontani). There is a roosting site for greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoe bat R. hipposideros, both of which are nationally rare. Dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) are found in the woodland. Twenty-five species of butterfly have been recorded and these include: brown argus (Aricia agestis), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja) and marbled white (Melanargia galathea).|$|E
50|$|This site {{lies within}} the Exmoor National Park, and {{contains}} extensive areas of heathland communities. Associated particularlywith the coastal communities and woods are {{a wide range}} of nationally rare and scarce plants. The site comprises four separate blocks (between Combe Martin and Minehead) centred on Trentishoe, Cosgate Hill, Countisbury and North Hill. There are two nationally rare, endemic whitebeam species which occur in the woodland areas namely Sorbus subcuneata and Sorbus vexans. Several nationally scarce plant species are found within this site; white mullein (Verbascum lychnitis) in its yellow form occurs in fields {{at the edge of the}} site, Cornish moneywort (Sibthorpia europaea) beside streams, rock stonecrop (Sedum forsteranum) on rocky seacliffs and sea <b>storksbill</b> (Erodium maritinum), upright chickweed (Moenchia erecta) and bird's-foot clover (Trifolium ornithopodioides) all in areas of very short turf. A nationally rare butterfly the high brown fritillary (Argynnis adippe) occurs on this site.|$|E
5000|$|Wingletang Down is 28.9 ha of {{maritime}} heath, {{dune grassland}} and scrub reaching a maximum height of 20 m above sea-level {{and is considered}} by Plantlife to be an Important Plant Area. Due to exposure to salt-laden winds, wind-pruned or [...] "waved" [...] maritime heath has developed on the low nutrient, shallow soils on the higher land, whilst to the south on the deeper sandy soils close to sea-level dune grassland grows. At the southern promontory of Horse Point there is short maritime grass and a tumble of large granite boulders where shallow temporary brackish pools occur. Sea milkwort (Glaux maritima) is a rare plant in Scilly and grows here. Sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and sand couch (Elytrigia juncea) dominate the dune grassland between Wingletang Bay and Porth Askin whilst flowering plants include common <b>storksbill</b> (Erodium cicutarium), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica) and hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) which is unusual here as it usually grows in wet habitats. At Beady Pool, {{which is part of}} Wingletang Bay, sea kale (Crambe maritima) grows on the strandline along with yellow horned poppy (Glaucium flavum) and sea spurge (E paralias). There is a colony of Six-spot Burnet (Zygaena filipendulae) here and in the past Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) nested. The nationally scarce (but common on all the inhabited islands) early meadow grass (Poa infirma) grows in the short maritime grass west of Porth Askin.|$|E
40|$|Overall {{plant cover}} has {{increased}} {{as evidenced by}} a decrease in interspace size and frequency. Some of the other plant species on site include Mormon tea, winterfat, rabbitbrush, snakeweed, squirreltail, curlygrass, blue grama, and globemallow. Exotic species such as cheatgrass and <b>storksbill</b> are also present. Vegetation conditions inside of the fenced right-of-way (visible in the 1998 photograph about 75 feet from the photopoint) {{are very similar to}} the foreground area that is still grazed by cattle. The deep sandy loams found here are moderately productive if an annual precipitation level of about 10 inches is maintained. [URL]...|$|E
30|$|Exotic {{plant species}} {{typically}} included Ehrharta calycina (African Veldt grass), Rumex sp. (Sorrel), Arctotheca calendula (Capeweed), and Erodium sp. (<b>Storksbill).</b> These {{were treated with}} successive broad scale herbicide applications of Roundup Powermax 1.5  L/ha, Amitrole T 1.5  L/ha, Glean 7.5  g/ha, and Eject (Oust) 7.5  g/ha with 100  L water per ha using a tractor-mounted boom-sprayer. On the deeper sands associated with the Heathy Woodlands, 1  m-wide strips were cleared with the boom-sprayer. In addition, Cutlass 500 120  mL/ha, Metsulfuron 7  g/ha, ammonium sulphate 4  kg/ 1, 000  L, Wetspray 200  mL/ 100  L, and water 70  L/ha were applied {{in order to control}} the soil-borne pests Halotydeus destructor (Red-legged earth mites) and Agrotis spp. (Cut worm). In areas supporting more than 50 % indigenous ground cover, herbicide was only applied using a spot-spraying approach – clearing 1  m 2 of vegetation at least 6  m apart.|$|E
40|$|The types, general distribution, and {{descriptions}} of vegetation communities occurring along the various proposed segments are described in further detail below. Annual grasslands (non-native grasslands) : A small patch of this community is found {{just south of the}} proposed segment, west of Pomona. This community is composed of many native and non-native annual species of grasses and herbs and include bromes (Bromus sp.), California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), lupines (Lupinu sp.), mustards (Brassica sp.), oats (Avena sp.), ryegrasses (lolium sp.), <b>storksbill</b> (Erodium sp.), and star-thistles (Centaurea sp.). Emergent shrubs and trees also may be present. Annual grasslands may host European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), house sparrows (Passer domesticus), mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos), house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), scrub jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), Brewer’s blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus), and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Annual grasslands also provide important foraging habitat for raptors, including American kestrel (Falco sparverius), blackshouldered kite (Elanus caeruleus), and prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus) (Mayer and Laudenslayer, Jr., 1988).
