Mansfield continued in the title role, and Beatrice Cameron continued to play Jekyll's fiancée; the actors married in 1892. In later years he staged the play less often, after becoming fearful that <b>something</b> <b>would</b> go wrong during the transformation scenes. Mansfield's company last performed the play at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York on March 21, 1907. He fell ill soon afterward, and died on August 30 of that year.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the events of , protagonist George Stobbart and his girlfriend, Nicole Collard, visit an {{archaeologist}} named Professor Oubier to learn about a mysterious Mayan stone Nico uncovered while researching a newspaper story. At Oubier's home, they are ambushed by two Central Americans, who kidnap Nico, tie George to a chair and set the building ablaze. George unties himself and puts out the fire. He contacts Andre Lobineau, who reveals that Nico had suspected that <b>something</b> <b>would</b> go wrong and had left the stone with him. Lobineau tells him of a gallery owner who can tell him more about Mayan art. George discovers that Oubier supplies the gallery with Mayan artifacts, which he imports through a company named Condor Transglobal. Following this lead, George finds the two Central Americans who kidnapped Nico. One of them, whose name is later revealed to be Pablo, is shown threatening and berating the other (later revealed to be called Titipoco). George knocks Pablo unconscious and discovers that Condor Transglobal has links with Quaramonte City in Central America. He also frees Titipoco, who had been manacled by Pablo. George finds Nico, who reveals that, while trying to expose a drug ring run {{by a man named}} Karzac, she was sent the stone instead, prompting her to arrange the appointment with Oubier.|$|E

500|$|Moore wrote {{music to}} Age 13 slowed down to half its {{original}} playback speed. This {{allowed him to}} write an album's worth of music around the twenty-five minute film and [...] "made [...] flow better". Moore primarily worked alone in his home studio, recording short song ideas. [...] "I would place [...] inside a theme in the film, just sort of audition things that might work, and <b>something</b> <b>would</b> click and I would develop the idea," [...] Moore said. In contrast to Moore's original plan to record an [...] "organic, and less digital" [...] album, all of the sounds on Graveyard Mountain Home are digital.|$|E
500|$|Scholars such as Claudia Tate suggest {{there is}} a theme of jealousy {{throughout}} the novel. Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not [...] "She was caught between two allegiances, different, yet the same. Herself. Her race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her. Whatever steps she took, or if she took none at all, <b>something</b> <b>would</b> be crushed. A person or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. Or, it might be, all three. Nothing, she imagined, was ever more completely sardonic.” Larsen uses jealousy as {{the main source of}} conflict in the novel, and uses race solely as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare. At this point in the story Irene realizes she can expose Clare’s true racial identity to remove Clare from her life, and regain that security she desires more than anything.|$|E

[...] Anna Torv later commented that she wished for Olivia to [...] "lighten up" [...] during the first season, [...] "but every time she did, <b>something</b> <b>would</b> happen." [...] The writers inputted small scenes to shine more light on her character, which included Olivia dressing up for a night out but then [...] "the phone rings. It’s Broyles, and she wipes the lipstick off, puts on a coat, and goes out. That’s it. You’re on call. She breaks my heart." ...|$|E
500|$|She then won a {{supporting}} role in the futuristic 1995 film Tank Girl, winning the role of [...] "Jet Girl" [...] after nine auditions. While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it {{has gone on to}} become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: [...] "there were always little bites. Whenever I felt I {{was at the end of}} my rope, <b>something</b> <b>would</b> come up. Something bad. But for me it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto." [...] In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; and as the lead role in , in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.|$|E

500|$|In 1903, the Georgist Lizzie Magie {{applied for}} a patent on a game called The Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched {{property}} owners and impoverished tenants. She knew that some people would {{find it hard to}} understand the logic behind the idea, and she thought that if the rent problem and the Georgist solution to it were put into the concrete form of a game, it might be easier to demonstrate. She was granted the patent for the game in January 1904. The Landlord's Game {{became one of the first}} board games to use a [...] "continuous path", without clearly defined start and end spaces on its board. Another innovation in gameplay attributed to Magie is the concept of [...] "ownership" [...] of a place on a game board, such that <b>something</b> <b>would</b> happen to the second (or later) player to land on the same space, without the first player's piece still being present. A copy of Magie's game that she had left at the Georgist community of Arden, Delaware and dating from 1903–1904, was presented for the PBS series History Detectives. This copy featured property groups, organized by letters, later a major feature of Monopoly as published by Parker Brothers.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} the {{demonstration}} became violent. A government statement called the riots a [...] "pre-empted, organised violent crime [...] instigated and directed from abroad, and carried out by outlaws." [...] Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang regional government, said on 6 July that overseas separatist forces had {{taken advantage of the}} Shaoguan incident [...] "to instigate Sunday's unrest and undermine the ethnic unity and social stability". The government blamed the exiled independence group World Uyghur Congress (WUC) for coordinating and instigating the riots over the internet. Government sources blamed the WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer in particular, citing her public speeches after the Tibetan unrest and phone recordings in which she had allegedly said that <b>something</b> <b>would</b> happen in Ürümqi. Chinese authorities accused a man who they alleged to be a key WUC member of inciting ethnic tensions by circulating a violent video, and urging Uyghurs, in an online forum, to [...] "fight back [...] with violence". Jirla Isamuddin, the mayor of Ürümqi, claimed that the protesters had organised online via such services as QQ Groups. China Daily asserted that the riots were organised to fuel separatism and to benefit Middle East terrorist organisations. Kadeer denied fomenting the violence, and argued that the Ürümqi protests and their descent into violence were triggered by heavy policing, discontent over Shaoguan and [...] "years of Chinese repression", rather than by the intervention of separatists or terrorists; Uyghur exile groups claimed that violence erupted when police used excessive force to disperse the crowd.|$|E
500|$|The Haunting {{opened to}} mixed reception, the {{consensus}} generally being {{that it was}} a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. Variety called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the [...] "monstrous" [...] house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had [...] "major shortcomings" [...] in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times cited The Haunting as [...] "one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced" [...] but surmised that [...] "there is really no point to it". Writing in The Atlantic magazine, critic Pauline Kael called the film [...] "moderately elegant and literate and expensive", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being [...] "feeble [...] cowardly-comic". She considered the film to be superior to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film. Kael said of it, [...] "It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at The Haunting wasn't merely bored, it was hostile—as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies… But the few scattered people at The Haunting were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing—the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that <b>something</b> <b>would</b> happen. In their terms, they were cheated: nothing happened. And, of course, they missed what was happening all along, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that the real things are physical." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{developing}} the argument against a divine creator, Dawkins examines {{a number of}} designoid objects that contain imperfections, which is <b>something</b> you <b>would</b> not expect to find in an object that is supposedly created by a divine being. Showing the audience a halibut flatfish, he explains how they evolved from an upright swimming ancestor with one eye {{on each side of}} the head into a bottom-hugging flatfish with a distorted set of eyes on one side of the body. Dawkins claims that this is poorly designed, as any proper engineer would design an organism more like a skate, which flattened out on its belly instead of on its side. This is an example of <b>something</b> you <b>would</b> expect from an evolved/designoid object, but not <b>something</b> you <b>would</b> expect from a created/designed object.|$|R

500|$|The 2002–03 season saw Duncan enjoy another {{standout}} {{season in}} which he averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and yet another dual All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-up, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award. At age 37, Robinson announced that year as his last season, and his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs. The Spurs qualified easily for the playoffs, concluding the regular season as the Conference number one seed with a 60–22 record. Although San Antonio now had new offensive threats in Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili, during the playoffs, it was Duncan's performance in the semi-finals against the Los Angeles Lakers which was singled out for praise by Popovich, who stated: [...] "I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [...] was astounding in his focus. He pulled everyone along these last two games." [...] In the series, Duncan was matched up against forward Robert Horry, {{and was able to}} dominate him the entire series and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds, allowing Spurs coach Popovich to call timeout with 2:26 left to instruct his team not to celebrate excessively. The Spurs made it to the finals, and defeated the New Jersey Nets 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship. Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a quadruple double in the final game, and was named the NBA Finals MVP. Duncan said of the victory: [...] "We were all confident that <b>something</b> <b>would</b> happen, that we would turn the game to our favor, and it did", but felt sad that Robinson retired after winning his second championship ring. Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named Sports Illustrateds 2003 [...] "Sportsmen of the Year".|$|E
