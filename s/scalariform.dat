2500|$|Some hand axes {{were used}} with force that left clearly visible marks. Other visible marks {{can be left}} as the scars from retouching, on {{occasion}} {{it is possible to}} distinguish them from marks left by the initial manufacture. One of the most common cases is when a point breaks. This was seen at sites in Europe, Africa and Asia. One example comes from the El Basalito site in Salamanca, where excavation uncovered fragments of a hand axe with marks at the tip that appeared {{to be the result of}} the action of a wedge, which would have subjected the object to high levels of torsion that broke the tip. A break or extreme wear can affect a tool's point or any other part. Such wear was reworked by means of a secondary working as discussed above. In some cases this reconstruction is easily identifiable and was carried out using techniques such as the coup de tranchet (French, meaning [...] "tranchet blow"), or simply with scale or <b>scalariform</b> retouches that alter an edge's symmetry and line.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} {{difference is}} that <b>scalariform</b> conjugation occurs between two filaments and lateral conjugation occurs between two adjacent cells on the same filament.|$|E

5000|$|Alfaroa is a genus of {{evergreen}} {{trees in}} the Juglandaceae family of the Fagales, growing in montaine and submontaine tropical rain forests in Central America. The wood is characterized by solid pith, pink heartwood, and vessels with <b>scalariform</b> perforations, as well as simple perforations.|$|E
50|$|The {{elm tree}} family. To tell these trees {{apart from other}} rose motif trees, look for their {{alternate}} 2-ranked, often scabrous leaves. The Ulmus genus are strongly toothed and have asymmetrical leaf bases with secondary veins <b>scalariform</b> and usually ending in teeth. The Ulmus also have samara.|$|E
50|$|The {{wood of the}} Anacardiaceae has the {{frequent}} occurrence of simple small holes in the vessels, occasionally in some species {{side by side with}} <b>scalariform</b> holes (in Campnosperma, Micronychia, and Heeria argentea (Anaphrenium argenteum). The simple pits are located along the vessel wall and in contact with the parenchyma.|$|E
50|$|In the gnetifer hypothesis, the gnetophytes are {{sister to}} the conifers, and the {{gymnosperms}} are a monophyletic group, sister to the angiosperms. The gnetifer hypothesis first emerged formally in the mid-twentieth century, when vessel {{elements in the}} gnetophytes were interpreted as being derived from tracheids with circular bordered pits, as in conifers. It did not gain strong support, however, until the emergence of molecular data in the late 1990s. Although the most salient morphological evidence still largely supports the anthophyte hypothesis, there are some more obscure morphological commonalities between the gnetophytes and conifers that {{lend support to the}} gnetifer hypothesis. These shared traits include: tracheids with <b>scalariform</b> pits with tori interspersed with annular thickenings, absence of <b>scalariform</b> pitting in primary xylem, scale-like and strap-shaped leaves of Ephedra and Welwitschia; and reduced sporophylls.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} turbinate to {{elongate}} conical in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral. The spire is <b>scalariform</b> and concave in cross section. The shell is ornamented with cords and nodules which die out {{early in the}} postnuclear whorls. The anal notch is deep. The periostracum is tufted, and the operculum is small.|$|E
5000|$|In lateral conjugation, gametes {{are formed}} {{in a single}} filament. Two {{adjoining}} cells near the common transverse wall give out protuberances known as conjugation tubes, which further form the conjugation canal upon contact. The male cytoplasm migrates through the conjugation canal, fusing with the female. The rest of the process proceeds as in <b>scalariform</b> conjugation.|$|E

5000|$|Hardwoods have a {{more complex}} {{structure}} than softwoods and are often much slower growing as a result. The dominant feature separating [...] "hardwoods" [...] from softwoods {{is the presence of}} pores, or vessels. The vessels may show considerable variation in size, shape of perforation plates (simple, <b>scalariform,</b> reticulate, foraminate), and structure of cell wall, such as spiral thickenings.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} {{elongated}} to biconical in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral, the spire is <b>scalariform.</b> The anal notch is deep.

5000|$|Geminigeraceae is {{a family}} of cryptophytes {{containing}} the five genera Geminigera, Guillardia, Hanusia, Proteomonas and Teleaulax. They are characterised by chloroplasts containing Cr-phycoerythrin 545, and an inner periplast component (IPC) comprising [...] "a sheet or a sheet and multiple plates if diplomorphic". The nucleomorphs are never in the pyrenoid, and there is never a <b>scalariform</b> furrow. The cells do, however, have a long, keeled rhizostyle with lamellae (wings).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scalariform</b> {{conjugation}} requires {{association of}} two different filaments lined side by side either partially or throughout their length. One cell each from opposite lined filaments emits tubular protuberances known as conjugation tubes, which elongate and fuse, to make a passage called the conjugation canal. The cytoplasm of the cell acting as the male travels through this tube and fuses with the female cytoplasm, and the gametes fuse to form a zygospore.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 5 mm, its {{diameter}} 5 mm. The umbilicated, very fragile shell has a conoidal shape. The 5Â½ whorls are angular and flat above. The first 3 whorls are smooth, the remainder minutely cingulate, granose, and obliquely striate. They are ornamented with chestnut-brown radiating spots and whitish. The body whorl is angular at its base, convex below, and ornamented with 7 minutely grained concentric lirae. The ample umbilicus is <b>scalariform,</b> cingulate, granose, and bounded by a white crenate riblet.|$|E
50|$|A {{narrowly}} {{conical shell}} with angular shoulders, an elevated and slightly <b>scalariform</b> spire, {{and a body}} whorl with flat sides; shell shape is not known to vary in this species. The protoconch is paucispiral with two whorls, and fluted nodules are present {{on the shoulders of}} the earliest teleoconch whorls. The sutural ramps are flat and lack cords. The color consists of light golden brown with white blotches in a spiral pattern. The aperture is blue-white to lavender in color. The protoconch and early whorls are white. The shell is similar in shape to juvenile Conus scalaris. Its length is between 12.8 and 50.9 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{preserved}} as a cellular permineralization {{within a single}} cobble and consists of a small axis with a centrarch protostele. The secondary tissues of the vascular cambium contain extinct P-type cell walls. This type of cell wall consisted of <b>scalariform</b> bordered pits and multiaperturate pit membranes. The secondary vascular tissues in Franhueberia gerriennei represent {{one of the oldest}} examples of secondary growth. Wood or secondary xylem with P-type cell walls have also been observed in the slightly older (late Pragian-earliest Emsian) Armoricaphyton chateaupannense from western France and in an unnamed basal euphyllophyte from late Emsian outcrops of the Campbellton Formation in New Brunswick, Canada.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} stems of P. dawsonii was considerably more complex than that of other plants of a similar age, e.g. Rhynia. A central strand of xylem occupied up {{to a third of}} the diameter of the stem. In the lower parts of main stems it was circular, enlarging before it divided prior to dichotomous branching. Higher up it became elliptical in cross-section, corresponding to the two rows of fertile branching units. Within the branches of these units, the strand was more-or-less rectangular. The conducting elements of the xylem, the tracheids, were of the so-called 'P-type' in which the walls were strengthened by ladder-like (<b>scalariform)</b> bars with circular openings between them. The tissue around the central strand was multi-layered with open spaces below the stomata.|$|E
5000|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 9 mm and 19 mm. The solid, umbilicate or {{perforate}} shell has a conical shape. It is whitish, radiately maculated above and dotted beneath with red or rich brown. There are several color mutations. The conical, turrited spire is acuminate and somewhat <b>scalariform.</b> The about 7 whorls are very convex, spirally lirate, and radiately costate above. They are bicarinated at the periphery, and encircled by a deep canal. The convex base of the shell bears about 5 spiral lirae. The oblique aperture is rounded. The columella is sinuous in the middle (not concave, nor dentate at the base as in Rubritrochus declivis (ForskÃ¥l, 1775)) and arcuate above. The broad umbilicus is funnel-shaped, or narrow and almost closed, ...|$|E
50|$|As a young {{vascular}} plant grows, {{one or more}} strands of primary xylem form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called 'protoxylem'. In appearance protoxylem is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls which contain thickenings {{in the form of}} rings or helices. Functionally, protoxylem can extend: the cells are able to grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, 'metaxylem' develops in the strands of xylem. Metaxylem vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings which are typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars (<b>scalariform)</b> or continuous sheets except for holes or pits (pitted). Functionally, metaxylem completes its development after elongation ceases when the cells no longer need to grow in size.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 5 mm and 13 mm. The solid, umbilicate shell has a conical shape. It is deep green, brown, pinkish or olivaceous, more or less dotted with white and a self-color, {{sometimes}} radiately flammulated with white. A tract around the umbilicus is white, tessellated with brown. The spire is elevated, sometimes <b>scalariform.</b> The apex acute. The upper whorls are slightly convex. The body whorl is convex, depressed below the suture and, rounded at the periphery. The whole surface bears numerous low, smooth spiral striae, which are often subobsolete on the body whorl, and it is then nearly smooth. The base of the shell is concave in the middle. The aperture is rounded-quadrate, smooth within or finely lirate. The columella is slightly sinuous, bidentate at base, expanding in a callus above, which slightly impinges upon the umbilicus.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the shell is between 12 mm and 24 mm and is 16 mm to 19 mm wide. The {{conoidal}} shell is imperforate or narrowly perforate. It is very thick and solid, cinereous. The color of the shell is yellowish or green. It is longitudinally marked with rose-red lines, often oblique or broken into square dots. The spire {{is more or less}} elevated. Its outlines are rather convex. The six whorls are encircled by numerous lirulae, the upper ones flattened. The sutures are slightly impressed, but <b>scalariform</b> specimens with deep sutures are frequent. The body whorl is rounded at the periphery and on the base. The aperture is rounded-quadrate. The outer lip is bevelled to an edge, very thick andsmooth within. The pearly columella is straightened in the middle. The umbilicus is narrow or concealed.|$|E
5000|$|The white shell has a pupiform shape. The length {{measures}} 5 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small, {{almost completely}} immersed. The six whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, scarcely at all contracted at the periphery, strongly roundedly shouldered at the summit. They {{are marked by}} slender, distant, <b>scalariform,</b> retractive axial ribs, of which about 20 occur upon the first and 16 upon the remaining turns. The shallow intercostal spaces are very broad. The sutures are strongly marked. The periphery and the somewhat prolonged base of the body whorl are well rounded. They are marked by the undiminished continuations of the axial ribs, which extend to the umbilical chink. The aperture is ovate. The outer lip is thin. The slender columella is curved, and provided with a moderately strong fold at its insertion. The parietal wall {{is covered with a}} thick callus.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 3 mm and 10 mm. The small, solid, {{elevated}} shell has an ovate-conic shape. It is white, {{with a series of}} about 10 rufous spots near the suture. The five whorls form a conical spire. They are ventricose, with delicate, highly elevated spiral rib-striae,- of which there are about 5 on the upper and 10 on the last whorl. The surface of the ribs is slightly tuberculous, and the last one overhangs the succeeding whorl so as to form a broad deep channel at the suture. The interspaces have about the same width as the ribs, and are beautifully barred with close-set laminae. The base of the shell isconvex, with a small deep <b>scalariform</b> umbilicus, sculptured like the spire. The aperture is obliquely semicircular. The outer lip is crenulated by the ribs, and conspicuously sulcate within. The columella is sharp, oblique, armed with a fully developed sharp tooth at the base, succeeded by a deep basal notch.|$|E
50|$|Armoricaphyton is an extinct monospecific genus of {{vascular}} land plants described from Early Devonian (late Pragian-earliest Emsian) outcrops of the Chalonnes Formation {{in western}} France. The plant consists of small, leafless, longitudinally-ribbed axes that branch pseudomonopodially. Pairs of fusiform-shaped, twisted sporangia preserved as adpressions {{were found in}} association with the axes and may belong to this species. Permineralized specimens reveal the oldest documented wood or secondary xylem of any known fossil plant. The water-conducting tissues or tracheids consisted of extinct P-type cell walls. This type of cell wall consisted of <b>scalariform</b> bordered pits and perforated sheets that covered the openings (apertures) of the pits. A. chateaupannense is anatomically similar in some respects to other members of the Euphyllophytina such as Psilophyton and Franhueberia. Franhueberia gerriennei {{is also one of the}} earliest land plants described from the Early Devonian (late Emsian) that was known to have wood. Given the differences between Armoricaphyton and these other genera and a lack of a complete understanding of the whole plant, Armoricaphyton is currently classified as Euphyllophytina incertae sedis.|$|E
