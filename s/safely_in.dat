5|$|The British took Ninfa {{into service}} as HMS Hamadryad, a 36-gun frigate with a main battery of 12-pounders, but {{were unable to}} {{retrieve}} the cargo of silver, which later arrived <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|Three men, Thomas Kenney, Aquilla Floyd, and Alexander Higginbotham, {{managed to}} escape. They eluded the warriors and arrived <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> Galena, Illinois three days later.

5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the risks}} {{associated}} with the Lunar landing, a number of rescue spacecraft were proposed, to be used to allow the crew of an Apollo mission to return to Earth <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> the event of a problem. Many of these designs were based around the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Inspections by the Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Sir Joseph Bazalgette, {{following}} the purchase found that Battersea Bridge {{was in such}} poor condition that it was unable to be repaired <b>safely.</b> <b>In</b> 1883 it was restricted to pedestrian traffic only, and in 1885 it was demolished {{to make way for}} a new bridge designed by Bazalgette.|$|E

5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Although there had been only a few new defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E
5|$|At 9:42a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{grounded}} all civilian aircraft {{within the}} continental U.S., and civilian aircraft already in flight {{were told to}} land immediately. All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico, and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days. The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers. Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day, {{one of the most}} prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the U.S. State Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Another jet—Delta Air Lines Flight 1989—was suspected of having been hijacked, but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, Krakatoa begins {{stirring}} for {{the first}} time in 200 years. In the nearby village of Waringin, Sadidjah confides to her husband, village head Tjakra Amidjaja, that she has had a bad dream about the volcano; she fears that it will be the death of them. Tjakra Amidjaja consoles her, and tells her that they will leave the village in two days. In the meantime, the volcano grows increasingly violent and Tjakra Amidjaja and Sadidjah stay behind to manage the evacuation. They send their children, Hasan and Soerijati, to stay with family in Rangkas Gombong. Krakatoa erupts several hours later. The village is wiped out in the resulting tsunami, and Soerijati is lost after she falls out of the carriage she is in; Hasan, however, arrives <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> Rangkas Gombong.|$|E
5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed {{into each other}} and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for the}} final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> last place, around 15m behind with only 50m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's own {{plane was}} charred black by the flames, and hit by flak several times {{but managed to}} return <b>safely.</b> <b>In</b> all, 54 of the 177 {{aircraft}} involved in the raid were lost, along with 532 of the 1,725 crewmen. Although 42 percent of the refining capacity was destroyed, the Germans were able to soon restore production. The 44th Bombardment Group received a second Distinguished Unit Citation. For his part in that raid, Johnson was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver {{that he or she}} does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.|$|E
5|$|On 29 December 2000, British Airways Flight 2069 was {{en route}} from London to Nairobi when a mentally-ill {{passenger}} entered the cockpit and grabbed the controls. As the pilots struggled to remove the intruder, the Boeing 747-400 stalled twice and banked to 94 degrees. Several people on board were injured by the violent manoeuvres, which briefly caused the aircraft to descend at 30,000ft per minute. The man was finally restrained {{with the help of}} several passengers, and the co-pilot regained control of the aircraft. The flight landed <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> Nairobi.|$|E
5|$|The rest day was {{followed}} by the fourth day, which was abandoned due to persistent rain. Yardley declared {{at the start of the}} fifth day, leaving Australia a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire first session was lost. Young removed Johnson for six to leave Australia 10/1, but the tourists thereafter batted <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> a defensive manner to ensure a draw. They ended at 92/1 in 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, which was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series. The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test.|$|E

5|$|While {{searching for}} the convoy {{during the first week}} of June, Montagu's {{squadron}} became trapped between two French squadrons and was forced to sail southwards to avoid Villaret's returning fleet. As a result, the French Atlantic seaboard was clear of British forces for a significant period. The food convoy arrived <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> France in the third week of June, and Montagu returned to Britain empty-handed. Both nations claimed victory in the campaign; the British by virtue of success in the only major action, and the French through the intact arrival of their convoy.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Complaints lodged to the {{authorities}} against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579. He was replaced with his son Muhammad. Mansur died in 1580. According to Duwayhi, Muhammad was alleged by {{the authorities}} to {{have participated in the}} looting of an Istanbul-bound caravan from Egypt while it was passing through the Akkar and was consequently imprisoned in Istanbul. However, Ottoman sources mention that the caravan arrived <b>safely</b> <b>in</b> Istanbul and that the commander of the caravan, Ibrahim Pasha, backed by a 20,000-strong army, arrested Muhammad and Qurqumaz Ma'an while suppressing rebel activity in Mount Lebanon en route to Istanbul. About a year later, Muhammad was released and assigned the tax farm for Tripoli Eyalet's rural districts, not including Tripoli itself, which remained under Yusuf Sayfa. The Ottoman authorities were content with Muhammad's rule, but were vexed by the Maronites in his retinue.|$|E
