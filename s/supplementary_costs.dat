50|$|In {{a broader}} sense Marshall hoped to {{reconcile}} the classical and modern theories of value. John Stuart Mill had {{examined the relationship between}} the value of commodities and their production costs, on the theory that value depends on the effort expended in manufacture. Jevons and the Marginal Utility theorists had elaborated a theory of value based on the idea of maximising utility, holding that value depends on demand. Marshall's work used both these approaches, but he focused more on costs. He noted that, in the short run, supply cannot be changed and market value depends mainly on demand. In an intermediate time period, production can be expanded by existing facilities, such as buildings and machinery, but, since these do not require renewal within this intermediate period, their costs (called fixed, overhead, or <b>supplementary</b> <b>costs)</b> have little influence on the sale price of the product. Marshall pointed out that it is the prime or variable costs, which constantly recur, that influence the sale price most in this period. In a still longer period, machines and buildings wear out and have to be replaced, so that the sale price of the product must be high enough to cover such replacement costs. This classification of costs into fixed and variable and the emphasis given to the element of time probably represent one of Marshall's chief contributions to economic theory. He was committed to partial equilibrium models over general equilibrium {{on the grounds that the}} inherently dynamical nature of economics made the former more practically useful.|$|E

To investigate the question, a hypothetical $Z <b>supplementary</b> <b>cost</b> carrying currency is considered whose value is tethered to the retail value of kilo-watt-hours generated from benign renewable energy resources from host bioregions.

Furthermore, the history of transfusion points strongly to the clinical outcome value of products as the overriding driver of short-term manufacturing as well as its long-term development, lending support to the use of clinical consensus in the derivation of allocations.

Therefore, providing precise recommendations efficiently to many users {{in real time}} is imperative. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to CF to achieve such goal. SVD-based CF systems offer reliable and accurate predictions when they own large enough data. Data collected for CF purposes, however, might be split between different companies, even competing ones.

MethodsESPERA was a multicentre, observational, cross-sectional study conducted in France in 2010. A random sample of neurologists, including specialists in epilepsy, prospectively enrolled adults with focal epilepsy treated with a combination of AEDs. Investigators classified their patients according to the 2009 ILAE criteria for drug resistance and this classification was then reviewed by two experts. All items of healthcare resource use associated with epilepsy over the previous year were documented retrospectively and valued from a societal perspective. ResultsSeventy-one neurologists enrolled 405 patients. After experts’ review, 70. 6 % of patients were classified with drug-resistant epilepsy, 22. 4 % with drug-responsive epilepsy and 7 % with undefined epilepsy. The mean annual epilepsy-related direct costs per patient were € 4485 ±€ 4313 in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy compared to € 1926 ±€ 1795 in patients with drug-responsive epilepsy. In these two groups, costs of AEDs were estimated at € 2603 and € 1544, respectively. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy were more often hospitalised (mean annual cost: € 1270 vs. € 97) and underwent more additional tests (mean annual cost: € 194 vs. € 53). ConclusionThe direct cost of focal epilepsy in adults on AED combinations was estimated at € 3850 /patient/year.

The cases of the solid flame model and of the optically thin flame are considered as they are usually involved in fire propagation studies. It is shown that the solid flame model provides satisfactory results in some applications, but only for flames with sufficiently high optical thickness (above three at least). However, its inability to model the intensity distribution when shifting from the normal to the flame surface and its inaccuracy when addressing the case of low or even moderate optical thicknesses are two weaknesses that should be kept in mind when using this model. Regarding the optically thin flame model, it is demonstrated that its use should be restricted to really low optical thicknesses, far below one, which makes the application of such models quite unrealistic unless for small scale flames.

40|$|Competitiveness {{differentials}} are {{blamed for}} the instability of the Eurozone. Most of the analyses focus on labour costs or labour-market institutions. This paper explores an additional source of differentials in competitiveness: land and building prices. European countries, especially France, have experienced a significant rise in property prices {{since the beginning of}} the century. Germany is an exception. A large increase in the prices of buildings, structures and lands for private companies can be also observed in some countries. Higher prices impede firm competitiveness in at least two ways: a) investments are more costly; b) the increasing value of non-financial assets should translate into higher equity value and thus incite firms to increase dividends so as to preserve firm owners' direct remuneration. French national accounts provide rich information for exploring these mechanisms. We show that the nominal value of buildings, structures and land owned by non-financial corporations dramatically increased relative to their value added, well above their historical observations.

Rather, the emerging need for distribution and quick adaptation to new requirements stemming from, e. g., virtual enterprises, demands distributed systems that can be extended dynamically to compose new services from existing software components. However, usage of mobile code introduces specific security concerns which a security system must be aware of. We present a comprehensive security architecture for extensible, distributed systems using the example of an Internet query processing service which can be extended by user-defined operators. Before an operator is actually used in queries for the first time, our OperatorCheck server validates its semantics and analyzes its quality. This is done semi-automatically using an oracle-based approach to compare a formal specification of an operator against its implementation. Further security measures are integrated into the query processing engine: during plan distribution secure communication channels are established, authentication and authorization are performed, and overload situations are avoided by admission control. During plan execution operators are guarded using Java's security model to prevent unauthorized resource access and leakage of data. The resource consumption of operators is monitored and limited with reasonable <b>supplementary</b> <b>costs</b> to avoid resource monopolization. We show that the presented security system is capable of executing arbitrary operators without risks for the executing host and the privacy and integrity of data.

40|$|Measures {{are being}} {{developed}} and implemented enabling the co-existence of conventional, genetically modified (GM) and organic cropping systems. In order to segregate GM from conventional crops in the entire supply chain, a food or feed company has to reorganise its production. This may involve for dedication of the production line to non-GM, or production can be organised on the same plant, using spatial or temporal segregation. In practice, only the latter method {{is used in the}} feed industry, as no investments in new machinery are necessary in the case. The segregation and identity preservation of GM and non-GM crops has to be well organised. An important tools used to proof the identity of the imported raw materials is the batch or product declaration and in some cases, a supplementary certificate of analysis for the raw materials is provided. In compound feed production, specific procedures to reduce carry-over are introduced and described in a book of charge, such as rinsing of transportation and production line, empty declaration of transport systems or storage bins and specific discharge and production orders. All these measures however imply <b>supplementary</b> <b>costs</b> to the manufacturer. A major additional cost is the price difference between GM and non-GM raw materials. Other extra costs result from losses in flexibility, a devaluation of the rinsing product, analysis and audits. As a result, the cost of a compound feed using non-GM is higher than with GM. Benefits to the segregation measures are an increased gamut of products and an improved organisation and management of the production.

The principal impediment to proper planning of logging operations, training and supervision of forest workers, and the other components of RIL is apparently the belief {{on the part of}} loggers that these improvements are costly to implement. Although there are reasons to doubt that many forest managers and forest operators are fully aware of the costs of each component of their timber harvesting operations, it cannot be disputed that there are additional costs of implementing some aspects of RIL for some forest stakeholders over some time periods. It should therefore be useful to all parties concerned to disaggregate RIL into its components and to analyse {{the costs and benefits of}} each from different perspectives. For example, if timber harvesting companies only obtain a portion of the benefits of RIL, then from their perspective it may not be appropriate to pay all of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>costs</b> associated with implementing RIL practices.

40|$|International audienceDeveloping {{products}} that are properly suited to users' needs and preferences {{in order to be}} accepted {{is one of the main}} challenges designers and engineers face constantly. Evaluating and improving users' product acceptability has become an important research question. Many approaches leave the acceptability evaluation question for the last phases of the New Product Development process (NPD), when an almost finished prototype is available and when there is no time left for important modifications. In the early phase of the NPD process, the project managers need models and methods to evaluate the potential acceptability of the new concept and if required, to define actions to improve this concept. In this paper, a method with two main goals is proposed to tackle this problem. Its first goal consists in evaluating an index of users' product acceptability. When this index is too low, the second goal concerns the optimal selection of the most appropriate actions (improvement scenario) to increase this previously assessed index and to optimise the <b>supplementary</b> <b>cost.</b> As information collected from users in the early phase is subject to uncertainty, the proposed method exploits the inference properties of Bayesian networks making it possible to make useful estimations of the acceptability index. Furthermore, the improvement scenarios are composed of actions that make it possible to improve different criteria composing the users' acceptability index. The improvement problem is formulated as an optimisation problem to be solved by a simulated annealing algorithm. In order to illustrate its interest, the proposed method is applied to a real case concerning the design of a medical-stocking threading device...|$|R
