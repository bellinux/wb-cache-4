40|$|AbstractGamma {{emission}} tomography {{is a method}} based on gamma-ray spectroscopy and tomographic reconstruction techniques, {{which can be used}} for rod-wise characterization of nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies</b> without dismantling the fuel. By performing a large number of measurements of the gamma-ray flux intensity around a <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> using a well-collimated gamma-ray detector, the internal source distribution in the assembly may be reconstructed using tomographic algorithms. If a spectroscopic detection system is used, different gamma-ray emitting isotopes can be selected for analysis, enabling nondestructive fuel characterization with respect to a variety of fuel parameters. In this paper, we describe a novel gamma {{emission tomography}} instrument, which has been designed, constructed and tested at the Halden Boiling Water Reactor (HBWR). The device will be used to characterize <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies</b> irradiated in the HBWR as part of ongoing nuclear fuel research conducted within the OECD Halden Reactor Project (HRP). As compared to single-rod gamma scanning, where the fuel is dismantled and the gamma radiation from each rod is measured separately, handling time associated with characterizing the fuel can be significantly reduced when using the gamma emission tomography device. Furthermore, because gamma emission tomography enables rod-wise fuel characterization without dismantling, even instrumented experimental <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies</b> may be characterized repeatedly throughout the fuel’s lifetime, with limited risk of damaging the fuel or its instrumentation. Accordingly, the capabilities of fuel characterization within the OECD HRP are expected to be strongly enhanced by the deployment of this device. Here, the gamma-tomographic method and the experimental setup are demonstrated through experimental measurements of the <b>fuel</b> <b>stack</b> and gas plenum regions of a nine-rod HBWR <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> configuration, where four rods had a burnup of approximately 26 MWd/kgUO 2 and five rods had a burnup of approximately 50 MWd/kgUO 2.
