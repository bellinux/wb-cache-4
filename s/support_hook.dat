40|$|Accuracy of biaxial test {{equipment}} {{to examine the}} nonlinear mechanical behavior of thin sheet specimens of elastomeric materials has been hampered by lack of precise determination of the force distribution {{along the sides of}} the specimen. It has been necessary to use an effective width established by approximate means to obtain the stress from the overall force applied along the edges. To avoid this experimental difficulty, individual miniature proof-ring load cells utilizing semiconductor strain gages have been developed and applied to the <b>support</b> <b>hooks</b> for the thin sheet specimens. Typical results are shown for time-dependent stress distributions for all degrees of biaxiality. An accurate evaluation of the effective specimen width is now possible...|$|R

The packaging scripts <b>support</b> <b>hooks,</b> plugins, language modules, and modifications to REDCap core. Packages are built rapidly and consistently across any REDCap version. These packages {{are used to}} provision new REDCap instances or upgrade existing ones. Scripted upgrade processes integrate new code with existing code, manage all required database updates, and run post-deployment tests to verify the deployment. This toolset reduces variability between development, testing, and production environments. This in turn reduces error rates {{and the costs of}} upgrading REDCap instances...|$|R
50|$|The bowls {{are usually}} of thin beaten bronze, between 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) in diameter, and dished or cauldron-shaped in profile. Typically {{they have three}} {{decorative}} plates ('escutcheons') applied externally just below the rim to <b>support</b> <b>hooks</b> with rings, by which they were suspended. The ornament of these plates is often very sophisticated, {{and in many cases}} includes beautiful coloured enamel work, commonly in champlevé and using spiral motifs. Although their designs and manufacture are thought to proceed from Celtic technique, they are principally found in eastern Britain, and especially in the areas which received Anglo-Saxon acculturation. Their production is also evidenced in Pictish and Irish contexts, but they seem almost completely absent from Wales, Devon and Cornwall.|$|R
50|$|Bigbury Camp {{has been}} the focus of a {{significant}} amount of archaeological study. Digging at Bigbury has unearthed a number of iron artefacts including agricultural tools and kitchen untensils. In 1861, gravel diggers unearthed a quantity of corroded ironwork consisting of the remains of rods, rings and hooks together with triangular bricks arranged in a circle that displayed evidence of burning. At the time this was interpreted as a Roman-style hearth that had consisted of three iron legs <b>supporting</b> <b>hooks</b> and rings from which would have been suspended a cauldron. The total height of the apparatus would have been approximately 5 ft. A flint arrowhead was found nearby. The gravel diggers also found a large iron knife measuring 10.5 in, including the tang. Parts of a horses bridle were also recovered, including a snaffle bit with 3.25 in wide bridle rings.|$|R
50|$|The Ladderax System {{consists}} {{of a number of}} upright ladders, supporting shelves and cabinets.

30|$|SN Gorb states [1] that at {{the time}} of his writing, there were no {{commercial}} lightweight attachment mechanisms that exhibited a flexible base as he found in the case of G. aperine (multiple degrees-of-freedom). This can be expanded to include probabilistic and fields-of-hooks fasteners. Species he studied that <b>support</b> <b>hooks</b> were Agrimonia eupatoria, Circaea lutetiana, G. aperine and Geum urbanum. These hooks are not formed through the process of adaptive growth since they are single-use. They therefore must be genetically defined to occur in their shape. Interaction with the environment changes their qualities in a genetically predefined manner. The distinct difference between these hooks is the structures from which they arise; G. aperine hooks are stomatal in origin as are those of A. eupatoria and C. lutetiana while the hooks of G. urbanum arise from carpels. Only the hooks of A. minus arise from modified bracts encasing the ovary.|$|R

50|$|Perforated {{hardboard}} {{and similar}} systems {{are designed to}} <b>support</b> peg <b>hooks.</b> These are usually mounted by hand and support themselves with gravity alone, though some systems use screws instead. These screws can be supported by additional straps to prevent the metal from bending under a significant load. The hooks in turn act as storage {{for a variety of}} objects such as tools and keys. Heavy duty metal systems can support the heaviest objects, such as push lawnmowers and vertically stored bicycles.|$|R

In March, Great White embarked on their first tour of Japan. They returned to the United States for the Memorial Day weekend festival dubbed The World Series of Rock, which featured Whitesnake, Skid Row, Bad English, and Hericane Alice. Great White recorded two more albums for Capitol Records, Hooked, which was certified gold, and Psycho City. In <b>support</b> of <b>Hooked,</b> Great White did a tour as opener for the German metal band Scorpions and traveled to Europe and Japan. During this tour Mark Kendall was hospitalized for a hiatal hernia for 3 weeks and then returned. Guitarist Al Pitrelli was asked to fill in for Mark during his absence. Psycho City {{was followed by a}} US tour with Kiss.|$|R
60|$|The {{ceiling was}} high, {{and light and}} air were {{admitted}} by gratings placed at the top, letting onto the bastion of the roof, where {{they could not be}} observed by those below. The gratings were covered by projections that kept out the rain and dew. On the floor was a thick carpet, somewhat musty and dusty now, and at the far end was placed a couch with silken curtains. This was still piled high with bedding and pillows and was boxed in, the full width of the passage, with elaborately carved woods. Upholstered seats, rather narrow but long and quite comfortable, were built against the wall and supported by richly carved frames of ebony and panels of cherry. There were pictures upon the walls; oil paintings of quite good quality. A sort of wall-cabinet and some small brackets <b>supported</b> numerous <b>hooks,</b> ornaments, and several boxes of metal and sandalwood, which last Mildred eyed expectantly but had now no leisure to examine.|$|R
25|$|Adult blue monkey beetles are {{typically}} found grouped in the centres of unscented flowers that bear dark discs and bright petals with spot patterns at the bases. They {{feed on the}} pollen, embedding their heads into the discs and browsing, and sometimes <b>supporting</b> themselves by <b>hooking</b> their hind tarsal claws onto the flower petals. Pollen is swept into the mouth by dense setae on the maxillae. The behavioural tendency to congregate is for mating purposes, and {{it is suggested that}} male beetles prefer dark-centred flowers with spot patterns because they mistake the glossy discs and bright spots for resting females.|$|R
50|$|A typical myzostomid has a flattened, rounded shape, {{with a thin}} edge {{drawn out}} into {{delicate}} radiating hairs called cirri. The dorsal surface is smooth, with five pairs of parapodia on the bottom surface. These parapodia are armed with <b>supporting</b> and <b>hooked</b> setae, by means of which the worm adheres to its host. Beyond the parapodia are four pairs of organs, often called suckers. These organs are probably of sensory nature, and are comparable to the lateral sense organs of capitellids. The mouth and cloacal opening are generally {{at opposite ends of}} the bottom surface. The former leads to a protrusible pharynx, from which the esophagus opens into a wide intestinal chamber with branching lateral diverticula. There appears to be no vascular system. The nervous system consists of a circumoesophageal nerve, with scarcely differentiated brain, joining below a large ganglionic mass, no doubt representing many fused ganglia. The dorsoventral and the parapodial muscles are much developed, while the coelom is reduced mostly to branched spaces in which the genital products ripen.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} ended hostilities {{during the}} Hook and Cod {{wars in the}} County of Holland, between the <b>Hooks,</b> <b>supported</b> by England and the Cods supported by the county of Flanders.

Moreover, should Jacqueline perish without any offspring to succeed her, Philip the Good would be declared the heir to the throne of the Counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut.Furthermore, Jacqueline was forbidden to remarry without the consent of Philip.|$|R
40|$|Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapiae parasites were {{collected}} from the intestines of 300 fish belonging to three tilapia species sourced at the River Nile, Giza, Egypt. The proboscis of the parasite was characterized by three rows of hooks that curved towards the posterior of the body. The first row is <b>supported</b> by unmodified <b>hooks.</b> The parasite tegument has a series of alternative folds {{and a large number}} of pores. Sensory ganglia are located {{on the surface of the}} proboscis and body. Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapiae provokes an aggressive host response indicated by hyperplasia of the intestinal goblet cells and focal eosinophil infiltrations.

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of {{the sensory}} 'hook-like' structures {{on the arm}} spines and tentacle scales of the brittlestar Ophiocomina nigra are described. Sensory hooks are shown to be cuticle covered epidermal projections structurally composed of two monociliated sensory cells surrounded by <b>support</b> cells. These <b>hooks</b> are located exclusively in the proximal third of the spines and on the tentacle scales. It is suggested that these hooks {{may be responsible for}} monitoring the depth of mucus on the spines and initiating a spine cleaning reaction in the podia. This possible function is considered {{within the context of the}} spines being responsible for mucus production for both mucus net feeding and as part of a defensive reaction...|$|R

40|$|The twin hook {{has been}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative to}} the conventional lag screw to be combined with a barrelled side-plate in the treatment of trochanteric hip fractures. With two oppositely directed apical hooks introduced into the subchondral bone of the femoral head, the twin hook provides different stabilising properties to the lag screw. The femoral head purchase of the twin hook and the lag screw were compared in a biomechanical study using artificial cancellous bone, and responses to axial and torsional loading was determined. A distinct yield point in load and torque was noted for the lag screw, representing failure of the laminas supporting the threads. For the twin hook, gradual increase of load and torque occurred during impaction of the bone <b>supporting</b> the <b>hooks.</b> The peak loads and torques were higher for the lag screw, but were similar for both devices after 8 rum deformation. The stiffness was higher for the lag screw, but in counter-clockwise rotation the stiffness for the lag screw was negligible. The twin hook appeared to provide fixation stability comparable to that offered by the lag screw, but with conceivable advantages in terms of a deformation response involving bone impaction and gradually increasing stability...|$|R
50|$|In {{using the}} {{pointing}} machine, the sculptor mounts or glues three metal rivets, {{that correspond to}} each other, on both model and block of stone or wood. To these basic points, a (usually wooden) T-shaped <b>support</b> is <b>hooked</b> up, the cross. On this crosswood, the actual pointing device is attached. The sculptor sets the device by moving {{the arms of the}} tool so that the point of the needle just touches the point to be measured on the model (for instance, the nose of a bust). The needle is set at a right angle to the surface that is measured and the stop is tightened.The sculptor then takes the whole cross, pointing machine and all, to the block of stone or wood and sets it up on the identical, corresponding basic points. The needle that defines the measuring point can slide. By subsequently carving or drilling carefully until the needle touches the stop, the sculptor can place their measuring point exactly in the block.By thus copying several dozens or hundreds of points, an accurate copy can be carved. The quality of the copy will still depend on the skill of the sculptor, however, because these points are only the basis for the final sculpture.|$|R
50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung {{on a wire rack}} connected to tracks that are suspended from channels on the floor and ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or <b>supported</b> by <b>hooks</b> attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R
40|$|Dark-grown {{dicotyledonous}} seedlings form a hook-like structure {{at the top}} of the hypocotyl, {{which is}} controlled by the hormones auxin and ethylene. Hook formation is dependent on an auxin signal gradient, whereas hook exaggeration is part of the triple response provoked by ethylene in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. Several other hormones and light are also known to be involved in hook development, but the molecular mechanisms that lead to the initial installation of an auxin gradient are still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to unravel the cross-talk between auxin and ethylene in the apical hook. Auxin measurements, the expression pattern of the auxin reporter DR 5 ::GUS and the localization of auxin biosynthesis enzymes and influx carriers collectively indicate the necessity for auxin biosynthesis and efficient auxin translocation from the cotyledons and meristem into the hypocotyl in order to <b>support</b> proper <b>hook</b> development. Auxin accumulation in the meristem and cotyledons and in the hypocotyl is increased similar to 2 -fold upon treatment with ethylene. In addition, a strong ethylene signal leads to enhanced auxin biosynthesis at the inner side of the hook. Finally, mutant analysis demonstrates that the auxin influx carrier LAX 3 is indispensable for proper hook formation, whereas the auxin influx carrier AUX 1 is involved in the hook exaggeration phenotype induced by ethylene...|$|R
