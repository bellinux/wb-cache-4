One solution to reducing the amount of insecticides sprayed on the crops is mechanical exclusion, which is a method of using a material to cover the crops row and prevent beetles from gaining access to the plants. The {{purpose of this study was}} to better understand the production of cucurbit crops, growth efficiency, major factors affecting growth, and markets for various cucurbits. The materials used in this study were published research data, public extension data, and market data.

Dr. Standish was a <b>horticulture</b> <b>specialist</b> and oversawpersonally the plantings of 122 trees and 115 shrubs. He was involved {{with the establishment of}} the Galesburg Horticultural Society in 1873 and the Park Commission Board in 1876. He helped shape the policy of the park and transformed it into a park of exceeding beauty, available for visitors from near and far. He nurtured the park until his death in 1919. In 2003, Standish Park was designated an Arboretum by the Galesburg City Council. In the 1950’s, Knox College classes in advanced taxonomy re-identified and tagged trees. In the 1970’s, the Ray Brown Restoration Project set out to identify original trees and shrubs. They planted 37 trees and 6 shrubs in addition to their inventory work. In 1989, the SPRUCE committee (Standish Park Restoration Undertaking with Creative Enthusiasm) formed to replant and nurture Standish Park. As a result of their work, 38 trees and 3 shrubs were planted. In 2003, University of Illinois Extension Master Gardener volunteers re-identified the current inventory of trees and shrubs in Standish Park Arboretum. Subsequently, the inventory was also re-tagged and efforts are underway to encourage more visitors to the Arboretum.|$|R

40|$|Farmland {{biodiversity}} is {{an important}} component of Europe?s biodiversity. More than half the continent is occupied by agricultural lands. They host specific habitats and species, which ? in addition to their conservation values they provide ? perform vital ecological functions. Indicators are needed to enable the monitoring of biodiversity at the farm level for the purpose of assessing the impacts of farming practices and of agricultural policies. Our research aims at identifying farmland biodiversity indicators which are scientifically sound, operational and relevant for stakeholders. We screened the literature for farmland biodiversity indicators and, in an iterative process with stakeholders, we identified 28 candidate indicators for genetic, species and habitat diversity. Those selected biodiversity indicators, as well as 14 management indicators that are known to relate to biodiversity, were assessed in 12 case study regions across Europe. Each case study region represents a typical production system (i. e. <b>specialist</b> field crops, <b>horticulture</b> and permanent crops; specialist grazing with cattle and other livestock types; mixed crop and livestock farming). In each region, 8 ? 20 farms were randomly selected, mostly within the two groups of organic and non-organic farms, to obtain a gradient of farming intensity. Indicators were measured applying standardized sampling procedures and farm interviews. Sampling effort was recorded in order to assess the cost of indicator measurement. For each case study region, biodiversity indicators are presently being evaluated in conjunction with management indicators. Surrogate indicators will be proposed when possible and indicators will be prioritized taking into account their validity, practicality, cost and priority for stakeholders. Based on preliminary results, the presentation will focus on the specific challenges of farm level monitoring, addressing issues of sampling design within the farms and up-scaling from plot to farm to region.

40|$|While {{the winter}} {{landscape}} sleeps {{in shades of}} gray and brown, gardeners dream in the colors of spring [...] lush green foliage and the vibrant pinks, blues, oranges, yellows, and reds of blossoms. It will be awhile before gardeners can dig in the dirt but already some gardening trends are emerging: landscape sustainability, native plants in home landscapes, container gardening, and increased interest in vegetable gardening. And this spring, just as in any other year, nurseries will sprout new varieties. One of the biggest trends is increasing interest in vegetable gardening, said Dale Lindgren, horticulturist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln West Central Research and Extension Center in North Platte. Last year, vegetable plant sales were up 10 - 15 percent and that trend is expected to continue. Vegetable gardening is becoming more appealing as people try to save money {{at the grocery store}} during these tough economic times. Some gardeners are focused on food safety and believe that food they grow themselves is safer, which is related to the burgeoning interest in organically grown food, Lindgren said. 2 ̆ 2 Last year, {{we got a lot of}} questions about local food, and I think we 2 ̆ 7 ll see that again, 2 ̆ 2 said Kim Todd, UNL landscape <b>horticulture</b> <b>specialist</b> and 2 ̆ 2 Backyard Farmer 2 ̆ 2 host. 2 ̆ 2 There are a lot of people who want to grow at least a little bit of their own food, and more people are intrigued with edible woody plants such as apples and apricots. 2 ̆ 2 In the last few years, interest in heirloom vegetables and flowers also is on the upswing. Old-fashioned flowers, such as hollyhocks, are receiving more attention because they don 2 ̆ 7 t require much water. Heirloom vegetables, particularly tomatoes, are grown for their flavor, Lindgren said. Another trend is blended gardens, which include both edible ornamental vegetables and flowering plants. Vegetables such as colorful peppers and eggplant can provide visual pleasure as well as food. This can be a good option if garden space is limited, he said. 2 ̆ 2 One of the overall garden trends is landscape sustainability, which means the landscape is one that we can take care of without harming the environment, 2 ̆ 2 said Sarah Browning, UNL Extension educator...|$|R
40|$|Horticultural crops {{for export}} Cue: Kenya {{is well known}} as one of the major African {{suppliers}} of fruit, vegetables and flowers to European markets. In January this year, a group of European buyers, including some of the big supermarkets, introduced a new set of standards for horticultural produce. Called Eurepgap, the standards require all suppliers to grow their produce in accordance with strict rules - and to be able to prove that they have done so. Failure to meet the standards could mean that a buyer will refuse to accept the produce, potentially a big loss of income for the farmer. So growing for export markets remains a challenging business, not least for small-scale farmers. To find out how farmers are coping, and to learn about the support offered by the agricultural extension services in Kenya, Eric Kadenge recently visited two farms close to Nairobi. He also spoke to an extension officer who has been helping both farmers with their production and their marketing. IN:		?My name is Bernard Ngoi? OUT:		? alongside their food crops. ? DUR?N		 7 ? 55 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sarah Ndegwa concluding that while growing horticultural crops for export is a demanding activity, it can also be financially rewarding. Transcript Ngoi:	My name is Bernard Ngoi. I plant French beans, baby corns and maize for eating. Kadenge:	Do you also plant the French beans for eating? Ngoi:	No I plant French beans for selling. Kadenge:	Right now we are in your farm and I can see that you are busy as well as your colleagues here. What is happening, what are you doing? Ngoi:	Now we are preparing to plant some French beans. Kadenge:	Why did you decide to grow French beans for sale? Ngoi:	It is the crop for which I can get money easily, because we use one and a half months to get money. Kadenge:	What are some of the biggest challenges you face with this crop? Ngoi:	Sometimes when we have no fertilizers or the money where we can get it, it is difficult for us, because if you plant without fertilizer or manure it cannot do well. Also we use some labourers but we give them 120 /- per half day. Sometimes we use a machine for pumping some water. So sometimes we get loss instead of profit. Kadenge:	Why do you have to use labourers? Ngoi:	It is because if we use cows we cannot prepare well, so as to make the French beans grow well. Kadenge:	And you've mentioned that you also have to use a water pump to pump water. Where do you get this water from? Is it from that river ahead of us? Ngoi:	We get water from this river, you can see. Also we built a gabion here - you can see it. And we were helped by local government. We can use it and plant more and we can get money. Kadenge:	Now the level of the water here is very, very low. Is this what usually happens or are there times when you have a lot of water here that it actually flows like a big river? Ngoi:	Yes, in December, January to May it flows very much, and there is plenty of water here. Kadenge:	Other than the problems of pumping water and the cost of production of French beans, what other difficulties do you face in terms of growing French beans? Ngoi:	Sometimes there is some limit in marketing. And if we plant and it is not carried, we lose some kgs (kilograms). Kadenge:	So they are very perishable. They have to get to the market quickly. And how do you carry them from your farm to the market? Ngoi:	We use wheel-barrows to carry these to our nearest market, so it can be carried by the agent to send it to Machakos or Nairobi. SFX	Car stopping, door closing. Kadenge:	We have just arrived at Mr Katumbo's farm. He grows all kinds of fruits but what you can see most as you enter his farm are the mango trees and as you shall discover he has more than five different varieties of mango trees that he grows here. Katumbo:	I am Peter Mutisya Katumbo. I am a horticultural farmer. I grow a variety of mango fruits, oranges, tangerines, tomatoes and also some paw paws. Kadenge:	Of all the crops that you have mentioned, what do you grow most? Katumbo:	Mangoes. I've got about more than 10 mango varieties. Kadenge:	OK. Let?s move closer to this heap of mangoes here. What are they doing here - why are they heaped here? Katumbo:	We are going to ferry these to Nairobi for marketing. Kadenge:	So why don?t we take a walk to the farm and then continue to discuss a little bit more about your mango farming? SFX	Footsteps. Kadenge:	So we are standing just next to one of the mango trees here that seems to be very, very heavy with fruit. Now this is what variety? Katumbo:	This is called Kent. Kadenge:	Now why did you decide to grow mangoes? Katumbo:	I would say I was looking for a crop which can give good returns. This appears to be the only cash crop that can do well here. Kadenge:	Are there any challenges that you face as you bring up these mango trees? Katumbo:	Yeah there are all sorts of challenges. You find various diseases attacking the crop. Spraying of chemicals is very necessary. The required chemicals, for example fungicides. To export mangoes to Europe has become somewhat a big problem, because now we have newly-introduced conditions by EUREPGAP. Kadenge:	Now what word would you have for somebody that is thinking of growing mangoes? Katumbo:	I would like to tell him that growing mangoes should be taken seriously. It seems as though it is the only viable cash crop in this area. Kadenge:	So thank you very much for taking us around your farm and we've enjoyed talking about the various fruits especially about mangoes. SFX	Car stopping. Ndegwa:	My name is Sarah Ndegwa, I am a <b>specialist</b> in <b>horticulture,</b> and I am doing extension work for the Machakos district. I give guidance on production and after production we link the farmers to the market. Kadenge:	We have just visited two of the farmers you work with. One was a French bean farmer and the other one is this mango farmer. Let?s start with French beans. What are the conditions necessary for the cultivation of French beans? Ndegwa:	Generally what is required in almost all of the crops is record keeping. Because you need to know: time of planting, time of spraying, and what chemicals you sprayed, the dosage, the quantity, source of seed, for example - where you bought the seed from. So the farmers have to record every step of their activity, and this also helps in the traceability and also the expected time of harvesting. Each crop has its own chemicals. We do give a spray programme for each crop. And the chemicals depend on the time, the stage of the product. Because let?s say you are harvesting: you need to use chemicals that have a short post harvest interval, like one day or two days. The same thing with mangoes. If you are harvesting, at harvesting stage we actually discourage spraying at harvesting stage for mangoes. So most of the chemicals for mangoes you start when they are flowering. Kadenge:	One of the things that the two farmers have mentioned has been accessibility to the market and the exploitation by middlemen. Is this something that you are able to address, as a horticultural development agency? Ndegwa:	We are working very hard on this because we have been helping the farmers on production and they have managed to do good quality produce. We have a list of exporters that we have approached, and local markets also. So we are trying to link them with the farmer. Like this mango farmer; we just brought an exporter to him and he bought his mangoes and he bought even from the farmers around here. He is able to collect from the farm and pay them on the farm. And the same case with the French bean farmers. We are linking them with a buyer. That way the middlemen issue is being tackled; but only for those farmers we are working with. Kadenge:	But since these are high value crops, are you seeing a difference? Do they change the lives of the farmers here, who may not have been making much from the usual subsistence farming of maize and beans? Ndegwa:	Over the four years that I have been in extension work I have seen horticultural farming making a difference in farmers? lives. They are able to pay their school fees and meet other small expenses, because they are doing their horticultural farming as a cash crop alongside their food crops. End of track. Eric Kadenge talks to a French bean farmer and a mango farmer, and the extension worker who has been helping them, for example with record-keeping...|$|R
