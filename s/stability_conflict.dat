40|$|Community-based {{management}} is increasingly {{viewed as the}} most appropriate arrangement for promoting sustainable development of natural resources. A common assumption is that the values of community members, often assumed to be homogeneous, foster successful outcomes. However, analysts often treat these values and their homogeneity as exogenous factors, ignoring the community's potential role in managing members ' values. This study of community-based forest management in two southern Indiana sites examines how {{the members of the}} two communities created institutions to screen, maintain, and defend their values. Analysis reveals that different institutions shaped members ' preferences and led to different levels of community <b>stability,</b> <b>conflict</b> management, and natural resource condition. We argue that understanding community-based management processes and outcomes requires careful attention to how institutions facilitate or hamper the construction of community members ' values.

40|$|Teaching and Learning Department Capstone projectCurrent {{education}} practice puts little {{focus on}} conflict resolution strategies. This essay argues that, {{in light of}} the inevitability of conflict both in the classroom and in our society, teachers must teach students how to handle conflict constructively. Students will learn something each time they encounter conflict, and {{it is the responsibility of}} the teacher to make sure they learn something positive. This essay challenges typical views of conflict as negative. It investigates why and how conflict resolution strategies should be implemented in an elementary classroom in light of four major areas of educational practices: learners and learning, learning environment, curriculum and teaching strategies, and assessment. In the area of learners and learning, teachers must keep in mind a number of things when teaching conflict resolution. First, students learn best when they can actively construct meaning for themselves, so conflict resolution should not always look like the teacher solving the problem. Second, teachers must equip learners to do what we ask them to do. Third, teachers must make conflict resolution culturally relevant to all students. The learning environment must be one in which students feel safe. It must cater to students' need for consistency and <b>stability.</b> <b>Conflict</b> resolution must be interwoven into the fabric of the classroom. It is more of a worldview and a philosophy than a list of steps to take in the face of conflict. While there are a myriad of specific conflict resolution strategies, the most successful ones share important characteristics. Assessing conflict resolution strategies, while difficult, is of utmost importance. The teacher must use a variety of assessment tools, and the assessments must drive further instruction. Finally, this essay explains in detail the implications for teaching conflict resolution in an elementary classroom.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} debate surrounding both the opportunities {{and the challenges}} arising from European monetary union. It is organised in two parts. Part I examines the economic environment in EMU, analysing the role of markets and the macro-economic framework. It finds that the prospect of EMU has already succeeded in creating a stable macro-economic environment, but that structural reforms aimed at better functioning markets take more time to be implemented and to produce results. Part II investigates the issue of adjustment in EMU in response to macro-economic disturbances, exploring the potential contribution of market mechanisms and macro-economic policies for coping with country-specific shocks. It finds that the new macro-economic framework will soon enable automatic stabilisers to operate better than in the recent past, but that it may take longer for market mechanisms to play their full part. II/ 0452 / 97 -ENEconomic Policy in EMU. Part B. Specific Topics. Â (ECONOMIC PAPERS. No. 125. November 1997. European Commission. Brussels. 187 p. Tabl. Graph. Bibliogr. Free.) This paper explores a number of policy issues deriving from Economic and Monetary Union: - Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate; - Budgetary Policy; - Shocks and Market Adjustment; - Real and Nominal Convergence. II/ 0453 / 97 -ENOn January 1 st 1999, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will move to its third and final stage. The exchange rates between the parties will be locked irrevocably and the euro will be introduced. The responsibility for monetary policy in the participating countries will be entrusted to the newly-created European Central Bank. European monetary union must be understood as comprising two separate, but complementary facets: a single currency, and a stable currency. These two facets correspond to the two interrelated objectives of EMU: efficiency and stability. The commitment by national public authorities to meet {{the terms of the}} Treaty on European Union for creating EMU is already bearing important fruit in terms of stability: in the past several years, the convergence towards low inflation has been spectacular and, although more efforts are in order, budget deficits have been substantially reduced. This has resulted in more stable nominal exchange rates and lower long term interest rates, thus paving the way to the current economic recovery. Although EMU represents first and foremost a monetary reform, its implications are much wider. The construction of EMU is geared towards the stability of the new currency, and sound public finances. Together with a well-functioning Single Market, this new policy regime is bound to bring about a new economic environment with fundamental consequences for the behaviour of public and private agents. The gradual elimination of budget deficits, as provided for by the Stability and Growth Pact, implies that government debt, currently still at too high levels, will be set on a consistently downward path. This will have beneficial consequences for interest rates and private investment, help restructuring public expenditure by giving more weight to growth-enhancing factors (such as investment in education and infrastructure), and raise the room for manoeuvre of national budgetary policies in stabilising the cycle. Budgetary discipline will also imply a new, fairer contract between the current and the next generation which will not have to shoulder the burden of today's spending choices. In total, with the change brought about by the EMU regime, the risk of a new <b>stability</b> <b>conflict</b> between the monetary and budgetary policies, which in the past repeatedly contributed to the unsatisfactory growth and employment performance of the Community, could be avoided in the coming years. Private agents, as consumers and producers, will not only benefit from lower transaction costs and simplification entailed by the replacement of multiple national currencies by the euro, but will also see their spectrum of choice broadened. The euro will strengthen the effects of the Single Market due to higher price transparency and greater competition. The relationship between factors of production will also undergo important changes. It will become apparent that if prices and wages are inconsistent with macroeconomic stability and with the Single Market rules, {{there will not be a}} â€œbail outâ€ by public authorities - be it in the form of budgetary handout, looser monetary policy or â€œdefensiveâ€ industrial policies. To the extent that wage and price behaviour anticipate this constraint, EMU will lead to a greater efficiency and higher employment. The changes in behaviour on the part of public authorities and private agents in the new EMU regime are desirable per se, as a means of tackling the structural problems faced by Europe, namely the high and structural unemployment and the budgetary consequences of ageing. Hence EMU acts as a catalyst of changes which would have to take place anyhow to shift the European economies on a path of sustainable growth and high employment. By definition, EMU implies the loss of national monetary autonomy. One of the criticisms often levied against the EMU project is that member countries will not be able to respond to economic disturbances via changes in national monetary policy or in their nominal exchange rate. It is then alleged that negative shocks will result in a surge of unemployment. In reality, the exchange rate, being a â€œnationalâ€ instrument - in that it changes the whole set of domestic prices vis-Ã -vis third countries - is potentially appropriate only in a narrow set of circumstances, namely in the event of shocks affecting the entire national economy and only that economy. If the shock only effects a particular region or sector, a devaluation would lead to over-heating in other parts of the economy. Mutatis mutandis, the same can be said of monetary policy. Shocks that are truly national are already relatively infrequent. And they will become even more so once EMU is in place: The stability-oriented macroeconomic framework will reduce the likelihood of policy-induced shocks (such as disturbances originating in reckless fiscal behaviour), which in the past have been an important source of country-specific shocks. Moreover, the increasing trade interdependence among EMU members will further blur the economic importance of national boundaries, thereby reducing national specificity of economic developments. Admittedly, in those circumstances in which a change in the exchange rate or national monetary policy would have been useful, alternative adjustment channels will have to be provided for in EMU. At the macroeconomic level, a rapid reduction of deficits below the 3 % threshold will create sufficient room for automatic fiscal stabilisers to offset cyclical downturns. Where structural adjustment, rather than mere macro-economic stabilisation is called for, changes in prices and wages will be needed. This requires that product and labour markets operate with greater flexibility. In conclusion, EMU offers important opportunities for better allocation of resources, higher growth and higher employment, but also challenges of completing the necessary budgetary consolidation and stepping up the reforms in product and labour markets. Meeting these challenges will ensure not only the full success of EMU, but will also help in solving Europe's structural problems. macroeconomic policy coordination, emu...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper proposes an {{approach}} to discover conflicting data in a training set for neural-networkbased transient stability classification of power systems. The conflicting data or inconsistent cases here denote the cases belonging to one class but lying in the regions occupied by another class in the numeric feature space of transient stability classification. Misclassifications usually occur due {{to the presence of}} conflicting data. Through defining a group of hyper-cubic regions, the conflicting data is found by direct class-region analysis with continuous numeric features and without feature discretization. The ratio of the conflicting data to all the training data indicates the separability of the feature space in which the training data set is embedded. The numerical results presented show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for discovering the conflicting data of transient stability classification.

40|$|Background. Research {{repeatedly}} showed young children’s {{aggressive behaviour}} to predict relationship difficulties with the teacher. Aims. To examine a possible mediating variable {{in this process}} and in the stability of relationship difficulties across the school year, namely teacher perceived control over child behaviour. Sample. The sample consisted of 139 Belgian kindergartners and their teachers. Method. Data were collected throughout kindergarten at three measurement occasions: Children’s aggressive behaviour was measured {{by means of a}} peer nomination procedure during the first trimester, teacher perceived control over child behaviour was assessed by means of a teacher questionnaire during the second trimester, and teacher-child conflict was measured by means of a teacher questionnaire during the first and third trimester. Correlations among all study variables were calculated and different models were estimated and compared by means of structural equation modeling. Results. Teacher perceived control completely mediated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and teacher-child conflict (after controlling for the concurrent association between aggressive behaviour and <b>conflict,</b> and the <b>stability</b> of <b>conflict).</b> In addition, teacher perceived control accounted for part of the <b>stability</b> in <b>conflict</b> across the school year.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the factors}} that determine the provision of stability in peacekeeping operations and the peacekeeping operations of the African Union (AU). It makes theoretical and empirical contributions, and supports {{the claim that the}} AU has been effective in peacekeeping. Theoretically, this study offers a comprehensive list of factors drawn from extant peace literature which influence peace operations meeting the basic objective of protecting lives and keeping areas stable. Beyond the majorly discussed factors of contingent size, funding, international collaboration, local participation, mandate and peacekeeper training, this study also examines issues of domestic political elite, field leadership, force integrity, impartiality, international political will, lead state, local women participation, size and resources of territory and timing. In bringing these factors together, this study expands the peacekeeping debate on what matters for <b>stability</b> in <b>conflict</b> areas. Empirically, using the peace support operations (PSO) of the AU, this study identifies those factors most and least significant for the provision of <b>stability</b> in <b>conflict</b> areas and ranks them based on their impact. Contrary to extant peace literature where mandate, funding, international collaboration, local initiative and size of the contingent {{are at the heart of}} creating <b>stability</b> in <b>conflict</b> areas, this study advocates the indispensability of domestic elite cooperation, local initiative and international political will. These were the only factors consistent in all successful AU PSO’s. Conversely, where any of these three factors were lacking, the AU missions failed. This study therefore argues that these three factors are central to the provision of stability in peace operations in the short term. The short term method of evaluation which revolves around the cessation of violence and provision of security is adopted as the standard for peacekeeping’s effectiveness. This is because the AU often leaves peacebuilding which is evaluated over the long term to the United Nations (UN). So, having achieved stability in four of its six peace operations, this study concludes that the AU has been fairly effective as Africa’s chief peacekeeper. Other findings exhumed by this study include the necessity of force integrity to large contingents, and the need for a lead state if missions are to succeed in complex theatres demanding prolonged operations...|$|R
