40|$|Introduction. Black plum (Vitex doniana) is an {{indigenous}} fruit tree species {{important for the}} livelihoods of rural populations. Currently, there is renewed national and international interest in black plum, and it {{has emerged as a}} priority species for domestication in Africa. The present work addressed farmers' indigenous knowledge of the use and management of the species among different <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups</b> in Benin, taking into account gender differences. The specific objective of this work was to study the knowledge, uses, local gathering practices and management systems of V. doniana {{that are part of the}} traditions of the communities in Southern Benin. Materials and methods. A total of 150 participants randomly selected from three <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups</b> provided survey responses. Information collected mainly referred to the motivation of respondents to conserve black plum trees on their land, the local uses and the management practices to improve the regeneration and production of the black plum. Results and discussion. The study showed that knowledge of black plum is well distributed in the community. However, people have different interests in using black plum and there is variable knowledge of use and management practices. The food and medicinal categories were the most important uses. There were no significant differences in knowledge of the management and utility of black plum between men and women, or across <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups.</b> Conclusion. Given its value to the communities in southern Benin, black plum should be prioritized for domestication...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to study production, vending, and consumption of kenkey, a sour dumpling in Ghana. Information was obtained on the socio-cultural profile of the actors, processing technologies, practices which adversely affected product quality, shelf life, and quality attributes important to consumers. Kenkey production and retailing was the domain of women, and carried out mainly as a family business in home-based operations. Three types of kenkey were encountered: Ga-, Fanti-, and nsiho-kenkey. Production was dominated by the Ga and Fanti <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups</b> but consumption cut across all <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups.</b> The majority of producers processed 10 - 100 kg of maize per week but frequency of production varied from 1 to 10 times in a week. Unit operations in kenkey production were labour intensive and manually carried out apart from milling. The texture of kenkey was more critical to most consumers than taste and depended on a procedure called aflatalization yielding a product with a semi-sticky, elastic consistency.

50|$|Recently {{theorists have}} {{recognized}} a natural affinity between situated cognition, New Literacy Studies and new literacies research (Gee, 2010).

50|$|Cultural Norm Manners - {{typically}} demonstrate one’s identity {{within a}} specific <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>group.</b> Adherence to cultural norm manners allows for the demarcation of socio-cultural identities {{and the creation of}} boundaries which inform who is to be trusted or who is to be deemed as ‘other’. Cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation and routinisation of ‘the familiar’ and through exposure to ‘otherness’ or those who are identified as foreign or different. Transgressions and non-adherence to cultural norm manners commonly result in alienation. Cultural norms, by their very nature, have a high level of between-group variability but are likely to be common to all those who identify with a given group identity.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} whether certain configurations of management controls dominate in certain societies (socio-cultural contexts) and whether the effectiveness of a given archetype of management control systems (MCSs) varies depending on the socio-cultural setting-the society-in which it operates. The study focuses on three <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups</b> and the corresponding institutional contexts (an Anglo-Saxon group, a Central European group, and a Northern European group) and three MCS archetypes (delegated bureaucratic control, delegated output control, and programmable output control). We use unique data from a cross-national, interview-based survey encompassing 610 strategic business units from nine countries (seven European countries plus Canada and Australia). The idea that firms tend to adapt MCSs to the socio-cultural context does not gain empirical support in this study. No significant differences in the distribution of MCSs between the three <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups</b> are noted. However, we do find that programmable output control has a more positive impact on effectiveness in Anglo-Saxon cultures, while delegated output control has a more positive impact on effectiveness in Northern Europe. Taken together these findings indicate that distinct differences between societies make a particular MCS design more appropriate in a given society, but where such differences are not dramatic (as in the present case), multiple MCS designs can be found in the same society...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{and compares}} conceptions or visions of “wilderness. ” To {{illustrate}} the differences, four different <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups</b> in Southern Bahia, Brazil {{in contrast to}} Northern Colorado were studied. A total of 80 people were surveyed and interviewed, 40 in Brazil and 40 in Colorado with 10 people from each socio-cultural group: university professors, university students, environmentalists, and family farmers. The objective {{of this research was}} to achieve a greater understanding of their perspectives on the human-nature relationship and the implications of these perceptions for environmental understanding and action. Through the compilation and analysis of the data, it is concluded that Northern (United States) and Southern (Brazil) Environmentalist distinctions begin to dissolve while similarities emerge between parallel <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>groups.</b> Brazilian farmers and a few United States professors and environmentalists were against preservation areas where no humans are allowed. These individuals did not separate humans from nature and also believed in the rights of native people to continue to live on their land. Some people separated humans and nature placing nature as more important because they often have positive definitions of “wilderness” contrasted to negative ones of “civilization. ” Certain individuals placed humans above nature, especially the U. S. farmers and a few students in Brazil and the U. S. Many individuals believed that humans and nature are the same thing. Most people agreed that education and cultural changes were needed to improve the human-nature relationship and these improvements should be made.

Contextual student modeling, {{also called}} {{cultural}} profiling or cultural modeling, {{refers to the}} process of building a computational representation of the cultural identity and background of a student.

In this paper, a new approach is proposed that uses additional dimensions, and incorporates combinations of dimension clusters to represent and quantify a students expression of <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>group</b> traits and preferences. The viability of this approach is demonstrated {{through the use of a}} prototype that collects dimension data and generates estimates of a students association with particu-lar socio-cultural groups in five categories. An evaluation of the prototype re-vealed that estimates were rated as reasonable and acceptable by students and confirms that the approach extends current efforts in the field of culturally-aware tutoring systems for modeling students cultural context...|$|E
