Two variations of this idea are illustrated.

The second approach is to apply the power transformation to the contingency ratios, that is the values in the table relative to expected values based on the marginals – this method converges to weighted log-ratio analysis, or the <b>spectral</b> <b>map.</b> Two applications are described: first, a matrix of population genetic data which is inherently two-dimensional, and second, a larger cross-tabulation with higher dimensionality, from a linguistic analysis of several books.

40|$|Safe and {{efficient}} intracellular delivery of genes or drugs {{is critically important}} in targeted cancer treatment and gene therapy applications. Ultrasound (US) has been demonstrated to alter the cell membrane permeability due to a biophysical mechanism (Sonoporation) and exploited as a promising non-invasive gene transfer method. The sonoporation process could induce the formation of transient pores without significantly affecting cell viability. This research is aimed at investigating some bioeffects due to Therapeutic Ultrasound (pulsed- 1 MHz) which could allow to enhance drugs or genes delivery in a non tumoral cell line. We have used the NIH- 3 T 3 cell line as model system and exposed it to US at two different distances from the source; {{the effects of this}} pulsed ultrasonic wave on cells were assessed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging analysis. This technique combined with a focal plane array (FPA) detector has been widely used to study the general biochemical changes in vitro; moreover, the development of FPA detectors and shortening of measurement times specifically for IR imaging, from several hours to few minutes, have made possible to image the distribution of molecular species in biological samples. We have also performed a cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay to reveal the presence or not of micronuclei (named Howell-Jolly bodies) formed during the cell division due to the DNA damage. The results of IR analysis combined with the cytogenetic analysis have shown that these experimental conditions can not cause DNA mutations in the NIH- 3 T 3 cell line.

For semigroups on general Banach spaces we prove an inequality between these bounds and we give {{a version of the}} spectral mapping theorem in terms of the new growth bound. For semigroups on Hilbert space we show that the bounds are equal and hence obtain new characterizations of asymptotically normcontinuous semigroups and semigroups norm-continuous for t ? 0 in terms of the resolvent of the infinitesimal generator. In the last section we prove that versions of the spectral mapping theorem holds for three different definitions of the essential spectrum and give nice relationships between the new growth bound and the essential growth bound of the semigroup. 1 Introduction Let T (t) be a C 0 -semigroup on a Banach space X with generator A.
