To determine whether <b>sludge</b> <b>compost</b> is suitable {{for use as a}} nursery substrate, some experiments were conducted. Reduction of the electrical conductivity (EC) value could improve seed germination in saturated extract from <b>sludge</b> <b>compost.</b> In addition, water elution and mixing dilution with raw soil were all shown to be able to alleviate saline inhibition on seed germination and seedling growth, including stem diameter, seedling height, and above-ground weight. Overall, salinity is a crucial problem when sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>compost</b> is reused as a nursery substrate, and some effective and convenient approaches to reduce salt should be served prior to its reuse.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of total {{temperature}} increase, normal dehydration, and maturity, the odor compositions of surface and internal piles in a well-run sewage sludge compost plant were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a liquid nitrogen cooling system and a portable odor detector. Approximately 80 types of substances were detected, including 2 volatile inorganic compounds, 4 sulfur organic compounds, 16 benzenes, 27 alkanes, 15 alkenes, and 19 halogenated compounds. Most pollutants were mainly produced in the mesophilic and pre-thermophilic periods. The sulfur volatile organic compounds contributed significantly to odor and should be controlled primarily. Treatment strategies {{should be based on}} the properties of sulfur organic compounds. Hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, ammonia, and carbon disulfide were selected as core indicators. Ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, dimethyl disulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethylbenzene, phenylpropane, and isopentane were designated as concentration indicators. Benzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, dimethylbenzene, dichloromethane, toluene, chlorobenzene, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, and ethylbenzene were selected as health indicators. According to the principle of odor pollution indicator selection, dimethyl disulfide was selected as an odor pollution indicator of sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>composting.</b> Monitoring dimethyl disulfide provides a highly scientific method for modeling and evaluating odor pollution from sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>composting</b> facilities. Implications: Composting {{is one of the most}} important methods for sewage sludge treatment and improving the low organic matter content of many agricultural soils. However, odors are inevitably produced during the composting process. Understanding the production and emission patterns of odors is important for odor control and treatment.

Materials &amp; Methods: Sawdust was added to sewage sludge at 1 : 3 weight bases to Carbon to Nitrogen ratio of 25 : 1 for composting or vermicomposting. Lignin and volatile solids were determined at different periods, of 0, 10, 30, 40 and 60 days of composting or vermicomposting period to determine the biodegradation of lignocellulose to lignin. Results were expressed as mean of two replicates and the comparisons among means were made using the least significant difference test calculated (p < 0. 05). Results: After 60 days of experiment period, the initial lignin increased from 3. 46 % to 4. 48 % for compost and 3. 46 % to 5. 27 % for vermicompost. Biodegradation of lignocellulose was very slow in compost and vermicompost processes. Vermicomposting is a much faster process than compost to convert lignocellulose to lignin (p < 0. 05).

Natural zeolite and nitrification inhibitor (NI) are widely used during composting and land application for nitrogen conservation, respectively. Three composting reactors (A-the control, B-natural zeolite addition, and C- 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) addition) were established to investigate the influence of NI and natural zeolite addition on organics degradation and nitrogen transformation during <b>sludge</b> <b>composting</b> conducted at the lab scale. The results showed that, in comparison with the control, natural zeolite addition accelerated organics degradation and the maturity of sludge compost was higher, while the DMPP addition slowed down the degradation of organic matters. Meanwhile, the nitrogen transformation functional genes including those responses for nitrification (amoA and nxrA) and denitrification (narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ) were quantified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) to investigate the effects of natural zeolites and DMPP addition on nitrogen transformation. Although no significant difference in the abundance of nitrogen transformation functional genes was observed between treatments, addition of both natural zeolite and DMPP increases the final total nitrogen content by 48. 6 % and 23. 1 %, respectively. The ability of natural zeolite for nitrogen conservation was due to the absorption of NH 3 by compost, and nitrogen conservation by DMPP was achieved by the source reduction of denitrification.

40|$|Composting is {{commonly}} used for the treatment and resource utilization of sewage sludge, and natural zeolite and nitrification inhibitors {{can be used for}} nitrogen conservation during <b>sludge</b> <b>composting,</b> while their impacts on ARGs control are still unclear. Therefore, three lab-scale composting reactors, A (the control), B (natural zeolite addition) and C (nitrification inhibitor addition of 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate, DMPP), were established. The impacts of natural zeolite and DMPP on the levels of ARGs were investigated, as were the roles that heavy metals, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and the bacterial community play in ARGs evolution. The results showed that total ARGs copies were enriched 2. 04 and 1. 95 times in reactors A and C, respectively, but were reduced by 1. 5 % in reactor B due to the reduction of conjugation and co-selection of heavy metals caused by natural zeolite. Although some ARGs (bla(CTX-M), bla(TEM), ermB, ereA and tetW) were reduced by 03 - 2 logs, others (ermF, sull, sulll, tetG, tetX, mefA and aac(6 '- 1 b-cr) increased by 0. 3 - 1. 3 logs after <b>sludge</b> <b>composting.</b> Although the contributors for the ARGs profiles in different stages were quite different, the results of a partial redundancy analysis, Mantel test and Procrustes analysis showed that the bacterial community was the main contributor to the changes in ARGs compared to MGEs and heavy metals.

40|$|The {{disposal}} {{of sewage sludge}} and other organic waste on the soil seems be an alternative for the public sector since this can provide nutrients for the growth and maintenance of plant species that constitute the urban systems of green areas. This experiment was conducted in Mogi Guacu, State of Sao Paulo to evaluate the effect of doses (0, 20, 40 and SO Mg ha(- 1)) of an organic sewage sludge coin post and grass residue on the recovery of a humusless soil, particularly on the soil chemical properties and revegetation with native species. At a dose of 80 Mg ha(- 1) sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>compost</b> an increase was observed {{in the level of}} P, Ca, Mg, K, Mg, Fe, and soil pH, with. positive influence on fertility and Unaltered soil organic C content. The index of soil cover by tree canopies was not influenced by increasing doses of sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>compost</b> on humusless soil...|$|R
