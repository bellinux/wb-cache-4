40|$|Abstract—With the {{increased}} emphasis on improving fuel econ-omy and reducing emissions, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have emerged as very strong candidates to achieve these goals. The power-split hybrid system, which is a complex hybrid powertrain, exhibits great potential to improve fuel economy by determin-ing the most efficient regions for engine operation and thereby high-voltage (HV) battery operation to achieve overall vehicle efficiency optimization. To control and maintain the actual HV battery power, a sophisticated control system is essential, which controls engine power <b>and</b> thereby engine <b>speed</b> to achieve the desired HV battery maintenance power. Conventional approaches use proportional–integral (PI) control systems to control the actual HV battery power in power-split HEV, which can sometimes result in either overshoots of engine <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> <b>or</b> degraded response <b>and</b> settling times due to the nonlinearity of the pow-er-split hybrid system. We have developed a novel approach to intelligently controlling engine power <b>and</b> <b>speed</b> behavior in a power-split HEV using the fuzzy control paradigm for better per-formances. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first reported use of the fuzzy control method to control engine power <b>and</b> <b>speed</b> of a power-split HEV in the applied automotive field. Our ap-proach uses fuzzy gain scheduling to determine appropriate gains for the PI controller based on the system’s operating conditions. The improvements include elimination of the overshoots as well as approximate 50 % faster response and settling times in comparison with the conventional linear PI control approach. The improved performances are demonstrated through simulations and field experiments using a Ford Escape Hybrid vehicle.

At present, the optical image motion compensation method bases mainly on the reflective element. In order to overcome the disadvantages of complicated image rotation corrected mechanism, difficult position location and optical vibration occurred by the swing scanning, a new method based on rotating double optical wedge was proposed, the dynamic working matrix was built, the emergent light vector's trajectory was analyzed and simulated. According to the actual image motion compensation demand, the double optical wedge designing result and controlling method were presented. Through analysis and simulation, {{the results show that}} this method has significant advantages such as compact structure, easy controlling method, stable motion state, high compensation capacity, etc. It has very important practical value for the occasions of the greater ratio of <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> height (<b>or</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> distance). ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Astronautics.

These antennas are generally larger than those seen in Wi-Fi setups and are designed for outdoor use. Several types of radio antennas are available that accommodate various weather conditions, signal distances and bandwidths. They are usually selected to make the beam as narrow as possible and thus focus transmit power to their destination, increasing reliability and reducing the chance of eavesdropping or data injection. The links are usually arranged as a point-to-point setup to permit the use of these antennas. This also permits the link to have better <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>or</b> better reach for the same amount of power.|$|R
