2500|$|The Dust Bowl exodus was {{the largest}} {{migration}} in American history within {{a short period of}} time.

2500|$|The {{reasonableness}} test {{itself can}} be seen in operation in Howard Marine & Dredging Co v A Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd (where the Court of Appeal disagreed about the weight one would give the Lloyd's Register) and Walker v Boyle. In Walker, two private parties, albeit both with solicitors acting on their behalf had made an agreement to sell a country house. Some <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> called the [...] "National Conditions of Sale" [...] were incorporated, and these contained a clause excluding liability for misrepresentations. Even though these terms were widely used, it was held that between the parties their use fell foul of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 3, since they were not negotiated by interested trade parties. A court will weigh up a number of considerations (was the clause transparent? which party is better insured to bear the risk?) but the most important consideration is what the bargaining strength of the parties were.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{there are}} over 7,021 colleges and universities. A [...] "college" [...] in the US {{formally}} denotes a constituent part of a university, but in popular usage, the word [...] "college" [...] is the generic term for any post-secondary undergraduate education. Americans [...] "go to college" [...] after high school, {{regardless of whether the}} specific institution is formally a college or a university. Some students choose to dual-enroll, by taking college classes while still in high school. The word and its derivatives are the <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with American post-secondary undergraduate education.Students must pay for college before taking classes. Some borrow the money via loans, and some students fund their educations with cash, scholarships, or grants, or some combination of any two or more of those payment methods. In 2011, the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree. For state-owned schools (called [...] "public" [...] universities), the subsidy was given to the college, with the student benefiting from lower tuition. The state subsidized on average 50% of public university tuition.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the model}} of an offer {{mirroring}} acceptance makes sense to analyse almost all agreements, it does not fit in some cases. In The Satanita the rules of a yacht race stipulated that the yachtsmen would be liable, beyond limits set in statute, {{to pay for all}} damage to other boats. The Court of Appeal held that there was a contract to pay arising from the rules of the competition between The Satanita's owner and the owner of Valkyrie II, which he sank, even though there was no clear offer mirrored by a clear acceptance between the parties at any point. Along with a number of other critics, in a series of cases Lord Denning MR proposed that English law ought to abandon its rigid attachment to offer and acceptance in favour of a broader rule, that the parties need to be in substantial agreement on the material points in the contract. In Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd this would have meant that during a [...] "battle of forms" [...] two parties were construed as having material agreement on the buyer's <b>standard</b> <b>terms,</b> and excluding a price variation clause, although the other court members reached the same view on ordinary analysis. In Gibson v Manchester CC he would have come to a different result to the House of Lords, by allowing Mr Gibson to buy his house from the council, even though the council's letter stated it [...] "should not be regarded as a firm offer". This approach would potentially give greater discretion to a court to do what appears appropriate at the time, without being tied to what the parties may have subjectively intended, particularly where those intentions obviously conflicted.|$|E
