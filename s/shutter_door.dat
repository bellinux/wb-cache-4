5000|$|Old {{tales about}} Yuki-onna are mostly stories of sorrow, {{and it is}} said that these tales started from when people who have lived gloomy lives, such as childless old couples or single men in {{mountain}} villages, would hear the sound of a blizzard knocking on their <b>shutter</b> <b>door</b> and fantasize that the thing that they longed for has come. It is said that after that, they would live in happiness with what they longed for in a fantasy as fleeting as snow. There is also a feeling of fear, and like as in the Tōno Monogatari, the sound of a blizzard knocking on an outer shōji is called the [...] "shōji sasuri" [...] (rubbing a shōji), and there is a custom of making children who stayed up late go to sleep quickly when a yuki-onna rubs a shōji. From real sayings such as the shōji sasuri, {{it is said that}} things that one longs for sits back-to-back with fear. Also, winter is the season when gods would come to visit, and if one does not pay respects, terrible things will happen, so even if it is said to be things that one longs for, one cannot put too much trust in that. In any case, it can be said {{to be related to the}} coming and going of seasons. Nobuyoshi Furuhashi, scholar of Japanese literature, stated that the novel Kaze no Matasaburō is also probably somehow related.|$|E

50|$|The {{drum motor}} concept was first {{recorded}} in 1928 {{but was not}} realised until the early 1950s {{when it was first}} produced specifically for conveyor belt applications. The idea was to produce a compact, totally enclosed single component drive unit with high efficiency and lower frictional losses than a conventional geared motor. The new design was quick and easy to install, required no maintenance and because of its totally enclosed IP66 sealed design would be unaffected by dust, dirt grease or water. Today you see many examples of drum motor applications in airport check-in conveyors and security machines, supermarket checkstands, food processing conveyors and weighing equipment. Reversible drum motors are also used for roller <b>shutter</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
