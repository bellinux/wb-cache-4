40|$|To improve practical, {{accurate}} {{diagnosis of}} malaria in the Amazon rainforest of Venezuela, two rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) (OptiMAL-IT) and FalciVax) and a laboratory light microscope, {{used in the}} field with a battery-operated head lamp as an external light source, were evaluated against the standard laboratory microscope procedure for malaria detection. One hundred and thirty-six Yanomami patients were studied {{for the presence of}} malaria parasites. Thirty-three patients (24 %) were positive for malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae). Twenty-one (64 %) of the positive patients had < 100 parasites/microl. Both RDTs showed poor sensitivity (24. 2 % for OptiMAL-IT) and 36. 4 % for FalciVax) but good specificity (99 % both for OptiMAL-IT) and FalciVax). Field and laboratory microscopy showed sensitivities of 94 % and 91 %, respectively. The kappa coefficient was 0. 90, indicating a high agreement between field and laboratory microscopy.

40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} the world's {{most common}} and serious {{tropical}} diseases, caused by parasites of the genus plasmodia that are transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Various parts of Asia and Latin America are affected but highest malaria incidence is found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Standard diagnosis of malaria comprises microscopic detection of parasites in stained thick and thin blood films. As the process of <b>slide</b> <b>reading</b> under the microscope is an error-prone and tedious issue we are developing computer-assisted microscopy systems to support detection and diagnosis of malaria. In this paper we focus on a deep learning (DL) approach for the detection of plasmodia and the evaluation of the proposed approach in comparison with two reference approaches. The proposed classification schemes have been evaluated with more than 180, 000 automatically detected and manually classified plasmodia candidate objects from so-called thick smears. Automated solutions for the morphological analysis of malaria blood films could apply such a classifier to detect plasmodia in the highly complex image data of thick smears and thereby shortening the examination time. With such a system diagnosis of malaria infections should become a less tedious, more reliable and reproducible and thus a more objective process.

40|$|Context: Pathologists grade {{follicular}} lymphoma (FL) cases by selecting 10, random high power fields (HPFs), counting {{the number of}} centroblasts (CBs) in these HPFs under the microscope and then calculating the average CB count for the whole slide. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is high inter-reader variability among pathologists using this methodology in grading. Aims: The objective {{of this study was to}} explore if newly available digital reading technologies can reduce inter-reader variability. Settings and Design: In this study, we considered three different reading conditions (RCs) in grading FL: (1) Conventional (glass-slide based) to establish the baseline, (2) digital whole slide viewing, (3) digital whole slide viewing with selected HPFs. Six board-certified pathologists from five different institutions read 17 FL slides in these three different RCs. Results: Although there was relative poor consensus in conventional reading, with lack of consensus in 41. 2 % of cases, which was similar to previously reported studies; we found that digital reading with pre-selected fields improved the inter-reader agreement, with only 5. 9 % lacking consensus among pathologists. Conclusions: Digital whole slide RC resulted in the worst concordance among pathologists while digital whole <b>slide</b> <b>reading</b> selected HPFs improved the concordance. Further studies are underway to determine if this performance can be sustained with a larger dataset and our automated HPF and CB detection algorithms can be employed to further improve the concordance...|$|E

Although these tests have been extensively evaluated in uncomplicated falciparum malaria, reliable data on their performance for diagnosing potentially lethal severe malaria is lacking. Methods. We compared a Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich-protein 2 (PfHRP 2) –based RDT and a Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) –based RDT with routine microscopy of a peripheral blood slide and expert microscopy as a reference standard for the diagnosis of severe malaria in 1898 children who presented with severe febrile illness at 2 centers in Mozambique and Tanzania. Results. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of the PfHRP 2 -based test were 94. 0 %, 70. 9 %, 85. 4 %, and 86. 8 %, respectively, and for the pLDH-based test, the values were 88. 0 %, 88. 3 %, 93. 2 %, and 80. 3 %, respectively. At parasite counts, 1000 parasites/lL (n 5 173), sensitivity of the pLDH-based test was low (45. 7 %), compared with that of the PfHRP 2 -based test (69. 9 %).

During March 2006 - April 2007, the incidence of all cause attendance was two attendances per person, per year (pppy), including 0. 2 episodes pppy of malaria, 0. 7 episodes of mild and 0. 13 episodes of severe anaemia. Point estimates for the effect of IPTi on malaria varied between 18 % and 52 %, depending on the scope of the analysis, although adjustment for clustering rendered these not statistically significant. Conclusions The point estimate of the effect of IPTi on malaria is consistent with that from a large pooled analysis of randomized control trials. As such, it is plausible that the difference seen in health centre data is due to IPTi, even thought the effect did not reach statistical significance.

In this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tu-mor samples from 77 breast cancer patients were examined for HER 2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and silver in situ hybridization (SISH) using HER 2 IHC (clone 4 B 5), HER 2 /CEN 17 SISH, and combined IHC and SISH assay, called gene protein (GP). Cases were selected to ensure a sufficient number of borderline cases on the basis of IHC scores (0, 1 +, 2 +, 3 +), obtained during diagnostic histopatho-logical workup. The concordance between the HER 2 IHC score obtained during diagnostic histopathological workup and GP was 93 %. Discordances had no influence on therapy decisions. The concordance between ISH results using dual ISH (DISH) and GP was 96 %. Of the 77 cases studied by GP, three cases with a ratio close to 2 would have been called amplified by DISH.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{decline in}} malaria {{coinciding with the}} {{introduction}} of newer, costly anti-malarials has prompted studies into the overtreatment for malaria mostly in East Africa. The study presented here describes prescribing practices for malaria at health facilities in a West African country. Methods Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in two urban Gambian primary health facilities (PHFs) during and outside the malaria transmission season. Facilities were comparable in terms of the staffing compliment and capability to perform slide microscopy. Patients treated for malaria were enrolled after consultations and blood smears collected and read at a reference laboratory. <b>Slide</b> <b>reading</b> results from the PHFs were compared to the reference readings and the proportion of cases treated but with a negative test result at the reference laboratory was determined. Results Slide requests were made for 33. 2 % (173) of those enrolled, being more frequent in children (0 - 15 yrs) than adults during the wet season (p = 0. 003). In the same period, requests were commoner in under-fives compared to older children (p = 0. 022); however, a positive test result was 4. 4 times more likely in the latter group (p = 0. 010). Parasitaemia was confirmed for only 4. 7 % (10 / 215) and 12. 5 % (37 / 297) of patients in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The negative predictive value of a PHF slide remained above 97 % in both seasons. Conclusions The study provides evidence for considerable overtreatment for malaria in a West African setting comparable to reports from areas with similar low malaria transmission in East Africa. The data suggest that laboratory facilities may be under-used, and that adherence to negative PHF slide results could significantly reduce the degree of overtreatment.

No studies have been conduct to investigate {{the safety of the}} extract. Objectives: The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the acute oral toxicity test of soursoup leaves extract (Annona muricata) on Swiss miceâ€™s liver and kidney. Methods: Twenty four mice were divided into 4 groups. Group I was control group, while group II-IV was given soursoup leaves extract as single dose orally via sonde. The mice were obsereved until day 7 to determine the LD 50 and at the end were terminated to collect the liver and kidney. The organs later were made into histopathology <b>slides.</b> The <b>slides</b> <b>read</b> with light microscope. The data analyzed with ANOVA and was considered significant at p< 0. 05. Results: All mice were alive during the 7 days observation and no mice showing the toxic spectrum after the dosing. Microscopically, no damage on the liver and kidney organ among the groups. Conclusion: The LD 50 of soursoup leaves extract is more than 2000 mg/kgBW. This result indicate that the extract is practically non toxic and do not damage the liver and kidney...|$|R
