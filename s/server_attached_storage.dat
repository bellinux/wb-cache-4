40|$|Network {{attached}} storage devices improve I/O performance by separating control and data paths and eliminating host intervention during data transfer. Devices {{are attached to}} a high speed network for data transfer and to a slower network for control messages. Hierarchical mass storage systems use disks to cache the most recently used files and tapes (robotic and manually mounted) to store {{the bulk of the}} files in the file system. This paper shows how queuing network models can be used to assess the performance of hierarchical mass storage systems that use network {{attached storage}} devices. The analytic model validated through simulation was used to analyze many different scenarios. 1 Introduction Most current mass storage systems at national laboratories and supercomputer centers are based on the <b>server</b> <b>attached</b> <b>storage</b> model in which all storage devices are attached to a single machine using high speed busses and I/O channels. A request for access to a storage object arrives at the ser [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – One of {{the major}} {{components}} of any enterprise IT infrastructure is data storage. There has been continuous effort to explore new storage technologies to improve performance with respect to input/output operations, data availability, consolidation of storage assets and data protection and archiving. Storage has moved from the traditional Direct Attached Storage (DAS) to Network Attached Storage (NAS) and now to Storage Area Networks (SAN). Traditional storage subsystems like <b>Server</b> <b>Attached</b> <b>Storage</b> (SAS) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) use disks directly attached to servers over a Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) bus. However, these have limited capabilities keeping in view the rapidly expanding storage needs. The SAN technology holds great promises {{to be used for}} enterprises where issues like data availability, serviceability, consolidation of storage and reliability are major concerns. It can provide high speed data transfer with many other storage services, backboned with a high speed Fibre Channel (FC). Storage-area networks are also more popular and efficient way of building large storage systems both in an enterprise environment and for multi-domain storage service providers. SAN design and implementation requires careful analysis before SAN can be used as an enterprise storage solution. &# 13; &# 13; In this paper we provide an overview of SAN technology from the view point of building large storage systems in an enterprise environment. We also discuss on return on investment (ROI) which can justify the adoption of SAN in an enterprise. Further, it compares two specific technologies, namely, FC SAN and IP SAN. In the sequel different design considerations are made to recommend suitable SAN implementations {{in order to meet the}} requirements of any enterprise...|$|E

Capacity is scaled by adding additional nodes or adding additional storage to each node. Performance is increased by deploying storage among more nodes. High availability is achieved by replicating data n-way between nodes but comes at the expense of reliability.|$|R

Deployments involve careful design of many mechanisms where content attributes and usage models {{should be taken}} into account. We define, and propose a methodology to solve, the VoD Equipment Allocation Problem of determining the number and type of streaming <b>servers</b> with directly <b>attached</b> <b>storage</b> (VoD <b>servers)</b> to install at each potential location in a metropolitan area network topology such that deployment costs are minimized. We develop a cost model for VoD deployments based on streaming, storage and transport costs and train a parametric function that maps the amount of available storage to a worst-case hit ratio. We observe the impact of having to determine the amount of storage and streaming cojointly, and determine the minimum demand required to deploy replicas as well as the average hit ratio at each location. We observe that common video-on-demand server configurations lead to the installation of excessive storage, because a relatively high hit-ratio can be achieved with small amounts of storage so streaming requirements dominate...|$|R
