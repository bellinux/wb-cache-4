Of which Irish Poor-Slave Costume no description will indeed {{be found in the}} present Volume; for this reason, that by the imperfect organ of Language it did not seem describable. Their raiment consists of innumerable skirts, lappets and irregular wings, of all cloths and of all colors; through the labyrinthic intricacies of which their bodies are introduced by some unknown process. It is fastened together by a multiplex combination of buttons, thrums and skewers; to which frequently is added a girdle of leather, of hempen or even of <b>straw</b> <b>rope,</b> round the loins. To <b>straw</b> <b>rope,</b> indeed, they seem partial, and often wear it by way of sandals. In head-dress they affect a certain freedom: hats with partial brim, without crown, or with only a loose, hinged, or valve crown; in the former case, they sometimes invert the hat, and wear it brim uppermost, like a university-cap, with what view is unknown.|$|E
60|$|The Queen, quite delighted, {{thanked the}} Fairy gratefully, and begged {{her to take}} charge of the little Delicia and bring her up as her own daughter. This she agreed to do, and then they shut the basket and lowered it carefully, baby and all, to the ground {{at the foot of the}} tower. The Fairy then changed herself back into the form of a mouse, and this delayed her a few seconds, after which she ran nimbly down the <b>straw</b> <b>rope,</b> but only to find when she got to the bottom that the baby had disappeared.|$|E

Other aspects of this {{fertility}} rite include prayers to the spirits of the local mountains and forests, exorcism rite, and traditional music and dancing. Because the Western side of the village is thought to represent fecundity, the Seobu Go is larger than the Dongbu one, since only if Seobu win will the villager's prayers for a prosperous year be granted. Historically, in the event that no clear winner emerged, the Go would be dismantled and their <b>straw</b> <b>ropes</b> used in a tug-of-war contest instead.|$|R
6000|$|No {{sooner had}} they returned, than {{the scene of}} {{yesterday}} began again. The horses were not even tied with a <b>straw</b> <b>rope</b> this time-- it was not worth while; and Kelmar disappeared into the bar, leaving them under a tree {{on the other side}} of the road. I had to devote myself. I stood under the shadow of that tree for, I suppose, hard upon an hour, and had not the heart to be angry. Once some one remembered me, and brought me out half a tumblerful of the playful, innocuous American cocktail. I drank it, and lo! veins of living fire ran down my leg; and then a focus of conflagration remained seated in my stomach, not unpleasantly, for quarter of an hour. I love these sweet, fiery pangs, but I will not court them. The bulk of the time I spent in repeating as much French poetry as I could remember to the horses, who seemed to enjoy it hugely. And now it went - ...|$|E
60|$|Thus I speculated before I {{looked at}} the pile of parchments so evidently {{prepared}} from sheep skins by one who had only a very rudimentary {{knowledge of how to}} work such stuff, not knowing that in those parchments was hid the answer to many of my questions. To these I turned last of all, for we all shrink from parchments; their contents are generally so dull. There was a great bundle of them that had been lashed together with a kind of <b>straw</b> <b>rope,</b> fine straw that reminded me of that used to make Panama hats. But this had rotted underneath together with all the bottom part of the parchments, many sheets of them, of which only fragments remained, covered with dry mould and crumbling. Therefore the rope was easy to remove and beneath it, holding the sheets in place, was only some stout and comparatively modern string--it had a red thread in it that marked it as navy cord of an old pattern.|$|E
6000|$|At last we {{set forth}} for Silverado on foot. Kelmar and his jolly Jew girls {{were full of}} the {{sentiment}} of Sunday outings, breathed geniality and vagueness, and suffered a little vile boy from the hotel to lead them here and there about the woods. For three people all so old, so bulky in body, and belonging to a race so venerable, they could not but surprise us by their extreme and almost imbecile youthfulness of spirit. They were only going to stay ten minutes at the Toll House; had they not twenty long miles of road before them on the other side? Stay to dinner? Not they! Put up the horses? Never. Let us attach them to the verandah by a wisp of <b>straw</b> <b>rope,</b> such as would not have held a person's hat on that blustering day. And with all these protestations of hurry, they proved irresponsible like children. Kelmar himself, shrewd old Russian Jew, with a smirk that seemed just to have concluded a bargain to its satisfaction, intrusted himself and us devoutly to that boy. Yet the boy was patently fallacious; {{and for that matter}} a most unsympathetic urchin, raised apparently on gingerbread. He was bent on his own pleasure, nothing else; and Kelmar followed him to his ruin, with the same shrewd smirk. If the boy said there was [...] "a hole there in the hill"--a hole, pure and simple, neither more nor less--Kelmar and his Jew girls would follow him a hundred yards to look complacently down that hole. For two hours we looked for houses; and for two hours they followed us, smelling trees, picking flowers, foisting false botany on the unwary. Had we taken five, with that vile lad to head them off on idle divagations, for five they would have smiled and stumbled through the woods.|$|E

5000|$|In 1703, John Brand {{wrote in}} his {{description}} of Shetland that: Not above forty or fifty years ago, every family had a brownie, or evil spirit, so called, which served them, to which they gave a sacrifice for his service; as when they churned their milk, they took a part thereof, and sprinkled {{every corner of the}} house with it, for Brownie’s use; likewise, when they brewed, they had a stone which they called [...] "Brownie’s stane", wherein there was a little hole into which they poured some wort for a sacrifice to Brownie. They also had some stacks of corn, which they called Brownie’s Stacks, which, though they were not bound with <b>straw</b> <b>ropes,</b> or in any way fenced as other stacks used to be, yet the greatest storm of wind was not able to blow away straw off them.|$|R
50|$|Growing {{disillusionment with}} the {{consumer}} society {{led to a}} change in Tilson work in the 1970s. After moving to Wiltshire in 1972, Tilson began to use a wider variety of materials, including stone, <b>straw</b> and <b>rope</b> in an effort to transcend time and culture by drawing on the motifs of pre-Classical mythology. This body of work was called Alchera.|$|R

500|$|The <b>straw</b> <b>ropes</b> used in juldarigi are immense, up to 200m {{in length}} and 1m in diameter. They can weigh as much as 40 tons. They are {{constructed}} of twisted rice straw; this choice of material is symbolic, since rice is the staple grain in the areas where juldarigi is practiced. The construction process is a communal event, reflecting the communal nature of rice cultivation. Two ropes are used, one for each team; they are connected by a wooden beam or stump known as a binyeomok, around three metres long. The rope held by the Eastern team is termed the sutjul ( [...] "male rope") and the Western team hold the amjul ( [...] "female rope"). [...] Because of the ropes' great size, they cannot be grasped directly; players attached smaller side-ropes to the main rope to act as handles and fray its ends to provide additional hand-holds.|$|R
30|$|During the enunciation, the Daba {{also has}} to {{accomplish}} a series of gestures. For example, he takes the statue which stands for the particular malefic spirit and talk to them, when he is seating them (“ke”). In the fifth step (“tçi”), the Daba asks the assistants to cut the <b>straw</b> <b>ropes</b> which symbolize the connection of malefic spirits and humans, then sprinkles the cut ropes over the statue. In the sixth step (“dha”), the Daba puts specific offerings on the statue of malefic spirits. In the ninth step (“dhen”), he moves the statue to let them face with {{the front door of}} the living room. In the tenth step (“pié”), he asks the assistants to send the statue out of the residence. During mukrabu, the Daba has to expel dozens of malefic spirits, indicating that he has to repeat above enunciation and gestures for over ten times. The whole process is accomplished continuously.|$|R
60|$|Two great yellow caravans had halted {{one morning}} {{before the door}} and men had come {{tramping}} into the house to dismantle it.

50|$|The cottage is {{a single}} storey {{building}} of rubble stone walls with larger quoin stones. The walls are colourwashed and the roof is thatched. The thatch {{was covered with a}} corrugated tin roof until the cottage was restored in 2013 and the roof re-thatched. The interior has rough A-frame trusses formed from rounded timbers with pegged joints. Rough purlins support the roof thatch. The A-frames and purlins are now exposed but originally {{there would have been a}} boarded loft. According to Cadw, originally the thatch straw was probably laid over an underthatch of gorse over a layer of <b>straw</b> <b>rope.</b> When re-thatched, a base coat of slates was tied on with handmade <b>straw</b> <b>rope</b> then laid over with a thatch of combed wheat and drum thrashed landrace long straw.|$|E
50|$|Heavy gauge <b>straw</b> <b>rope</b> is coiled and sewn tightly {{together}} to make archery targets. This is no longer done entirely by hand, but is partially mechanised.

Today the bear wears fluffy, brown clothes and a mask. A chain is tied around the bear's waist and its jangling alerts residents about the Greys' approach.|$|E
50|$|Korea has ten {{kinds of}} eulalia. The eulalia leaf {{is good for}} {{waterproofing}} and durability. It is a strong material that will last for ten years after covering the roof with eulalia once. The <b>straw</b> <b>rope</b> twisted with eulalia is not only strong and elastic but also good for waterproofing. It is used in weaving rain-gear (rainwear) or straw sandals. The material should be dried with dew for a week. Then it is put in a shady pot for good airing.|$|E
50|$|The central {{portion of}} the kadomatsu is formed from three large bamboo shoots, though plastic kadomatsu are available. Similar to several traditions of ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement), the shoots are set at {{different}} heights and represent heaven, humanity, and earth with heaven being the highest and earth being the lowest. Some kadomatsu place the humanity and earth shoots at the same height. After binding {{all the elements of}} the kadomatsu, it is bound with a straw mat and newly woven <b>straw</b> <b>rope.</b> Kadomatsu are placed in pairs {{on either side of the}} gate, representing male and female.|$|E
50|$|A round {{elongated}} makiwara, traditionally {{made from}} rice <b>straw</b> bound with <b>rope,</b> {{is used by}} practitioners of Kyudo, Japanese archery. This makiwara is placed on a stand {{so that it is}} near shoulder height, and is used for close range practice from about 5-8 feet away. The archer is practically unable to miss the target from that range, affording the Kyudo practitioner the opportunity to practice his form, without thought for the target.|$|R

50|$|Early February: Shimakusarashi (Purification of the Village). Especially {{popular in}} {{southern}} Okinawa. A cow is slaughtered, and its various parts used to ritually cleanse the community. The cow's blood is smeared with leaves onto walls and gates. Then {{the heart is}} boiled and presented at an utaki, ancient tombs, or the house of an especially old or powerful family. A rope, particularly a <b>straw</b> <b>rope,</b> is hung over paths {{at the edge of}} town to mark the reaches of the community's sanctuary and keep out evil influences. Bones of the cow are then tied to the string and the cow's meat is given out for communal consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Chajeon Nori, {{occasionally}} {{translated as}} Juggernaut Battle, {{is a traditional}} Korean game usually played by men, originating in the Andong region. It may have originated as a commemoration of Wang Geon's victory over Gyeon Hwon at the Battle of Gochang in 935, {{near the end of}} the Later Three Kingdoms period. It resembles a jousting match, with the two commanders are atop large log frames maneuvered by their teams. These trapezoidal log frames are known as dongchae, and are composed of two 10-meter-long logs tied together with <b>straw</b> <b>rope.</b> The dongchae lie horizontally at the beginning of play, but then are hoisted up by their team. Some members of the team carry the dongchae, while others fight with the opposing team to help their side advance.|$|E

[...] Also, there is a sacred tree at this site, Sacred Camphor Tree, which located between the Nachi Shrine (heiden) and Seigantoji Temple. It is 850 years old and {{is said to have been}} planted by Taira-no-Shigemori (1138-1179). The <b>straw</b> <b>rope</b> (shimenawa) and paper flags show that this tree has been sanctified as a kami. The tree is alive with moss and ferns and other small plants growing on its ancient limbs. It is possible to enter the tree where there is a small altar for making offerings - inside the tree you feel as though you actually hear the beating of its 800-year-old heart! ...|$|E
50|$|If a {{break or}} leak was {{discovered}} {{and the level}} walker could not do repair it himself, he {{sent a message to}} the section superintendent or headquarters, and the section crew with a repair scow would come. These boats carried clay <b>straw,</b> takes, <b>rope,</b> wooden boards, and tools (picks & shovels). For culverts and flood gates, a row of heavy planks, interlocked with tongue and groove, would be driven across the canal (similar to a cofferdam) above and below the break, and would swell when wet. After the water drained out through the break, it would be repaired. If the break was in the bank or berm of the canal, the crew would drive two rows of stakes, about a foot apart, across the breach, then weaving <b>rope</b> between them. <b>Straw</b> was put in it, and that would slow or stop the water flow. A row of planks were then driven to stop the flow, and then the break would be filled with dirt and rocks.|$|R
25|$|Slum {{areas are}} {{characterized}} by substandard housing structures. Shanty homes are often built hurriedly, on ad hoc basis, with materials unsuitable for housing. Often the construction quality is inadequate to withstand heavy rains, high winds, or other local climate and location. Paper, plastic, earthen floors, mud-and-wattle walls, wood held together by <b>ropes,</b> <b>straw</b> or torn metal pieces as roofs {{are some of the}} materials of construction. In some cases, brick and cement is used, but without attention to proper design and structural engineering requirements.

40|$|Anthropogenic debris {{contaminates}} marine habitats globally, {{leading to}} several perceived ecological impacts. Here, we critically and systematically review the literature regarding impacts of debris from several scientific fields {{to understand the}} weight of evidence regarding the ecological impacts of marine debris. We quantified perceived and demonstrated impacts across several levels of biological organization {{that make up the}} ecosystem and found 366 perceived threats of debris across all levels. Two hundred and ninety-six of these perceived threats were tested, 83 % of which were demonstrated. The majority (82 %) of demonstrated impacts were due to plastic, relative to other materials (e. g., metals, glass) and largely (89 %) at suborganismal levels (e. g., molecular, cellular, tissue). The remaining impacts, demonstrated at higher levels of organization (i. e., death to individual organisms, changes in assemblages), were largely due to plastic marine debris (> 1 mm; e. g., <b>rope,</b> <b>straws,</b> and fragments). Thus, we show evidence of ecological impacts from marine debris, but conclude that {{the quantity and quality of}} research requires improvement to allow the risk of ecological impacts of marine debris to be determined with precision. Still, our systematic review suggests that sufficient evidence exists for decision makers to begin to mitigate problematic plastic debris now, to avoid risk of irreversible harm. </p...|$|R
