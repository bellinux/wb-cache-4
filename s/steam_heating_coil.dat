50|$|A Windermere kettle {{is a form}} of steam-operated tea urn or samovar {{installed}} on some steam launches. They are a metal vessel containing a few pints of water. Inside the vessel is a <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> When hot or boiling water is required, a valve is opened and steam from the boat's propulsion boiler is passed through the coil, heating the water. Their exhaust is either overboard or up the funnel, as convenient. Windermere kettles are rapid boilers and can heat enough water to make a pot of tea in only a few seconds.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} operate at peak efficiency, every <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> in a dry kiln must fully purge the {{condensate}} that forms within it. Failure to do so results in a condition known as waterlogging, where {{a portion of the}} coil becomes flooded with condensate. Waterlogging is recognized as an undesirable condition that leads to uneven heat distribution and increases the corrosivity of condensate. This paper reviews a unique method to detect waterlogging, and assesses its impact on the lumberâ€™s moisture content...|$|E
40|$|Steam {{has been}} widely used {{as the source of}} heating in {{commercial}} buildings and industries throughout the twentieth century. Even though contemporary designers have moved to hot water as the primary choice for heating, a large number of facilities still use steam for heating. Medical campuses with on-site steam generation and extensive distribution systems often serve a number of buildings designed prior to the mid- 1980 s. The steam is typically used for preheat as its high thermal content helps in heating the air faster and prevents coils from freezing in locations with extreme weather conditions during winter. The present work provides a comprehensive description of the various types of steam heating systems, steam coils, and valves to facilitate the engineer's understanding of these steam systems. A large percentage of the steam coils used in buildings are provided with medium pressure steam. Veterans Integrated Service Network and Army Medical Command Medical Facilities are examples which use medium pressure steam for heating. The current design manual for these medical facilities recommends steam at 30 psig be provided to these coils. In certain cases although the <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> is designed for a 5 psig steam pressure, it is observed that higher pressure steam is supplied at the coil. A higher steam pressure may lead to excessive heating, system inefficiency due to increased heat loss, simultaneous heating and cooling, and increased maintenance cost. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of lowering steam pressure on the system performance. A 16 % reduction in temperature rise across the coil was found when the steam pressure in the coil was reduced from 15 psig to 5 psig. The rise in temperature with lower pressure steam was sufficient to prevent coil freeze-up even in the most severe weather conditions. Additional benefits of reduced steam pressure are reduced flash steam losses (flash steam is vapor or secondary steam formed when hot condensate from the coil is discharged into a lower pressure area, i. e., the condensate return line) and radiation losses, increased flow of air through the coil thereby reducing air stratification and reduced energy losses in the event of actuator failure. The work also involved evaluating the existing control strategies for the steam heating system. New control strategies were developed and tested to address the short comings of existing sequences. Improved temperature control and occupant comfort; elimination of valve hunting and reduced energy consumption were benefits realized by implementing these measures...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Lumber drying {{accounts}} for about 70 percent of sawmill energy requirements. Significant recovery of energy used to dry lumber would result in significant energy recovery for the mill. This is desirable because of today's high cost of energy. The objective {{of this study was}} to recover some of the energy required to dry Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] with a superheated steam schedule by compressing kiln exhaust in a steam-jet thermocompressor and condensing this compressed steam in the kiln <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coils.</b> Once the <b>steam</b> recovery was determined, an economic sensitivity analysis was performed. The recovery system resulted in approximately 20 percent recovery of the steam required to dry the charge of lumber. The economic sensitivity analysis showed that the recovery system is sensitive to the size of the kiln on which it is used, and steam value factors which include the fuel cost to produce steam, steam recovery, and the steam flow requirement of the kiln...|$|R
25|$|The {{movement}} {{of crude oil}} by rail is far from new, but {{it is now a}} rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with <b>steam</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coils,</b> avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.|$|R
50|$|The easiest {{alternative}} {{to this is}} <b>steam</b> <b>heating.</b> This presupposes {{the presence of a}} boiler capable of generating steam at high enough pressures to reach the required temperatures. An existing high pressure steam plant is a fine thing to have on hand, and facilitates the use of steam coils, which are simple, compact, and easily controlled. The purchase price of <b>steam</b> <b>coil</b> <b>heating</b> is roughly comparable to that of electric heating, but the operating cost is dramatically lower. If high pressure steam is not available, consider a small dedicated boiler for the autoclave. The cost can be surprisingly low, making this alternative nearly as economical as direct gas-firing of an internal heat exchanger. It also enables you to run your autoclave on natural gas, propane, butane, or fuel oil, sometimes interchangeably if the boiler is set up for dual-fuel operation. Where gas supplies are susceptible to interruption, using a small high-pressure steam boiler to run the autoclave and ovens can be a life-saver when dual-fuel firing is incorporated.|$|R
