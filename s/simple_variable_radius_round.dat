40|$|A {{rigidity}} {{theory is}} developed for bar-joint frameworks in R^d+ 1 whose vertices are constrained {{to lie on}} concentric d-spheres with independently <b>variable</b> <b>radii.</b> In particular, combinatorial characterisations are established for the rigidity of generic frameworks for d= 1 with an arbitrary number of independently <b>variable</b> <b>radii,</b> and for d= 2 with at most two <b>variable</b> <b>radii.</b> This includes a characterisation of the rigidity or flexibility of uniformly expanding spherical frameworks in R^ 3. Due to the equivalence of the generic rigidity between Euclidean space and spherical space, these results interpolate between rigidity in 1 D and 2 D {{and to some extent}} between rigidity in 2 D and 3 D. Symmetry-adapted counts for the detection of symmetry-induced continuous flexibility in frameworks on spheres with <b>variable</b> <b>radii</b> are also provided.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for the modeling and animation of generalized cylinders with <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> offset space curves. The boundary {{surface of a}} generalized cylinder is constructed: either as a translational sweep of cross-sectional curves along the skeleton curve, or as a rotational sweep of profile curves around the skeleton curve. The cross-sectional curves are computed as the <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> offset curves of a circle in the normal plane, and the profile curves are computed as the <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> offset space curves of the skeleton curve. The offset curves are approximated by spline curves, and the boundary surface of a generalized cylinder is approximated by the tensor product surface patches of the offset spline curves. Key Words: Generalized cylinder, sweep, <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> offset, modeling, animation 1 Introduction In computer animation movies, the characters are usually composed of flexible geometric components: arms, legs, and body [30].

We used the rotational symmetry to reduce the problem to two dimensions. Calcium signals were induced by a calcium influx density through the left boundary of the dendrite with an initial strength of 2.5 × 10 ^- 18 mol m^- 2 s^- 1 that linearly decreased to zero within 1  ms.|$|R

40|$|Given a semialgebraic {{description}} {{of an object}} in real 3 -space, we compute a semialgebraic {{description of}} the rounded or blended object using circular constant <b>radius</b> <b>rounding</b> and blending. Our approach uses a real elimination method that can handle polynomial inequalities both in the input and in the output. We discuss the general properties of constant <b>radius</b> <b>rounding</b> of objects from inside and from outside and of constant radius blending of composite objects for arbitrary closed semialgebraic sets in real n-space. We show that rounding and blending {{can be reduced to}} an iterated formation of certain offsets. Our method is implemented based on the REDUCE package REDLOG.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} to approximate the <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> offset curves by cubic B'ezier curves. The offset curve is approximated by a cubic B'ezier curve which interpolates the positions and derivatives {{of the exact}} offset curve at both end points. Thus, it approximates the exact offset curve very closely near the curve end points, but not necessarily {{in the middle of}} the curve. Given a fixed base curve, by changing the offset radius and its derivative at an end point, one can easily control the offset curve shape near the end point. To better control the offset curve shape {{in the middle of the}} curve, we use two global shape parameters (bias and tension) of the offset curve (see [16]). A variety of <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> offset curves are easily generated by using six shape control parameters (the two offsets and their derivatives at both end points, and the bias and tension parameters). Each bristle of a B'ezier brush stroke is represented by a <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> offset curve. Even with simpl [...] ...|$|R

The total cost of lining is the sum of cost of lining on sides on curves and in the base. <b>Radius</b> of <b>rounding</b> can be provided in two ways 1) unbound radius case i. e. the <b>radius</b> of <b>rounding</b> remain constant and it predecided 2) Bound radius case i. e. the <b>radius</b> <b>rounding</b> depend on depth of flow.

30|$|Torching {{potential}} expressed at {{the unit}} scale was low in this study, but the {{bias in the}} measurements before and after treatment (variable area versus <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> plots to inventory trees) makes direct comparison of pre- and post-treatment data risky. We believe the <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> plots used after treatment were more reliable, because prism sampling is unbiased. Occasional plots contained no trees. In contrast, the variable area plots were expanded as needed to include at least 10 trees per sample, so that every plot contained trees, and this resulted in higher basal area expressed at the unit scale (see control unit basal areas in Tables 1 and 3). Comparison of torching index values for just the post-treatment data show little torching potential.|$|R

30|$|Suppose the {{objective}} of an inventory is to estimate the mean, Y, of the target variable Y in a population that consists {{of a total of}} N sampling units and where an auxiliary variable X is available. In the context of forest inventory, the sampling units might be individual trees, or fixed area plots, or points at which <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> plot sampling (known also as Bitterlich sampling) is done (Gregoire and Valentine 2008 Chaps. 7, 8; West 2016). If the sampling units are individual trees, target and/or auxiliary variable values will be obtained as measurements of some characteristic of the individual trees. If the sampling units are fixed area or <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> plots, the measurements will be values for whole plots derived from the trees within any one plot.|$|R

In order to highlight the benefits of VRDMs, two applications are presented and analyzed as examples.

40|$|To {{solve the}} long object problem, an exact and {{efficient}} algorithm has been recently developed by Katsevich. While the Katsevich algorithm only works with standard helical cone-beam scanning, {{there is an}} important need for nonstandard spiral cone-beam scanning. Specifically, we need a scanning spiral of <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> for our newly proposed electron-beam CT/micro-CT prototype. In this paper, for <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> spiral cone-beam CT we construct two Katsevich-type cone-beam reconstruction algorithms in the filtered backprojection (FBP) and backprojected filtration (BPF) formats, respectively. The FBP algorithm is developed based on the standard Katsevich algorithm, and consists of four steps: data differentiation, PI-line determination, slant filtration and weighted backprojection. The BPF algorithm is designed based on the scheme by Zou and Pan, and also consists four steps: data differentiation, PI-line determination, weighted backprojection and inverse Hilbert transform.

40|$|The maximal {{covering}} location problem (MCLP) {{seeks to}} locate a predefined number of facilities {{in order to maximize}} the number of covered demand points. In a classical sense, MCLP has three main implicit assumptions: all or nothing coverage, individual coverage, and fixed coverage radius. By relaxing these assumptions, three classes of modelling formulations are extended: the gradual cover models, the cooperative cover models, and the <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> models. In this paper, we develop a special form of MCLP which combines the characteristics of gradual cover models, cooperative cover models, and <b>variable</b> <b>radius</b> models. The proposed problem has many applications such as locating cell phone towers. The model is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP). In addition, a simulated annealing algorithm is used to solve the resulted problem and the performance of the proposed method is evaluated with a set of randomly generated problems...|$|R
