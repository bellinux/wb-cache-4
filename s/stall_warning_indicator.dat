50|$|Most {{military}} {{combat aircraft}} have an {{angle of attack}} indicator among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1940s, Greene {{developed}} the first {{practical way to}} warn the pilot of the aerodynamic stall. His first design and apparatus included threaded bolts, a bicycle horn and other odd components, all powered by flashlight batteries. Greene filed his device for a patent in 1944, and the patent was issued in 1949. In order to develop his design, Greene founded the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in White Plains, NY, in 1946. There, he refined and marketed the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system {{utilizes}} a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> vane on {{each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above <b>stall,</b> the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|R
50|$|Basically, his device sounded {{an alert}} {{when the plane}} {{was in danger of}} not having enough lift to stay flying. This alert would allow time for the pilot to take {{corrective}} measures. Since its invention, this device became standard equipment for all aircraft and has also helped reduce the number of accidents due to stalling. The <b>Stall</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>Indicator</b> was called “the greatest lifesaver since the invention of the parachute”14 by the Saturday Evening Post and the device received the Flight Safety Foundation’s first Air Safety Award.|$|E
50|$|The SOCATA TB {{family are}} {{a series of}} {{single-engine}} light aircraft developed for general aviation and training purposes. Some versions, such as the TB-200 model, were specifically produced to meet the varied requirements of the trainer aircraft role. The type is often known for its favourable, easy to handle flight characteristics, such as its appropriate handling and control sensitivity, vice-free flying attitude, and being readily recoverable with ease from a typical stall, which lend themselves to less experienced pilots. Due to the absence of violent low-speed behaviour, the presence of a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> is both necessary and furnished.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an audible <b>warning</b> as the <b>stall</b> speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall.

5000|$|In {{an article}} in Vanity Fair, William Langewiesche noted that once the angle of attack was so extreme, the system {{rejected}} the data as invalid and temporarily stopped the <b>stall</b> <b>warnings.</b> However, [...] "this led to a perverse reversal that lasted nearly to the impact: each time Bonin happened to lower the nose, rendering the angle of attack marginally less severe, the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> sounded again—a negative reinforcement that may have locked him into his pattern of pitching up" [...] which increased the angle of attack and thus prevented the plane from getting out of its stall.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the crew}} {{did not respond}} to the <b>stall</b> <b>warning,</b> whether due to a failure to {{identify}} the aural warning, to the transience of the <b>stall</b> <b>warnings</b> that could have been considered spurious, to the absence of any visual information that could confirm that the aircraft was approaching stall after losing the characteristic speeds, to confusing stall-related buffet for overspeed-related buffet, to the indications by the Flight Director that might have confirmed the crew's mistaken view of their actions, or to difficulty in identifying and understanding the implications of the switch to alternate law, which does not protect the angle of attack.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{critical}} {{review of the literature}} on early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of economics crises and propose methods to overcome several pitfalls of the previous contributions. We use a quarterly panel of 40 EU and OECD countries for the period 1970 – 2010. As the response variable, we construct a continuous index of crisis incidence capturing the real costs for the economy. As the potential <b>warning</b> <b>indicators,</b> we evaluate a wide range of variables, selected according to the previous literature and our own considerations. For each potential indicator we determine the optimal lead employing panel vector autoregression, then we select useful indicators employing Bayesian model averaging. We re-estimate the resulting specification by system GMM to account for potential endogeneity of some indicators. Subsequently, to allow for country heterogeneity, we evaluate the random coefficients estimator and illustrate the stability among endogenous clusters. Our results suggest that global variables rank among the most useful early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> In addition, housing prices emerge consistently as an important domestic source of risk.
