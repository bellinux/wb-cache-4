2500|$|Welkom (...) is {{the second-largest}} {{city in the}} Free State {{province}} of South Africa, located about [...] northeast of Bloemfontein, the provincial capital. Welkom {{is also known as}} Circle City, City Within A Garden, Mvela and Matjhabeng. The city's <b>Sesotho</b> name, Matjhabeng means 'where nations meet', derived from the migrant labour system, where people of various countries such as Lesotho, Malawi and Mozambique etc. met to work in the mines of the gold fields.|$|E
2500|$|Although most affricates are homorganic, Navajo and Chiricahua Apache have a heterorganic alveolar-velar affricate [...] (McDonough & Ladefoged 1993, Hoijer & Opler 1938). Wari’ and [...] Pirahã have a voiceless dental bilabially trilled affricate [...] (see Trilled affricates). Other heterorganic affricates are {{reported}} for Northern Sotho (Johnson 2003) and other Bantu languages such as Phuthi, which has alveolar–labiodental affricates [...] and , and <b>Sesotho,</b> which has bilabial–palatoalveolar afficates [...] and [...] Djeoromitxi (Pies 1992) has [...] and [...]|$|E
2500|$|Mfecane (Zulu), {{also known}} as the [...] Difaqane or Lifaqane (<b>Sesotho),</b> is an African {{expression}} which means something like [...] "the crushing" [...] or [...] "scattering". [...] It describes a period of widespread chaos and disturbance in southern Africa during the period between 1815 and about 1835 which resulted from the rise to power of Shaka, the Zulu king and military leader who conquered the Nguni peoples between the Tugela and Pongola rivers {{in the beginning of the}} nineteenth century, and created a militaristic kingdom in the region. [...] The Mfecane also led to the formation and consolidation of other groups — such as the Ndebele Kingdom, the Mfengu and the Makololo — and the creation of states such as the modern Lesotho.|$|E
2500|$|Tutu {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to serve a seven-year term as dean, however after seven months he was nominated as a candidate in an election for the position of Bishop of Lesotho. Although Tutu stipulated {{that he did not want}} the position, he was elected to the position regardless in March 1976, at which he reluctantly accepted it. This decision upset some of his congregation, who felt that he had used their parish as a stepping stone for his personal career advancement. In July, Bill Burnett consecrated Tutu as a bishop at St Mary's Cathedral. In August, Tutu was enthroned as the Bishop of Lesotho in a ceremony at Maseru's Cathedral of St Mary and St James; thousands attended, including King Moshoeshoe II and Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan. In this position, he travelled around the diocese, often visiting parishes in the mountains. He learned the <b>Sesotho</b> language and developed a deep affection for the country. He appointed Philip Mokuku as the first dean of the diocese and places great emphasis on further education for the Basotho clergy. He befriended the royal family although his relationship with Jonathan's right-wing government, of which he disapproved, was strained. In September 1977 he returned to South Africa after being invited to speak at the Eastern Cape funeral of Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko, who had been killed by police while in their custody. At the funeral, Tutu stated that Black Consciousness was [...] "a movement by which God, through Steve, sought to awaken in the black person a sense of his intrinsic value and worth as a child of God".|$|E
50|$|<b>Sesotho</b> has {{developed}} a sizable media presence {{since the end of}} apartheid. Radio Lesedi is a 24-hour <b>Sesotho</b> radio station run by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, broadcasting solely in <b>Sesotho.</b> There are other regional radio stations as well throughout Lesotho and the Free State. Half-hour <b>Sesotho</b> news bulletins are broadcast daily on a government TV station. Independent TV broadcaster, eTV, also features a daily half-hour <b>Sesotho</b> bulletin. Both SABC and the eTV group produce a range of programs that feature at least some <b>Sesotho</b> dialogue.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sesotho</b> {{is one of}} the Languages of South Africa, {{according}} to the South African National Census of 2011, almost 4 million people speak <b>Sesotho</b> as a first language [...] including 62% of the inhabitants of the Free State speak <b>Sesotho</b> as a first language. Approximately, 13.1% of the residents of Gauteng speak <b>Sesotho</b> as a first language. In the North West Province, 5% of the population speak <b>Sesotho</b> as a first language, with a concentration of speakers in the Maboloka region. 3% of Mpumalanga's people speak <b>Sesotho</b> as a first language, with many speakers living in the Standerton area. 2% of the residents of the Eastern Cape, chiefly in the northern regions of the province, speak <b>Sesotho</b> as a first language.|$|E
5000|$|Just as the <b>Sesotho</b> {{sentence}} centres on the <b>Sesotho</b> noun, the noun {{is made to}} [...] "concòrd" [...] ("agree") {{with the}} verbs, pronouns, and qualificatives describing it {{by a set of}} <b>Sesotho</b> noun concords.|$|E
5000|$|The {{language}} of the Basotho {{is referred to as}} <b>Sesotho</b> or less commonly <b>Sesotho</b> sa borwa). Some texts may refer to <b>Sesotho</b> as [...] "Southern Sotho" [...] to differentiate it from Northern Sotho, also called Pedi.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from acting}} as state ministers, missionaries (primarily Casalis and Arbousset) played {{a vital role}} in {{delineating}} <b>Sesotho</b> orthography and printing <b>Sesotho</b> language materials between 1837 and 1855. The first <b>Sesotho</b> translation of the Bible appeared in 1878.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sesotho</b> nouns signify {{concrete}} or abstract {{concepts in}} the language, but are {{distinct from the}} <b>Sesotho</b> pronouns.|$|E
5000|$|The popular monthly {{magazine}} Bona includes <b>Sesotho</b> content. Since the codification of <b>Sesotho</b> orthography, {{literary works}} {{have been produced}} in <b>Sesotho.</b> Amongst the most notable are Thomas Mofolo's epic, [...] "Chaka", which has been translated into several languages including English and German ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sesotho</b> is {{the first}} {{language}} of 1.5 million people in Lesotho, or 85% of the population. <b>Sesotho</b> {{is one of the}} two official languages in Lesotho, the other being English. Lesotho enjoys one of Africa's highest literacy rates, with 59% of the adult population being literate chiefly in <b>Sesotho.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most {{newspapers}} in Lesotho are written either mainly in <b>Sesotho</b> or in both <b>Sesotho</b> and English; currently, in South Africa, {{there is one}} mainstream magazine, namely Bona; there are no fully fledged {{newspapers in}} <b>Sesotho</b> though except for regional newsletters in Qwaqwa, Fouriesburg, Ficksburg and possibly other Free State towns.|$|E
5000|$|More {{often than}} not {{compounds}} that are written as one word in South African <b>Sesotho</b> will be written with dashes in Lesotho <b>Sesotho</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{one point}} that seems to often confuse authors who attempt to study the {{dialectology}} of <b>Sesotho</b> is the term Basotho, which can variously mean [...] "Sotho-Tswana speakers," [...] "Sesotho and Northern <b>Sesotho</b> speakers," [...] "Sesotho speakers," [...] and [...] "residents of Lesotho." [...] The Nguni language Phuthi has been heavily influenced by Sesotho; its speakers have mixed Nguni and Sotho-Tswana ancestry. It seems that it is sometimes treated erroneously as a dialect of <b>Sesotho</b> called [...] "Sephuthi." [...] However, Phuthi is mutually unintelligible with standard <b>Sesotho</b> and thus cannot in any sense be termed a dialect of it. The occasional tendency to label all minor languages spoken in Lesotho as [...] "dialects" [...] of <b>Sesotho</b> is considered patronising, {{in addition to being}} linguistically inaccurate and in part serving a national myth that all citizens of Lesotho have <b>Sesotho</b> as their mother tongue.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Sesotho,</b> nngwe is {{a variant}} (allomorph) of the {{adjective}} stem -ng {{used only for}} Class 9 nouns. The use of the number [...] "one" [...] in <b>Sesotho</b> {{is different from the}} other Sotho-Tswana languages, because the <b>Sesotho</b> -ng is an irregular enumerative which behaves sometimes like an adjective and can therefore become a noun.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sesotho</b> syllables {{tend to be}} open, with syllabic nasals and the syllabic approximant l also allowed. Unlike {{almost all}} other Bantu languages, <b>Sesotho</b> does not have prenasalized consonants (NC).|$|E
50|$|Aside from Lesotho and South Africa, 60,000 {{people speak}} Silozi (a close {{relative}} of <b>Sesotho)</b> in Zambia. Small numbers of <b>Sesotho</b> speakers reside in Botswana, Swaziland and the Caprivi Strip of Namibia.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, being {{derived from}} a {{language}} or dialect very closely related to modern <b>Sesotho,</b> the Zambian Sotho-Tswana language Lozi is also sometimes cited as a modern dialect of <b>Sesotho</b> named Serotse or Sekololo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sesotho</b> has a {{relatively}} large number of affricates. The velar affricate, which was standard in <b>Sesotho</b> until the early 20th century, now only occurs in some communities {{as an alternative to}} the more common velar fricative.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{stress system}} of <b>Sesotho</b> (often called [...] "penultimate lengthening" [...] instead, {{though there are}} certain {{situations}} where it doesn't fall on the penultimate syllable) is quite simple. Each complete <b>Sesotho</b> word has exactly one main stressed syllable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sesotho</b> {{is used in}} a {{range of}} {{educational}} settings both as a subject of study and as a medium of instruction. It is used in its spoken and written forms in all the spheres of education from pre schooling to doctoral studies. Difficulties still exist when <b>Sesotho</b> is used as a technical language in the fields of commerce, information technology, science, mathematics and law since the corpus of technical materials in <b>Sesotho</b> is still relatively small.|$|E
5000|$|<b>SeSotho</b> (<b>Sesotho</b> or Southern <b>SeSotho),</b> a Southern Bantu language, is the {{national}} language of Lesotho, and is spoken by most Basotho. [...] It was recognized as {{the national}} language by the National and Official Languages Bill, ratified by the National Assembly of Lesotho on 12 September 1966, which also established Sotho and English as the country's two official languages. [...] The country's language policy promotes bilingualism, and Chapter 1 of the Constitution of Lesotho states: The official languages of Lesotho shall be <b>Sesotho</b> and English and, accordingly, no instrument or transaction shall be invalid by reason only that it is expressed or conducted {{in one of those}} languages. The Constitution of Lesotho, 1993 ...|$|E
50|$|No {{official}} statistics data on second language usage are available, but {{a conservative estimate}} {{of the number of}} people who speak <b>Sesotho</b> as a second (or later) language is 5 million. <b>Sesotho</b> is one of the 11 official languages in South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sotho" [...] is {{also the}} name given to the entire Sotho-Tswana group, in which case <b>Sesotho</b> proper is called [...] "Southern Sotho". Within the Sotho-Tswana group, <b>Sesotho</b> proper is most closely related to Lozi (Silozi), with which it forms the Sesotho-Lozi group within Sotho-Tswana.|$|E
5000|$|The English {{text of the}} {{constitution}} signed by president Nelson Mandela on 16 December 1996 uses (mostly) {{the names of the}} languages expressed in those languages themselves. <b>Sesotho</b> refers to Southern Sotho, and isiNdebele refers to Southern Ndebele. Controversy surrounds the designation of Northern <b>Sesotho</b> as Sepedi (its main dialect) instead of the comprehensive <b>Sesotho</b> sa Leboa (which had been the wording in the Interim Constitution of 1993). [...] The spelling of Venda is also incorrectly rendered as Tshivenda instead of the correct Tshivenḓa.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{the people}} in Matlwangtlwang speak <b>seSotho.</b> In the actual town of Steynsrus the {{majority}} (70.8%) of residents speak Afrikaans while most of the black minority speaks <b>seSotho</b> and a few whites (as well as most of the Asian population) profess English as their mother tongue.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Sesotho</b> {{parts of}} speech convey the most basic {{meanings}} and functions of {{the words in the}} language, which may be modified in largely predictable ways by affixes and other regular morphological devices. Each complete word in the <b>Sesotho</b> language must comprise some [...] "part of speech." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ditema tsa Dinoko (<b>Sesotho</b> for [...] "Ditema syllabary"), {{also known}} by its Zulu name, Isibheqe Sohlamvu, and various other related names in {{different}} languages, is a contemporary writing system (specifically, a featural syllabary) associated with litema, {{that is used to}} write <b>Sesotho</b> (and all other Southern Bantu languages).|$|E
5000|$|Like {{almost all}} other Niger-Congo languages, <b>Sesotho</b> is a tonal language, spoken with two basic tones, high (H) and low (L). The <b>Sesotho</b> {{grammatical}} tone system (unlike the lexical tone system used in Mandarin, for example) is rather complex {{and uses a}} large number of [...] "sandhi" [...] rules.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sesotho</b> {{has a large}} {{inventory}} of vowels compared with many other Bantu languages. However, the nine phonemic vowels are collapsed into only five letters in the <b>Sesotho</b> orthography. The two close vowels i and u (sometimes called [...] "superclose" [...] or [...] "first-degree" [...] by Bantuists) are very high (with advanced tongue root) and are better approximated by French vowels than English vowels. That {{is especially true for}} , which, in English, is often noticeably more front and can be transcribed as [...] or [...] in the IPA; that is absent from <b>Sesotho</b> (and French).|$|E
5000|$|The {{phonology}} of <b>Sesotho</b> {{and those}} of the other Sotho-Tswana languages are radically different from those of [...] "older" [...] or more [...] "stereotypical" [...] Bantu languages. Modern <b>Sesotho</b> in particular has very mixed origins (due to the influence of Difaqane refugees) inheriting many words and idioms from non-Sotho-Tswana languages.|$|E
