Investigated concretes varied in, both, chemical and mineralogical compositions. The sintering process during <b>secondary</b> state <b>creep</b> within refractory concrete has an isothermal character. Thus, {{an attempt was made}} to describe the mentioned process quantitatively. Creep was investigated at three different temperatures: 1200, 1300 and 1400 ºC. Variations of the microstructure of concrete samples, exposed to constant static pressure and constant temperature during certain time-intervals, were investigated using a scanning electron microscope. Obtained results of the investigation proved that creep resistance is an irreplaceable method when the decision about the best possible type of refractory concrete for application in metallurgical furnaces is required...|$|R
30|$|The {{settlement}} of structures on the fine-grained soil stratums {{due to the}} vertical stress increment {{is one of the}} most important problems in geotechnical engineering. The total {{settlement of}} a structure comprises three parts: (1) immediate (elastic) compression, (2) primary consolidation, (3) <b>secondary</b> consolidation (<b>creep).</b> Elastic settlement occurs immediately due to applied load without any change in the water content. Primary consolidation is a main component of settlement of fine-grained saturated soils having low permeability, because the excess pore water pressure dissipates with time. The <b>secondary</b> consolidation is <b>creep</b> of soils such as peats and soft organic clays under constant effective stress. The primary and secondary consolidation settlements can be several times greater than the elastic settlement in saturated fine-grained soils.|$|R

In contrast, large changes were observed for equivalent parameter for <b>secondary</b> <b>creep</b> rate. As a result of these differences, the Monkman-Grant correlation was sensitive to stress and temperature below 650 C. Metallurgical studies based on light and transmission electron microscopy suggested that the temperature and stress sensitivities of <b>secondary</b> <b>creep</b> rate at temperatures below 650 C were related to features of the substructure not present at higher temperature.

40|$|Peat {{has been}} {{considered}} a problematic geotechnical material, with extremely high water content, low shear strength and high compressibility. Although initially high, fibrous peat undergoes dramatic reductions in permeability under compression, with <b>secondary</b> compression (<b>creep)</b> accounting for {{a large proportion of}} the settlement under loading. The key to accelerating the whole consolidation process for fibrous/hemic peats is to create a means of accelerating water flow from micropores (within the cellular structure) or humus contained in the peat. This paper presents the results of preliminary laboratory trials performed using the hydraulic consolidation (Rowe) cell apparatus to investigate a novel approach involving the addition of salt grains to fibrous peat towards accelerating its rate of primary consolidation and reducing its creep rate. Under similar loading conditions, salt-treated specimens were found to have reduced rate and magnitude of creep settlement, explained by larger volumes of micropore water expelled during primary consolidation...|$|R

Homogenous, pore-free materials were obtained by chemical reaction between nickel and aluminum after complete infiltration with liquid aluminum of preforms of nickel wires (containing tungsten wires for the composites) with low surface-to-volume ratio, high permeability, and regular infiltration paths. Reactively-processed, monolithic NiAl exhibited compressive creep properties at 715 8 C and 1025 8 C in good agreement with those of conventionally processed NiAl. The compressive creep behavior of NiAl composites reinforced with 5 to 20 vol pct W was also characterized at the same temperatures.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the conditions for}} initiation and maintenance of secondary currents in open channel flows. By analyzing the Reynolds equation in the wall-normal and wall-tangent directions, this study reveals that, like other types of vortices, the secondary currents are originated in the near-boundary region, and the magnitude (or strength) of secondary flow {{is proportional to the}} lateral gradient of near-wall velocity. The near-wall secondary flow always moves from the region with lower velocity (or lower boundary shear stress) to the location with higher velocity (or higher boundary shear stress). Subsequently, the near-boundary <b>secondary</b> flow <b>creeps</b> into the main flow and drives circulation within a region enclosed by lines of zero total shear stress, leading to anisotropy of turbulence in the main flow region. This paper also discusses typical secondary currents in open channel flows and presents the relationship between sediment transport and secondary currents.

40|$|Destructive {{testing of}} creep exposed {{components}} {{is a powerful}} tool for evaluation of remaining lifetime of high temperature pipe systems. The most common destructive evaluation method used today is uniaxial creep testing. Uniaxial creep tests can produce accurate creep curves but the test method has some drawbacks such as costliness and long testing times. It also demands large sample material outtake which often involve weld repair. Impression creep (IC) testing is a relatively new alternative test method for evaluating primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>creep</b> rates. The scope of this work is to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of IC testing over uniaxial creep testing in order to determine its usefulness as a test method. A literature survey was carried out over the area creep testing of high temperature pipe systems, with particular focus on impression creep testing. The result of the literature survey clearly showed several benefits with impression creep testing.

Torsional, stress-strain curves show a decreasing modulus with increasing temperature from 2000 - 2850 °C. The rate of creep in this range is increased by increasing temperature and stress.
