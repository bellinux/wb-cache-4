5|$|Forum members whose ruses are {{discovered}} by their support groups are frequently banned from such communities—sometimes after demanding that site administrators do so—moving to other websites to display other ailments. Denise Grady noted in The New York Times {{that the woman}} with the eating disorder moved to a group for sexual abuse survivors then another where she claimed to be dying of AIDS. An article in The Weekend Australian highlighted an example of this in 2003: a woman in London admitted to belonging to online support forums dedicated to helping members cope with migraines, grieving over dead children, and breast cancer, all at the same time. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> psychiatrist that she would study a specific malady and subsequently present herself with its symptoms; her time at each forum followed a daily schedule. Others disappear and simply stop posting, such as the monk who claimed to have cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} before Ambrose was shuffled out from the {{environment}} portfolio, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary committee that Canada had paid its debts under the Kyoto Protocol only to have an Environment Canada official {{point out that the}} bill was still unpaid.|$|E
25|$|Her initial {{goal was}} to teach dance {{movement}} to deaf children, but she began a career in modelling and then began acting in television. Her first screen role was in the BBC series The Queen's Traitor in 1967, in which she played Mary, Queen of Scots. During an interview, thinking Barnet sounded uninteresting, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> reporter from the Northern Echo {{she was born in}} Casablanca, where her favourite Bogart/Bergman film was set.|$|E
5000|$|These days Dara {{lives in}} France {{and in the}} United States. Every year she travels to Cambodia. In 2000 <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{interviewer}} that [...] "Cambodia is where my heart is." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{interviewer}} from Zocalo Public Square {{that her}} {{introduction to the}} art world occurred in college when she worked for the Columbia Bartending Agency in New York—she bartended for Julian Schnabel parties at the Mary Boone gallery.|$|R
50|$|Saxton's first {{event was}} a Royal Performance for Queen Elizabeth II. Her firm, The Saxton Group, {{is known for}} staging fund raisers. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{interviewer}} that her proudest accomplishment was the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial {{at the behest of}} Ed Koch.|$|R
25|$|Madame Montour is {{believed}} to have been of Algonkin-French ancestry, born in Quebec. In one account, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> colonist in the 1740s that she had been taken captive in an Iroquois raid and adopted into an Iroquois family. (Her given name may have been Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, or Madeleine.). Speaking French and English, as well as Algonquian and Iroquoian languages, she became highly influential in New York, and acted as Governor Robert Hunter's personal interpreter.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, 2015, Cosby sued supermodel Beverly Johnson for defamation, {{claiming}} that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> false {{story in a}} Vanity Fair article. This {{was the first time}} Cosby had sued a woman who has claimed assault without being sued himself first. Cosby's lawsuit accuses Johnson of lying about the incident in which she says Cosby spiked a cup of cappuccino with an unknown drug. Realizing what was happening, Johnson said she screamed and cursed at him several times before Cosby dragged her out and hailed a cab for her. (No sexual contact by Cosby was alleged in Johnson's version of the event.) Allegedly, she also repeated the story in subsequent interviews and in her memoirs, released on August 25, 2015.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} two detectives in the nation's only {{full-time}} unit {{devoted to}} that specialty, she had gained some local media attention when she and her partner had recovered a statue stolen from Carthay Circle. To better understand the field, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> local newspaper, she had begun learning to paint. Off the job, she had been active in the Los Angeles Women Police Officers Association and organized childcare for families of officers. She also made chocolate-covered cherries and homemade soap for her neighbors in Simi Valley for Christmas. Since she was still with the department, they realized they would have to proceed carefully. Still, they ranked Lazarus as the least promising of the five suspects, since from what they read in the files Lazarus and Ruetten had ended any relationship they had had over the summer before the murder.|$|E
5000|$|Lenihan {{had arrived}} on Broadway {{only a short}} time before that and the initial joy of {{appearing}} on the stage had not yet worn off. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer: [...] "Here I am on Broadway. It does seem like a fairy tale." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{few days}} later, after her lackluster {{performance}} in the 4×100-meter medley relay where the team placed fourth, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer that <b>she</b> was on her period; many commended her decision to speak about this, menstruation being considered a taboo topic in sports.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the start}} of her term as commissioner, Craddick has been {{critical}} of federal intervention into the energy industries: [...] "Texas knows how energy regulation is done. People ought to be modeling themselves after us, instead of ... the EPA," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> energy policy group in Austin." ...|$|R
25|$|Lamphere {{represented}} an unresolved danger to Gunness; now Asle Helgelien was making inquiries that {{could very well}} send her to the gallows. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> lawyer in La Porte, M.E. Leliter, that she feared for her life and that of her children. Ray Lamphere, she said, had threatened to kill her and burn her house down. She wanted to make out a will, in case Lamphere went through with his threats. Leliter complied and drew up her will. She left her entire estate to her children and then departed Leliter's offices. She {{went to one of}} the La Porte banks holding the mortgage for her property and paid this off. She did not go to the police to tell them about Lamphere's allegedly life-threatening conduct. The reason for this, most later concluded, was that there had been no threats; she was merely setting the stage for her own arson.|$|E
500|$|Hogg never married; her biographer Bernhard {{reports that}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> friend [...] "she had gotten over 30 {{proposals}} of marriage but 'wouldn't {{have any of}} them'".|$|E
500|$|Nixon did not sport the {{outrageous}} fashions of the 1970s, {{because she was}} concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose. [...] "Always before, {{it was sort of}} fun to get some... thing that was completely different, high-style", <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> reporter. [...] "But this is not appropriate now. I avoid the spectacular." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “I am like <b>a</b> conductor,” <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer, “and Chagall is the music. I must {{understand}} the work of Chagall so profoundly that I myself do not exist.” Chagall called her “the Toscanini of tapestry,” and declared that “there {{will never be a}} tapestry by Chagall without you.” ...|$|R
5000|$|After the war {{was over}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{interviewer}} that even while she was kept in the concentration camp, she was much loved by German audiences: [...] "Because of Goebels' stupidity I was known here Germany. Although my records were banned, he sent them to all the at the front".|$|R
60|$|Tony did not for {{a moment}} doubt Cousin Maria's word when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him that George Mason had gone away. <b>She</b> never <b>told</b> <b>a</b> lie. The only trouble with her was that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> too much truth.|$|R
500|$|Dallas was {{the first}} woman on City Council, which brought challenges, not least of which was {{determining}} how other council members would treat her. She began by insisting that they not call her [...] "Mrs. Dallas." [...] and that they use the title [...] "councilman," [...] not [...] "councilwoman," [...] since that was how it was written in the city charter. [...] "In private life, I'm Mrs. George Dallas," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> reporter shortly after the election, [...] "but in public life I'm Constance H. Dallas. I object to the use of Mrs." ...|$|E
500|$|Her other {{comments}} also followed {{along the same}} lines. In a blog posting, she wrote, [...] "Apparently, {{they give you a}} detailed transaction of every text message sent and received. Completely unnecessary." [...] <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> USA Today reporter, [...] "This is so silly, there's no reason they need to send you this much information." [...] Ezarik is a heavy user who typically sends and receives tens of thousands of text messages a month, which generated an exceptionally long, $275 bill – 300 double-sided pages that had to be sent in a box with postage charges of $7.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence {{is probably one of the}} most powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Hollander {{began work}} on a memoir in visual form. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{interviewer}} of other plans: [...] "I always hope I'll have a show," [...] says Hollander. [...] "Now that I {{have time to think}} of these things, I'm thinking of approaching galleries with this work my house is full of." ...|$|R
50|$|Peyser {{moved to}} Hollywood upon landing a minor role in All the President's Men. Robert Redford, who {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the film, objected to casting a politician's daughter, but, as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer for People, she informed Redford that {{her father was a}} liberal Republican who had criticized Richard Nixon, and she got the part.|$|R
5000|$|Cullors recalls {{being forced}} {{from her home}} at 16 when she {{revealed}} her queer identity to her parents. She was involved with the Jehovah's Witnesses as a child, but later grew disillusioned with the patriarchal church. She developed {{an interest in the}} Nigerian religious tradition of Ifá, incorporating its rituals into political protest events. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer: ...|$|R
500|$|Hepburn {{is one of}} {{the most}} celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her {{on-screen}} persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> journalist, [...] "I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite personality and I liked material that showed that personality." [...] Playwright and author David Macaray has said, [...] "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in and ask yourself if she's not playing, essentially, the same part over and over... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress." [...] Another repeated criticism is that her demeanor was too cold.|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, McKenzie {{turned her}} {{attention}} increasingly to teaching other women about electricity and radio. She had observed the need over years of {{working in the field}} herself. In 1925, she told the Australian Woman's Mirror: [...] "here are such a lot of women experimenters [...] that I would like to form a Women's Wireless Club.' In 1931 <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> Sunday Sun reporter that she wanted to see a course of lectures on domestic radio and electricity established in girls' schools and technical colleges. The following year she took matters into her own hands, opening a Women's Radio College on Phillip Street in 1932. She persuaded employers to take on some of her trainees, as one of them later recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|Paige {{has gained}} herself a {{reputation}} as someone who can be [...] "difficult". [...] The Times Brian Logan wrote, [...] "Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word 'difficult' is often applied". On one occasion, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> male interviewer {{that she was going}} to stop giving interviews to female reporters because, in her own words, [...] "I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time". What has been seen as a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan, but Paige has said that a common misconception of her is that she is confident and very serious. [...] Another editor found her [...] "refreshingly down-to-earth" [...] and [...] "very friendly".|$|E
5000|$|Hoag {{was born}} in Cresco, Iowa {{and raised in the}} small town of Harmony, Minnesota. From childhood, she knew she wanted to be a writer. [...] "I had to spend a lot of time {{entertaining}} myself," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer in 2016. [...] "I found books at a really young age and fell in love with books." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{describes}} herself as [...] "a single woman", even though [...] "I was always a great believer in romance and partnership." [...] "I {{would like to be}} in close association with a man whose work I respect," [...] <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer, attributing her unmarried status to {{the fact that she was}} [...] "not willing to compromise." ...|$|R

500|$|Chestnut, {{who plays}} Phillips, {{a police officer}} and Turner's boyfriend, {{prepared}} by riding along with Los Angeles police officers to observe {{what it is like}} to be an officer in a squad car and Berry prepared for the role by visiting a call center and observing the operators at work. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> Miami Herald interviewer, [...] "You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. They would just be as cool as can be doing their thing. I thought, 'I could never do this job.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Webster persuaded Thomas to {{keep her}} on for a further three days until Sunday 2 March. She had Sunday afternoons off as a half-day and was {{expected}} to return in time to help Thomas prepare for evening service at the local Presbyterian church. On this occasion, however, Webster visited the local alehouse and returned late, delaying Thomas' departure. The two women quarrelled and {{several members of the}} congregation later reported that Thomas had appeared [...] "very agitated" [...] on arriving at the church. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> fellow congregant that she had been delayed by [...] "the neglect of her servant to return home at the proper time", and said that Webster had [...] "flown into a terrible passion" [...] upon being rebuked. Thomas returned home from church early, about 9pm, and confronted Webster. According to Webster's eventual confession: ...|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to}} take good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
50|$|On July 22, 1965, {{she married}} actor Cary Grant, who was 33 years her senior. They had one daughter, Jennifer (born February 26, 1966), {{who also is}} an actress. They were {{divorced}} on March 21, 1968. In 1972, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer that <b>she</b> was involved in Primal therapy. Cannon married real estate investor Stanley Fimberg in 1985. They divorced in 1991.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is married}} to artist and {{photographer}} Katie Aaberg who collaborates with her husband on PORK. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer for Tension Magazine that people do not always understand their {{sense of humor and}} that they frequently receive hate mail from [...] "activists" [...] who lecture them on appropriate behavior, but [...] "cultural ownership" [...] is against their artistic vision.|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to Brooklyn Goldberg took several jobs, including {{working on a}} production of a Stephen King horror movie. She was let go from that job, which brought an unforeseen benefit - the six months of unemployment benefits checks gave her sufficient time to finish Bee Season ("It was a grant, as far as I was concerned", <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> Oberlin student interviewer in 2005).|$|R
