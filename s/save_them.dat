5|$|Thousands of Jewish refugee {{children}} {{arrived at}} Liverpool Street {{in the late}} 1930s {{as part of the}} Kindertransport rescue mission to <b>save</b> <b>them</b> in the run up to World War II. The Für Das Kind Kindertransport Memorial sculpture by artist Flor Kent was installed at the station in September 2003 commemorating this event.

The objects included in the sculpture began to deteriorate in bad weather, and a replacement bronze memorial, Kindertransport – The Arrival by Frank Meisler was installed as a replacement at the main entrance in November 2006. The child statue from the Kent memorial was re-erected separately in 2011.|$|E
5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward the icon that will <b>save</b> <b>them.</b> This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
