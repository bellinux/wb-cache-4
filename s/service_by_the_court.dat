As distorções cognitivas são examinadas no conteúdo do que é expresso e na possibilidade de contextualização da resposta dada. Participaram cinco homens, com idades entre 37 e 73 anos, acusados de abuso sexual contra crianças de até 13 anos de idade. Um participou espontaneamente e quatro foram compulsoriamente encaminhados pela justiça ao serviço. Uma ficha biossociodemográfica e uma entrevista semi-estruturada foram utilizadas.

[...] But there are two reasons why the jury did not reach that issue in this case. In the first place, North Carolina does not seek to sustain the judgment below on that ground. Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered 'to have been actually domiciled in Nevada.' In the second place, the verdict against petitioners was a general one. “It was there held that a divorce granted by Nevada, on a finding that one spouse was domiciled in Nevada, must be respected in North Carolina, where Nevada's finding of domicile was not questioned though the other spouse had neither appeared nor been served with process in Nevada and though recognition of such a divorce offended the policy of North Carolina.” [...] The ruling: both Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix were “convicted of bigamous cohabitation” [...] and were sentenced to a term of years in a state prison.|$|R

The ability to allocate some of a corporate seller’s purchase price in a sale of assets to an individual shareholder rather than to the corporation saves that individual shareholder from being subject to the double taxation of a C corporation. Despite its ability to save on taxes, company advisors are reluctant to allocate part of a purchase price to personal goodwill because of the uncertainty surrounding how to have <b>the</b> allocation respected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Service</b> and upheld <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b> While commentators believe that they {{have come up with a}} list of criteria that will pass muster with <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> those same commentators admit that following the list only makes it less likely that the allocation will be respected, not that it is foolproof. However, even the commentators have missed <b>the</b> mark slightly. <b>By</b> taking a fresh, in-depth look at the cases that created the concept of allocating personal goodwill, this article discloses what the accepted criteria list left out, what the real requirements have been, and why those requirements aren’t supportable. Finally, this article proposes a simple legislative fix that would provide certainty in the world of personal goodwill, allowing taxpayers and practitioners the assurance that their allocations would not just survive a deficiency claim from the Service, but actually reduce the ability of the Service to make that claim in the first place...|$|R

The data collection and the set hypothesis verification in the theoretical part of the paper were carried out using a quantitative research, the method of document analysis, the technique of secondary data analysis. The qualitative part of the research used the method of questioning, the technique of standardized interview. Interviews were carried out with law court staff and probation staff during April 2010. Based on these interviews, we obtained the opinions of the professional staff of the adoption of the new Penal Code, in particular with regard to the changes this new code brings to the punishment of community service. The research has shown that the imposition of <b>the</b> community <b>service</b> punishment <b>by</b> <b>the</b> law <b>courts</b> in <b>the</b> Pilsen region does not drop { [...] } it still remains on the level of about 19. 3 % {{of the total number of}} condemned in criminal cases.

Unfortunately, even a perfect legal regulation cannot guarantee a proper function of the entire system. What is essential is the cooperation of all the bodies concerned, the correct application of legal regulations and, last but not least, the attitude of the society.

A demora na tramitação dos processos judiciais constitui um grave problema da Justiça. A eficiência do Poder Judiciário em distribuir justiça está condicionada à prestação jurisdicional rápida, à efetividade do processo. As transformações sociais, econômicas, tecnológicas têm operado muitas mudanças na rotina dos Tribunais. Uma delas é a implantação do sistema de gestão da qualidade nas serventias judiciais. A qualidade da prestação jurisdicional dependerá da gestão imprimida pelo juiz na sua unidade. Diante disso, o presente trabalho destina-se a apresentar uma proposta de sistema de gestão no âmbito da Vara da Infância e Juventude de Porto Velho, Estado de Rondônia, dividido em catorze etapas: foco da organização, direcionadores estratégicos, planejamento da gestão, estrutura organizacional, comunicação, gestão de pessoas, infraestrutura, processos de trabalho, documentos e normas, registros, medição, tratamento de falhas, análise crítica e avaliação dos resultados.

The acting in this field impacts the legitimacy of the judiciary, and can raise it all the more satisfied the social expectations. The management concepts and their implementation should be part of judicial activities, from senior administration to the operation of the judicial unit. There is a need, therefore, for a management system that permeates all the activities. Since 1995 <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Rio Grande do Sul has adopted the Gaucho Programme of Quality and Productivity (PGQP) through the Quality Management Plan for the judiciary in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (PGQJ).

40|$|M. B. A. An {{investigation}} into the application of judicial case management in the South African civil court system to enhance quality and access to justice. Background The South African judicial system, and in particular, <b>the</b> lower <b>Courts</b> have been plagued by inefficiency and inadequate use of its resources. This, in turn, has lead to inordinate delays in the prosecution of both civil and criminal matters. This research will however focus on the civil prosecution of cases. Ultimately, the quality of service being provided to {{both internal and external}} customers is lacking and is evidenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slow pace of cases through the system. The civil justice system in South Africa is in need of an overhaul as the quality of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> has been questioned extensively. The focus of this research is to look at judicial case management {{as well as some of}} the current factors that may be responsible for the delays in the civil justice system and to propose judicial case management as a possible solution to enhance quality in the South African judicial system. Related to the concept of quality are productivity and efficiency and, by implication, these areas may also be improved. Accordingly, this study will assess the current situation in the South African civil justice system and investigate if judicial case management will assist in achieving quality and productivity. IV Objectives The overall objective of this study is to formulate recommendations to enhance quality and access the civil justice system.
