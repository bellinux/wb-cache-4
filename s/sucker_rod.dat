50|$|The {{surface unit}} {{transfers}} energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> string. In doing this, it must change the rotary {{motion of the}} prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b> And it must reduce {{the speed of the}} prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of thencrank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> string above stuffing box. The polished rod and stuffing box combination is used to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface.|$|E

5000|$|The sub-surface pump {{displaces}} {{the fluid}} {{at the bottom}} of the well thus lowering the bottom hole pressure.The movement of the plunger and the traveling valve helps to create a low pressure thus moving fluid up the well. The traveling valve is opened on the down stroke and closed on the upstroke. It is on the up stroke that it carries the fluid up the well. The <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is usually 25 ft. long. There are 3 types of pumping units: Class 1, Mark 2, or air balanced. By changing the stroke length or the pump rate the production rate can be changed.|$|E
50|$|At {{the bottom}} of the tubing is the {{down-hole}} pump. This pump has two ball check valves: a stationary valve at bottom called the standing valve, and a valve on the piston connected to {{the bottom of}} the sucker rods that travels up and down as the rods reciprocate, known as the traveling valve. Reservoir fluid enters from the formation into {{the bottom of the}} borehole through perforations that have been made through the casing and cement (the casing is a larger metal pipe that runs the length of the well, which has cement placed between it and the earth; the tubing, pump, and <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> are all inside the casing).|$|E

50|$|A DOWS {{system is}} {{installed}} {{at the bottom of}} an oil well, it separates oil and water in the wellbore. The oil rich stream is brought to the surface while the water rich stream is pumped into an injection formation without ever coming to the surface. A DOWS system includes many components but the two primary components are an oil/water separation system and a pumping/injection system used to lift oil to the surface and inject the water into a deeper formation. Two basic types of DOWS systems have been developed, one type uses hydrocyclones to mechanically separate oil and water and the other relies on gravity separation that takes place in the wellbore. Three basic types of pumping/injection systems are used with the DOWS technology. These include electrical submersible pumps, progressive cavity pumps and <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumps. Hydrocyclone separators are usually used with the electrical submersible pumps because of higher drawdown created with effective injection of water into the lower zone.|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> with relatively heavy weight, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is much lighter. So it {{can reduce the}} polished rod load (Hicks 1986). Considering that fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> cannot bear compressive stress, a length of steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is needed {{to be connected to}} the bottom of the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
30|$|Development of {{fiberglass}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> {{for use in}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping {{oil wells}} was started in 1973, based {{on the need for}} a <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> that could pump under highly corrosive and heavily loaded condition (Saul III and Detterick 1980). In contrast to standard steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> with relatively heavy weight, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> bodies are much lighter. That is because fiberglass has a low density. Thus, using fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> can significantly reduce the gravity load acting on the polished rod.|$|E
30|$|Carbon fiber <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> {{and wire}} rope <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> are also {{lightweight}} sucker rod; however, their application is limited {{compared with the}} fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b> So we chose fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> as a representative technique to study. The research of wire rope <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> started in 1960 s. Some field tests showed that it could greatly reduce the polished rod load and energy consumption (Tan and Zhang 2005); however, it is rarely used in fields and seen in the studies nowadays. Carbon fiber <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> {{seems to be a}} potential technique to resolve some problems for deep-rod pumping, though it is not used as commonly as fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b> Xinjiang oilfield in China has started to conduct the field test recently, and carbon fiber <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> shows good performance (Zhao et al. 2016).|$|E
30|$|However, {{relatively}} heavy, stiff steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> must be run on {{the bottom}} of the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> interval, because fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is weak when loaded in compression. If the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is subjected to compression, the rod string body could be crushed beneath the wedges and a pullout failure could occur (Gibbs 1991).|$|E

30|$|Due to {{its special}} structure, the force {{condition}} of the side-flow pump {{is different from that}} of the conventional pump. When the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping system works, the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> connected to the polished rod performs vertical reciprocating motion. Thus, we choose the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> and plungers as the object of the force analysis. The result is shown in Fig.  2.|$|E
30|$|Because using {{fiberglass}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> {{does not}} change the structure of the pumping system, we do not need to conduct force analysis as we have done on the former two technologies. We can use the conventional model to calculate the polished rod load; however, {{it should be noted that}} the formulas for calculating the natural frequency and the elastic modulus of the composite <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> are more complex compared with the all steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> (Li 1991).|$|E
30|$|Side-flow {{pump can}} largely reduce the liquid {{pressure}} load, but its reduction {{effect for the}} polished rod load is very limited. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump also reduces the liquid pressure load. On the contrary, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> can greatly reduce the polished rod load by decreasing {{the weight of the}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b> Rod load reducer does not change the previous load; instead, it can create an additional reduction force. Among them, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is the most effective rod load reduction technique.|$|E
40|$|For low {{pressure}} reservoir, {{it is possible}} to produce a large number of washing fluid flowing into the formation, which affects the well production recovery. The application of hollow <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> hot flushing technology can avoid fluid pouring back into the formation, and the wells can keep production. Based on the principle of hollow <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> hot flushing and heat transfer theory, calculation model of temperature field was established, and hollow <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> hot flushing simulation system was developed, which can guide flushing in oilfield...|$|E
30|$|Polished rod load of the {{pumping system}} was {{induced by the}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> that drives the pump to reciprocate. The {{polished}} rod load included <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> and fluid weight load, inertial load, vibration load, friction load and elastic force etc. Polished rod load reduction was a very effective method to improve the working performance of pumping system. Many researchers devoted to design a shock absorber to reduce the dynamic load of the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod,</b> to design a rod centralizer for reducing the friction load, or to design a load reducer for reducing polished rod load.|$|E
30|$|The {{load reducer}} for the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> could {{decrease}} the suspension load {{and increase the}} pumping system efficiency, and could increase {{the depth of the}} pump by the same type beam pumping units. Guo (2014) proposed a design method of the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> string with load reducer in oil pumping system. Zhao et al. (2012) established the simulation model of the longitudinal vibration of the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> string with a load reducer according to the wave equation (Gibbls 1963) and the hydraulic feedback balance model (Guo 2014), and built the difference scheme method to achieve the numerical results.|$|E

40|$|The centralizers can add the {{polished}} rod load, and affect the pumping system efficiency. A pumping system efficiency {{model has been}} built by considering the influence of centralizers on polished rod load. The influence of centralizers, stroke length, pumping speed and flooding period on <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping system efficiency and production has been studied. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping system efficiency and production rate decrease while the number of centralizer increases, but the influence of number of centralizer on <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping system efficiency and production rate is not big while the influence of stroke length and pumping speed is significant. The <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping system efficiency first increase obviously and then trend to be gentle with the stroke length and pumping speed increasing. The pumping system efficiency in main slug of ASP flooding is lowest. The optimization value of stroke length and pumping speed has been selected to maximize the pumping system efficiency. And hence get the reasonable pump depth, and system efficiency, it have reference significance to the reasonable production...|$|E
30|$|When using a side-flow pump, the {{resistance}} on the plunger {{caused by the}} liquid pressure would increase. This resistance may cause the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> to bend in downstroke. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump is not suitable for high production wells. Fiberglass–steel composite <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> {{cannot be applied to}} high temperature, heavy oil and deviated wells. Rod load reducer may increase the energy consumption of the pumping system. These limitations and disadvantages should be considered in practical application.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the fatigue life of <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> string, researchers had designed many kinds of shock absorber with an elastic elements such as spiral spring (Komarov and Sun 1981), dish-shaped spring (Komarov 1979; Velichkovich 2005), rubber spring (Zhao et al. 2014) or air spring (Mбaгиpoв and Zhu 1985). The elastic elements serve to both absorb and release energy and {{to act as a}} dampening agent which suppresses the oscillating harmonic motion in the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> string.|$|E
30|$|<b>Sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping is a {{traditional}} and widely used method of artificial lifting in the world’s oil industry. In recent years, on the one hand, as the natural energy has been depleted and working fluid level is going down, most of old oilfields in the late development stage need deep pumping techniques to increase oil production; on the other hand, deep reservoirs are gradually being developed. For example, the average reservoir depth in Tahe oilfield of Northwest China is more than 6000  m. With the complex geological conditions and bad fluid properties, the working fluid level is very low and rapidly dropping to the limit depth of conventional <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping system. The limit depth mainly depends on the polished rod load which increases with the pump depth. However, high polished rod load is disadvantageous to the whole system and even tends to exceed the operating range of the pumping unit. At present, aiming at the problem about how to reduce the polished rod load in the deep <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> pumping wells, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed. They are side-flow pump, rod load reducer, fiberglass–steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> and deep pumping with small-diameter pump.|$|E
