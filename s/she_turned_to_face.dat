5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
60|$|Startled out of {{her happy}} pensiveness by that smooth and now unutterably {{sinister}} voice, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> its owner.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} Virginia stood {{on the end of}} the porch, until the heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence gaze upon her before <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him.|$|E
50|$|The {{final scene}} is of Kuba and Sylwia in the bathtub. After {{giving her a}} short {{shoulder}} massage, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him and they stare impassively {{at each other for}} a few moments, before Kuba gets out of the tub and walks away.|$|R
5|$|Simultaneously, Peter (Joshua Jackson) {{has decided}} {{to open up to}} Olivia (Anna Torv) and shows her the five data discs from the shapeshifters he killed after the doomsday device weaponized him. As he {{discusses}} it with her, Olivia hears the sound of the bell. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Peter, revealing herself to now be possessed by Bell.|$|R
50|$|Mary is then shown alone {{near the}} river spoken of in the song. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the camera {{with a look of}} {{surprise}} on her face, and it is then made to look as if she lay in water. The next morning (as the song states), several people assist in arresting the male character in regard to her disappearance.|$|R
60|$|Rowan {{fell back}} in his chair, {{coughing}} violently. For several moments he was incapable of speech. Winifred knelt by his side. When he had finished coughing, she held a wineglass {{to his lips and}} made him sip its contents. He lay back now as though completely exhausted. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> these unwelcome visitors.|$|E
60|$|On the girl's lips was an avowal {{of her own}} love, but as {{she bent}} closer to whisper the words in his ear there came the sound of men {{crashing}} through the jungle, and as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the peril that she thought approaching, von Horn sprang into view, while directly behind him came her father and Sing Lee.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! No! This is {{no place}} for aristos," [...] cried one of the women in a voice which many excesses and many vices had {{rendered}} hoarse and rough. [...] "Spy or not, we don't want you in here. Do we?" [...] she added as with arms akimbo <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> those of her own sex, who behind the men had come up in order {{to see what was going}} on.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him. <b>She</b> {{was pale}} to the lips, and her hazel eyes were blazing, as she cut into his apologies for Blood.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> stopped, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him, an {{incredible}} shyness seeming to cause her to avoid his gaze.|$|R
60|$|Presently <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> {{him almost}} suddenly, and smiled with the easiest {{assurance}} of friendship.|$|R
60|$|From his apparel, {{he was a}} man of position, and he {{was evidently}} in heated {{discussion}} with some one whom Norman of Torn could not see. The man, a great, tall black-haired and mustached nobleman, was pounding upon a table to emphasize his words, and presently he sprang up as though rushing toward the one to whom he had been speaking. He disappeared from the watcher's view for a moment and then, at the far side of the apartment, Norman of Torn saw him again just as he roughly grasped the figure of a woman who evidently was attempting to escape him. As <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> her tormentor, all the devil in the Devil of Torn surged in his aching head, for the face he saw was that of Joan de Tany.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> me with {{flashing}} eyes. [...] "You {{know best}}!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You know best {{and tell me}} that! Never until this moment have you spoken falsely. Oh, why have you said such things to me--named after this place, Riolama? Am I also like that false water you speak of--no divine Rima, no sweet Rima? My mother, had she no mother, no mother's mother? I remember her, at Voa, before she died, and this hand seems real--like yours; you have asked to hold it. But it is not he that speaks to me--not one that showed me the whole world on Ytaioa. Ah, you have wrapped yourself in a stolen cloak, only you have left your old grey beard behind! Go back to the cave and look for it, and leave me to seek my people alone!" ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{person in}} clown attire was spotted in a {{cemetery}} in Chicago, Illinois in July 2015. This occurrence involved two residents who spotted the [...] "creepy clown" [...] scaling the {{gate at the}} Rosehill Cemetery late at night. After the clown entered the cemetery, he or <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the residents and began waving slowly as they made a video recording. After waving for a few seconds, the clown ran into a dark wooded area and was not seen again. Police investigation of the sighting {{did not lead to}} any arrests.|$|E
50|$|The {{linesmen}} are {{stationed in}} the opposite corners of the field from the referee, and use flags to signal their calls. Their task is to make judgements on line calls, similar to a soccer linesman. The observation area of the two linesmen is dependent on {{which of the two}} teams is currently attacking and which is defending. The linesman on the attacking side is responsible for the entire sideline to the end, and therefore he or <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the side line. The linesman on the defending side is level with the base line and is therefore solely responsible for observing that line. The linesmen change their observation areas as the play changes between attack and defense.|$|R
60|$|She {{held her}} arms out widely, and the {{moonlight}} shone in her eyes as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
60|$|She refused <b>to</b> be amused; <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> {{the window}} and put her {{handkerchief}} up under her veil.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} story {{recollection}} of the Noppera-bō comes from Lafcadio Hearn's book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things titled Mujina. The {{story of a man}} who travelled along the Akasaka road to Edo, he came across a young woman in a remote location near Kunizaka hill, crying and forlorn. After attempting to console the young woman and offer assistance, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him, startling him with the blank countenance of a faceless ghost. Frightened, the man proceeded down the road for some time, until he came across a soba vendor. Stopping to relax, the man told the vendor of his tale, only to recoil in horror as the soba vendor stroked his face, becoming a noppera-bō himself. It turns out that all of these noppera-bō were really just mujina in disguise.|$|E

500|$|The series premiere {{begins at}} Sunnydale High School, where a boy (played by Carmine Giovinazzo) breaks {{into the school}} during the night with a {{seemingly}} reluctant girl (Julie Benz), promising her mischief and therefore fun. Nervous and on edge, the girl says she thinks she heard something and fears someone is in the school, other than the two of them. The boy calls out but gets no response, leading him to say [...] "it's nothing" [...] to the girl and assure her that they [...] "are alone". The girl says [...] " [...] ok, that's good", after which <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the boy, revealing her facial morph into her true identity; a vampire. She then bites the boy's neck. She is later revealed to be Darla.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> him gratefully, {{but he did}} {{not meet}} her look. They were on the {{driveway}} of Fairview.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> {{the wall}} and never said a word, nor did any further {{conversation}} on these matters pass between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dearest, I {{must love}} anyone that you love." [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> his and whispered {{into his ear}} the name of Mr. Arabin.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the fire, {{gripped her}} hands upon her elbows, and drew her thin {{shoulders}} {{together in a}} shrug. [...] "Ugh!" [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|She tore herself away. But {{again he}} took her in his arms, {{and this time he}} kissed her on the mouth. <b>She</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> her <b>face</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the mention}} of love, a shuddering ran through her. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> me a <b>face</b> wild with anguish. [...] "No more of that! no more of that!" [...] gasped she--"talk not to me of love--I--I--am married!" ...|$|R
60|$|Nancy gave a {{quick glance}} at Littlefield, and saw him take out his pocket-knife and open it. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> obey orders, keeping up a rapid fire at the enemy.|$|R
60|$|Then I heard a {{voice calling}} me, and pushing past Mrs. Cowan, I ran into the cabin. Polly Ann lay on the log bedstead, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> mine a <b>face</b> radiant with a {{happiness}} I had not imagined.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ach Gott!" [...] {{she sighed}} {{by way of}} comment, and mused deeply {{for a moment before}} <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> me, as to {{something}} forgotten and remembered, and assumed the half-hearted meretricious smile.|$|R
50|$|After {{getting her}} inheritance, Ashley offers Spencer {{a trip to}} Cabo, but she declines because they both {{need to figure out}} their own paths in life. The night before Ashley leaves, she talks to Spencer and tries once more to keep her in her life. After hanging up the phone, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> over <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Aiden, and it is clear that she has slept with him yet again.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{begins with}} Reid {{sitting in the}} middle of crowds of people, mostly wearing dark colors. The words [...] "Alyssa Reid", [...] "The Game", and [...] "Directed by Marc Andre Debruyne" [...] appear and {{disappear}} quickly before the song starts. Then she stands up and starts singing. Occasionally, there are scenes of her singing in a lit-up alleyway. After the first verse is over, she appears singing the chorus in a blue room with fancy candlebras on the wall. There is a boy standing next to her, and the two seem to be ignoring each other completely. As scenes continue of her in the dark crowd and the lit-up alleyway, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the boy in the blue-room scene. Then, scenes appear of Reid walking past lines of people as she sings the second verse. She then performs for crowds in an old warehouse-like building. As the last chorus finishes, scenes show of her being lifted up by the dark crowd. The song finishes and the video fades away while she walks out of the lit-up alleyway.|$|R
60|$|Her pale lips curled {{a little}} bitterly, and suddenly, as a change {{seemed to come}} over her, they set that way. She looked up at Lane with a {{different}} light in her eyes. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the wall.|$|R
50|$|After Andy {{is killed}} in a manner {{reminiscent}} of Jeffrey Dahmer, M.J. deduces the killer to be Peter Foley (William McNamara). After leading a failed attempt to catch Foley at his house, M.J. discovers that he has kidnapped Helen and taken {{her back to the}} scene of Daryll Lee's attempt at killing her—the restroom of the lecture hall. Once she gets there, M.J. finds Helen bound and gagged in the same manner that Cullum did before, but she is ambushed and shot by Foley, rendering her unconscious. As Foley prepares to kill M.J., Helen desperately attempts to save her by ruining Foley's carefully replicated crime scene the only way she can—by attempting to hang herself. Foley panics and cuts Helen down, and Helen is able to get away and escape to the building's roof. Her agoraphobia kicks in again, and Helen finds herself cornered. Accepting her fate, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Foley. However, just as he is about to kill her, M.J. shoots him in the brachial nerve, giving him one last chance to surrender. When he pulls his gun back on her, however, she shoots him dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "O! no, no--I never shall," [...] she insisted, when {{he pressed}} her hand; and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> Lucetta's wall {{to hide her}} weeping. The farmer said he would give the young man half-an-hour for his answer, and went away, leaving the group sorrowing.|$|R
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> him again, a faint {{delicate}} flush was glowing, {{and there}} was again dawning that terrible shining of joy in her eyes, which really terrified him, and yet which he now wanted to see, because he feared the look of doubt still more.|$|R
