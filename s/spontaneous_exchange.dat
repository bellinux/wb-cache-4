A similar interfacial frozen-spin-mediated exchange bias effect has also been observed from Fe/Fe 3 O 4 core/shell and Fe 3 O 4 hollow-shell nanoparticles [14, 15]. Such pinned spins at the interface can further enhance the unidirectional anisotropy in the core/shell nanoparticles. In {{a recent study of}} the magnetic size dependence of strongly interacting NiO nanoparticles, we observed both a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias and vertical-loop shift [9]. The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias effect resulted from the setting up of unidirectional anisotropy across frustrated surface spins and the uncompensated antiferromagnetic core of NiO nanoparticles during the first field of hysteresis loop measurement, and it decreased with an increase of particle size. The observed vertical-loop shifts from bare NiO nanoparticles hint at the presence of strongly pinned spins at the interface of frustrated surface spins and the uncompensated antiferromagnetic core, which can further enhance the magnetic anisotropy.|$|E
40|$|Based {{on almost}} all {{the data from the}} {{literature}} on <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias (SEB), it is expected that the system will show SEB if it meets two conditions simultaneously: (i) there are the coexistence and competition of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) interactions and (ii) AFM interaction should dominate but not be too strong in this competition. In order to verify this view, a systematic study on SEB has been performed in this work. Mn 50 Ni 40 Sn 10 with strong FM interaction and without SEB is chosen as the mother composition, and the negative chemical pressure is introduced by the substitution of Sn by Si to enhance AFM interaction. It is found that a long-range FM ordering window is closed, and a long-range AFM ordering window is opened. As a result, SEB is triggered and a continuous tuning of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias field (HSEB) from 0 Oe to 1300 Oe has been realized in a Mn 50 Ni 40 Sn 10 −xSix system by the enhanced AFM interaction...|$|E

The zero-field-cooled hysteresis loop reveals their ferromagnetic behavior and effective <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias field of 60  Oe, {{due to the}} setting up of unidirectional anisotropy during the first field of hysteresis loop measurement. The analysis {{of a series of}} field-cooled M(H) reveals that the observed <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias and unidirectional anisotropy is mediated by strongly pinned spins at the interface of frustrated surface spins and uncompensated antiferromagnetic cores. The magnetization relaxation measured at different temperature shows the presence of multimagnetic anisotropy in the nanoparticles, which could possibly originate from strong interparticle interactions, broad size distributions, spin-glass behavior, and unidirectional anisotropy. However, observed memory effect only occurs when the field-cooling process has the characteristics of an (i) increase of magnetization with decrease of temperature and (ii) the fade out behavior with an increase of particle size rules out the possibility of the effect of strong interparticle interactions, broad size distributions, and spin-glass behavior. We conclude that the observed field-cooling memory effect from bare, small size NiO nanoparticles arises because of the unidirectional anisotropy which is mediated by the interfacial strongly pinned spins.|$|E

Here, we report an antisite disorder driven <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias effect {{as a result of}} hole carrier (Sr 2 +) doping in La 2 -xSrxCoMnO 6 (0 < x < 1) double perovskites. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have evidenced an increase in disorder with the increase of Sr content up to x = 0. 5 and thereby decreases from x = 0. 5 to 1. X-ray absorption spectroscopy has revealed that only Co is present in mixed valent Co 2 + and Co 3 + states with Sr doping to compensate the charge neutrality. Magnetotransport is strongly correlated with the increase of antisite disorder. The antisite disorder at the B-site interrupts the long-range ferromagnetic order by introducing various magnetic interactions and instigates reentrant glassy dynamics, phase separation and canted type antiferromagnetic behavior with the decrease of temperature.

This is a re-entrant spin cluster material which exhibits a non-negligible negative exchange bias effect {{when it is}} cooled in zero magnetic field from an unmagnetized state down to low temperature. X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and magnetometry results indicate mixed valence state at Co site, leading to competing magnetic phases and uncompensated spins at the magnetic interfaces.

These magnetoelectric composites are artificial multiferroic materials which exhibit both a coexistence and coupling of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering. This device architecture provides a route to control magnetism with electric fields via the application of mechanical stress. In the present work, magnetization behavior under mechanical stress of various magnetically coupled systems is investigated using both advanced computer simulations and experimental work. The application of voltage-controlled strain is shown to influence dipole coupled nanomagnet arrays and antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic (AFM-FM) <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias systems, which present pathways to engineered systems. Furthermore, the repeatable nature of these experiments presents unambiguous deterministic voltage control for both dipole-coupled systems and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>exchange</b> bias systems.

Cells were labeled with two different quantum dot nanocrystals (Qtracker 605 or 525) and intercellular exchange was quantified by high-throughput fluorescence imaging and FACS analysis.
