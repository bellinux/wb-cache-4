25|$|A {{new method}} of {{producing}} glass, {{known as the}} cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process {{was used by the}} Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} of road users would often {{be taken to}} extremes in schemes: by moving motor vehicles onto dedicated routes, their interaction with pedestrians or cycle routes might occur less often but at higher speeds than before, and thus be far more hazardous or intimidating. New towns like Milton Keynes could avoid this by placing motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians on separate levels and routes. However, their interaction would be a particular problem in the established towns, especially in the transition to suburban areas where separation would be more ambiguous and inconsistent. In the search for low casualty rates, urban planners now look to detailed road designs and traffic calming to counteract this affect by reducing vehicle speeds, or take more dramatic steps by destroying this separation and mixing all road users together through shared <b>space</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is a park in Mission Hill {{that is a}} walking, sitting {{park for}} the community, called the Kevin W. Fitzgerald Park. Formerly named Puddingstone Park because of the local rock sources, the park {{includes}} lawn space and asphalt walkways for people to walk on. The walkway is lined with benches for people to rest and enjoy the various views such as Lower Roxbury, the Fenway, and Back Bay. This park was previously {{one of the five}} quarries in Boston. This park was known as the Harvard Quarry. The operation of the quarry was ceased around 1910 and this left a 65-foot-high quarry wall. In 1964 Harvard University filled the land in. In the 1990s, the open <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> committee worked on preserving public access to the quarry. The community and the developer decided together that the walls of the old quarry would be preserved and they would create a new 6-acre open space for the community {{at the top of the}} puddingstone bowl. Harvard Quarry Urban Wild was then named Puddingstone Park. In November 2006, the park was renamed Kevin Fitzgerald Park in honor of the former Massachusetts State Representative.|$|E

[...] The main campus entrance road ascends a steep, well-groomed grassy slope past a huge stylized cross, known as the Phillips Theme Tower, symbolizing the university's dedication to its original Christian mission. Most buildings were constructed in a reinterpretation of Mediterranean Revival Style architecture (red tile roofs, white stuccoed walls, large tinted windows). [...] The majority of the construction on the main campus was completed in 1973.
