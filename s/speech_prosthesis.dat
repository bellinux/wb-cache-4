40|$|The use of <b>speech</b> <b>prosthesis</b> after total {{laryngectomy}} {{has become an}} international standard for voice restoration today. Provox II voice prosthesis is not permanently inserted, and as such, it must meet the criterion of achieving prolonged retention time {{within the walls of}} tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF). Complications after the insertion of <b>speech</b> <b>prosthesis</b> are familiar and anticipated but efforts are being made in order to reduce them. Part of the complications is caused by inadequate choice of the length of the prosthesis. The Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery in Rijeka conducted a study which included 91 patients in the period from 01. 01. 2004. to 31. 12. 2010. We used ultrasound and computerized neck tomography on 58 (63. 7 %) patients in preoperative procedure through which we determined the length of the subsequent TE fistula. At the same time we used this opportunity to specify the length of the <b>speech</b> <b>prosthesis</b> we have inserted primarily or secondary. The number of respondents who had complications, and with whom we used neck ultrasound during preoperative procedure {{in order to determine the}} length of the prosthesis, was significantly smaller than the number of respondents who had complications but with whom we did not use the above mentioned procedure (5. 6 % vs. 15. 5 %, p= 0. 042). Comparing our results to other studies, we believe that we managed to reduce the number of complications caused by inadequate length of the prosthesis, by routine preoperative use of neck ultrasound.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis took as its starting point {{the question of whether}} touch has the information processing characteristics required to deal with speech transforms. A review of the current status of tactile <b>speech</b> <b>prostheses</b> and of the range of potential limitations to touch's ability to deal with speech transforms, lead to the identification of two specific research foci. First, it was argued that an appropriate strategy for tactile aid development is to establish where tactile and auditory processes overlap and where they differ, then to take advantage of any similarities, or compensate for any differences, between these modalities {{in the design of the}} prosthesis. In line with this argument, a series of experiments was undertaken to test previous suggestions that there is an underlying similarity between auditory and tactile representations of stimuli. In support of these claims, it was found that auditory and tactile versions of patterns are easier to compare than are auditory and visual versions of those patterns. Subsequent research revealed that one aspect of this processing affinity between touch and hearing is that both modalities, unlike vision, process temporally distributed information more efficiently than spatially distributed information. This finding has broader theoretical significance in view of the current controversy regarding the division of senses according to a spatial vs temporal criterion. The second research focus addressed was whether touch has the spatial and temporal acuity required to deal with speech transforms. It was argued that the limiting factors in tactile spatial and temporal acuity were more likely to occur at the higher level of touch's ability to deal with the strong interactive effects between pattern elements, rather than at the lower level of two-point thresholds in time and space. As masking is a primary interactive force between tactile pattern elements, an attempt was made to resolve the ongoing debate regarding the extent to which tactile masking effects either limit the perception of complex tactile patterns by obscuring the identity of pattern elements or facilitate this task via a process of perceptual integration. This question was investigated by measuring the discriminability of three-element tactile patterns as the spatial and temporal separation, and hence the level of masking, between pattern elements was varied. It was expected that performance would De best at closer element spacings, due to the greater opportunity for perceptual integration to occur. Contrary to this prediction, it was found that the increasing levels of masking induced by decreasing the spatial and temporal separation between pattern elements caused a decrease in the discriminability of the patterns. One caveat to the acceptance of this result was the possibility that training may be required before touch can take advantage of any beneficial interactions between pattern elements, a possibility supported by the anecdotal reports of the subjects. Tentative support for this suggestion was provided by a pattern learning experiment involving three subjects from the previous experiment. After brief experience with closely spaced tactile patterns, the subjects were able to discriminate these stimuli at least as well as widely spaced tactile patterns. While failing to demonstrate the proposed beneficial effects of integration, these results did indicate that close spatial and temporal proximity between tactile pattern elements may not adversely affect the discriminability of those patterns. If subsequent research confirms this tentative finding, then the implication for tactile <b>speech</b> <b>prostheses</b> is that the display employed need not avoid the strong masking effects induced by close spatial and temporal proximity between speech pattern elements. In summary, this thesis showed that there is a general similarity between auditory and tactile perceptual representations of patterns which may both assist in the implementation of tactile <b>speech</b> <b>prostheses,</b> and advantage touch over vision for this purpose. Second, it appears that although tactile pattern perception is initially impeded by the occurrence of masking effects between pattern elements, this performance deficit may be removed once the observers have sufficient experience with the stimuli. There is, however, a clear need for further research before this tentative conclusion can be confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Cannulas {{and voice}} {{prostheses}} are mechanical aids {{for patients who}} had to undergo tracheotomy or laryngectomy for different reasons. For {{better understanding of the}} function of those artificial devices, first the indications and particularities of the previous surgical intervention are described {{in the context of this}} review. Despite the established procedure of percutaneous dilatation tracheotomy e. g. in intensive care units, the application of epithelised tracheostomas has its own position, especially when airway obstruction is persistent (e. g. caused by traumata, inflammations, or tumors) and a longer artificial ventilation or special care of the patient are required. In order to keep the airways open after tracheotomy, tracheostomy cannulas of different materials with different functions are available. For each patient the most appropriate type of cannula must be found. Voice prostheses are meanwhile the device of choice for rapid and efficient voice rehabilitation after laryngectomy. Individual sizes and materials allow adaptation of the voice prostheses to the individual anatomical situation of the patients. The combined application of voice prostheses with HME (Head and Moisture Exchanger) allows a good vocal as well as pulmonary rehabilitation. Precondition for efficient voice prosthesis is the observation of certain surgical principles during laryngectomy. The duration of the prosthesis mainly depends on material properties and biofilms, mostly consisting of funguses and bacteries. The quality of voice with valve prosthesis is clearly superior to esophagus prosthesis or electro-laryngeal voice. Whenever possible, tracheostoma valves for free-hand speech should be applied.

OBJETIVO: correlacionar a proficiência de voz e de fala de laringectomizados totais usuários de prótese traqueoesofágica com a pressão intraluminal da transição faringoesofágica no repouso e durante a fonação. MÉTODO: foram estudados 12 laringectomizados totais com voz traqueoesofágica, usuários de prótese fonatória, submetidos à coleta e registro do {{material}} de voz e da fala, que foram avaliados por três expertos, utilizando-se um protocolo de julgamento geral da comunicação traqueoesofágica. Em seguida, os indivíduos foram encaminhados à manometria esofágica para avaliar a pressão intraluminal da transição faringoesofágica durante a fonação e no repouso. RESULTADOS: durante a fonação, os indivíduos caracterizados como bons falantes (16, 7 %) pelos expertos apresentaram valores médios de amplitude de pressão na transição faringoesofágica de 27, 48 mmHg. Entre os falantes moderados (52, 5 %), obteve-se amplitude média de 30, 63 mmHg e para os piores falantes (30, 8 %), 38, 72 mmHg.

BACKGROUND: {{rehabilitation of}} individuals with total laryngectomy. AIM: to correlate the voice and speech proficiency {{of individuals with}} total laryngectomy, users of tracheoesophageal, prosthesis with the intraluminal pharyngoesophageal transition pressure at rest and during phonation. METHOD: twelve individuals with total laryngectomy and with tracheoesophageal voice, users of <b>speech</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> were submitted to a voice and speech sample gathering and registration. These individuals were assessed by three experts using a specific protocol {{for the evaluation of}} tracheoesophageal communication. Individuals also underwent esophageal manometry in order to evaluate the intraluminal pharyngoesophageal transition pressure during rest and phonation. RESULTS: during phonation, individuals who had been characterized by the experts as good speakers (16. 7 %) presented average values of pressure amplitude during pharyngoesophageal transition of 27. 48 mmHg. Average amplitude of 30. 63 mmHg was observed for individuals classified as moderate speakers (52. 5 %), and of 38. 72 mmHg for individuals classified as poor speakers (30. 8 %). During rest, the good speakers presented an average pressure of 14. 72 mmHg, the moderate speakers of 13. 04 mmHg and the poor speakers of 3. 54 mmHg. CONCLUSION: the good speakers presented the lowest amplitude values of pharyngoesophageal transition pressure during phonation. However, the pressure observed in the rest condition was higher for the good speakers and lower for the poor speakers, suggesting that the raise in the pharyngoesophageal transition pressure during phonation damages the quality of tracheoesophageal communication when using <b>speech</b> <b>prosthesis...</b>|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{most severe}} {{consequence}} of laryngectomy for patients {{is the loss}} of their voice. For this reason, voice rehabilitation has been an integral aspect of treatment after total laryngectomy from the very beginning. A wide variety of different technical and surgical approaches are available and reflect the problems associated with the rehabilitation of communication and swallowing after the removal of the larynx. MethodsWe used Internet search engines and libraries to conduct a search of the current medical literature and historical sources of medical information in order to identify and summarize landmark work on this subject. DiscussionFour types of methods have been used to restore the voices of patients, i. e., external devices, esophageal <b>speech,</b> internal voice <b>prostheses,</b> and surgically created tracheo-esophageal fistulas that do not involve the use of a prosthetic device...|$|R
40|$|There {{are various}} types of {{obturator}} fabrication achievable by prosthodontist. Maxillectomy, which is a term used by head and neck surgeons and prosthodontists to describe the partial or total removal of the maxilla in patients suffering from benign or malignant neoplasms is a defect for which to provide an effective obturator is a difficult task for the maxillofacial prosthodontist. Multidisciplinary treatment planning is essential to achieve adequate retention and function for the <b>prosthesis.</b> <b>Speech</b> is often unintelligible {{as a result of}} the marked defects in articulation and nasal resonance. This paper describes how to achieve the goal for esthetics and phonetics and also describes the fabrication of a hollow obturator by two piece method, which is simple and maybe used as definitive obturator for maximum comfort of the patient...|$|R
40|$|Patients after {{laryngectomy}} often receive silicone made voice <b>prostheses</b> for <b>speech</b> rehabilitation. The <b>prosthesis</b> {{is inserted}} in a shunt between the trachea and the digestive tract. As the prosthesis {{is placed in}} a non-sterile environment it becomes rapidly colonized by microorganisms eventually leading to failure and frequent exchange of the implant. In this study, explanted "Groningen Button" silicone voice prostheses were used to investigate by scanning electron microscopy the biofilm developing on the implant. Two main types of microbial colonization forms could be distinguished. Firstly, macroscopically visible, single colonies dominating on the esophagus side of the prosthesis were found, which were built up of mainly yeast cells. Secondly, thin microbial films on the areas in between were seen in which bacteria were the dominating organisms. In both colonization forms, mixed biofilms of mainly cocci and yeasts could also be found...|$|R
