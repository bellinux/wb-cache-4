50|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>head</b> or {{rupture disk}} is a device {{containing}} a thin metal membrane {{that is designed}} to rupture when the pressure in the separator exceeds a predetermined value. This is usually from 1 1/4 to 1% times the design pressure of the separator vessel. The <b>safety</b> <b>head</b> disk is usually selected so that it will not rupture until the safety relief valve has opened and is incapable of preventing excessive pressure buildup in the separator.|$|E

50|$|A {{spring-loaded}} {{safety relief}} valve is usually installed on all oil and gas separators. These valves normally are set at the design pressure of the vessel.

50|$|Separators {{should be}} {{operated}} above hydrate-formation temperature.

In some instances when the liquid or gas outlet is plugged or restricted, this causes the safety valve to open or the <b>safety</b> <b>head</b> to rupture. Steam coils can be installed in the liquid section of oil and gas separators to melt hydrates that may form there. This is especially appropriate on low-temperature separators.|$|E

5000|$|Mary Sudik No. 1 {{well was}} {{developed}} by the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company on the property of Vincent and Mary Sudik. [...] The well, located about 2000 ft to the southeast of the present intersection of Interstate 240 and Bryant Avenue, to the south of the Oklahoma City center, blew out when the drilling crew underestimated well pressures in the newly developed Wilcox formation, producing 20,000 barrels of oil and [...] of gas per day from the 6471 ft well. According to the well completion report, it produced 15,441 barrels of oil in a test run for 13 hours and 15 minutes. [...] The crew had neglected to keep sufficient drilling mud in the well, and did not use a <b>safety</b> <b>head,</b> contrary to the accepted practice of the time, running the well [...] "wild." [...] The initial flow of gas from the well changed to oil after about a day, with oil fountaining up to 400 ft into the air. Oil vapor blew in the wind as far as Norman, 11 mi to the south. A safety zone was established around the well to prevent fire. The American Iron and Machine Company was engaged to cap the well, led by superintendent H. M. Myracle. [...] The first attempt failed after twelve hours, but a second attempt restricted the flow, and oil was diverted into a pit until a final seal could be effected. A total of 211,600 barrels of oil was recovered from the vicinity of the well, and as many as 800,000 barrels were believed to have been wasted. Once controlled, Mary Sudik No. 1 was the most productive well in the world in 1930.|$|E

30|$|Controversy {{regarding}} American Football headgear {{surrounded the}} introduction of plastic-based helmets in 1939 (Gelberg 1995) which were designed to replace the leather headgear that athletes had previously worn (Miah 2005). The new plastic helmets were lighter, stronger and did not require re-branding after each game (Gelberg 1995). In was envisaged that the adoption of more effective materials and design would reduce head related injuries to players (Miah 2005). However, whilst the number of head injuries has been suggested as decreasing, the severity of those that did occur had been proposed to actually increase (Miah 2005). The suggested reasoning behind this is that players would use the helmet itself as an instrument to perform harder tackles (Miah 2005) or to create {{a greater sense of}} invulnerability (Gelberg 1995). Whilst the American judicial system and in its law ultimately clarified liability or blame in any contentious cases involving use of a helmet, it was suggested that potentially dangerous and aggressive tackles have continued regardless (Gelberg 1995). Similar parallels were also evident in amateur boxing whereby controversy was created with their introduction of <b>safety</b> <b>head</b> gear (Dyer et al. 2010). Much like in American Football, the headgear was designed to reduce impact forces but may have indirectly created feelings of athlete invulnerability and therefore encouraged boxers to hit harder or to defend their head less.|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} assess the effect of {{compulsory}} cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries given the ongoing debate in Australia as to the efficacy of this measure at a population level. We used hospital admissions data from New South Wales, Australia, from a 36 month period centred at the time legislation came into effect. Negative binomial regression of hospital admission counts of head and limb injuries to cyclists was performed to identify differential changes in head and limb injury rates {{at the time of}} legislation. Interaction terms were included to allow different trends between injury types and pre- and post-law time periods. To avoid the issue of lack of cyclist exposure data, we assumed equal exposures between head and limb injuries which allowed an arbitrary proxy exposure {{to be used in the}} model. As a comparison, analyses were also performed for pedestrian data to identify which of the observed effects were specific to cyclists. In general the models identified a decreasing trend in injury rates prior to legislation, an increasing trend thereafter and a drop in rates at the time legislation was enacted, all of which were thought to represent background effects in transport <b>safety.</b> <b>Head</b> injury rates decreased significantly more than limb injury rates at the time of legislation among cyclists but not among pedestrians. This additional benefit was attributed to compulsory helmet legislation. Despite numerous data limitations, we identified evidence of a positive effect of compulsory cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries at a population level such that repealing the law cannot be justified...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in road <b>safety,</b> <b>head</b> injuries still account {{for many of}} the most serious and fatal injuries in road traffic accidents. This PhD thesis provides a summary of knowledge regarding the current position in head injury research with regard to:  Previous assertions as to head injury mechanisms  Existing head injury criteria  The availability of data to explore potential confounding factors in predicting head injury risk and to propose or validate a new injury criterion or criteria. On the basis of the existing information the question was posed, whether it is possible to validate advanced head injury criteria and head models using additional (new) head injury case data so as to make their application more robust in efforts to mitigate future injuries. In order to answer this question, priority was given to the pursuit of new data, offering six degree of freedom time-series data with detailed information on the exact injuries sustained. A working in-ear sensor system was deemed to offer a potential solution in obtaining elusive data regarding the kind of impact events that could cause head injuries for road users. An in-ear accelerometer system used by the FIA Institute was evaluated through experimentation. Then a low-cost solution was developed with the aim to give similar sensor performance for a wider market of potential wearers. The prototype low-cost sensor system was evaluated in a small series of drop tests and also in a very small real-world data collection trial. This evaluation identified a series of issues that need to be resolved before the system can be used to generate valuable data. A viable system is not ready immediately, but could be following modifications to the prototype system evaluated. Taking this revised system, the next step would be to initiate a larger trial to start the collection of high fidelity data and impact event details; in order to address the need for such information and confirm that even the low-cost system would be fit for that purpose...|$|E
