40|$|Substitution is a phonological {{process in}} language. Existing studies have {{examined}} deletion in several languages and dialects with less attention paid to the <b>spoken</b> <b>French</b> of Ijebu Undergraduates. This article therefore examined substitution as a dominant phenomenon in the <b>spoken</b> <b>French</b> of thirty-four Ijebu Undergraduate French Learners (IUFLs) in Selected Universities in South West of Nigeria {{with a view to}} establishing the dominance of substitution in the <b>spoken</b> <b>French</b> of IUFLs. The data collection was through tape-recording of participants’ production of 30 sentences containing both French vowel and consonant sounds. The results revealed inappropriate replacement of vowel and consonant in the medial and final positions in the <b>spoken</b> <b>French</b> of IUFLs...|$|R

5|$|Adams did not <b>speak</b> <b>French,</b> the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a less visible role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French {{journalists to}} view the raw footage—Denis Jeambar, {{editor-in-chief}} of L'Express; , former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and , former editor-in-chief of Le Monde. They also asked {{to speak to the}} cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not <b>speak</b> <b>French</b> and that his English was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Laurent {{had also}} planned another feature film, Putain de pluie!, {{produced}} by Alain Attal's Productions du Trésor, whose script she co-wrote with Morgan Perez and which {{she intended to}} direct. Originally set for filming {{in the spring of}} 2009, it was postponed because of her work on Inglourious Basterds. Knowing that she could <b>speak</b> <b>French,</b> and had already acted in French in one of the short films in Paris, je t'aime, she offered the first role to Natalie Portman, who declined because of the script's language.|$|E

Exceptions include Lee Chaolan, Lars, Xiaoyu, and Alisa, who still speak Japanese, as well as Lei and Lee's alter-ego Violet, who still speaks English due to their further character backgrounds despite their actual nationalities.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{gave the}} four {{recognized}} parties free air time for political statements. The television broadcasts's audio tracks served also {{for use on}} radio. The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time, though Diefenbaker, who did not <b>speak</b> <b>French</b> well, played only a limited role in the Tories' French-language broadcasts. In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, who gave the speech. Diefenbaker had no objection to makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.|$|E

Joe, a Canadian businessman, met Wendy, an Australian air hostess, {{while she was in}} Canada. When Kimberley was three years old, the family moved to Australia's Gold Coast, where she {{attended}} St Hilda's School for the next nine years. The family travelled extensively in Europe, and Kimberley attended a private school in Montreux, Switzerland for four years. While there, she learned to <b>speak</b> <b>French</b> and Spanish. When she returned to Australia, she started a degree in arts and commerce at Bond University, though did not complete it.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{population}} of Belgium was comparatively small. Out of a {{population of}} around 8 million, there were only 10,000 Jews in the country before World War I. The interwar period saw substantial Jewish immigration to Belgium. By 1930, the population rose to 50,000, and by 1940 it was between 70,000–75,000. Most of the new Jewish immigrants came from Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany, escaping anti-Semitism and poverty in their native countries. The Roma population of Belgium {{at the same time}} was approximately 530. Few of the Jewish migrants claimed Belgian citizenship, and many did not <b>speak</b> <b>French</b> or Dutch. Jewish communities developed in Charleroi, Liège, Brussels and, above all, Antwerp, where {{more than half of the}} Jews in Belgium lived.|$|E
5|$|George {{was born}} at St James's Palace, London, on 12 August 1762, the first child of King George III of the United Kingdom and Queen Charlotte. As the eldest son of a British sovereign, he {{automatically}} became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay at birth; he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a few days later. On 18 September of the same year, he was baptised by Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury. His godparents were the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (his maternal uncle, for whom the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Chamberlain, stood proxy), the Duke of Cumberland (his paternal great-uncle) and the Dowager Princess of Wales (his paternal grandmother). George was a talented student, and quickly learned to <b>speak</b> <b>French,</b> German and Italian, {{in addition to his}} native English.|$|E

5|$|His first post upon {{returning}} to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted {{for only a few}} months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s. In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from {{the fact that he did}} not <b>speak</b> <b>French,</b> at a time when the NFB's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too long, while the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.|$|E
5|$|In early 1994, Levesque {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In his first televised match, Levesque debuted as a villain named Terror Risin', defeating Keith Cole. His ring name was soon modified to Terra Ryzing, which he used until mid-1994, when he was renamed Jean-Paul Lévesque. This gimmick referred to his surname's French origins and {{he was asked to}} speak with a French accent, as he could not <b>speak</b> <b>French.</b> During this time, he began using his finishing maneuver, the Pedigree. Lévesque had a brief feud with Alex Wright that ended at Starrcade with Wright pinning him. Between late 1994 and early 1995, Lévesque briefly teamed with Lord Steven Regal, whose upper class British persona was similar to Lévesque's character. However, the team was short-lived, as Levesque left for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in January 1995 after WCW turned down his request to be promoted as a singles competitor.|$|E
5|$|The next {{election}} {{was called for}} October 2008. Dosanjh faced sociologist Wai Young running for the Conservatives, health worker Ann Chambers running for the NDP, and an IT consultant, Csaba Gulyas for the Green Party. Dosanjh won by 33 votes over Young, both receiving 38.4% of the vote. A recount confirmed Dosanjh's victory but only {{by a margin of}} 22 votes. The Conservative Party requested a second, judicial recount, which again confirmed Dosanjh as the victor. In the 40th Canadian Parliament, with his party once again forming the official opposition, Dosanjh was appointed the National Defence critic for the first parliamentary session which was short-lived. During the 2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute he defended the proposed coalition government as a reaction to inappropriate leadership on economic issues by the existing government. When Dion resigned as party leader, Dosanjh considered but did not run for leadership citing his inability to <b>speak</b> <b>French</b> and again supported Rae's bid. In October 2009, Michael Ignatieff appointed Dosanjh as the Liberals' critic for National Defence.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{chapter is}} {{dedicated}} to the syntax of <b>spoken</b> <b>French.</b> Section 1, which focuses on ‘orality’, presents some phenomena related to ‘oral’ situational parameters with reference to spoken French: speech production processes, ‘ellipsis’, the use of deictics, and discourse markers. Section 2 considers whether we speak in sentences or not, and examines the use of tenses, moods, and voices in <b>spoken</b> <b>French,</b> the frequent non-use of negative ne, as well as the use of interrogative constructions. Section 3, entitled ‘Between syntax and discourse’, evokes the so-called ‘syntax of spoken French’, and mentions some preferred constructions in <b>spoken</b> <b>French,</b> i. e. left detachment (or dislocation) and presentational structures, before closing with a brief reflection on whether <b>spoken</b> <b>French</b> can be considered as an illustration of syntactic variation...|$|R

5|$|When Bart is sent by {{his captors}} into town {{to buy a}} case of antifreeze, he sees a gendarme and tries to ask for help, but the gendarme does not {{understand}} English and only gives Bart a piece of candy. Bart walks away, despairing over his own stupidity, then suddenly begins speaking French to himself. Realizing he has become fluent in the language, he runs back to the gendarme and tells him about the winemakers, who are swiftly arrested and Bart finishes his stay in France being hailed as a hero. He is awarded a medal for his bravery and he is kissed by a French beauty queen. Back in Springfield, Adil is caught by the FBI, forcing him to be deported back to Albania {{in exchange for their}} own child spy. Bart returns to his family, bringing them gifts from France. Back at home trying out the gifts, Homer has difficulty opening a wine bottle, but is pleased to hear Bart <b>speak</b> <b>French,</b> oblivious that Bart has just called him a buffoon.|$|E
