40|$|Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 The {{role of the}} anaesthesiologist, nowadays, is {{not just}} limited to patient care in the {{operating}} room but also {{plays a key role in}} the ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol, including management of perioperative analgesia, infusion therapy, nutrition and efficient rehabilitation in order to obtain the shortest hospital-ization with the lowest rate of adverse complications for patients undergoing surgery. The fast-track protocol was first designed for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, but its principles were soon extended to other surgical specialities, including orthopaedic and vascular surgery. As the most advanced technical equipment and drugs are often insufficient to successfully manage serious conditions, their synergic use and mutual purposeful coordination are even more im-portant. Cooperation of the whole team (in particular of the anaesthesiologist and the surgeon) is necessary, as demonstrated by the workgroup of Evidence Based Medicine in Surgery of the Canadian Association of General Surgeons and the American College of Surgeons. Nutritional support. Nutritional status, fluid intake before sur-gery, <b>special</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>products</b> and intestinal preparation play a crucial role in the perioperative period (1). Perioperative nutrition-al care should focus particularly on detection of any preoperative malnutrition and potential nutrition problems in the postoperative period, compensation of perioperative hyperglycaemia and man-agement of insulin resistance through preoperative administration of appropriate carbohydrate solutions, early enteral nutrition and special nutritional immunomodulative products to support the gas-trointestinal tract. Randomized clinical studies have shown that ad-E di to ri al Fast-track is more than physiological anaesthesi...|$|E
40|$|Stunting and {{micronutrient}} malnutrition are persistent {{public health}} problems in refugee populations. UNHCR and its partner organisations implement blanket supplementary feeding programmes using {{a range of}} <b>special</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>products</b> as one approach to address these issues. The evidence base for the efficacy and effectiveness of a small quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement, Nutributter速, in reducing stunting and anaemia is limited. Secondary data {{analysis was used to}} assess the effectiveness of Nutributter速 distribution on anaemia and stunting in children aged 6 - 23 months (programme target group) and 6 - 59 months (the standard age group sampled in routine nutrition surveys). Analysis was conducted using routine pre and post-intervention cross-sectional nutrition survey data collected between 2008 - 2011 in five refugee camps in Kenya and Djibouti. Changes in total anaemia (Haemoglobin< 110 g/L), anaemia categories (mild, moderate and severe), and stunting (height-for-age z-score <- 2) were explored using available data on the Nutributter速 programme and contextual factors. A significant reduction in the prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6 - 23 months and 6 - 59 months was seen in four of five, and in all five camps, respectively (p< 0. 05). Reductions ranged from 12. 4 to 23. 0, and 18. 3 to 29. 3 percentage points in each age group. Improvements were largely due to reductions in moderate and severe anaemia and occurred where the prevalence of acute malnutrition was stable or increasing. No change in stunting was observed in four of five camps. The replicability of findings across five sites strongly suggests that Nutributter速 distribution was associated with a reduction in anaemia, but not stunting, among refugee children in the Horn of Africa. Benefits were not restricted to the 6 - 23 month target group targeted by the nutrition programme. However, even following this intervention anaemia remained a serious public health problem and additional work to define and evaluate an effective intervention package is warranted...|$|E

Qualitative interviews with four pharmacists were analysed using Framework Analysis. Quantitative diary recording of all HNP-related events for child customers in four pharmacies was carried out over 2 separate week periods between March - June 2008. Of 29 events recorded, most involved parents buying products for their child, especially herbal and nutritional supplements and topical products, and asking for advice. Pharmacists were generally open to herbal and <b>nutritional</b> <b>products</b> and perceived an increasing demand which they were keen to meet. Although they reported feeling competent to give advice, pharmacists wished to increase their knowledge as information on HNPs was limited, {{and the need to}} maintain professionalism at all times was recognised. Pharmacists appear to understand and empathise with customer demand for HNPs and are uniquely positioned within the National Health System to provide product advice and support. However, to maintain professionalism, pharmacists may require further information on herbal and <b>nutritional</b> <b>products</b> and continuing professional training, especially since herbal and nutritional supplements may interact with prescribed and over-the-counter drugs...|$|R
