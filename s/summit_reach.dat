50|$|The Crinan Canal has 15 {{locks and}} is crossed by seven bridges: six swing bridges and a {{retractable}} bridge. Stone for the 15 locks was brought from Mull, the Isle of Arran and Morvern. From Ardrishaig, three locks raise the canal's four-mile long east reach to 32 {{feet above sea}} level. The 1,100-yard <b>summit</b> <b>reach,</b> between Cairnbaan and Dunardry, is 64 feet above sea level. The west reach between Dunardry and Crinan is 18 feet above sea level. The canal is 10 ft deep and has essentially no height limit.|$|E
5000|$|Prevo ( [...] влк. Прево, 新知富士, Shimushiru Fuji), with {{a height}} of 1360 m. The peak erupted in the early 19th century, forming a {{symmetrical}} cone with a resemblance to Mount Fuji. On the summit is a 450 × 600 meter wide summit crater with a small caldera lake on its floor. Lava flows from the <b>summit</b> <b>reach</b> both coasts of central Simushir. Only two eruptions are known from Prevo Peak in historical times. The largest of these, during the 1760s, produced pyroclastic flows that destroyed all vegetation {{at the foot of}} the volcano. Weak explosive activity occurred during the most recent eruption, in the early 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Investigation of {{meteorological}} disasters {{caused by}} small-scale topography shows that flashover due to wind age yaw occurred quite often where col topography existed. Considering that the distribution pattern of wind profile at different locations of a col topography is not clear, this paper, with wind tunnel tests, studied the influenced of such topographic {{features of a}} col as hill slope and valley mouth width on the wind profile at different locations. The results of wind tunnel tests indicated that over-hill wind has a stronger effect on wind velocity correction coefficient than does valley wind, that compared to flat terrain wind velocity, the maximum speed-up amplitude of wind velocity at valley throat and hill <b>summit</b> <b>reach</b> 33 and 53 %, respectively, apparently higher than 10 % specified in Codes, that wind velocity at valley throat increases {{with the increase of}} hill slope and decreases with the increase of valley mouth width, that wind velocity in the valley basically does not go up when the slope of one hill side is smaller than 0. 1 and that wind velocity at the same non-dimensional height of a 3 D hill summit increases with the increase of hill height...|$|E
