6000|$|... § 4. There {{is still}} one fact which {{requires}} to be noticed (in addition {{to the existence of}} a power of <b>self-formation)</b> before the doctrine of the causation of human actions can be freed from the confusion and misapprehensions which surround it in many minds. When the will is said to be determined by motives, a motive does not mean always, or solely, the anticipation of a pleasure or of a pain. I shall not here inquire whether it be true that, in the commencement, all our voluntary actions are mere means consciously employed to obtain some pleasure or avoid some pain. It is at least certain that we gradually, through the influence of association, come to desire the means without thinking of the end; the action itself becomes an object of desire, and is performed without reference to any motive beyond itself. Thus far, it may still be objected that, the action having through association become pleasurable, we are, as much as before, moved to act by the anticipation of a pleasure, namely, the pleasure of the action itself. But granting this, the matter does not end here. As we proceed in the formation of habits, and become accustomed to will a particular act or a particular course of conduct because it is pleasurable, we at last continue to will it without any reference to its being pleasurable. Although, from some change in us or in our circumstances, we have ceased to find any pleasure in the action, or perhaps to anticipate any pleasure as the consequence of it, we still continue to desire the action, and consequently to do it. In this manner it is that habits of hurtful excess continue to be practiced although they have ceased to be pleasurable; and in this manner also it is that the habit of willing to persevere in the course which he has chosen, does not desert the moral hero, even when the reward, however real, which he doubtless receives from the consciousness of well-doing, is any thing but an equivalent for the sufferings he undergoes, or the wishes which he may have to renounce.|$|E

For this purpose, he used fresh clay mould, into which the melted mass was poured directly, allowing in this way also to mix metal, glass or other basic materials on the spot. This leads to certain anticipated temperature- and gas-expansions that form the sculpture as outlined. Pejić termed the method the Big Bang Method, and the sculptures born in this way as [...] "self-born sculptures".

40|$|Abstract. Relatively {{high cost}} of energy {{produced}} by solar cells prevents them from being used widely. One {{of the ways to}} address this problem is to create new, cost efficient solar cell production technologies. This presentation analyzes how, by applying <b>self-formation</b> principles it is possible to decrease number of photolithography processes used in high efficiency solar cell production, thus significantly reducing the cost of solar cell itself. All known planar technologies can be described based on <b>self-formation</b> principles; new microchip and integrated circuit technologies were created using <b>self-formation</b> as well. It is therefore natural to extend <b>self-formation</b> to solar cell technology. This presentation provides specific aspects of <b>self-formation</b> simulation as related to solar-cell technology. The object of the simulation is a cross-section of solar cell in two-dimensional Euclidean space and it’s evolution over time. Such kind of solar cell approximation simplifies the model, yet keeps all essential characteristics of the solar cell. The cross-section contains geometrical figures which approximate objects in the solar cell. Each figure is assigned with an integer parameter, approximating physical material. According to <b>self-formation</b> principles, evolution of each figure depends only on geometrical configuration of the figure itself, the parameter and interaction rules. Interaction rules define change of neighbouring points and approximate technological processes (etching, oxidation, coating etc). Combination of such processes enables construction of required solar cell configuration, with only minimum use of photolithography processes. <b>Self-formation</b> is simulated by two-dimensional 8 -neighbour cellular automata based mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Self-formation</b> {{concept as}} a {{generalization}} {{of the huge}} number of technologies in microelectronics was defined. <b>Self-formation</b> as irreversible evolution, causing self-increasing of an object complexity, is presented. Differential equation method allows description of evolution of any figures contour. Numerical model of <b>self-formation</b> in essence is a cellular automata of the second kind. Neither analytical nor numerical models did not involve causes of contour evolution. However causes of evolution are hidden in interactions of parameters which approximate an object and ambient materials. On the basis of above-mentioned factors, the right-dimensional topological space was created. It is the Cartesian product of the eight sets, including three Euclidean space axes, four parameter axes (defining parameters of the Euclidean points and interaction matrix) and time axis. <b>Self-formation</b> {{is a result of}} non-homogeneous mapping sequence in time. On the other hand non-homeomorpheous mapping indicates irreversibility of an evolution. Evolution is irreversible in time if only the object either contains the peculiar points or they arise under evolution. Therefore an interaction, defining the figure evolution out-side, does not return the object to initial state after its diversion inside and can implicate the complexity increasing. The new <b>self-formation</b> technologies for electron devices and integrated circuits manufacturing were carried out. Topological approach allows analysis and synthesis of real world structures, known in the areas of microelectronics, nanotechnology, photovoltaics and fuel cell technology, possibly in living world (genes, cells, organs, organism) as well.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to examine}} the various ways in which three Victorian novels, such as Wilkie Collins?s The Woman in White (1860), Anne Bront??s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848), Charlotte Bront??s Villette (1853), address the relationship between storytelling and <b>self-formation,</b> showing that a subject formulates {{a sense of self}} by storytelling. The constructed nature of self and storytelling in Collins?s The Woman in White shows that narrative is a significant way of attributing meaning in our lives and that constructing stories about self is connected to the construction of self, illustrating that storytelling is a form of <b>self-formation.</b> Anne Bront??s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall exemplifies Bront??s configuration of the relational and contextual aspect of storytelling and <b>self-formation</b> in her belief that self is formed not merely through the story he/she tells but through the triangular relationship of the storyteller, the story, and the reader. This novel proves that even though the writer?s role in constructing his/her self-concept through his/her narrative is important, the narrator?s triangular relationship with the reader and the text is also a significant component in his/her <b>self-formation.</b> Charlotte Bront??s Villette is concerned with unnarration, in which the narrative does not say, and it shows that the unnarrated elements provide useful resource for the display of the narrator?s self. For Charlotte Bront?, unnarration is part of the narrative configuration that contributes to constructing and presenting the storyteller?s <b>self-formation.</b> These three novels illuminate that narrative is more than linguistic activities of the symbolic representation of the world, and that it cannot be fully conceived without taking into consideration the storyteller?s experience and thoughts of the world...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Solar cell (SC) cost {{reduction}} remains {{the main problem}} in PV development. Selfformation technology implementation {{is one of the}} ways to decrease this cost. It is known planar object’s evolution approximation by 8 -dimensional topological space, containing object geometry, set of parameters, medium set and matrix of interaction. There we can have some different cases: external formation, <b>self-formation,</b> development and reproduction. However in case of <b>self-formation,</b> these attributes are not sufficient, because the different sequences of media can be created from the same set of medium. In external formation all structured and chaotic media are brought from outside and technological graph is created from recurrent parts. There we see an object interaction with different structured media, which structures are transferred to evolving object, and recurrent sequence of chaotic media (deposition, exposure, development, etching, diffusion and oxidizing). Initial technological object, interaction matrix and set of interactions are not sufficient to unambiguous technological process describing in <b>self-formation</b> case as well. Some technological graphs may be valid to one interaction matrix and result different final object. Medium there are changed from outside but the initial object changes as the result of interaction with medium. In optimal case one structured medium (for initial object formation) and the sequence of chaotic media are necessary to manufacture the solar cell from the silicon wafer. The approach of technological graph to solar cell technology is presented. Graphs of external formation and <b>self-formation</b> of solar cell are compared...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{tremendous}} {{research has been}} focused on the synthesis and applications of hierarchically porous materials. Hierarchical porous materials have enhanced materials’ properties compared to those with unimodal pore structure. Owing to their structure, a large series of domains have a fervent interest in hierarchically porous materials. This thesis is aimed at designing a new reaction system to develop hierarchically porous metal alkoxides with novel porosities via a spontaneous <b>self-formation</b> procedure. Furthermore, this thesis is also aimed at investigating the possible formation mechanism based on the <b>self-formation</b> procedure, and also the photocatalytic performance and adsorption capacity of the hierarchically porous metal alkoxides. The objective of this thesis is to fabricate a series of hierarchically porous materials with different porosities by adjusting the spontaneous <b>self-formation</b> procedure from metal alkoxides via novel strategies. In this thesis, we developed a novel water-adjusting method in order to adjust the amount of water in the reaction system thus controlling the <b>self-formation</b> procedure. Acetonitrile and methanol were used as the examples to be the reaction mediums here. On the basis of this novel strategies, a series of metal oxides with diverse porous structures had been synthesized, which would be suitable for a variety of applications from catalysis, to separation or environmental remediation. The evolution of the porosity of textural properties of metal oxides, formed from the addition of metal alkoxide to a water-acetonitrile system, with increasing water content was carefully investigated and summarized. The formation mechanism of hierarchically porous metal oxides in a water-acetonitrile system had been discussed in detail. Furthermore, the spontaneous <b>self-formation</b> process to form hierarchically porous titania in methanol was also studied in this thesis. More importantly, the hierarchically 3 D dendrimeric nanostructures formation process had been successfully investigated in situ by optical microscopy from Leica microsystem. The resultant hierarchically porous metal oxides were used as photocatalysts and adsorbents for dye molecule depollution and presented very high activities. In addition, hydrothermal and surfactant treatment to enhance the photocatalytic activity of hierarchically meso-macroporous titanias was also demonstrated in this thesis.

40|$|In the {{creative}} design process, {{it is difficult}} to observe {{the creative}} process from an inner perspective when people are deeply engaged in their work. The reason behind this is {{that the people who are}} absorbed in the work are assumed to have entered the flow state. Moreover, an external observation of the design process fails to grasp the designers' thoughts since they are stimulated by intrinsic motivation and formed owingto inner dynamics. The aim of the study described in this paper is to propose a method to observe the internal thoughts elicited during the creative design process by extending Reflections and Poietiques. This method comprises three stages: (1) the creative design process, (2) the formulation of two reports on the designer's work by the designer and a third person (art researcher), and (3) the formulation of another report by the designer after examining both the reports created in the second stage. The process of <b>self-formation</b> is expected to begin in the third stage.
