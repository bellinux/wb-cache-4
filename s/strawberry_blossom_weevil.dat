40|$|Introduction The {{project is}} based on {{research}} on pheromones and the project SoftPest Multitrap. Copenhagen Universitys Science and Life Sciences, more specifically Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, has researched and developed the pheromonis for mass trapping of the <b>Strawberry</b> <b>Blossom</b> <b>Weevil</b> (Anthonomus Rubi) and the European Tarnished Plant Bug (Lygus Rugulipennis).

The ecological strawberry producers lack effective pest control methods and has no options if they are attacked by the mentioned pest. A preromone-based pest control method is a promising alternative and it is useful for both conventional and ecological strawberry producers.

40|$|The <b>strawberry</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus rubi, and the European {{tarnished}} plant bug,Lygus rugulipennis, {{can cause}} substantial damage in organic strawberries in Northern and Central Europe. In conventional production {{it is also}} desirable to find alternatives to current pesticide controls, which negatively affects beneficials and also creates a risk of building pesticide resistance. Anthonomus rubi lays an egg in a developing flower bud and then partially bites off the flower stem, resulting {{in a loss of}} yield. Lygus rugulipennis nymphs and adults feed on flowers and developing fruitlets, causing a fruit distortion which makes the damaged fruit unmarketable. In the ERA-NET CORE Organic project “Softpest Multitrap”, we studied how pheromone and plant volatiles can be combined to improve trapping of the two pests. Our studies also included trap design and placement of traps in the field (grid size, perimeter versus field centre), investigations of the phenology of A. rubi and L. rugulipennis. In 2014 we assessed a ‘multi’-trap for both species. Results will be presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} growing is increasing world-wide, but knowledge concerning best practice is generally empirical rather than field-based. This thesis extends knowledge concerning best practice in Swedish organic strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa (Duch)) production, which is usually based on a two-year crop. A series of four field experiments were conducted at Rånna Experimental Station (58 ° 27 ’N, 13 ° 51 ’E) on the strawberry cultivars ‘Honeoye’, ‘Cavendish’ and ‘Korona’. Specific objectives were to investigate: the effects of different organic fertilisers combined with degradable plastic mulch on plant establishment, yield and nitrogen mineralisation in soil; the efficiency of biological pest control using a predatory mite against strawberry mites (Phytonemus pallidus); innate within-field dispersal capacity of strawberry mite; the effects of pyrethrum combined with fleece covering on damage by <b>strawberry</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil</b> (Anthonomus rubi). Plant establishment measured as fruit yield was improved by 60 % when degradable plastic mulch was used, probably through more flowers being initiated. Additional applications of organic fertiliser during the cropping period {{had little effect on}} yield. Biological control using the predatory mite Neoseiulus cucumeris reduced strawberry mite populations by up to 50 % but there was no increase in yield. It was difficult to draw clear conclusions from the strawberry mite dispersal pilot study, but mites tended to move more easily along planted rows than between rows. Pyrethrum alone had no visible effect on flower bud damage by <b>strawberry</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil</b> but when combined with fleece covering it reduced the number of ‘Honeoye’ buds damaged by weevils by approximately 10 %. This was followed by a corresponding increase in cultivar yield. Similar effects were not recorded in the other cultivar examined. The study identified the following practical consequences for organic strawberry production: • Choice of pest-resistant cultivars is extremely important for success. • Use of clean plants and an efficient predatory species is essential in controlling mite infestations. • Use of degradable plastic mulching is recommended. • Fleece covering is recommended for protecting some cultivars against strawberry blossom weevils. • Only an initial starter fertilisation is required. • Use of pyrethrum is not recommended...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{the second part of}} a project to assess the {{applicability}} of the male-produced, aggregation pheromone of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus rubi, for commercial monitoring and control. Following optimisation of pheromone lure and trap in previous work, the potential of the pheromone traps for monitoring and control of the pest was investigated. There was no obvious relationship between total pheromone trap catches and numbers of weevils on the crop determined by beating. However, good correlations were obtained at five sites during two seasons between the cumulative numbers of weevils and the amount of severing damage on the crop. Early catches of weevils preceded the first occurrence of damage by at least 1 week in several instances, providing useful information for timing the application of insecticide sprays against the adults to prevent occurrence of damage. The number of flowers severed was usually in the range of 0. 5 – 2. 0 times the cumulative number of weevils captured per trap. Adult weevil catches started at a low level in April or early May with similar numbers of males and females. The catches showed a marked increase in mid June coinciding with the emergence of new adults from the damaged flower buds, even though these are in reproductive diapause. Male weevils predominated in catches beyond this date by a factor of approximately 2 : 1. Two field experiments investigated the interference between traps and the effects of the traps on populations and crop damage by this pest. There was no evidence for interference between traps at spacings as close as 1. 7 m, and no effect on weevil damage or distribution was observed. Replicated trials were carried out of three approaches to exploit the pheromone for control of <b>strawberry</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil</b> damage in 0. 5 ha plots in commercial strawberry crops. These involved surrounding the crop with a perimeter of lures, the same method but with a boarder spray of the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin or by mass trapping with sticky stake pheromone traps at a density of 1000 per ha. None of these showed any reduction in crop damage compared to untreated plots. Possible reasons for this lack of success are discusse...|$|E

40|$|Advances in the {{identification}} of attraction of mirids to semiochemicals has provided the opportunity to exploit synthetically produced sex pheromones and plant produced compounds for controlling pest species in crops. Sex pheromones of mirids are important for long range attraction of males to females and plant volatiles indicate egg laying sites for female mirids. The European tarnished plant bug (Lygus rugulipennis) causes large yield losses (10 -> 80 %) in conventional and organic strawberry. Following the successful development of these semiochemicals in combination with effective traps we investigated the ability of a mass trapping system to reduce damage in strawberry crops in combination with another strawberry pest, <b>strawberry</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil</b> (Anthonomus rubi). Attractive traps and lures with host plant volatiles and sex or aggregation pheromones were deployed in strawberry crops at 50 per hectare in several European countries. Trap catches were monitored in relation to fruit damage and compared to untreated crops. Traps successfully captured both target pest species. In this paper we will present the results of the potential to reduce crop damage using mass traps and discuss the benefits and difficulties in using these techniques as part of integrated or organic pest management...|$|E

The aim was to find new cultivars tolerant to soil-borne pathogens and leaf/fruit diseases, with high yield, winter hardness and good fruit quality, to serve as alternative to the highly susceptible cultivar ‘Elsanta’, regarding soil-borne diseases. Plant vigour and infestation with Verticillium dahliae and leaf diseases were evaluated in 2005 und 2006 at 7 sites and in 2007 at 3 sites. In addition, following parameters were assessed on 2 organically managed sites in 2006 and 2007 : marketable yield, percentage of different categories of unmarketable fruits and incidence of the <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil.</b> In 2006 fruit characteristics and consumer acceptance were studied. ‘Elsanta’ showed the highest infestation with V. dahliae whereas ‘Salsa’, ‘Daroyal’ and ‘Alice’ were most tolerant. ‘Dora’, ‘Eva’, ‘Queen Elisa’ and ‘Daroyal’ recorded significantly higher losses by the <b>blossom</b> <b>weevil</b> than ‘Alice’. ‘Alba’ and ‘Divine’ were the earliest cultivars in ripening time. Highest marketable yield per plant had the late ripening cultivars, particularly ‘Salsa’ and ‘Sonata’.

Using the SBW aggregation pheromone and ETB sex pheromone we optimized and tested a single trap for both species. A series of field experiments in crops and semi-natural habitats in five European countries tested capture of the target pests {{and the ability to}} avoid captures of beneficial arthropods. A Unitrap containing a trapping agent of water and detergent and with a cross vane was more efficient at capturing both species compared to traps which incorporated glue as a trapping agent. Adding a green cross vane deterred attraction of non-pest species such as bees, but did not compromise catches of the target pests. The trap caught higher numbers of ETB and SBW if deployed at ground level and although a cross vane was not important for catches of ETB it was needed for significant captures of SBW. The potential for mass trapping SBW and ETB simultaneously in soft fruit crops is discussed including potential improvements to make this more effective and economic to deploy...|$|E

As a control possibility for strawberry fields in their first year after planting, net covering has been tested to prevent the weevil from entering since A. rubi usually hibernates in nearby forest areas. Five net types with different mesh sizes and weights were tested and an uncovered control in the late blooming cultivar Malwina. In regard to the criteria “destroyed flower buds” all five net variants showed significant lower rates than the control. In regard to the criteria “yield class- 1 -fruits” none of the net variants showed significantly higher yield amounts than the control.
