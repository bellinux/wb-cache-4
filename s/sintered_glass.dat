50|$|A setback {{to using}} Bioglass 45S5 {{is that it}} is {{difficult}} to process into porous 3D scaffolds. These porous scaffolds are usually prepared by <b>sintering</b> <b>glass</b> particles that are already formed into the 3D geometry and allowing them to bond to the particles into a strong glass phase made up of a network of pores. Since this particular type of bioglass cannot fully sinter by viscous flow above its Tg, and its Tg is close to the onset of crystallization, it is hard to sinter this material into a dense network.|$|R

5000|$|Piranha {{solution}} is particularly useful when cleaning sintered (or [...] "fritted") glassware. The {{size of the}} pores of sintered glassware is critical for its function, so {{it should not be}} cleaned with strong bases, which gradually dissolve the sinter. <b>Sintered</b> <b>glass</b> also tends to capture material deep within the structure, making it difficult to remove. Where less aggressive cleaning methods fail, piranha solution can be used to return the sinter to a pristine white, free-flowing form without excessive damage to the pore dimensions.

40|$|This article reviews recent ndings on {{internal}} and surface nucleation in silicate glasses. The internal homogeneous nucleation rates sharply decrease and the induc-tion times increase with the Tg=TL ratio (Tg is the glass-transition temperature and TL is the liquidus temperature). Only {{systems that have}} Tg=TL < 0 : 58 display mea-surable internal nucleation rates on a laboratory time-scale. Numerous tests of the classical nucleation theory have demonstrated that the theory fails to describe nucle-ation rates in glasses quantitatively. Possible explanations for this failure are tested and discussed. Surface nucleation depends strongly on the surface quality, e. g. tips, cracks and scratches, elastic stresses, foreign particles and surrounding atmosphere. The mechanisms of surface nucleation are still not fully understood, {{but some of the}} key factors are now known and the surface-nucleation density can thus be controlled for the development of <b>sintered</b> <b>glasses</b> or glass ceramics...|$|R
30|$|The risk of {{vaporisation}} and sublimation {{of silver}} {{exposed to air}} increases at higher reaction and operating temperatures. The vaporisation rate depends on temperature and atmosphere, and is higher in air than in H 2 /H 2 O atmosphere. Meulenberg et al. [2] extrapolated that up to 2 % of silver can evaporate after 40, 000  h at 690  °C in air. The evaporation will increase {{with the increase in}} the silver surface area. The cathode silver layer used in presented experiments was porous. Considering high porosity of the silver layer and its thickness 10 – 30  μm, {{a significant part of the}} silver can evaporate after the cell’s lifetime. The glass sealant, which is applied to maintain gas tightness, also poses a problem as glass sealants usually require sintering at 850  °C for several hours—leading to evaporation of silver into and through the glass matrix. In our previous report [29], the cathode was coated with silver ink to receive good current collection before <b>glass</b> <b>sintering.</b> This exposed the porous silver to the high temperature of 850  °C for 8  h. The reverse fabrication, with <b>sintering</b> <b>glass</b> before coating the cathode with silver, reduced silver degradation. However, it increases the complexity of the cell mass production. The Ag current collection film can be applied after the <b>glass</b> <b>sintering</b> for a single cell, although this process is impractical for the stack manufacture.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ceramic {{radiator}} fins {{were produced}} by screen-printing copper paste on ceramic substrate, which could replace the traditional technique of direct bestrow copper {{and meet the}} requirements of surface mounted technology. This method could be used to manufacture high density, superior thin and micro-sized molectrons. The key processes were screen-printing copper paste, sintering and electroless plating of nickel. The adhesion of copper film onto the ceramic substrate was often reduced after the process of electroless plating of nickel, resulting in the low quality of manufacturing. In this study, we analyzed the ceramic radiator fins which were obtained by the screen-printing copper paste method and using scanning electron microscopy to examine the surface and the cross-sections of copper film and Cu/Ni film. The adhesive properties of copper film during electroless plating was studied. The corrosion resistance of copper film and <b>sintering</b> <b>glass</b> phase on alumina substrate (96 %) was also studied in an electroplating bath.

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of <b>sintered</b> <b>glasses</b> and glass-ceramics, glass matrix composites and glass-bounded ceramics or pastes is often affected by gas bubble formation. Against this background, we studied sintering and foaming of barium silicate glass powders used as SOFC sealants using different powder milling procedures. Sintering {{was measured by}} means of heating microscopy backed up by XPD, DTA, Vacuum Hot Extraction (VHE) and optical and electron microscopy. Foaming increased significantly as milling progressed. For moderately milled glass powders, subsequent storage in air could also promote foaming. Although the powder compacts were uniaxially pressed and sintered in air, the milling atmosphere sig¬ni¬ficantly affected foaming. The strength of this effect increased in the order Ar  N 2 < air < CO 2. Conformingly, VHE studies revealed that the pores of foamed samples predominantly encapsulated CO 2, even for powders milled in Ar and N 2. Results of this study thus indicate that foaming is caused by carbonaceous species trapped on the glass powder surface. Foaming could be substantially reduced by milling in water and 10 wt% HCl...|$|R
