25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{for two and a}} half years the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel debated, the House of Shammai asserting that it would have been better for {{humanity}} not to have been created, and the House of Hillel maintaining that it is better that humanity was created. They finally took a vote and decided that it would have been better for humanity not to have been created, but now that humanity has been created, let us investigate our past deeds or, as others <b>say,</b> <b>let</b> us examine our future actions.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{singled out}} {{the sixth and}} final season as {{the worst of the}} series. Lineberger remarked, [...] "I haven't {{attempted}} to hide my disappointment with this season. For the first time ever in my life as a Highlander enthusiast, I found myself utterly uncaptivated." [...] Oliver awarded the sixth season a score of 3.9 out of 10, saying: [...] "Like The X-Files, Highlander: The Series simply went on too long.

2500|$|In her June 2013 {{address to}} the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, Palin {{declared}} her opposition to American involvement in the ongoing Syrian civil war: [...] "Militarily, where is our Commander-in-Chief? We’re talking now more new interventions. I say, until we know what we’re doing, {{until we have a}} Commander-in-Chief who knows what he’s doing, well, Chief, in these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, ‘Allah Akbar,’ I say, until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I <b>say,</b> <b>let</b> Allah sort it out!" [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] is usually translated [...] "God is Great" [...] and used in various contexts by Muslims; [...] "Allah" [...] is the Arabic word for God.|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{has stated}} that she {{supports}} a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban same-sex marriage. This position differed with that of her running mate, John McCain. In a July 31, 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren, Palin was asked about states' rights as they pertained to same-sex marriage, to which Palin responded, [...] "I believe that states have that constitutional right {{to make decisions about}} a variety of issues, {{but when it comes to}} some very fundamental, very cornerstone aspects of our society, of our culture, I personally would love to see a national dialogue about what will America continue to define as marriage. As a former Governor, I <b>say</b> <b>let</b> the states decide that, and that's where I would be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization." ...|$|E
