5|$|Coolbrith never resumed {{the work}} of writing the history, as {{she was unable to}} balance its revelatory autobiographical truth with the <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> would then ensue.

5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

5|$|Business writer Megan Barnett {{has pointed}} out {{parallels}} between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life W.B. Mason paper company, based near Boston, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line (rubber stamps) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> resulted in a $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin {{had to deal with}} the arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, it was {{revealed}} that in 1910–11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre's—a married man who was estranged from his wife. This resulted in a press <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.|$|E

This treatment caused such a <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> it was raised in the Houses of Parliament in December.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1920s, NFL {{membership}} {{had grown}} to 25 teams, and a rival league known as the American Football League was formed. The rival AFL folded after a single season, but it symbolized a growing interest in the professional game. Several college stars joined the NFL, most notably Red Grange from the University of Illinois, who was taken on a famous barnstorming tour in 1925 by the Chicago Bears. Another <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> season centered on a 1925 game between the Chicago Cardinals and the Milwaukee Badgers. The scandal involved a Chicago player, Art Folz, hiring a group of high school football players {{to play for the}} Milwaukee Badgers, against the Cardinals. This would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was used to help prop up their win-loss percentage and as a chance of wrestling away the 1925 Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. All parties were severely punished initially; however, a few months later the punishments were rescinded. Also that year a controversial dispute stripped the NFL title from the Maroons and awarded it to the Cardinals.|$|E

Frank's wife Claire publicly reveals that she was raped in college by a prominent general and pursues anti-rape legislation. The most significant new character is Jackie Sharp, Frank's successor as House Whip, who soon finds herself embroiled in Frank's plans.

5|$|Harvard {{entered the}} season as the two-time {{defending}} Ivy League Champion, but its roster was greatly changed due to graduation and the 2012 Harvard cheating <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> led to the withdrawal of two star players. With reduced expectations, the team entered the season expected to finish second in conference. During the season, the team swept the three opponents that are also from Boston. The win against Boston College, gave Amaker his sixth victory against no defeats over Atlantic Coast Conference foes. Despite the team's turmoil, it prevailed to win the 2012–13 Ivy League men's basketball season regular season championship, earning the team an automatic bid to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where it won the school's first ever NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament game. The tournament victory over #3 seed New Mexico was also the school's first victory over a top 10 ranked team.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said {{at the time that he}} had never met either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural ice companies examined various options. Some invested in plant ice themselves. New tools were brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of ice, but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances in plant ice manufacture. The Natural Ice Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural ice, and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural ice melted less slowly than manufactured ice. Under pressure, some ice companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on ice distribution networks to artificially raise prices for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American Ice Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a <b>scandal</b> <b>that</b> caused Morse to sell up his assets in the ice trade altogether to escape prosecution, making a profit of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E
