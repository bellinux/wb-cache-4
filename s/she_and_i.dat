500|$|The {{release of}} the duet was first {{announced}} via Stefani's Twitter account, where she posted the album notes of If I'm Honest, which revealed her name in the track listing. In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about".

500|$|Unable {{to return}} to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled, {{with the help of}} Ford and his {{half-brother}} Gregory Hickman, into the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. The headmaster was John Wentworth, and he took care to work with Johnson on his translation exercises. Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able {{to spend more time with}} the Fords and get to know his other relatives in the area. During this time he began writing poems and produced many verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in 1727. When Boswell was writing his Life of Samuel Johnson, he was told by Johnson's school friend Edmund Hector Johnson's leaving the Stourbridge school was due in part to a fight Johnson and Wentworth had over Latin grammar. For companionship, Johnson spent time with Hector and John Taylor, two of his schoolfriends, and he soon fell in love with Hector's younger sister, Ann. This first love was not to last, and Johnson later claimed to Boswell, [...] "She was the first woman with whom I was in love. It dropped out of my head imperceptibly, but <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall always have a kindness for each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to go to trials all the time as children. We went to the trials instead of going to the movies." [...] After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.|$|E
2500|$|Brandy and Monica first worked {{together}} in 1998, on a song titled [...] "The Boy is Mine". Created {{as a solo}} track, Brandy originally recorded the song alone. After listening to the result, however, she and Rodney Jerkins thought it would work better as a duet, an idea which was further inspired by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson's 1982 hit duet [...] "The Girl Is Mine". Jerkins, who produced the track, later claimed that both singers [...] "didn’t get along" [...] during production and that he and Dexter Simmons remixed the track seven times to keep everything even. Monica later spoke about her relationship with Brandy {{in an interview with}} WZMX, stating, [...] "we were young. We could barely stay in the room with each other. By no means was it jealousy or envy. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are polar opposites and instead of embracing that, we used our differences as reasons not to be amongst each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next, Karen learns {{through the}} French {{newspapers}} that Max has committed suicide, and Naomi arrives in London, where she explains {{the circumstances surrounding}} his death: after receiving his letter and informing Mme Fisher of his intentions, Naomi is quarantined by her mother, who intends to keep Naomi from seeing Max and removing any possibility of spoiling Max's chance for happiness with Karen. Max does visit Naomi, however, speaking to her of the failure inherent in his relationship with Karen: [...] "'What <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are' he said, 'is outside life; we shall fail.'" [...] He is visibly distressed as Mme Fisher returns to the salon. [...] Naomi returns to her upstairs bedroom. There is a commotion in the salon, and Naomi returns to find her mother strewn across the sofa and blood on the floor. Max has cut his own wrist, making his {{way out the door}} into the street, and dying in an alley. In the following days, Mme Fisher will observe that [...] "it was the commendation he could not bear. I was commending him when he took his knife out." [...] At the end of the section, Karen reveals to Naomi that she is pregnant with Max's child, and will leave for Germany to try to avoid any scandal.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because I think it just has great performances and I really love what it's about. I love Franny [...] and <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were presenting at the Creative Arts Emmys and I said, 'I think I have something really good for you, sort of the opposite of what you did last year.' She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{collaborating with}} American female rapper Nicki Minaj on the song [...] "I'm Legit" [...] for Minaj's album , Minaj agreed {{to appear on}} Ciara's album in return. Originally, the duo had worked on just one {{collaboration}} for Ciara called [...] "I'm Out". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that thing that she does that's so special. She went in." [...] Having enjoyed the process Minaj said [...] "I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm {{going to end up}} doing two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it." [...] In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; in an interview with MTV News, Ciara said, [...] "She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> rock together." [...] In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned [...] "Livin' It Up". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, [...] "Where You Go", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, [...] "She's like, 'I need this song.
