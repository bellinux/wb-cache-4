40|$|International audienceFlood {{hydraulic}} simulation aims {{to reproduce}} the flood wave, i. e. the water level, the flood duration or the flow velocity at any site of the channels and floodplain. Hydraulic model outputs may later be used in studies to delineate risk areas, to characterize impacts in cost-benefit analyses of a flood prevention project, or to alert inhabitants before flood event. To support the robustness of these studies, uncertainties of hydraulic outputs over floodplain, especially a spatially explicit representation of uncertainties may be required (Saint-Geours et al., 2013). However, due to the flood data scarcity, the available observed water level data are rather used to calibrate hydraulic model parameters rather than to validate the model. Thus, epistemic uncertainties of simulated maxima flood levels over floodplain are rarely measured, except on some points along the main channel. Nevertheless, hydraulic modellers are able to deduce general rules and ranges on flood level uncertainties from modelling experiences. These rules are built up in regards with the frequencies of the modelled events and the floodplain morphology. The translation of this expert knowledge to spatial pattern models {{that are able to}} simulate spatial explicit uncertainties has thus to be addressed. In this paper, we explored the translation of the downstream Rhône river hydraulic modellers expertise in ad hoc stochastic spatial, i. e. geostatistical models. Expertise rules were only devoted to 1 D floodplain modelling using a <b>storage</b> <b>cells</b> network framework. It concerned i) the magnitude of flood level errors depending on the riverbed location (floodplain or channel) of <b>storage</b> <b>cells,</b> ii) the water level measurement accuracies, iii) the spatial dependencies on errors between connected <b>storage</b> <b>cells,</b> and iv) some additional constraints on orders between flood levels on connected <b>storage</b> <b>cells.</b> Three continuous or discrete uncertainties simulation approaches were investigated using different levels of constraint: i) multi-Gaussian random fields on <b>storage</b> <b>cells</b> centroids within an anisotropic and curvilinear euclidean 2 D space, ii) multi-Gaussian random fields on <b>storage</b> <b>cells</b> lattice and iii) Gaussian Markov random fields on <b>storage</b> <b>cells</b> lattice (Rue and Held, 2004). Identical spatial 2 D covariance models were used in order to respect the expert rules on the water level error spatial structure in the same conditions for the three investigated approaches. The theoretical limitations of these approaches are first identified and discussed. Resulting maps of uncertainties are thus shown and discussed. Finally, in order to discuss the importance to refine spatial hydraulic uncertainty simulation methods, the measure of the impact of hydraulic un- 1 certainties in a flood-risk project cost-benefit analysis is computed in addition to other sources of uncertainties (stakes uncertainties, flood frequency uncertainties, damage curve uncertainties, etc.). This latter sensitivity analysis results allows to balance the impact of flood level errors in comparison to other sources of uncertainties.

40|$|With {{semiconductor}} technology advancing toward deep submicron, leakage energy is of increasing concern, especially for large on-chip array {{structures such as}} caches and branch predictors. Recent work has suggested that even larger branch predictors {{can and should be}} used in order to improve microprocessor performance. A further consideration is that more aggressive branch predictors, especially multiported predictors for multiple branch prediction, may be thermal hot spots, thus further increasing its leakage. Moreover, as the branch predictor holds state that is transient and predictive, elements can be discarded without adverse effect. For these reasons, it is natural to consider applying decay techniques—already shown to reduce leakage energy for caches—to branch-prediction structures. Due to the structural difference between caches and branch predictors, applying decay techniques to branch predictors is not straightforward. This paper explores the strategies for exploiting spatial and temporal locality to make decay effective for bimodal, gshare, and hybrid predictors, as well as the branch target buffer. Furthermore, the predictive behavior of branch predictors steers them towards decay based not on state-preserving, static <b>storage</b> <b>cells,</b> but rather quasi-static, dynamic <b>storage</b> <b>cells.</b> This paper will examine the results of implementing decaying branch predictor structures with dynamic–appropriately, decaying–cells rather than the standard static SRAM cell.

We show decay can either be implemented at the architectural level, or with a wholesale replacement of static <b>storage</b> <b>cells</b> with quasi-static <b>storage</b> <b>cells</b> which naturally implement decay. More importantly, decay techniques can be applied and should be applied to other such transient and/or predictive structures. I...|$|R
