This study aimed to develop an antifungal heat-curing resin containing quaternary ammonium monomer (dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate, DMADDM), and evaluate its physical performance and antifungal properties. The discs were prepared by incorporating DMADDM into the polymer liquid of a methyl methacrylate-based, heat-polymerizing resin at 0 % (control), 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % (w/w). Flexure <b>strength,</b> <b>bond</b> quality, surface charge density, and surface roughness were measured to evaluate the physical properties of resin.

The metal substrates were either air-borne particle abraded or polished prior to veneering. <b>Bond</b> <b>strength</b> was measured after veneering or after 6000 thermal cycles. With one alloy in addition long-term thermal cycling with 15, 000 and 50, 000 cycles was carried out. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Bonferroni test. RESULTS: Polished metal substrates showed a significantly lower <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> compared to the air-borne particle abraded substrates.
