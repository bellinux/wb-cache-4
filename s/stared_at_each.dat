5|$|In November 2006, at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, New Zealand {{performed}} the haka {{in the dressing}} room prior to the matchinstead of on the field immediately before kick-offafter a disagreement with the Welsh Rugby Union, which had wanted Wales to sing their national anthem after the haka. In 2008, New Zealand played Munster at Thomond Park. Before the match, Munster's four New Zealanders challenged their opponents by performing a haka before the All Blacks started theirs. On the same tour, Wales responded by silently refusing to move after New Zealand's haka, and the two teams simply <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other until the referee forced them to start the game.|$|E

25|$|On April 4, {{after the}} two {{unfamiliar}} armies had exchanged messages and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other for a few days, da Gama formed his troops into an infantry square and marched against the Imam's lines, repelling successive waves of Muslim attacks with musket and cannon. This battle ended when Imam Ahmad {{was wounded in the}} leg by a chance shot; seeing his banners signal retreat, the Portuguese and their Abyssinian allies fell upon the disorganized Muslims, who suffered losses but managed to reform next to the river on the distant side.|$|E

500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E

60|$|We did not <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other {{longer than}} a moment. Keeping tight hold of our prizes, we ran for the woods. Once in the {{security}} of a tall tree, we held up the puppies and laughed again. You see, we had to have our laugh out, no matter what happened.|$|R
60|$|Walt and Madge <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other. The miracle had happened. Wolf had barked.|$|E

A {{building}} that appears to be a house sits behind the fence, shaded by several large trees...|$|R

25|$|In the meantime, Roark {{is unable}} to find a client willing to build {{according}} to his vision. He walks away from opportunities that involve any compromise of his standards.
