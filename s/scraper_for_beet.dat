40|$|In {{transverse}} collimation systems, thin scrapers {{are used}} as primary collimators {{to interact with the}} beam halo and increase its impact parameter on the secondary collimators or absorbers. In the same way, placing the primary collimator in a dispersion region is used for momentum collimation. However, the use of <b>scrapers</b> <b>for</b> momentum collimation presents an additional disadvantage when handling medium-low energy beams. The energy lost by ionization is non negligible and the proton can be kicked out of the RF bucket. The material and thickness of the scraper have to be carefully adjusted according to the position of secondary collimators and momentum aperture of the machine. We derive simple analytical expressions for a generic case. The same calculations have been applied to the case of the SNS accumulator ring. After careful considerations, the use of <b>scrapers</b> <b>for</b> momentum collimation was ruled out in favor of a beam in gap kicker system...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on 6 Romanian Black and White cows in their first one hundred days of lactation. The aim {{was to assess the}} {{consumption}} speed (g/min), as well as the required time for consumption of 1 kg of raw forage for  alfalfa-hay, herbs silage, beet and concentrates), administered in two  portions (P 1, P 2,) per day, in 2 equal feedings (F 1, F 2) per portion. The administration order of forages (fibrous-succulents and succulents-fibrous), the number of feedings and the average consumption speed among the two portions were the experimental variants. Data was computed by ANOVA/MANOVA. The average consumption speed determined was 198. 5 g/min for concentrates, 48. 28 g/min for alfalfa hay, 203. 19 g/min for silage and 235. 32 g/min <b>for</b> <b>beets.</b> The required time for 1 kg of raw forage consumption (minutes and seconds) was 5. 02 for concentrates, 20. 43 for alfalfa hay, 4. 35 for herbs silage and 4. 15 <b>for</b> <b>beets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to examine effects of amendment of agricultural soil with river-sediment on the yield and heavy metal concentration of crops cultivated in it. Sediment was {{collected from the}} river in the industrialized and densely-populated area of Hanoi city and added to agricultural soil at the rates of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 %, followed by thorough mixing. White cabbage and beet were cultivated in pots at Hanoi Agricultural University. After harvest edible parts (leaf for white cabbage and root <b>for</b> <b>beet)</b> of both crops were weighed. The yield was highest at the soil with 30 % addition of the sediment for both crops. The total concentration of heavy metals was higher for white cabbage than <b>for</b> <b>beet</b> and was not parallel with the percentage of sediment in the soil. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in white cabbage and Cd in beet were over the Vietnam standard for maximum permissible heavy metal concentration in vegetables...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} provides {{insight into}} activities at two adjoining Aboriginal rockshelters in the Central Highlands in western Queensland, Native Well I and Native Well II. The study involved a residue and use-wear {{analysis of the}} backed artefact component of the stone assemblage. Prior to this, interpretation of the sites essentially relied on evidence of changes in stone technology over time, sequential and spatial patterning of artefacts and ethnographic analogy. This analysis revealed a range of activities occurring during the mid-to-late Holocene. Backed artefacts were used as knives, <b>scrapers</b> and/or incisors <b>for</b> wood-working and bone-working, as well as knives and <b>scrapers</b> <b>for</b> plant processing, including cooked starchy plants. Artefacts with ochre and feather residues {{may have been used}} for ceremonial purposes, while distribution of resin indicates more than half the artefacts had been hafted...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} in the process of turning the burr, the choice of which is down to personal preference. However the basic concept is that the burnishing rod is held against the edge of the scraper at a slight angle and drawn along the edge a number of times until the burr is created. One variation involves holding the rod flat {{against the side of the}} <b>scraper</b> <b>for</b> the first few passes to create a burr pointing away from the edge and this is then rolled back down by drawing the rod along perpendicular to the scraper.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} known humans at Silver Mound were Paleo-Indians, {{who entered}} the area about 9550 BC. This is {{not long after the}} last glacier began retreating a short distance to the north, when the climate remained cool and mammoths and mastodons still roamed the area. To hunt them, the Paleo-Indians needed good projectile points. They also needed knives and <b>scrapers</b> <b>for</b> processing their kill. These tools could be made from the quartzite from Silver Mound, which was the largest source of orthoquartzite in the Midwest. Tools made from Hixton orthoquartzite and datable to this period have been found as far away as Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.|$|R

50|$|Charles B. Brooks, an African American {{man from}} Newark, New Jersey, invented the U.S.' first {{self-propelled}} street sweeper truck. Brooks' patent was approved on March 17, 1896; his application for the patent had been filed on April 20, 1895. His street sweeper had a truck-like frame mounted on axles supported by wheels. There are drive-wheels for the sweeping, elevator mechanisms, and an endless chain that travels around a sprocket-wheel and travels {{up to an}} additional sprocket-wheel. The patent drawings go on to explain the complete composition of the invention. The truck had brushes attached to the front fender which would revolve.
