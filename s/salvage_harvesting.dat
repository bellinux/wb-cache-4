40|$|The {{theory of}} {{ecological}} resilience focuses on ecosystem processes that can breach thresholds and cause {{a loss of}} resilience and a switch to an altered trajectory. Using this theory, I propose hypotheses about habitat changes caused by <b>salvage</b> <b>harvesting</b> following disturbance by mountain pine beetle in Canada. Thresholds could be breached in species, soil or hydrological processes because of habitat changes. I summarize three lessons from the literature {{about the effects of}} habitat change on thresholds in species processes. Thresholds relate to the amount and quality of habitat essential for species persistence. Thresholds occur across scales according to species’ perceptions of the landscape, and can be induced by an accelerated rate of change. Thresholds are breached as a consequence of traits such as reproduction and species interactions. Policy makers can better elucidate the costs and consequences of breaching thresholds by implementing policy for <b>salvage</b> <b>harvesting</b> that supports adaptive management...|$|E

Alternative B, the proposed action and preferred alternative, would <b>salvage</b> <b>harvest</b> dead and dying trees on 9, 432 acres, and remove danger trees along haul routes, open forest routes and developed recreation sites, and administrative sites. Alternative C is designed to remove danger trees and <b>salvage</b> <b>harvest</b> primarily dead trees on 4, 188 acres where fire effects were obviously severe enough to kill 90 percent of trees, along with incidental amounts (less than 10 percent) of trees with visible green needles, within a unit.

40|$|As the {{mountain}} pine beetle (mpb) infestation expands, changes to British Columbia’s lodgepole pine forests will affect hillslope hydrology and streamflow in many watersheds (Figure 1).

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} effects of climate change are expected to be changes in the hydrologic regime. Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns have the potential to alter both the availability and quality of freshwater. The purpose of this synthesis article is to review the research on the effects of natural disturbance (focused on wildfire and insect infestation) and post-disturbance management actions on key watershed processes or values, including the streamflow magnitude and timing, stream temperature, suspended sediment, and aquatic invertebrate population dynamics. In general, research shows that the potential effects on hydrologic processes and watershed functions are greater following post-disturbance activities; however, the limited available research on past post-disturbance management practices has primarily examined the effects of clearcut <b>salvage</b> <b>harvesting.</b> To maintain the resilience of watersheds, management activities should be designed to maintain as much natural hydrologic and ecosystem function as possible.

This study evaluates the impact of prior therapy with RIT (yttrium- 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan) and different chemotherapy regimens in all FL patients (N = 103) attempting HSC mobilization at our institution over the last 7 years. Sixty-nine patients received R-CHOP (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone) or CHOP-like regimens, 21 patients received R-FM (rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone), and 13 patients received RIT before HSC mobilization.

50|$|The {{agent-based}} model {{developed for}} {{this study was designed to}} simulate the MPB attack behavior in order to evaluate how management practices influence the spatial distribution and patterns of insect population and their preferences for attacked and killed trees. Three management strategies were considered by the model: 1) no management, 2) sanitation <b>harvest</b> and 3) <b>salvage</b> <b>harvest.</b> In the model, the Beetle Agent represented the MPB behavior; the Pine Agent represented the forest environment and tree health evolution; the Forest Management Agent represented the different management strategies. The Beetle Agent follows a series of rules to decide where to fly within the forest and to select a healthy tree to attack, feed, and breed. The MPB typically kills host trees in its natural environment in order to successfully reproduce. The beetle larvae feed on the inner bark of mature host trees, eventually killing them. In order for the beetles to reproduce, the host tree must be sufficiently large and have thick inner bark. The MPB outbreaks end when the food supply decreases to the point that there is not enough to sustain the population or when climatic conditions become unfavorable for the beetle. The Pine Agent simulates the resistance of the host tree, specifically the Lodgepole pine tree, and monitors the state and attributes of each stand of trees. At some point in the MPB attack, the number of beetles per tree reaches the host tree capacity. When this point is reached, the beetles release a chemical to direct beetles to attack other trees. The Pine Agent models this behavior by calculating the beetle population density per stand and passes the information to the Beetle Agents. The Forest Management Agent was used, at the stand level, to simulate two common silviculture practices (sanitation and salvage) as well as the strategy where no management practice was employed. With the sanitation harvest strategy, if a stand has an infestation rate greater than a set threshold, the stand is removed as well as any healthy neighbor stand when the average size of the trees exceeded a set threshold. For the <b>salvage</b> <b>harvest</b> strategy, a stand is removed even it is not under a MPB attack if a predetermined number of neighboring stands are under a MPB attack.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects on}} forest {{carnivores}} of forest insects, tree diseases, wildfire, and management strategies {{designed to improve}} forest health (e. g., thinning, salvage operations, prescribed burns, and road removal) are discussed. Forest carnivores of conservation concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, USA include the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and fisher (Martes pennanti). All three species depend to some degree on forest structures, stands, and landscapes created by insects, disease, and fire. Wildfire and insect outbreaks maintain a mosaic of structural stages across the landscape that are used by lynx. Thinning of dense lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands that result largely from wildfire and insect outbreaks is detrimental to snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), which are the primary prey of lynx. Fishers use large stands of mature forest and snags, hollow live trees, logs, stumps, witches-brooms, and other structures for rest and den sites. <b>Salvage</b> <b>harvesting,</b> thinning, and conversion from predominantly fir stands to ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) may adversely affect habitat conditions for fishers.

A detailed time study was conducted on a whole tree clear-cut harvest using a ground-based system in western Montana in August 2015. The effects of downed-trees on machine productivity and cost were analyzed using the collected field data. Our results indicated that tree conditions, including standing or down, not only significantly affected the productivity of the feller-buncher, but also affected the unit costs and productivity of the entire harvesting system, changing of the bottleneck machine in a combined felling, skidding and delimbing operation.

30|$|Predicting snag {{longevity}} {{is important}} in many aspects of forest management, from quantifying habitat requirements, carbon stores, and fuel loading, to identifying safety hazards. Despite this importance, snag dynamics are still poorly understood. Studies have identified many different and often discrepant factors affecting snag persistence. Most studies have found snag age (i.e., time since death), and species significantly affect snag persistence, with some overlap between similar species. While most studies report that snag diameter affects longevity, with larger snags persisting longer than smaller snags (Keen 1955; Bull 1983; Raphael and Morrison 1987; Chambers and Mast 2005), some studies have found no impact of DBH (Schmid et al. 1985; Harrington 1996). Other factors including cause of death, tree height, soil type, site aspect, slope, microclimate, species composition, landform, <b>salvage</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and stand density {{have been identified as}} significant in some studies, but not significant in others (Keen 1955; Lyon 1977; Mitchell and Preisler 1998; Russell et al. 2006; Parish et al. 2010). Large-scale factors such as climate may also play an important role, but lack empirical evidence to describe their effects (Keen 1955; Harmon et al. 1986; Garber et al. 2005). In addition to these studies, the Fire and Fuels Extension of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS), a commonly used forest growth model, includes submodels of snag dynamics (Reinhardt and Crookston 2003). These snag submodels are largely not validated, although a few have incorporated work from the Snag Recruitment Simulator and the Coarse Woody Dynamics Model (Marcot 1992; Mellen and Ager 2002).|$|E

A regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between sale procedures and the delivered log price. The model indicated that sale to export buyers and the number of buyers contacted were positively associated with sale price; payment of the logger on a percentage basis, lack of familiarity with price levels and trends, and buyer-initiated sales were negatively associated with the sales price.

Four species groups were selected for harvest; white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina), post oak (Quercus stellata), and hickories (Carya spp.) which were not separated into specific species. Of these species groups, 220 trees were selected for harvest and felled following the collection of the diameter (in.), total height (ft.), and crown height (ft.). The total weight of the trees were collected prior to bucking and followed with the collection of the weight of the merchantable portion of the stem alone, without the tree top, and the weights of any sawlogs bucked from the merchantable stem.

The panel data model alleviates possible collinearity among climatic variables, accounts for the effect of omitted or unobserved variables, and incorporates natural and human adaptation, thus representing a more robust approach to analyzing climate change impacts. SPB outbreaks in Louisiana and Texas appeared to move together; infestations in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee were highly correlated; and Virginia demonstrated its unique temporal pattern of SPB outbreaks. <b>Salvage</b> <b>harvest</b> was found to be helpful in lessening future infestation risk. Warmer winters and springs would positively contribute to SPB outbreaks with spring temperature showing a more severe and persistent impact than winter temperature; increases in fall temperature would ease SPB outbreaks; and summer temperature would have a mixed impact on SPB infestations. Compared to temperature, precipitation would have a much smaller impact on SPB infestations. While increases in the previous winter, spring, and fall precipitation would enhance SPB outbreak risk in the current year, a wetter summer would reduce infestations 3 years later. Global climate change induced by doubling atmospheric CO 2 concentration would intensify SPB infestation risk by 2. 5 – 5 times. If the changes in the area and productivity of southern pine forests due to climate change are accounted for, SPB would cause even more severe damage, 4 – 7. 5 times higher than the current value of trees killed annually...|$|R

Additional information on the Mountain Pine Beetle Program may be found at: [URL] fragmentation can generally be considered as two components: 1) compositional change representing forest loss, and 2) configurational change or change in the arrangement of forest land cover. Forest loss and configurational change occur simultaneously, resulting in difficulties isolating the impacts of each component. Measures of forest fragmentation typically consider forest loss and configurational change together. The ecological responses to forest loss and configurational change are different, thus motivating the creation of measures capable of isolating these separate components. In this research, we develop and demonstrate a measure, the proportion of landscape displacement from configuration (P), to quantify the relative contributions of forest loss and configurational change to forest fragmentation. Landscapes with statistically significant forest loss or configurational change are identified using neutral landscape simulations to generate underlying distributions for P.

When the geographic distribution of landscape pattern varies, global indices fail to capture the spatial nonstationarity within the dataset. Methods that measure landscape pattern at a spatially local scale are advantageous, as an index is computed at each point in the dataset. The geographic distribution of local indices is used to discover spatial trends. Local indicators for categorical data (LICD) {{can be used to}} statistically quantify local spatial patterns in binary geographic datasets. LICD, like other spatially local methods, are impacted by decisions relating to the spatial scale of the data, such as the data grain (p), and analysis parameters such as the size of the local neighbourhood (m). The goal {{of this article is to}} demonstrate how the choice of the m and p parameters impacts LICD analysis. We also briefly discuss the impacts spatial extent can have on analysis; specifically the local composition measure.

40|$|A {{concern to}} {{reforestation}} efforts following the recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is {{the migration of}} the below-ground herbivore Warren root collar weevil, Hylobius warreni Wood, from stands with a high percentage (> 80 %) of mature, dead lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var latifolia Dougl. ex. Loud., into adjacent young, replanted stands, resulting in significant levels of mortality to juvenile trees. The effects of the spatial patterns of <b>salvage</b> <b>harvesting</b> following outbreaks of mountain pine beetle {{on the development of}} Warren root collar weevil pressure in neighbouring, regenerating stands was examined in young lodgepole pine stands in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada. Gradients of tree mortality caused by feeding of Warren root collar weevils were observed and found to be dependent on characteristics of the adjacent, unsalvaged stands. Mortality was exacerbated by high components of dead pine in these stands, and became worse over time. To investigate whether reduced host availability is a potential causal factor explaining such patterns, I constructed three research plots consisting of combinations of live tree, dead tree and mixed (i. e., live and dead) tree habitats and observed dispersal patterns of labeled insects. Weevils {{were more likely to be}} captured close to the release location in the mixed and live habitats vs. the dead habitat. Movement rate was high in the dead habitat compared with the live and mixed habitats. In the plot with the dead habitat adjacent to the location of release, the probability of capture was lower, but movement rate and dispersal distance were greater, indicating that Warren root collar weevils will disperse out of a habitat with dead trees into a habitat with live trees. Implications to reforestation strategies following savage harvesting are discussed. [...] P. ii. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|E

The {{body of literature}} with detailed empirical data on log resources in diverse habitats in the Interior Columbia River Basin is sparse.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 This study {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the persistence of silvicultural treatments into the stem exclusion stage of forest development in an experiment originally designed to test the effectiveness of various white spruce (Picea glauca Moench [Voss]) regeneration practices. Many studies in the North American boreal forest address the effect of silvicultural treatments on a single tree species, specifically white spruce in the great majority of cases. The experiment measured in this study provided an excellent opportunity to compare treatment effects on white spruce density and growth. The Rosie Creek Fire Tree Regeneration Installation experiment represents an operational-scale, spatially-explicit, replicated design on a single site disturbed consecutively by high-severity wildfire and clearcut <b>salvage</b> <b>harvest.</b> Three hierarchical factors, each with multiple levels, were examined: landform type, ground scarification methods, and white spruce regeneration methods. All three of the experimental factors exercised continuing influence on the patterns of white spruce regeneration and growth. The treatment effects did not attenuate over time for white spruce, and we found statistically significant effects that the original researchers could only describe as tendencies. However, relatively few studies address treatment impacts on non-target species or determine how the silvicultural treatments affect a site's overall woody biomass production. Experimental silvicultural practices targeted in this study to improve white spruce survival had profound effects on other dominant upland tree species such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and Alaska birch (Betula neoalaskana Sarg.). Interior Alaska timber species demonstrate different regeneration strategies to post-disturbance environmental conditions, especially residual organic soil layer thickness and spatial configuration of surviving potential seed sources. Effective silvicultural practices must consider each species' unique reproductive biology, and clonal sprouting as a source of aspen persistence was a particularly important example in our study. Site differences, such as we found between the slope and ridge landforms, are a key consideration for implementing effective silvicultural practices. Significant interactions between the regeneration treatments and landform types proved to be critical to meet specific reforestation objectives, particularly the different herbaceous vegetation cover types, presence/absence of aspen clonal rootstocks, and spatial configurations regarding seed sources. Managing mixed species stands, which are common in the lightly managed portions of the boreal forest, requires not only the consideration of the future crop tree, but the interacting effects of silvicultural practices on all tree species...|$|R
30|$|The most robust {{calculation}} of satellite-image-derived burn ratio indices uses post-fire images acquired {{during the middle}} of the summer when solar elevation angles are maximized and topographic and tree shadows are minimized. Because containment dates of many fires in the western US occur after the fall equinox, the best images for minimizing shadows can only be acquired during the summer of the year after the fire. Therefore, the fire severity mapping methodologies evolved using these “extended” assessments created from post-fire images acquired during the summer after the fire (Key and Benson 2006). Additional benefits of extended assessments include reduction of ash-related reflectance, and they allow for one season of delayed mortality or flushing of new growth on defoliated trees. These factors may lead to more accurate representations of forest structural change in some situations. However, post-fire management actions (e.g., <b>salvage</b> <b>harvesting),</b> post-fire regrowth of herbaceous vegetation, and sprouting of shrubs before image acquisition can cause confusion when interpreting the images (Crotteau et al. 2013, Miller and Quayle 2015, Safford et al. 2015). Since 2007, management requirements for more immediate estimates of fire effects to guide post-fire response has given rise to the production of initial assessments, which use post-fire images collected 30 to 45 days after fire containment (Miller and Quayle 2015). These initial assessments, however, can be adversely affected by shadows, depending upon topographic complexity and how late in the year the post-fire image is acquired. For example, a sun elevation angle of 40 °, which occurs at the latitude of our study area in mid-October, means that north-facing slopes > 40 ° will be in complete shadow. As a result, in non-hazy clear sky conditions, which are typical in our study area, satellite reflectance values for areas in complete shadow will be greatly reduced to near zero regardless of whether live vegetation exists or not (Chavez 1988). Additionally, when the fire’s containment date is very late in the year, it may be necessary to use an image acquired while the fire is still active to avoid cloud cover, which blocks the satellite’s view of the earth’s surface.|$|E

The amount of time available to salvage harvest damaged trees is unknown, especially on seasonal and regional scales. Manipulative experiments were established in Pinus radiata forests to examine this seasonal and regional variation in sapstain attack following windthrow, and to investigate the importance of bark beetles as vectors of sapstain fungi. A range of methods were implemented to assess the role of bark beetles as vectors and to ascertain which sapstain fungi are associated with them. Experimental billet logs were caged to exclude beetles and subsequently analyse fungal attack in comparison with identical logs left exposed to beetles. In addition, individual beetles were sampled directly to determine whether they carried spores of particular fungal species and to assess the degree of association in vector-fungal dynamics. Finally, a novel application of DNA melt peak analysis was developed to investigate variation among the fungal communities associated with beetles potentially involved in vectoring sapstain spores. The moisture content of fallen trees was found to be the main factor regulating sapstain development, and when moisture content drops below 100 % (on dry weight basis) sapstain fungi grew rapidly. The speed at which this level drops depends on the season, with much faster drying occurring in the warmer months of spring and summer. As a result, trees that fell in the previous winter or autumn did not develop significant sapstain levels until temperatures rose in the following summer, suggesting that storm-damaged trees that fall in winter can be left safely until just before the next summer before they are no longer suitable for salvage harvest. In New Zealand, the bark beetle species acting as vectors of sapstain fungi are not behaviourally adapted to colonisation of logs that are not in contact with the ground. Following windthrow events in pine forests, trees generally lie with their stems suspended above the level of the ground by their branches. As a result, under these circumstances, beetle colonisation of windthrown timber was low, and bark beetles were not a significant vector of stain. The caged and un-caged experimental log billets, however, were in contact with the ground, resulting in colonisation of the un-caged logs. In this case, bark beetles did {{play an important role in}} contributing to sapstain intensity, and the stain distribution within the logs mirrored that of the stain distribution. However, this effect may be due to the provision of access points for wind- or water-borne spores of the non-insect vectored stain fungus Diplodia pinea, or to the spread of hyphae through the tunnelling and feeding activities of beetles within the tree, rather than by bark beetles acting as vectors of spores. Bark beetles were confirmed as sapstain vectors with the isolation of seven different ophiostomatoid stain fungi from them, five of which were also found in wood. Finally, the development of a laboratory based, rapid species identification method was developed to identify fungal DNA. Melt peak analysis allowed the species-specific DNA melt temperatures to be compared with the melt temperatures of known species to be able to rapidly, and cheaply, identify an unknown species. Bark beetles are vectors of sapstain fungi in P. radiata forests, however the bark beetle species naturalised in New Zealand prefer to colonise wood when it is in contact with the ground. Following windthrow, trees are generally not attacked by beetles as they are held from the ground by their branches, leaving them to be stained predominantly be wind and rain dispersed stain fungus D. pinea. Stain did not occur until the moisture content of fallen trees dropped below 100 %, which only happens in the warm months of summer and spring. In New Zealand, there are interactions between trees and bark beetles, and bark beetles with fungal pathogens from all around the globe resulting in a unique novel assemblage of species together for the first time. Understanding the dynamics of these species in their novel environment is crucial to effectively responding to potential pest threats...|$|E
40|$|Output {{from the}} SELES MPB Landscape Scale Mountain Pine Beetle Model (Fall et al., 2004) was {{utilized}} to estimate potential mountain pine beetle spread rates within the Hinton Wood Products Forest Management Area (HFMA) of the Foothills Model Forest. From the SELES model output three spread rate scenarios were hypothesized. Scenario 1 hypothesized a Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) spread rate {{slower than the}} rate estimated by the SELES MPB Model. Within Scenario 1, current Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) levels were hypothesized to be adequate to harvest MPB damaged lodgepole pine stands. Scenario 2 hypothesized that spread rates {{would be consistent with}} the recommended run from the SELES MPB Model, resulting in attack {{of the majority of the}} stands within the HFMA within 29 years. Scenario 3 hypothesized that spread rates would be higher than estimated by the SELES MPB Model, resulting in attack of the majority of lodgepole pine stand in the HFMA in 20 years (Scenario 3. 1) or 10 years (Scenario 3. 2). The even flow harvest rates required to utilize commercially viable stands attacked by MPB were determined (Surge Period). The modeling program Forest Muncher was utilized to estimate the decrease in AAC which could result from succession / <b>salvage</b> <b>harvest</b> of the majority of lodgepole pine stands within the HFMA within each scenario (Post Surge Period). Based on these AAC estimates, the potential economic impact of MPB attack influenced AAC changes was examined utilizing output from the Computable General Equilibrium Framework (CGE) Model developed by Mike Patriquin and Bill White of the Canadian Forest Service (Patriquin et al., 2005). Scenario 1 had a nearly inappreciable impact on the economic indicators for the forest industry or the total economy in the Foothills Model Forest Area. Within Scenario 2, forest industry revenue, royalties, labour income, and employment were estimated to increase by 40 – 50 % during the Surge Period and decrease by 4. 7 – 6. 0 % in the Post Surge Period. Within Scenarios 3. 1 and 3. 2 forestry revenue, royalties, labour income and employment increases ranged from 70 – 90 % for Scenario 3. 1 and ranged from 160 – 210 % for Scenario 3. 2 during the Surge Period. Revenue, royalties, labour income and employment in the forest industry were estimated to decrease by 6 – 9 % within the Post Surge Periods of Scenarios 3. 1 and 3. 2.

40|$|Uncertainty {{in forest}} {{productivity}} prediction and the variable reduction from wind and fire damage makes predictions of forest Net Present Values (NPVs) and carbon sequestration uncertain, creating a distribution of possible future outcomes for new forestry investments. To quantify {{the distribution of}} NPV and carbon sequestered at harvest a stochastic modelling system was used incorporating uncertainty around the expected site productivity of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) (Palmer, Hock et al. 2009) with the influence of catastrophic wind and fire damage (Moore, Manley et al. 2011, Anderson, Doherty et al. 2008). By combining uncertainty in forest productivity estimation with that of volume reduction from catastrophic damage this system captured a complete picture of potential forest growth outcomes for forest volume and carbon sequestration. The stochastic forest modelling system used repeated runs of the 300 Index growth model (Kimberley, West et al. 2005) inside the Atlas Forecaster forest modelling software (Snook 2010). Site Index and 300 Index values were used to calibrate the model to site productivity. They were generated using the R statistics package (R Core Team 2012) with means, variances and correlation based on the sampled uncertainty of spatially modelled productivity estimates referenced against measured PSP data. The generated productivity indices were used to construct Forecaster project files which were used to initiate model runs. Simulated stem volume and stocking from forest growth simulation were {{used to calculate the}} likelihood of wind damage (Moore and Quine, 2000) for catastrophic damage simulation. The simulated average probability of damage was calibrated to match the surveyed regional average rates of wind and fire occurrence in Moore, Manley et al. (2011) and Anderson, S. A. J., et al. (2008) respectively. Growth simulations selected for damage were modified to represent <b>salvage</b> <b>harvest</b> operations and re-run with an earlier harvest matched to the year of the simulated event. Damaged simulations were modified with a higher proportion of logging waste and NPV calculations using increased logging costs. The NPVs and total carbon sequestered for the collated final simulations were used to display the likelihood of each simulated outcome. Results were compared across differing levels of catastrophic damage on high and low productivity sites. The addition of wind and fire damage to NPV estimates lowered the mean NPV especially for high productivity sites. However, the stochastic NPV estimates contained large variation and no statistically significant results were achieved, even with high numbers of repeated simulations. A reduction in total carbon sequestered prior to harvest due to wind and fire of between 3 and 5 % was found for the case study forest in the Central North Island of New Zealand. However, there was a large amount of variation in the simulations around these means and the observed reduction was not statistically significant. Confidence intervals for estimates of carbon sequestration without wind and fire damage were between 5 % and 10 % of the mean, and the addition of wind and fire damage increased variance and confidence intervals to 20 % of the mean. The results and conclusions show the significance of uncertainty for new forest investments on previously un-forested land both in terms of NPV and carbon sequestration. The trend across all scenarios with catastrophic damage is a tailed distribution with the main proportion of outcomes centred on the expected deterministically calculated value, for both carbon sequestered and NPVs. On average NPVs were reduced by $ 600 /ha through the inclusion of average rates of catastrophic damage. However, there was high variation in the result and the predicted reduction is not statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 42 {{consecutive}} patients undergoing infrainguinal vascular reconstruction for limb <b>salvage</b> using vein <b>harvested</b> from the arm were followed prospectively {{to determine the}} long-term graft patency and stenosis rates. Vein harvested from the arm ('arm vein') was used for secondary or tertiary reconstruction in 22 patients (52. 4 %). The outflow was to a single calf vessel in 37 grafts (88. 1 %). The cumulative primary, primary assisted and secondary graft patency rates were 35. 6 %, 49. 6 % and 59. 5 % at 2 years, respectively, and the limb salvage rate was 69. 0 % at 2 years. Eight grafts developed stenoses detected by a graft surveillance programme. Six stenoses were dilated successfully with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and one was treated with an interposition vein graft. Bypass using arm vein is time-consuming and technically demanding as multiple anastomoses are often required. Arm vein grafts, however, have no greater incidence of stenosis than long saphenous vein grafts and these stenoses may be dilated with PTA with good results. The long-term outcome suggests that an arm vein graft is an important treatment option {{in the absence of}} the long saphenous vein...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Two first-order forested {{watersheds}} (WS 80 and WS 77) on poorly drained pine-hardwood {{stands in}} the South Carolina Coastal Plain have been monitored since mid- 1960 s to characterize the hydrology, water quality and vegetation dynamics. This study examines the flow and nutrient dynamics of these two watersheds using 13 years (1 969 - 76 and 1977 - 81) of data prior to Hurricane Hugo (1 989) and nearly 10 years (1 990 - 1 992, 1996 - 99, and 2003 - 06) immediately after Hugo. WS 80 remained as a control throughout the study period, whereas WS 77 underwent several treatments including prescribed burning, partial <b>harvest,</b> <b>salvage</b> logging and prescribed fire for red-cockaded woodpecker habitat management. Depending upon the antecedent moisture conditions, both the watersheds were highly responsive of rainfall events throughout the periods. Accordingly, annual outflows varied from 5 % in 1981 to 59 % in 1998 {{with an average of}} 22 % of the annual precipitation for the control (WS 80) and from 9 % in 2004 to 44 % in 1991, with an average of 27 % for the treatment watershed (WS 77).

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to manage values other than timber production, {{forestry}} companies have sought a new paradigm to manage forest resources. Based on the hypothesis that wildlife in the boreal forest has adapted to habitat structures created by natural disturbances, some forest harvests have been modified to approximate patterns left after natural disturbance. Attempts at approximating natural disturbance have included retention of patches of live trees within cutblock boundaries, cutting to natural stand boundaries and application of harvest plans with spatio-temporally aggregated cutblocks (single-pass harvests). Single-pass harvesting is a recent attempt to better approximate natural disturbance in the boreal {{and has not been}} evaluated for its potential to sustain wildlife. I therefore contrasted residual patch pattern and composition, as well as landscape-scale avian abundance and composition in 1) single-pass; 2) multi-pass; and 3) <b>salvage</b> logged post-fire <b>harvests,</b> and contrasted these with unsalvaged post-fire sites. Post-fire sites were used to define the Natural Range of Variation (NRV). Seventy-two plots (12 post-fire, 15 post-salvage harvest, 16 single-pass harvest, and 29 multi-pass harvest) were surveyed for avian community composition and abundance one to five years post disturbance. I contrasted the composition of remaining live forest stands at the landscape-scale and in residual patches by pairwise comparison of pre- and post-disturbance composition. At the landscape-scale, non-metric mutlidimensional scaling suggested post-disturbance landscape composition of post-fire and salvage-logged plots was similar to pre-disturbance landscape composition, with a tendency toward greater survival of hardwoods and lower survival of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) or black spruce (Picea mariana). However, harvesting of hardwoods and mixedwood stand types in single and multi-pass harvests led to landscapes with more bog and swamp habitats. Comparison of residual patch composition with pre-disturbance composition was made using blocked multi-response permutation procedures. Post-fire plots (i. e. NRV) had residual patches that were representative of pre-disturbance composition, but with slightly more hardwoods and less black spruce/jack pine than expected by chance. All harvested treatments had similar biases among residuals to those left by fire, except that multi-pass harvests tended to leave less mixedwood habitat than expected. Multi-pass harvests also had less area in residual patches, and patches were smaller, more isolated and less complex in shape. Single-pass harvests had residual patches that were more representative of the size, shape, complexity, and change in composition seen post-fire. Multi-pass harvests only had 14 % of the residual patch area in patches at least 5 ha in size, whereas this proportion was higher in fire (83 %), salvage-logged areas (42 %), and single-pass harvests (57 %). Old-growth associated species might only persist in patches 5 ha or larger, and so multi-pass harvesting may have negative consequences for these forest birds. Redundancy analysis indicated that bird communities differed from the NRV in all harvest treatments. However, single-pass harvests provided a slightly better fit to NRV than did multi-pass harvesting. Community similarity was influenced by non-linear responses to area harvested, residual retention, residual composition and pre-disturbance forest composition. An optimization routine was used to select harvest characteristics that would maximize community similarity to NRV. Optimization suggested that community similarity to NRV can be maximized by using single-pass harvests over multi-pass harvests, harvesting 66 - 88 % of of a planning unit, and retaining 5 - 19 % of the harvest area as live residual patches. My results suggest that single-pass harvesting may be ecologically more sustainable than multi-pass harvests. Future studies are required to determine whether both harvesting treatments converge with NRV through time. Greater overlap of salvage-logged avian communities with NRV suggests that experimentation with prescribed fire as a post-harvest treatment may be the best method to bring harvests ecologically closer to NRV, and highlights the need to conserve early post-fire habitats...|$|R
