40|$|OBJECTIVES: in {{patients}} with vascular prosthesis infection, to compare surgical outcome and long-term results of cryopreserved allograft implantations to conventional surgery. DESIGN: retrospective study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: two asynchronous series of 44 [series I: 1980 - 1994; 8 patients with aortoenteric fistula (AEF) ] and 22 (series II: 1994 - 1997; 4 patients with AEF) patients were treated for prosthesis infection. All patients had prosthesis excision. <b>In</b> <b>series</b> I, there were 4 in situ reparations, 26 extra-anatomic bypass, 13 excision only, and one death at laparotomy. <b>In</b> <b>series</b> II, <b>in</b> situ cryopreserved allografts were implanted in all patients. RESULTS: operative mortality was 16 % <b>in</b> <b>series</b> I and 13. 6 % <b>in</b> <b>series</b> II. For AEF patients, mortality was 37 % <b>in</b> <b>series</b> I and 50 % <b>in</b> <b>series</b> II. Among hospital survivors, infection-related late mortality was 13. 5 % <b>in</b> <b>series</b> I and 5 % <b>in</b> <b>series</b> II.
