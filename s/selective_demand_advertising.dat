40|$|The {{research}} question {{addressed in this}} study was, "Do changes in promotional expenditure cause changes {{in the size of}} the market (primary demand) or market share (<b>selective</b> <b>demand)</b> ?" Two types of promotion were evaluated; sales calls to physicians and medical journal advertising. The sales elasticities of each of these promotional techniques were estimated through the use of ARIMA modeling. The market expansive effects and the market share effects were measured for each of 7 drugs in two therapeutic categories, the benzodiazepines and diuretics. The results of the analysis showed that there was no correlation between changes in detailing or journal advertising expenditures and primary or <b>selective</b> <b>demand.</b> Thus, it was assumed that the primary and <b>selective</b> <b>demand</b> elasticities for pharmaceutical advertising may be equal to zero. Drug manufacturers should evaluate the effects of reductions in their promotional expenditures, changes in promotional content, as well as seek alternative methods of advertising which may have a higher sales elasticity and effectiveness. ...|$|R

The data were analyzed by computing percentages, and it revealed several trends. The more television children watched, the more they <b>demanded</b> <b>advertised</b> products.

40|$|Print media {{markets have}} two unique features. First, market actors are faced by two interrelated demand curves: the <b>demand</b> for <b>advertising</b> and the <b>demand</b> for the print medium itself. Consequently, {{the print media}} industry’s pricing {{behavior}} {{is different from the}} pricing behavior of traditional industries where there is just one demand curve. Second, print media have recently started to produce an at least potentially perfect substitute for their initial product, namely newspaper and magazine websites. This paper studies the price–setting behavior of German women’s magazines and also provides empirical evidence {{on the extent to which}} website provision affects the demand for magazines and the <b>demand</b> for <b>advertising</b> space. It is shown that magazines whose <b>advertising</b> <b>demand</b> is highly cover–price elastic (e. g. inverse <b>advertising</b> <b>demand</b> strongly reacts to changes in cover prices) price their products markedly below marginal cost.

40|$|The {{current crisis}} of the media {{industry}} {{is a consequence of}} poor revenues from the advertising market. Actually, advertising revenues are contributing more than 60 % to the total revenues of German mass media, thus dominating the economic performance of media firms. This empirical contribution seeks to understand the cyclical behavior pattern of the advertising market and to test if the recent slump in <b>advertising</b> <b>demand</b> follows this cyclical pattern. In a first step, spectral analysis is used to identify potential cycle lengths. In a second step, the explanatory power of cycles for <b>advertising</b> <b>demand</b> is evaluated by inserting the most important cycle lengths into a regression model. All estimations are based on yearly data of the German advertising market from 1960 to 2003, differentiated by five types of media. The results underline a strong influence of overlapping cycles for the advertising market, with advertising in magazines being the only exception.

That is, it enables them to judge not only total market growth or decline but also trends in customers’ selections among competitors. Generally, sales growth resulting from primary demand (total market growth) is less costly and more profitable than that achieved by capturing share from competitors. Conversely, losses in market share can signal serious long-term problems that require strategic adjustments. Firms with market shares below a certain level may not be viable.

The current study extends these ideas by examining the influence of <b>selective</b> attention <b>demands</b> on remembering. In Experiment 1, participants read aloud the red word in a pair of red and green interleaved words. Half of the items were congruent (the interleaved words were the same), and the other half were incongruent (the interleaved words were different). Following the study phase, participants completed a recognition memory test with a remember/know classification. A mirror effect was observed in the recognition memory data, with better memory for incongruent than for congruent items. In Experiment 2, context was only partially reinstated at test, and again better memory for incongruent compared to congruent items was observed. However, the processes supporting recognition decisions varied depending on context reinstatement, with only full context reinstatement resulting in differences in recollection for congruent and incongruent items. These results demonstrate that <b>selective</b> attention process <b>demands</b> associated with incongruent items affect episodic learning. Rosner, T. M. – M. Sc.

Applying the rules to Norwegian salmon promotion in France for the period 1996 Â– 98, study results suggest that the actual quarterly allocation of 4, 52, 17, 27 was inefficient in that the optimal allocation of 23, 26, 20, 31 would have enhanced producer profits by 9. 8 million kroner, equal to 27 % of the total promotion outlay.

The phonological loop is responsible for maintaining hypotheses, while the central executive carries out mental operations that enable the use of hypotheses that are logically consistent with the given feedback.

In the two-echelon system, the manufacturer sells a newsvendor-type product through the buyer who faces a random <b>demand</b> depending on <b>advertising</b> expenditure and selling price. Before {{the start of the}} selling period, the buyer needs to determine how much she should invest in advertising, how many units of products she should order from the manufacturer and at what price she should sell the ordered products. At the end of the selling period, when the revealed demand exceeds stock on hand, all the superfluous demand is met by a second order from the manufacturer, if unfilled customers are offered a discount in selling price. Based on the buyer's first order, the manufacturer needs to select his initial production quantity under a relatively cheap but long lead-time production mode, and responds to the buyer's second order with an expensive but quick-response production mode (if necessary). Under both the centralized and decentralized setting, we formulate mathematical models of how two members make their decisions, respectively, and provide the closed-form solution to each model. In order to achieve perfect coordination of the supply chain, we propose an improved sales rebate contract, which can arbitrarily allocate the profit between two parties. Finally, we implement a numerical study to illustrate the models.

50|$|Since the invent of demarketing in the 1970’s, many {{different}} strategies for implementing demarketing have evolved. Traditionally in marketing - {{which seeks to}} grow the consumer base and increase the demand for a product or service - the 4 P’s are product, price, place/distribution and promotion. The logic then follows that demarketing would adapt this structure to serve the opposite purpose of reducing the consumer base and discouraging demand for a product and service. Instead of increasing availability of a product or service, a demarketing strategy would be to actually restrict availability. Furthermore, demarketing would seek to increase availability of the alternatives and highlight the downside of the product or service, therefore making it less attractive to consumers. To demarket in the pricing arena, the taxes or price might increase {{with the purpose of}} shrinking the <b>demand.</b> <b>Advertising</b> can be minimized or eliminated.
