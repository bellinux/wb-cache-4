Mulder, however, begins to suspect Detweiler after learning that he had been at the vet's office; Mulder believes that he is the dhole and is tranquilizing himself in an attempt to stop murdering. Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the Dhole and placed in the hospital. Mulder then visits Berquist and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> she has not been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler when she saw him. She also says that he will try to finish off Cahn. Mulder worriedly tells Scully, who remains skeptical.|$|E

Liz enters Tracy's {{dressing}} room—with the mustache intact—to take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz had been looking for her.

500|$|After Leslie {{notices the}} name [...] "Liz Waverly" [...] {{in one of}} Kelly's Twilight books, Kelly admits she is his 12-year-old daughter. He is {{divorced}} from her mother, and wants to put Twilight into the time capsule to impress her. Leslie now wants to include it, but Ben (Adam Scott) says if she makes one exception, everyone will want their own item in the capsule. Leslie decides to hold a public meeting so all citizens can make suggestions for capsule items. The meeting descends into chaos when the participants argue over what to include and make absurd suggestions, like human ashes and dead cats. Conservative activist Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) argues Twilight should not be included because it is too anti-Christian, while a civil liberties organization member says that the book isn't suitable because it is pro-Christian. Leslie tries to compromise by making multiple time capsules, but she ultimately decides to stick to one capsule and include nothing except a video recording of the meeting, which she said represents Pawnee because it shows [...] "a {{lot of people with}} a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in". Ben, a visiting state auditor, <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> the residents of Pawnee are strange, but he is impressed by their passion.|$|E
2500|$|The actresses {{who played}} the ghosts of the murdered Grady daughters, Lisa and Louise Burns, are {{identical}} twins; however, {{the characters in the}} book and film script are merely sisters, not twins. In the film's dialogue, Mr. Ullman <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> they were [...] "about eight and ten". Nonetheless, they are frequently referred to in discussions about the film as [...] "the Grady twins".|$|E
2500|$|On May 14, 2008, it was {{announced}} that Kornheiser had accepted a buyout from the Post. [...] "I love the paper. They were great to me every day that I was there," [...] he told Reuters. [...] "But I don't do much for the paper anymore." [...] Kornheiser had not written a regular column for the paper's print edition since 2006. However, Wilbon and Tony continued to tape a [...] "Talking Points" [...] mini online TV feature for the Washington Post until June 3, 2009 when an installment termed the final one was posted on the Post's site. In it Michael Wilbon <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> there will be further installments while Kornheiser seems certain it is a permanent decision management has made.|$|E

2500|$|Some in the {{scientific}} community are skeptical of Pepperberg's findings, pointing to Alex's communications as operant conditioning. Critics point to the case of Clever Hans, a horse who could apparently count, but who was actually understanding subtle cues from the questioner. [...] In another case, Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee was thought to be using language, but there is some debate over whether he simply imitated his teacher. Dr. Herbert Terrace, who worked with Nim Chimpsky, <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> Alex performed by rote rather than using language; he calls Alex's responses [...] "a complex discriminating performance", adding that in every situation, [...] "there is an external stimulus that guides his response." [...] However, supporters of Alex say that Alex was able to talk to and perform for anyone involved in the project as well as complete strangers who recorded findings, though such interactions do not involve the strict conditions required to exclude rote and operant responding.|$|E
2500|$|Art Vandelay {{is first}} used in [...] "The Stake Out". George and Jerry invent {{an excuse to}} explain their {{presence}} in the lobby of an office building. They explain that they're meeting Art Vandelay, an importer-exporter who works in the building. In [...] "The Boyfriend", George tells the unemployment office he's close to getting a job at [...] "Vandelay Industries", a latex manufacturer. George later applies the name to a fictional problem boyfriend of Elaine, part of an elaborate cover story to hide from Susan that he's also dating Marisa Tomei ("The Cadillac"). George uses the name when asked which authors he reads during an interview with Elaine's publishing house in [...] "The Red Dot". In [...] "The Bizarro Jerry", George asks the receptionist at Brandt/Leland for a Mr. Art Vendelay, to which she replies, [...] "there's no Mr. Vandelay here". In [...] "The Serenity Now", George invents fake customers, one of whom is [...] "Mr. Vandelay", to hide his lack of sales success. In [...] "The Bizarro Jerry", George asks to see Mr. Vandelay as part of a ruse to approach an attractive secretary. In [...] "The Puerto Rican Day", George pretends to be Vandelay (Jerry pretends to be [...] "Kal Varnsen", and Kramer is [...] "H.E. Pennypacker") to take advantage of an open house to watch a Mets game on television. In [...] "The Finale", the name of the presiding judge is actually Arthur Vandelay, much to George's amazement. George <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> it's [...] "good luck" [...] that that is the judge's name, though this turns out to be false.|$|E

As he is leaving, Andy casually loans Erin a copy of Shrek 2, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> she would like it. A deflated Gabe realizes that Erin is far more excited about the movie Andy recommended her than the one he picked out.|$|R
