5|$|The Life of <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson</b> or Life of <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson,</b> LL. D. {{was written}} by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full {{biography}} of Samuel Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson</b> being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins {{was a friend of}} Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life of <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson</b> came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, {{it would}} seem that cricket was a normal {{activity}} at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson</b> entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson.</b> A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during {{the first quarter of the}} 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century {{two members}} of the clan earned {{considerable}} regard for their Gaelic poetry. James, the poet-chief, (1727–1799) is best remembered for a biting satire he composed in Gaelic in response to <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson,</b> the English encyclopedist, who had made derogatory comments about the Scots in his famous trip to the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|Irene is a Neoclassical tragedy written between 1726 and 1749 by <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson.</b> It has the {{distinction}} of being the work Johnson considered his greatest failure. Since his death, the critical consensus has been that he was right to think so.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1787, William <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson,</b> {{the son of}} Dr. <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson,</b> was {{unanimously}} elected President of Columbia College. Prior {{to serving}} at the university, Johnson {{had participated in the}} First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The Plays of William Shakespeare was an 18th-century {{edition of}} the {{dramatic}} works of William Shakespeare, edited by <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson</b> and George Steevens. Johnson announced his intention to edit Shakespeare's plays in his Miscellaneous Observations on Macbeth (1745), and a full Proposal for the edition was published in 1756. The edition was finally published in 1765.|$|E
5|$|The Thraliana was a diary kept by Hester Thrale and {{is part of}} {{the genre}} known as table talk. Although the work began as Thrale's diary focused on her {{experience}} with her family, it slowly changed focus to emphasise various anecdotes and stories about the life of <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson.</b> The work was used as a basis for Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson,</b> but the Thraliana remained unpublished until 1942. The anecdotes contained within the work were popular with Thrale's contemporaries but seen as vulgar. Among 20th century readers, the work was popular, and many literary critics believe that the work is a valuable contribution to the genre and for providing information about Johnson's and her own life.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Pall Mall {{was well}} known for its shops {{as well as its}} grand houses. The shops {{included}} that of the Vulliamy family who made clocks at No.68 between 1765 and 1854. Robert Dodsley ran a bookshop at No.52, where he suggested the idea of a dictionary to <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson.</b> Writers and artists began to move to Pall Mall during this century; both Richard Cosway and Thomas Gainsborough lived at Schomberg House at Nos.80–82.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his lack}} of an {{extensive}} formal education, Brock appreciated its importance. As an adult, he spent much time reading {{in an attempt to}} improve his education. He read many works on military tactics and science, but he also read ancient history and other less immediately practical topics. At the time of his death, he owned a modest library of books, including classic works by Shakespeare, Voltaire, and <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson.</b>|$|E
5|$|Literary figures {{associated}} with Birmingham include <b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson</b> who stayed in Birmingham {{for a short}} period and was born in nearby Lichfield. Arthur Conan Doyle worked in the Aston area of Birmingham whilst poet Louis MacNeice lived in Birmingham for six years. It was whilst staying in Birmingham that American author Washington Irving produced several of his most famous literary works, such as Bracebridge Hall and The Humorists, A Medley which are based on Aston Hall.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samuel</b> <b>Johnson</b> (18 September 1709 13 December 1784) was an English author born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He was {{a sickly}} infant who early on began to exhibit the tics that would {{influence}} how people viewed {{him in his}} later years. From childhood he displayed great intelligence and an eagerness for learning, but his early years were dominated by his family's financial strain and his efforts to establish himself as a school teacher.|$|E
