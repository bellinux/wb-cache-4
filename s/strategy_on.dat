5|$|The Persian <b>strategy,</b> <b>on</b> {{the other}} hand, was {{probably}} principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and {{no match for}} hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of Thermopylae and Plataea.) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.|$|E
5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his <b>strategy</b> <b>on</b> {{the structure of}} the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{the impacts}} of various design <b>strategies</b> <b>on</b> {{satisfying}} {{the requirements of the}} target system is one of the important tasks in requirement engineering. In this paper, we proposed a systematic approach to analyze and reason the positive/negative impacts of design <b>strategies</b> <b>on</b> imprecise requirements. In our approach, we use fuzzy logic to capture the elasticity of requirements, to represent requirements, and to identify relationships between requirements. In order to analyze {{the impacts of}} design <b>strategies</b> <b>on</b> requirements, we explicitly represent design strategies in terms of requirements. We also developed a systematic reasoning scheme for reasoning the impacts of design <b>strategies</b> <b>on</b> requirements using the identified requirement-requirement and requirement-design relationships. The goal of identifying the impacts of design <b>strategies</b> <b>on</b> requirements is to reduce the conflicts between requirements and design strategies, to guide design engineers in evaluating design alterna [...] ...|$|R

Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using flyboats so that a good communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, Samson, and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive <b>strategy</b> <b>on</b> the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{had almost}} opted {{out of the}} tour, citing {{business}} commitments in Australia; at the time, {{it was not possible}} to make a living from cricket. Prior to the campaign in England, Australia hosted India for a five-Test series during the southern hemisphere summer of 194748. Australia easily defeated the tourists 40, and Bradman and his fellow selectors Chappie Dwyer and Jack Ryder thus began planning for the tour of England. Bradman made it publicly known that he wanted his team to become the first to play an English summer without defeat. England had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, instead of the previous rule of after 200 runs had been scored. As the run rate was generally much slower than 3.64, 55 overs would usually elapse long before 200 runs were scored. This meant that the ball was in a shiny state more often, and thereby more conducive to fast and swing bowling. Bradman and his colleagues thus chose the team with an emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling, basing his <b>strategy</b> <b>on</b> an intense speed attack against England's batsmen. His 17-man squad sailed for England and arrived in mid-April.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly the {{greatest}} achievement of Themistocles's career was {{his role in}} the defeat of Xerxes's invasion of Greece. Against overwhelming odds, Greece survived, and classical Greek culture, so influential in Western civilization, was able to develop unabated. Moreover, Themistocles's doctrine of Athenian naval power, and the establishment of Athens as a major power in the Greek world were of enormous consequence during the 5th century BC. In 478BC, the Hellenic alliance was reconstituted without the Peloponnesian states, into the Delian League, in which Athens was the dominant power. This was essentially a maritime alliance of Athens and her colonies, the Aegean islands, and the Ionian cities. The Delian league took the war to Persia, eventually invading Persian territory and dominating the Aegean. Under the guidance of Pericles, the Delian league gradually evolved into the Athenian Empire, the zenith of Athenian power and influence. Themistocles seems to have deliberately set Athens up as a rival to Sparta in the aftermath of Xerxes's invasion, basing this <b>strategy</b> <b>on</b> Athenian naval power (contrasted with the power of the Spartan army). Tension grew throughout the century between Athens and Sparta, as they competed to be the leading state in Greece. Finally, in 431BC, this tension erupted into the Peloponnesian War, {{the first of a series}} of conflicts that tore Greece apart for the next century; an unforeseen, if indirect, legacy of Themistocles's.|$|E
