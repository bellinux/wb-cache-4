About a wooden spring capture and wooden (so-called Teuchel) fresh water pipes were conducted in different houses. Elaborately constructed and parcarefully covered wooden channels were used for sanitation. Comparable with the southwesternly area, two rows of houses stretched towards the north-east. North of the church hill (Kastellweg) there were on 2000 m2 more residential and farm buildings made of wood, but also one of stone, fresh water pipes and sewers and latrines, established in the 1st to the 3rd century AD. Fire hazard exposed buildings and imissionary trades were situated at the edges of settlement in the west and east: in the 1st and 2nd centuries at least 14 kilns and tanneries in the southwest and northeast.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{deal with the}} problem of {{chromium}} present in various products and materials, and the health and environmental risks that this chromium can represent if uncontrolled. Special emphasis is given to various chrome tanned wastes generated by the leather industry. The agent that makes this waste potentially hazardous is hexavalent chromium. Its compounds can have negative effects on human health and some chromium VI salts are considered carcinogens. The authors present the risks of spontaneous oxidation of trivalent chromium to its hexavalent form in various conditions, as well as an analytical method for detection of small concentrations of both forms of chromium using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of hexavalent chromium and simultaneous detection of the two valences of chromium obtained from leather samples are presented. Another important issue addressed in this paper are technologies processing various kinds of chrome-tanned waste. From the technological point of view, there are several ways of handling primary leather waste, but no satisfactory technology has been developed so far for the secondary waste (manipulation waste, e. g. <b>leather</b> <b>scraps,</b> and used <b>leather</b> products). An innovative hybrid technology of processing the secondary waste is presented and tested in industrial conditions and its application on used leather goods is discussed, as well as possibilities of commercial utilization of the products generated by the technology...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the waste from the processes in which raw hide is transformed into leather, {{as well as with}} the waste generated during further leather processing and the final waste of leather industry, the worn-out shoes. All this waste, if deposited in the open-air dumps, represents a potential threat to human health, because it contains trivalent chromium (Cr III), which can oxidise to its hexavalent form (Cr VI) under various conditions. The authors discuss the possibilities of spontaneous transformation of Cr III into Cr VI and propose several technologies of the waste treatment to eliminate the health and environmental risks. Chrome-tanned waste, especially the chrome shavings, is processed with the use of modified enzymatic hydrolysis. The chromium cake obtained after filtration has proved to serve as a suitable precipitator of chromium ions from chromium containing spent liquor. Simultaneously, the chromium cake is enriched by those chromium ions and can be re-used in the tanning process. The method has been successfully tested in pilot and industrial scale. It enables us to possess the total control of solid and liquid chrome-tanned waste, which has shown a new approach towards the issue of chromium recycling in the tanning industry. A two-step technology has been proposed for processing <b>leather</b> <b>scraps,</b> for which it is not possible to apply the same method as in the case of chrome shavings. One of the products of this technology is a protein hydrolysate containing a high portion of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. This hydrolysate has been already successfully used as a good-quality NPK fertilizer in agriculture. The authors also warn against the classic ways of worn-out shoes treatment, i. e. disposal in the open-air dumps or combustion, which leads to potentially dangerous products. The separate collection of worn-out shoes is recommended and it is assumed that the hybrid hydrolysis technology used for <b>leather</b> <b>scraps</b> could be also successful at solving the problem of old shoes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Laboratory {{experimentation}} {{was carried}} out to analyze the performance of M 25 concrete made by partially replacing aggregates with waste materials like construction debris, PVC <b>scrap</b> and <b>leather</b> waste. The resultant concrete was tested for parameters like weight, compressive strength, slump and workability and compared with conventional plain cement concrete. It has been observed {{that the use of}} waste materials results in the formation of light weight concrete. There is a considerable increase in the compressive strength of concrete when the coarse aggregates are fully or partially replaced with construction debris. However a minor reduction in workability of the concrete mix was observed. When the coarse aggregates were replaced with PVC scrap in small percentage by weight, the resultant concrete shows fair value of compressive strength and the workability. But with the partial introduction of leather waste in place of sand in concrete, the concrete passed workability test but it failed completely in compressive strength test and gave almost zero strength. Hence, except leather waste other materials like construction debris and PVC scrap performed well as full or partial replacement for concrete aggregates and can find suitable application in construction industry as alternative to conventional materials. Uses of such waste materials will not only cut down the cost of construction, but will also contribute in safe disposal of waste materials. Apart from the environmental benefits, the addition of such wastes, also improves certain properties of resultant concrete...|$|R

60|$|Case-hardening is {{the name}} given to a simple process, by which the outside of iron may be turned into steel. Small tools, fish-hooks, and keys, etc., are usually made of iron; they are {{fashioned}} first, and case-hardened afterwards. There are good reasons for this: first, {{because it is the}} cheapest way of making them; and secondly, because while steel is hard, iron is tough; and anything made of iron and coated with steel, combines some of the advantages of both metals. The civilised method of case-hardening, is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate of potash, either powdered or made into a paste. The iron is then heated, until the prussiate of potash has burned away: this operation is repeated three or four times. Finally, the iron, now covered with a thin layer of steel, is hardened by quenching it in water. In default of prussiate of potash, animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used, but the latter is a very imperfect substitute. To make animal charcoal, take a <b>scrap</b> of <b>leather,</b> hide, hoof, horn, flesh, blood--anything, in fact, that has animal matter in it; dry it into hard chips like charcoal, before a fire, and powder it. Put the iron that is to be case-hardened, with some of this charcoal round it, into the midst of a lump of loam. This is first placed near the fire to harden, and then quite into it, where it should be allowed to slowly attain a blood-red heat, but no higher. Then, break open the lump, take out the iron, and drop it into water to harden.|$|R
