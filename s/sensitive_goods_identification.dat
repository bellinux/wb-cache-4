From stopping such a threat to preventing the illicit counterfeiting and smuggling of <b>sensitive</b> and proprietary <b>goods,</b> <b>identification</b> taggant technology can be applied to identify and interdict materials of a dubious nature. This cost effective approach to tag and track materials will find application in both the government and private sectors, particularly in the prevention of corporate espionage. A taggant system was created based on the modification of the natural isotopic vector of cadmium and tellurium to create artificial, unique, and robust identification capabilities. A proof of concept trial was undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness, reliability, and integrity of a system. Stable isotopes were mixed in various combinations to alter the isotopic vector and then neutron activation analysis techniques were used to evaluate the quality of the taggants. Two different neutron activation analysis facilities of differing capabilities were employed to test the limitations of the method in detection of trace amounts of taggant material. Testing of the taggant system found that solid phase taggants were capable of producing around 14, 000 unique taggants for under $ 250 each while liquid phase taggants were capable of producing around 2, 000 unique taggants for under $ 50 each. Common research reactors were also shown to be effective for use in a taggant system for certain isotopic vectors...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a world in}} which individuals have private endowments and trade in markets, while their utility is sensitive to the consumption of their neighbors. Our interest is in understanding how social structure of comparisons, taken together with the familiar fundamentals of the economy � endowments, technology and preferences � shapes equilibrium prices, allocations and welfare. We find that equilibrium prices and allocations depend on average individual centrality in the social network. As we add links to a social network, the centralities rise and this pushes up prices of the socially <b>sensitive</b> <b>good.</b> Newly linked agents demand more of the socially <b>sensitive</b> <b>good,</b> while the reverse happens with regard to the standard good. We derive a formula to compute the critical link, i. e., the new link which maximizes price increase. We then turn to a model with heterogenous endowments, and find that inequality in network centrality and in wealth inequality reinforce each other. Thus a transfer of resources from less to more central agents raises prices of the socially <b>sensitive</b> <b>good</b> and alters allocations and utilities of all agents. We show by example that poor individuals lose utility while rich individuals gain utility as society moves from segregation to integration. ...|$|R
