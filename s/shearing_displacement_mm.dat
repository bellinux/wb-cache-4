Experimental tests include shear stress-flow coupling process and shear displacement-flow coupling process. The shear stress-flow coupling test results, revealed that mechanical aperture keeps constant during shear, and that hydraulic aperture and conductivity decrease almost linearly with increasing shear stress. The shear displacement-flow coupling test results showed that hydraulic behavior under <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> includes two phases. During the first about 0. 05 <b>mm</b> <b>shear</b> <b>displacement,</b> hydraulic aperture and conductivity decrease with increasing <b>shear</b> <b>displacement,</b> and mechanical aperture remains constant or increases only by several microns of magnitude. After <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> is up to about 0. 05 mm, the fracture dilates remarkably, and hydraulic aperture and conductivity increase with <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> increasing...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{large-scale}} direct shear strength {{tests were conducted}} to evaluate the effect of <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> rate on the internal shear strength of reinforced GCLs. Specifically, the tests were conducted using <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> rates ranging from 0. 0015 to 1. 0 mm/min and using normal stresses ranging from 50 to 520 kPa.

Interpretation of these results, involving indirect evaluation of shear-induced pore water pressures, is proposed to explain this apparently counterintuitive trend.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} laboratory results {{regarding the}} shear behaviour of an artificial tensile fracture generated in granite. We used a direct shear rig to test fractures {{of different sizes}} (from 100 mm to 200 <b>mm)</b> under various <b>shear</b> <b>displacements</b> {{up to 20 mm}} and cyclic shear stresses with constant normal stress of 10 MPa. To determine the evolution of surface damage and aperture during shear, cyclic loading was performed at designated <b>shear</b> <b>displacements.</b> These changes in the surfaces topography were measured with a laser profilometer 2 ̆ 7 non-contact surface profile measurement system 2 ̆ 7. In addition, changes were also measured directly by using pressure-sensitive film. The results showed that the standard deviation (SD) of the initial aperture of the sheared fracture significantly increases with both <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> and size, which result in an increase in the non-linearity of the closure curve (since the matedness of the fracture surfaces decreases with <b>shear</b> <b>displacement).</b> Therefore, we concluded that shear dilation is not only governed by the surfaces sliding over each other, but is also strongly influenced by the non-linearity of closure with <b>shear</b> <b>displacement.</b> Furthermore, while the shear stiffness of the fracture during the initial stage decreases with fracture size, it increases with fracture size in the residual stage. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that only small asperities with short wavelengths were mainly damaged by shearing. Moreover the result showed that the damaged zones enlarge and localise with <b>shear</b> <b>displacement,</b> and eventually tend to form perpendicular to the <b>shear</b> <b>displacement...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Torsional ring shear {{tests were}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> rate on the internal shear strength of a needle-punched geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) under different normal stresses. The test {{results suggest that the}} internal shear strength of the needle-punched GCL depends on the following three factors: (i) resistance against reinforcement fibers pulling out and/or tearing; (ii) amount of posi-tive pore-water pressure induced during shear; and (iii) bentonite water content at the time of shearing. The laboratory tests indicate that the net effect of these three factors result in the peak internal shear strength being less sensitive to <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> rate at normal stresses between 200 and 400 kPa than at normal stresses less than 200 kPa. <b>Shear</b> <b>displacement</b> rate appears to have little influence on the residual internal shear strength regardless of normal stress.

40|$|Constitutive {{equations}} {{of direct}} shear testing {{based on the}} rheological investigation in conjunction with Coulomb's failure criterion are presented for compacted soil. The purpose in establishing such a constitutive equation is to introduce the displacement factor into the slope stability analysis of dams. In the stress-strain relationships, soil (here qualified as compacted soil) is divided broadly into two categories. The first {{is the case for}} no peak strength such as cohesive soil, the second is the case for peak strength such as sandy soil. The former is governed by a well-known Voigt model, and the latter consists of two Voigt models connected in series. There is no strain measure in the direct shear testing used in this study, alternatively a ratio of <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> to <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> at failure is defined as the <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> ratio. Also, it is assumed that the <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> is linearly related to time. Fitting such derived constitutive relations of compacted soil to data from laboratory experiments, for the case of no peak strength the calculated values from proposed equation are a little less than the experimental data {{at the point where the}} curves are rising. In the case for peak strength, there is little difference between the values from the constitutive equation and the experimental data. It is concluded that the constitutive equations proposed here generally are able to approximate well the relationship between the shear stress and the <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> ratio...|$|R

40|$|Four {{analytical}} models, namely, elastic, elasto-plastic, viscoelastic, and viscoelastic-plastic, {{are developed}} for predicting the maximum <b>shearing</b> <b>displacement</b> in a bonded assembly (e. g., an electronic assembly with a component and a substrate connected by {{an array of}} solder joints) under global thermal mismatch loading. The thermal loads {{are assumed to be}} uniform within the component and the substrate, with both step-function and sinusoidal temperature-time histories being considered. These models are based on plane stress formulations for circular disks and the assumption that the array of discrete joints may be replaced by an equivalent continuous 2 ̆ 2 shear layer. 2 ̆ 2 The derived analytical results can be applied to square assemblies with excellent accuracy. All results have been derived as closed-form correction factors to be applied to the easily calculated unconstrained <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> to obtain the maximum <b>shear</b> <b>displacement.</b> All the correction factors depend on prescribed geometric and material parameters of the component, substrate, and joints, the characteristics of the array, and the material properties of the bonding material (solder). The motivation for determining the maximum <b>shearing</b> <b>displacement</b> is to compute the maximum shear strain, which is then used to estimate the cycles-to-failure by means of a fatigue law (e. g., Coffin-Manson). Although the results are applied to microelectronics systems, they are also relevant to many other applications in which bonded assemblies are used. The solder material in the array of the elastic model is assumed to be a linear elastic material. For a small 2 ̆ 2 relative array stiffness 2 ̆ 2 (λ 3 ̆c 0. 46), the effect of array stiffness on the <b>shearing</b> <b>displacement</b> can be neglected in a homogeneous component assembly. In the elasto-plastic model, the effect of the plasticity of the bonding material is accounted for by modeling the solder or adhesive material as an elastic-perfectly plastic material. As expected, softening due to solder plasticity causes the magnitude of <b>shearing</b> <b>displacement</b> to increase. The creep effects in the <b>shear</b> <b>displacement</b> are introduced by modeling the solder material as a temperature-independent linear viscoelastic material in the viscoelastic model. The viscoelastic constitutive law used for the solder in this study is that of a three-parameter viscoelastic standard solid in distortion and an elastic solid in the hydrostatic mode. The viscoelastic model permits a sinusoidal thermal variation resulting in a frequency-dependent correction factor. A first attempt at a 2 ̆ 2 unified model 2 ̆ 2 {{in the form of a}} viscoelastic-plastic model is also developed to predict the displacement incorporating both the time-independent (elastic and plastic) and the time-dependent (creep) deformations. The analytical relations derived are simple, easy-to-use, and helpful for studying the interaction among the various design parameters. All the results have been presented in the form of dimensionless plots to aid in the analysis or design process and may provide convenient alternatives to performing time-consuming and expensive finite element analyses of entire assemblies.
