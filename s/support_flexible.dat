50|$|A {{special class}} of {{closed-cell}} foams, known as syntactic foam, contains hollow particles {{embedded in a}} matrix material. The spheres {{can be made from}} several materials, including glass, ceramic, and polymers. The advantage of syntactic foams is that they have a very high strength-to-weight ratio, making them ideal materials for many applications, including deep-sea and space applications. One particular syntactic foam employs shape memory polymer as its matrix, enabling the foam to take on the characteristics of shape memory resins and composite materials; i.e., it has the ability to be reshaped repeatedly when heated above a certain temperature and cooled. Shape memory foams have many possible applications, such as dynamic structural <b>support,</b> <b>flexible</b> foam core, and expandable foam fill.|$|E
