25|$|Gearshifting effort, long a {{complaint}} about the Testarossa, was eased {{with a new}} <b>single-plate</b> clutch, sliding ball bearings, and better angle for the shifter. The braking system included larger front rotors and cross-drilling all around. Quicker steering, lower-profile tires, and new shock settings improved handling. Most importantly, engine and gearbox position was rethought, which improved the centre of gravity, aiding the handling and making the car less fearsome on the limit.|$|E
25|$|Frictional {{machines}} were, in time, gradually {{superseded by}} the second class of instrument mentioned above, namely, influence machines. These operate by electrostatic induction and convert mechanical work into electrostatic energy by {{the aid of a}} small initial charge which is continually being replenished and reinforced. The first suggestion of an influence machine appears to have grown out of the invention of Volta's electrophorus. The electrophorus is a <b>single-plate</b> capacitor used to produce imbalances of electric charge via the process of electrostatic induction.|$|E
40|$|Earth is {{the only}} planet {{in the solar system}} on which plate {{tectonics}} occurs today. When did plate tectonics start on Earth and {{how long has it been}} in operation? Why do the the other terrestrial planets have <b>single-plates</b> and stagnant lids? Could they have had plate tectonics in the past? I present a literature review and overview of how Earth 2 ̆ 7 s plate tectonics operates and is measured today, how recent geodetic measurements (decade-scale) of plate motion compare to geologically determined (1 - 2 m. y.) ones, and how tectonics has likely evolved through Earth history. Complete melting and an early magma ocean (inferred; no record preserved), likely evolved into Archean vertical tectonics that produced sunken greenstone belts and diapiric TTG suites. The Meso-Proterozoic provides the first convincing record of rock products like passive margin sequences, blueschist, UHP rocks, and ophiolites that are easily related to modern plate tectonic processes. Thus, plate-like tectonics likely started in the Meso-Proterozoic, and Neo-Proterozoic and Phanerozoic Earth tectonics were probably much like modern plate tectonics...|$|R
25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer clutch pack drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the outer clutch pack has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry <b>single-plate</b> clutch, each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to upshift. In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|E
500|$|In April 1941, {{production}} of the Panzer IV Ausf.F started. It featured [...] <b>single-plate</b> armor on the turret and hull, {{as opposed to the}} appliqué armor added to the Ausf.E, and a further increase in side armor to [...] The main engine exhaust muffler was shortened and a compact auxiliary generator muffler was mounted to its left. The weight of the vehicle was now , which required a corresponding modification of track width from [...] to reduce ground pressure. The wider tracks also facilitated the fitting of track shoe [...] "ice sprags", and the rear idler wheel and front sprocket were modified. The designation Ausf.F was changed in the meantime to Ausf.F1, after the distinct new model, the Ausf.F2, appeared. A total of 471 Ausf.F (later temporarily called F1) tanks were produced from April 1941 to March 1942.|$|E
2500|$|LuK Clutch Systems, LLC. {{designed}} and manufacture the dual dry <b>single-plate</b> clutch {{system for the}} Volkswagen Group seven-speed DQ200 direct-shift gearbox (DSG) introduced in 2008. This DSG variant is used in smaller cars, with smaller-displacement engines with relatively low torque outputs. LuK are naming their technology [...] "XSG" [...] for their overview of automated shift gearbox systems, and [...] "Parallel Shift Gearbox" [...] for its own proprietary DCT.|$|E
2500|$|A {{choice of}} {{transmissions}} were offered. A ZF Friedrichshafen-sourced four-speed 4HP24A automatic transmission with a torque converter was available throughout the V8 production run. Automatic transmission has three modes: [...] "S" [...] – Sport; [...] "E" [...] – Economic and [...] "M" [...] – Manual operation. Sport mode is changing gears at higher rpm than Economic; Manual mode allows driver to choose gears using the lever. There were also two manual transmission offerings – for the 3.6: a five-speed manual gearbox, or later for the 4.2, a six-speed manual. Both manual transmission variants used a [...] <b>single-plate</b> clutch.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2008, another world-first [...] seven-speed DSG {{transaxle}} (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ200, parts code prefix: 0AM) became available. [...] It differs from the six-speed DSG, in that it uses two <b>single-plate</b> dry clutches (of similar diameter). This clutch pack was designed by LuK Clutch Systems, Gmbh. This seven-speed DSG is used in smaller front-wheel-drive cars with smaller-displacement engines with lower torque outputs, such as the latest Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Polo Mk5, and the new SEAT Ibiza. It has been paired to engines with up to [...] It has considerably less oil capacity than the six-speed DQ250; this new DQ200 uses just [...] of transmission fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Dual-clutch {{transmissions}} use two {{fundamentally different}} types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry <b>single-plate</b> clutches. The wet clutch design is generally used for higher torque engines that can generate [...] and more (the wet multiplate clutch DCT in the Bugatti Veyron is designed to cope with [...] ), whereas the dry-clutch design is generally suitable for smaller vehicles with lower torque outputs up to [...] However, while the dry-clutch variants may be limited in torque compared to their wet-clutch counterparts, the dry-clutch versions offer an increase in fuel efficiency, {{due to the lack}} of pumping losses of the transmission fluid in the clutch housing.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{variant of}} the DSG went into series {{production}} in 2008—the DQ200. [...] This unit has seven forward ratios, but the notable difference over the original DQ250 is the change from wet to dry clutches. This variant uses two <b>single-plate</b> dry clutches, arranged in a tandem design (instead of concentrically) and therefore similar in size. The DQ200 is again for use in transverse applications, but is intended for use in smaller cars, with smaller-displacement engines that generate relatively low torque outputs. [...] When used in the latest Golf with the [...] engine, this new seven-speed DSG uses roughly 6% (5.9l/100km for the seven-speed DSG compared to 6.3l/100km with the six-speed manual gearbox) less fuel than the same engine with a manual transmission and up to 20% less than a conventional automatic transmission. [...] The original DQ250 also remains available.|$|E
6000|$|... 716. But it was {{observed}} in these experiments, that in <b>single-plate</b> tubes (707.) more hydrogen was evolved at the negative electrode than was proportionate to the oxygen at the positive electrode; and generally, also, more than was proportionate to the oxygen and hydrogen in a double-plate tube. Upon more minutely examining these effects, I was led to refer them, and also the differences between wires and plates (714.), to the solubility of the gases evolved, especially at the positive electrode.|$|E
60|$|At {{the foot}} of each sofa was a side-door, for {{entrance}} and exit. Along the whole length of the sofa {{on each side of}} the car ran a row of large <b>single-plate</b> windows, of a blue tint--blue to soften the bitter glare of the sun and protect one's eyes from torture. These could be let down out of the way when one wanted the breeze. In the roof were two oil lamps which gave a light strong enough to read by; each had a green-cloth attachment by which it could be covered when the light should be no longer needed.|$|E
6000|$|... 715. Experiments of {{a similar}} kind were made with the <b>single-plate,</b> {{straight}} tubes (707.), and also with the curved tubes (708.), with similar consequences; and when these, with the former tubes, were arranged together in various ways, the result, as to the equality of action of large and small metallic surfaces when delivering and receiving the same current of electricity, was constantly the same. As an illustration, the following numbers are given. An instrument with two wires evolved 74.3 volumes of mixed gases; another with plates 73.25 volumes; whilst {{the sum of the}} oxygen and hydrogen in two separate tubes amounted to 73.65 volumes. In another experiment the volumes were 55.3, 55.3, and 54.4.|$|E
