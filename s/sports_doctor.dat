25|$|One {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} 2–2 equaliser. Hungarian goalie Gyula Grosics jumped to catch Fritz Walter's corner shot, but {{in plain sight}} of the camera, Hans Schäfer obstructed him, and so the ball reached Rahn unhindered. The second controversy concerns allegations of doping to explain the better condition of the West German team in the second half. Though teammates steadfastly denied this rumour, German historian Guido Knopp claimed in a 2004 documentary for German public channel ZDF that the players were injected with shots of vitamin C at half-time, using a needle earlier taken from a Soviet <b>sports</b> <b>doctor,</b> which would also explain the wave of jaundice among team members following the tournament. A Leipzig University study in 2010 posited that the West German players had been injected with the banned substance methamphetamine.|$|E

2500|$|Apatow's fifth directorial feature was the 2015 {{romantic comedy}} {{entitled}} Trainwreck.

The Atlantics Christopher Orr said [...] "this is a film that belongs not to its director but to its star, who, {{if there is any}} justice in the world, is about to ascend from cult icon to mass phenomenon." [...] Despite a positive reception from critics, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Time was less positive–saying [...] "In the way of most Apatow films, Trainwreck is a little too long, a little too shaggy and a little too conservative in insisting that all's square in love and war." [...] Produced on a budget of $35 million, Trainwreck grossed $140.8 million worldwide.|$|E
