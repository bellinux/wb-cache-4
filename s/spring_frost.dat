25|$|Florianópolis {{experiences}} a warm humid subtropical climate, falling {{just short of}} a true tropical climate. The seasons of the year are distinct, with a well-defined summer and winter, and characteristic weather for autumn and <b>spring.</b> <b>Frost</b> is infrequent, but occurs occasionally in the winter. Due to {{the proximity of the}} sea, the relative humidity of the atmosphere is 80% on average.|$|E
25|$|Beyond <b>spring</b> <b>frost,</b> {{the other}} {{viticulture}} hazard that growers {{have to worry}} about is court-noué (also known as roncet) which is a virus transmitted from vine to vine by nematodes that causes the vine to develop small leaves with short internode segments. This can impact a vine's ability to receive adequate foliage coverage to capture the sunlight needed to complete photosynthesis. Another hazard that Chardonnay is particularly susceptible to is oidium/powdery mildew.|$|E

25|$|It {{was under}} these auspices that the grapevine {{followed}} land prospector John Howe as he cut {{a path through}} the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the (Lower) Hunter Valley proper in 1820. Today, the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and Singleton follows Howe's exact path and is a major thoroughfare for wine tourists coming into the Hunter Valley from Sydney. As previous plantings in the coastal areas around Sydney succumbed to the humidity and wetness, and plantings to the west were limited by <b>spring</b> <b>frost</b> damage, northern reaches leading to the Hunter became, almost by default, the wine region of the new colony.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, as Pomerol's {{transition}} to a red wine producing district was completed, Cabernet Franc was the dominant grape variety. However, an early <b>spring</b> <b>frost</b> in 1956 killed {{a large portion of}} the Cabernet Franc plantings and many estates took this event as an opportunity to replant with the higher yielding and earlier ripening Merlot. Despite Merlot's tendency to suffer from coulure if the weather is cold and rainy during flowering, the grape quickly rose to prominence in Pomerol and has become the grape most closely associated with the region. Nevertheless, very few Pomerols are pure Merlot and Cabernet Franc is still valued for the tannic structure and acidity it gives, which can add longevity and aging potential to the wines. In fact, as the trend of the late 20th and early 21st century towards harvesting Merlot later and at increasingly higher sugar levels has continued, the role of Cabernet Franc in balancing the opulent but potentially flabby nature of over ripe Merlot has become even more appreciated by Pomerol winemakers.|$|E
25|$|Mount Barker {{is one of}} the 5 {{nominated}} subregions of the Great Southern wine {{region in}} Western Australia, which is Australia's largest wine region with a rectangle 200 kilometres from east to west and over 100 kilometers from north to south. The area has been described as 'the birthplace of the Great Southern wine region' and has won numerous awards for a variety of wines. Situated {{as it is in the}} middle of the Great Southern, the continental aspects of the climate make this quintessential country for Riesling and Shiraz. While, as with the rest of the region, rainfall is winter-spring dominant, late vintage rains can create problems. Mount Barker's continentality also means greater diurnal temperature fluctuations and the occasional <b>spring</b> <b>frost.</b> The Plantagenet Plateau, with Mount Barker its centre point, is marked by its marri soils, lateritic gravelly/sandy loams coming directly from granite rock protusions. Lat: 34 36’S; Alt: 180–250 m; Hdd: 1488; Gsr: 287mm; Mjt: 19C; Harvest: Early March to mid-April; Chief Viticultural Hazard: Spring frosts; late vintage rain. Plantagenet Wines established in 1968 was one of the first wineries in the region and is located within the town boundary.|$|E

40|$|Data {{concerning}} {{the effect of}} <b>spring</b> <b>frosts</b> on the survival of flower buds of several apple and pear cultivars, {{as well as on}} the damage caused by <b>spring</b> <b>frosts</b> to apple fruit are presented in the present paper. Observations were conducted in experimental and commercial orchards in the Lublin area in the years 2000, 2005 and 2007. The lowest temperature in spring in the consecutive years occurred on the following dates: 2000 - 3 rd and 4 th May, 2005 - 1 st April and 22 nd May, and 2007 - 2 nd and 4 th May. The most serious damages of buds were found in apple trees of Red Boskoop, Rubin and Jonagold cvs. grown in the experimental orchard in Felin (Lublin) (this was an average value for the years 2000 and 2007), whereas the buds of the late flowering cultivars of Golden Delicious Smoothee, Royal Gala and Ligol survived with significantly lesser damages. These observations generally confirmed those made in commercial orchards in 2005 and 2007, in which buds of cv. Elise also showed high resistance to <b>spring</b> <b>frosts.</b> Pear trees of cv. Concorde showed low damage to flower buds in 2007 and produced a reasonably good crop. Fruits of cv. Jonagold and its mutations Wilmuta, Jonica, Decosta and Rubinstar proved to be very sensitive to <b>spring</b> <b>frosts,</b> as well as fruits of cv. Lired. The positive influence of the Polish rootstock P 60 on flower bud survival was observed in the year 2000. However, this was not confirmed in 2007, thus further observations are necessary to check these effects...|$|R

2500|$|According to ampelographer Pierre Galet Mourvèdre {{thrives in}} warm climates as the variety has a {{tendency}} to both bud and ripen very late. While the variety can recover well from late <b>spring</b> <b>frost</b> due to the late budding, it can be very temperature sensitive throughout its growing season with even low winter temperatures affecting its dormancy. Though the grape can adapt to a variety of vineyard soil types, the most ideal sites are very warm, south facing (Northern hemisphere) slopes with shallow, clay soils that can retain the necessary moisture to keep the vines [...] "feet" [...] wet without letting it grow its foliage too vigorously. In addition to a warm climate, Mourvèdre also does best in a dry climate with sufficient wind to protect it from the viticultural hazards of powdery mildew and downy mildew.|$|E

40|$|As late <b>spring</b> <b>frosts</b> are a {{limiting}} factor to successful growth of walnuts attention {{was focused on}} walnut selection in years when late <b>spring</b> <b>frosts</b> occur after bud swelling. This particularly referred to the years of 1998 and 2002, and, partly 2001. In those years, 32 walnut trees were found to produce satisfactory yield in regions severely affected by string <b>spring</b> <b>frosts</b> and were subjected to careful observation in the following years. Of that number, 11 trees were found exceptional. They were characterized by luxuriance, vigour, satisfactory resistance to walnut antracnose, and yielding capacity. Fruits had good quality and favorable characteristics of the shell (smooth, thin, light-colored, easily separable) and kernel (relatively smooth, light-colored, tasty).

40|$|A field {{experiment}} with Actinidia arguta and A. kolomikta cultivars purchased from a commercial nursery {{was conducted in}} Skierniewice, central Poland. Both Actinidia arguta and A. kolomikta cultivars were planted in June 2005 at a spacing of 3 × 2. 2 m. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the influence of climate conditions on the growth of eight cultivars of small kiwi fruit and to evaluate their usefulness for orchard culture in central Poland. After three years of growth in different climate conditions, including one of the coldest winters (2005 / 06) during the last years, and also severe late <b>spring</b> <b>frosts</b> (2007), some conclusion can be drawn. Two cultivars of Actinidia kolomikta have shown quite good resistance to winter and <b>spring</b> <b>frosts,</b> but the growth rate of these plants was rather slow. All the cultivars of Actinidia arguta were damaged by frost during the 2005 / 06 winter due to the snow-cover level, which was rather thick (24 cm). One year later all new shoots and leaves of Actinidia arguta cultivars were damaged completely by late <b>spring</b> <b>frosts,</b> which deleted flowering and fruit setting for at least one year. After three years of growth observations, the growth rate of small kiwi cultivars can be divided into three groups: fast growing with 'Jumbo' and 'Genewa'; moderate growing with 'Issai', 'Ken's Red' and 'Weiki' - male and female, and slow growing with A. kolomikta cultivars Dr Szymanowski and Sientiabrskaja...|$|R
