5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a <b>signifier</b> of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E
5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a <b>signifier</b> of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E
5|$|The {{gender roles}} {{of men and}} women, as well as societies' conceptions of the {{associated}} concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a <b>signifier</b> of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control ‘his’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is “an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably {{from the work of}} African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe’s women some agency and prominence.|$|E

The analysis of paradigmatic relations helps to define the ‘value’ of specific items in a system.|$|R

40|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of Apocalypse Now, three <b>signifiers</b> (i. e., jungle, fire, and propeller) are repeatedly presented. The oneiric {{nature of this}} sequence suggests that such <b>signifiers</b> are just symbols, though this film, being placed withinthe postclassicism, on the essentials drifts away from the symbolic dimension that characterises the classical story. Herein, we emphasize that these <b>signifiers</b> constitute the key core of the aforementioned film. To assess the implicationsof these significant elements within the film, we shall perform an analysis, in which several significant chains are derivedfrom the three <b>signifiers.</b> This series of spontaneous associations of ideas leads {{to a set of}} dialectical pairs turning out toprovide the film with the essential tension supporting the development of the plot. Strikingly, such an analysis reveals thepresence of several links of Apocalypse Now to some traditional stories (e. g., fairy tales, biblical prophecies).

25|$|During the Middle Ages in Europe, castles, fortresses, and the basements {{of public}} {{buildings}} were {{often used as}} makeshift prisons. The possession of {{the right and the}} capability to imprison citizens, however, granted an air of legitimacy to officials at all levels of government, from kings to regional courts to city councils; and the ability to have someone imprisoned or killed served as a <b>signifier</b> of who in society possessed power or authority over others. Another common punishment was sentencing people to galley slavery, which involved chaining prisoners together in the bottoms of ships and forcing them to row on naval or merchant vessels.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{division}} and hatred was, therefore, never completely buried and {{a minority of}} the Defenders did not reject completely their previous anti-Protestant outlook. During the course of the 1798 rebellion, the Defenders who had risen with the United Irishmen perpetrated several sectarian massacres, most notoriously in County Wexford at Scullabogue and Wexford Bridge. While sectarianism undoubtedly played a part in many murders during the rising, religion was often taken as a <b>signifier</b> of loyalty or disloyalty by both sides and the fact that Protestants were often among the perpetrators and Catholics among the victims of rebel massacres indicates that victims lost their lives for being perceived as loyalists as opposed to purely religious reasons. Such subtleties were ignored in the aftermath, as the memory of such massacres was simplified and exploited in following years by politicians to cement the sectarian divide and to ensure the loyalty of Protestants to the British Crown.|$|E

25|$|The next {{victim of}} Telamon’s spear {{will be the}} Amazon BM 531:2, who helps up a wounded comrade. Although the other Amazon along {{this part of the}} frieze not already pitted against a foe is {{standing}} directly left of Telamon (BM 533:3), she cannot be his target, for she stands on a different ground line from Telamon and must be understood to be in a deeper spatial plane. As Telamon aims his spear at a distant enemy, so she aims her arrow past Telamon, probably at the Greek on the preceding slab, BM 536:3, who is about to drag off an Amazon. The Amazon Telamon is aiming at is dressed like Melanippe in an overgirt peplos, again probably a <b>signifier</b> of royalty. As Hippolyte will be seen later fighting Herakles, and Melanippe has already been slain, this Amazon may be identified as Antiope. The three slabs that comprise the south portion of the frieze, BM 542, BM 541, and BM 540, form a unit focusing on the figure of Herakles, BM 54l:3. The hero takes a prominent place, on the long axis of the temple and over the Corinthian capital, while {{at either end of the}} trio of slabs are balancing pairs of a Greek and an Amazon helping away wounded comrades, BM 542:1 and 2, and BM 540:5 and 4. Hippolyte, like the two other queens, is distinguished by dress. She wears a mantle wrapped about her waist, visually drawing attention to the disputed belt.|$|E

40|$|This article {{conducts a}} {{detailed}} analysis of multimodal <b>signifiers</b> in a popular Hindi film Dostana (meaning friendship) with particular focus on film’s (non) heteronormative and sexist system of signification. The <b>signifiers</b> that construct gender and sexual stereotypical worldview of the film are analyzed following Lazar’s (2007) conception of feminist critical discourse analysis and Wodak’s (2001) framework of Discourse Historical Approach which proposes three simultaneously functioning aspects of discourse, i. e. immanent, diagnostic and prognostic. The multimodal <b>signifiers</b> in the film are analyzed within Indo-Pakistani discursive context where patriarchal discourse does not seem to allow any cognitive pattern and mental model other than heteronormativity and heterosexual love and romance. In such discursive set-up, so-called deviant sexualities and gender roles struggle for voice, <b>signifiers</b> and representation. The prognostic critique of this article {{can be thought of as}} Positive Discourse Analysis (Martin, 2004), because eventually film’s text offers some examples of how certain multimodal signs can be used to resist hegemonic patriarchal and heteronormative discourses which are considered common sense and natural by mainstream Hindi film audience...|$|R
30|$|According to Sharifi [31], for instance, {{there are}} two basic pre-modern <b>signifiers</b> that {{constitute}} the official state discourse from the Shah Abbas Safavi era (1587 – 1629) until the 1906 Constitutional Revolution: Islam and security. Encountering Western modernity after 1870, new thoughts and opinions suggested some alternative <b>signifiers</b> in order to create several new imagined political discourses: law, development, people/democracy, and class/equality. After the mid- 1850 s, those who believed in Islamic politics were divaricated into two different groups: those traditionalists who rejected the West, due to its corruptive effects on Islam, and those modernists who advocated adopting the new Western values and concepts like constitution, citizenship, and civil law. Sharifi [31] concludes that we can trace all these contending <b>signifiers</b> in political texts after the 1900 s, albeit with different sets of meaning.|$|R

500|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events, notably the death of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in 1994 and Pearl Jam's lawsuit against concert venue promoter Ticketmaster, which in effect barred the group from playing many major venues around the United States. In addition to the decline of grunge bands, Britpop faded as Oasis's third album, Be Here Now (1997), received lackluster reviews and Blur began to incorporate influences from American alternative rock. A <b>signifier</b> of alternative rock's declining popularity was the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival after an unsuccessful attempt to find a headliner in 1998. In light of the festival's troubles that year, Spin said, [...] "Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now".|$|E

5000|$|This sort of {{interpretation}} keeps romance novel readers {{from having to}} guess the interpretation of a text.

Radway elaborates on this idea by stating “novel readers rely on standard cultural codes correlating <b>signifiers</b> and signifieds that they accept as definitive. It has simply never occurred to them that those codes might be historically or culturally relative.” This type of criticism, unlike the New Critics, is focused solely on readers’ interpretation {{and the ability of}} the author to write {{in such a way that}} their words will resonate with each one personally.

500|$|The entire {{score for}} La Strada {{was written by}} Nino Rota after {{principal}} photography was completed. The main theme is a wistful tune that appears first as a melody played by the Fool on a kit violin and later by Gelsomina on her trumpet.

This {{is one of three}} primary themes that are introduced during the titles at the beginning of La Strada and that recur regularly throughout the film. To these are added a fourth recurring theme that appears in the very first sequence, after Gelsomina meets Zampanò, and is often interrupted or silenced in his presence, occurring less and less frequently and at increasingly lower volumes as the film progresses. Claudia Gorbman has commented on the use of these themes, which she deems true leitmotifs, each of which is not simply an illustrative or redundant identifying tag, but [...] "a true <b>signifier</b> that accumulates and communicates meaning not explicit in the images or dialogue".|$|E
