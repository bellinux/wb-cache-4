The development of whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> permits the creation of virtual slides and to work on so-called virtual microscopes. In addition to interactive work on virtual slides approaches have been reported that introduce automated virtual microscopy, which is composed of several tools focusing on quite different tasks. These include evaluation of image quality and image standardization, analysis of potential useful thresholds for object detection and identification (segmentation), dynamic segmentation procedures, adjustable magnification to optimize feature extraction, and texture analysis including image transformation and evaluation of elementary primitives...|$|R
40|$|Whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> are novel {{devices that}} enable {{high-resolution}} imaging {{of an entire}} histological slide. Furthermore, the imaging is achieved {{in only a few}} minutes, which enables image rendering of large-scale studies involving multiple immunohistochemistry biomarkers. Although whole slide imaging has improved considerably, locally poor focusing causes blurred regions of the image. These artifacts may strongly affect the quality of subsequent analyses, making a slide review process mandatory. This tedious and time-consuming task requires the scanner operator to carefully assess the virtual slide and to manually select new focus points. We propose a statistical learning method that provides early image quality feedback and automatically identifies regions of the image that require additional focus points.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{microscopic}} imaging {{systems such}} as whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> provide very large (up to 18 GB) high resolution images. Such amounts of memory raise major issues that prevent usual image representation models from being used. Moreover, using such high resolution images, global image features, such as tissues, do not clearly appear at full resolution. Such images contain thus different hierarchical information at different resolutions. This paper presents the model of tiled top-down pyramids which provides a framework to handle such images. This model encodes a hierarchy of partitions of large images defined at different resolutions. We also propose a generic construction scheme of such pyramids whose validity is evaluated on an histological image application...|$|R

50|$|While {{real-time}} {{and virtual}} slide systems offer higher diagnostic accuracy {{when compared with}} static-image telepathology, there are drawbacks to each. Real-time systems perform best on local area networks (LANs), but performance may suffer if employed during periods of high network traffic or using the Internet proper as a backbone. Expense is an issue with real-time systems and virtual slide systems {{as they can be}} costly. Virtual slide telepathology is emerging as the technology of choice for telepathology services. However, high throughput virtual <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> (those producing one virtual slide or more per minute) are currently expensive. Also, virtual slide digital files are relatively large, often exceeding one gigabyte in size. Storing and simultaneously retrieving large numbers of telepathology whole-slide image files can be cumbersome, introducing their own workflow challenges in the clinical laboratory.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} availability of whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> facilitating digitization of histopathological tissue, {{there is a strong}} demand for the development of computer based image analysis systems. In this work, {{the focus is on the}} segmentation of the glomeruli constituting a highly relevant structure in renal histopathology, which has not been investigated before in combination with CNNs. We propose two different CNN cascades for segmentation applications with sparse objects. These approaches are applied to the problem of glomerulus segmentation and compared with conventional fully-convolutional networks. Overall, with the best performing cascade approach, single CNNs are outperformed and a pixel-level Dice similarity coefficient of 0. 90 is obtained. Combined with qualitative and further object-level analyses the obtained results are assessed as excellent also compared to recent approaches. In conclusion, we can state that especially one of the proposed cascade networks proved to be a highly powerful tool for segmenting the renal glomeruli providing best segmentation accuracies and also keeping the computing time at a low level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Colour {{consistency}} in light microscopy based histology is {{an increasingly important}} problem {{with the advent of}} Gigapixel digital <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> and automatic image analysis. This paper presents an evaluation of two novel colour normalisation approaches against the previously utilised method of linear normalisation in lαβ colourspace. These approaches map the colour distribution of an over/under stained image to that of a well stained target image. The first novel approach presented is a multi-modal extension to linear normalisation in lαβ colourspace using an automatic image segmentation method and defining separate transforms for each class. The second approach normalises in a representation space obtained using stain specific colour deconvolution. Additionally, we present a method for estimation of the required colour deconvolution vectors directly from the image data. Our evaluation demonstrates the inherent variability in the original data, the known theoretical problems with linear normalisation in lαβ colourspace, and that a multi-modal colour deconvolution based approach overcomes these problems. The segmentation based approach, while producing good results on the majority of images, is less successful than the colour deconvolution method for a significant minority of images as robust segmentation is required to avoid introducing artifacts. ...|$|R
