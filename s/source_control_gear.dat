40|$|Environmental {{impacts of}} light <b>sources</b> and <b>control</b> <b>gears</b> have been {{analysed}} in several life cycle assessments (LCAs). In contrast, this paper analyses {{the environmental impacts}} of an entire fluorescent lamp/luminaire combination. The environmental impacts of a fluorescent lamp luminaire with two T 5 lamps and an electronic ballast are analysed in a variety of potential environmental impacts. The results show that the energy consumption during use dominates the total environmental impacts by 93 % on the average, while manufacturing accounts for 7 % and end-of-life less than 1 %. The importance of energy consumption is dependent of the used energy source. Compared to a previous LCA of fluorescent lamp luminaire, the division of the results into life cycle stages is similar but there are differences in the numerical results. 1...|$|R

5000|$|... ==How It Works == The {{steering}} wheel {{is connected to}} the hydraulic control unit, which contains a slide valve, the <b>control</b> <b>gears</b> and linkage, and the centring piston and cam. The steering rack pinion {{is connected to the}} hydraulic control unit through an adjuster, to allow setting of the centre point of the steering. This then drives one of the <b>control</b> <b>gears,</b> the other being driven by the {{steering wheel}}. The control linkage consists of two gears coupled with rods through ball-joints. When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack. This moves the rack, which in turn moves its pinion, turning the <b>control</b> <b>gears</b> back to their centre position. Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve.|$|R
50|$|With such {{a number}} of trams in service, {{it should come as}} no {{surprise}} that {{a number of}} detail variations occurred in the fleet, only the main variations are listed here. In 1929, cars 274 and 275 were fitted with additional air brake pipes for use in hauling the horse transport cars between the City and Morphettville Racecourse on the Glenelg line. These airpipes were later removed, most possibly after the suspension of the horse transport service in 1936. As originally built, all the drop centre trams were built with General Electric PC5L2 and later PC5K2 control equipment (except for nos 251 - 261 which had English Electric control equipment). However, in 1952-1953, cars 259, 260 and 261 had their English Electric <b>control</b> <b>gear</b> replaced with General Electric <b>control</b> <b>gear.</b> At the same time, 251 - 258 and 264 had English Electric controllers of a different type fitted. The original <b>control</b> <b>gear</b> from 264 ended up in the solitary H1 car, 381.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When {{designing}} a landing gear damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control Langing gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active landing gear damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the passive <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> model and semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of passive <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds. Using linear quadratic optimal control effect is good. Intorductio...|$|R
