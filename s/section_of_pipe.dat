500|$|The first <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> {{was laid}} in 1975 {{after more than}} five years of legal and {{political}} arguments. Allegations of faulty welds drew intense scrutiny from local and national observers. A culture grew around the unique working conditions involved in constructing the pipeline, and each union that worked on the project had a different function and stereotype. Thirty-two Alyeska Pipeline Service Company employees and contract workers were killed during the project. The main construction effort lasted until 1977; the first barrel of oil was delivered on July 28 of that year. Several more pump stations, added as oil flow increased, were completed through 1980.|$|E
500|$|The International Union of Operating Engineers (called Operators for short) {{represented}} {{the men and}} women who sat at the controls of the heavy equipment used on the construction of the pipeline. This equipment included bulldozers, cranes, drilling rigs, and sidebooms—a cross between a bulldozer and a crane that could lay a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> in a trench parallel to its tracks. Because most of the heavy equipment was unheated, six operators were typically assigned to each piece of equipment, allowing for frequent breaks. A popular joke on the pipeline was that the sole qualification to be an Operator was, [...] "Must be able to sit on a sideboom at 40 below and not freeze up." [...] More seriously, one laborer wrote, was that there was nothing more terrifying than to be in a trench and have a drunken or unskilled Operator handling the pipe that was being laid in the trench.|$|E

50|$|In modern plumbing, a drain-waste-vent (or DWV) {{is part of}} {{a system}} that removes sewage and {{greywater}} from a building, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes to aid free flow.

50|$|Weld {{integrity}} {{is a crucial}} component of pipeline safety, especially girth welds (or the circumferential welds that join each <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> together). However, unlike the consistent molecular structure of milled steel, welds and their heat-affected zones (HAZs) have an anisotropic grain structure that attenuates ultrasonic signals and creates wave velocity variances that are difficult for ILI tools to analyze.|$|E
5000|$|The {{friction}} loss In a uniform, straight <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe,</b> known as [...] "major loss", {{is caused by}} the effects of viscosity, the movement of fluid molecules against each other or against the (possibly rough) wall <b>of</b> the <b>pipe.</b> Here, it is greatly affected by whether the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 3000): ...|$|R
50|$|This {{equation}} describes flow that chokes at M* = 0.87 {{for natural}} gas γ = 1.32; however choking requires an infinite heat flux.

This in-line <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> calculates % dry solids, wet density and wet or dry mass flow units. When coupled with compatible volumetric flow meters and processing units, this system gives a true value for density and mass flow. [...] The DM3 is a bi-directional unit which allows media to flow continuously through either ends. [...] "C" [...] Clamps {{located within the}} DM3 allows the flow tube to withhold high levels of pressure encountered. The flow tube was designed {{to focus on the}} highest amount of accuracy, resolution, and least amount of weight without compromising mechanical stability and reliability. Because of the sensitivity of measurement provided by DM3, each unit must be programmed and calibrated to accommodate the variation in Earth’s gravitational force.|$|E
