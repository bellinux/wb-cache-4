5000|$|A {{fracture}} is {{the separation}} of an object or material into two or more pieces under the action of stress. The fracture of a solid usually occurs due {{to the development of}} certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within the solid. If a displacement develops perpendicular to the surface of displacement, it is called a normal tensile crack or simply a crack; if a displacement develops tangentially to the surface of displacement, it is called a shear crack, <b>slip</b> <b>band,</b> or dislocation. [...] Fracture strength or breaking strength is the stress when a specimen fails or fractures.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between slip bands and grain boundaries in commercial-purity titanium was examined using cross-correlation-based electron backscatter diffraction. At a low strain level, {{three types of}} interactions were observed: blocked <b>slip</b> <b>band</b> with stress concentration; slip transfer; and blocked <b>slip</b> <b>band</b> with no stress concentration. The stress concentration induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> <b>band</b> was fitted with Eshelby's theoretical model, from which a Hall-Petch coefficient was deduced. It {{was found that the}} Hall-Petch coefficient varies with the individual grain boundary. We investigated the geometric alignment between the <b>slip</b> <b>band</b> and various slip systems to the neighbouring grain. Stress concentration can be induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> <b>band</b> if the slip system is poorly aligned with prismatic, pyramidal or basal slip systems in the neighbouring grain. Transfer of slip across the boundary occurs when there is good alignment on prismatic or pyramidal slip systems. Other stress-relieving mechanisms are possible when the best alignment is not with the slip system that has the lower critical resolved shear stress. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Pre-strains of 6. 5 and 20 % are imposed using [1 0 0] tensile testing. During tensile pre-deformation, several slip systems are activated and irregularly spaced <b>slip</b> <b>bands</b> form. A trace analysis revealed the presence of several <b>slip</b> <b>bands</b> on the tensile specimen near the grips while one family of <b>slip</b> <b>bands</b> parallel to the (1 1 1) crystallographic plane were detected {{in the middle of}} the tensile specimen. From the middle of the pre-deformed tensile specimens double microshear samples were prepared using focused ion beam (FIB) machining such that the [0 - 1 - 1] (1 - 1 1) slip system could be directly activated. The results show how microshear behavior reacts to different levels of tensile pre-deformation. Sudden deformation events (SDEs) are observed during microshear testing. The critical stress associated with the first SDE is shown to increase with increasing pre-deformation as a result of an increasing number of <b>slip</b> <b>bands</b> introduced during pre-deformation per shear zone. The results allow also to obtain information on the interaction between dislocations activated during microshearing ([0 - 1 - 1] (1 - 1 1)) and those which were introduced during tensile pre-deformation ([1 0 - 1] (1 1 1) and [1 - 1 0] (1 1 1)).
