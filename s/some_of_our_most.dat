In 2016 the political focus of J Street was to unseat Republican senators who led U.S. Congressional {{opposition to the}} Iran deal. When The Forward solicited opinions of the completed Iran deal from American Jewish organizations, some were critical, but J Street stated: [...] "For {{the first time in}} nearly a decade, Iran does not have the nuclear material needed to build even a single bomb. That makes Americans, Israelis and the Iranian people themselves immeasurably safer.... That Iran has completed these steps—and granted international inspectors the unprecedented access necessary to verify and continuously monitor compliance on an ongoing basis—in an unexpectedly short period of time is further proof of the power of tough, effective diplomacy in addressing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>most</b> serious security concerns." ...|$|E

60|$|Whilst {{all things}} were managed {{at home with}} such a spirit of disorderly despotism, abroad there was a proportionable {{abatement}} of all spirit. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>most</b> just and valuable claims were in a manner abandoned. This indeed seemed not very inconsistent conduct in the ministers {{who had made the}} treaty of Paris. With regard to our domestic affairs, there was no want of industry; but there was a great deficiency of temper and judgment, and manly comprehension of the public interest. The nation certainly wanted relief, and government attempted to administer it. Two ways were principally chosen for this great purpose. The first by regulations; the second by new funds of revenue. Agreeably to this plan, a new naval establishment was formed at a good deal of expense, and to little effect, to aid {{in the collection of the}} customs. Regulation was added to regulation; and the strictest and most unreserved orders were given, for a prevention of all contraband trade here, and in every part of America. A teasing custom-house, and a multiplicity of perplexing regulations, ever have, and ever will appear, the masterpiece of finance to people of narrow views; as a paper against smuggling, and the importation of French finery, never fails of furnishing a very popular column in a newspaper.|$|E
60|$|A hundred {{questions}} of fitness, of seasonableness, of conflicting expediencies, present themselves in this connection, and nothing gives more anxiety to a sensible man who holds notions {{opposed to the}} current prejudices, than to hit the right mark where intellectual integrity and prudence, firmness and wise reserve, are in exact accord. When we come to declaring opinions that are, however foolishly and unreasonably, associated with pain and even a kind of turpitude {{in the minds of}} those who strongly object to them, then <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>most</b> powerful sympathies are naturally engaged. We wonder whether duty to truth can possibly require us to inflict keen distress on those to whom we are bound by the tenderest and most consecrated ties. This is so wholly honourable a sentiment, that no one who has not made himself drunk with the thin sour wine of a crude and absolute logic will refuse to consider it. Before, however, attempting to illustrate cases of conscience in this order, we venture to make a short digression into the region of the matter, as distinct from the manner of free speech. One or two changes of great importance {{in the way in which}} men think about religion, bear directly upon the conditions on which they may permit themselves and others to speak about it.|$|E
60|$|In {{sporting}} literature--a tenth muse, exclusively {{indigenous to}} England--the same observation holds good tenfold. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>most</b> perfect topographical sketches {{have been the}} work of sportsmen. Old Izaak Walton, and his friend Cotton, of Dovedale, whose names will {{last as long as}} their rivers, have been followed by a long train of worthy pupils. White's 'History of Selborne;' Sir Humphry Davy's 'Salmonia;' 'The Wild Sports of the West;' Mr. St. John's charming little works on Highland Shooting; and, above all, Christopher North's 'Recreations'--delightful book! to be read and re-read, the tenth time even as the first--an inexhaustible fairy well, springing out of the granite rock of the sturdy Scotch heart, through the tender green turf of a genial boyish old age. Sporting books, when they are not filled--as they need never be--with low slang, and ugly sketches of ugly characters--who hang on to the skirts of the sporting world, as they would to the skirts of any other world, in default of the sporting one--form an integral and significant, and, it may be, an honourable and useful part, of the English literature of this day; and, therefore, all shallowness, vulgarity, stupidity, or bookmaking in that class, must be as severely attacked as in novels and poems. We English owe too much to our field sports to allow people to talk nonsense about them.|$|E
