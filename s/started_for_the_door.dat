60|$|Justice-of-the-peace Benaja Widdup {{interposed}} as they <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> forgetting his presence.|$|E
60|$|Hal <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Hardwick {{caught him}} by the arm, and shoved him back.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> but the Professor's calm {{voice called}} them back.|$|E
60|$|Barry was <b>starting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{to carry}} out these {{excellent}} instructions, when it flew open.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DAVIDSON--Good-by, Curtis! [Without {{looking at}} <b>the</b> others, he <b>starts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> rear. They all break out into conscience-stricken protestations.] ...|$|R
6000|$|CHARTERIS. I'll {{explain it}} all to-morrow. Just at present we'd really better follow Julia's example and bolt. (He <b>starts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Behind {{his chair}} Linda wrung her hands, crying without noise. Suddenly she <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He heard her move.|$|E
60|$|Roxy made no answer. She {{took the}} lantern and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Tom {{was in a}} cold panic in a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "How utterly horrible!" [...] exclaimed Elizabeth. [...] "Come, David! Come, Harriet!" [...] David {{making a}} way for her, she <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parr {{pushed back}} {{his chair and}} rose abruptly, <b>starting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> rector {{followed}} him, forcibly struck by the unusual bitterness in his tone.|$|R
60|$|He {{watched her}} morosely and without {{intention}} of speaking, till {{he saw her}} take a rifle from the stand, examine <b>the</b> magazine, and <b>start</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's dropped ten," [...] {{was all he}} said, yet every {{face went}} anxious, {{and there was a}} look as if every man desired {{immediately}} to <b>start</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|Madeline calmly {{rose from}} the table, eluding Florence's entreating hand, and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The cowboys jumped up. Alfred barred her progress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nellie <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and Tom did the same; {{but before}} the youth could leave, Miss Harrow {{clutched}} him by the arm.|$|E
6000|$|Heckewelder {{had taken}} Jim's arm and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{when he caught}} sight of Young, sitting bowed and motionless. Turning to Jim he whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|Legget arose, shook himself like a shaggy dog, and was <b>starting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{when one}} of the {{sentinels}} stopped him. Brandt, who was now awake, saw the action, and smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Step out, sir," [...] said Mr. Jackson, <b>starting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> before I could reply. I {{followed}} perforce, {{not without}} misgivings, the crowd pushing eagerly after. Before {{we reached the}} dusty street Jackson began pulling off his coat. In a trice the shouting onlookers had made a ring, and we stood facing each other, he in his shirt-sleeves.|$|R
60|$|She <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bedroom <b>door,</b> Lindy making way for her. I {{scarcely}} {{knew what}} I did as I sprang forward {{and took the}} Vicomtesse by the arm.|$|R
60|$|Owen {{never said}} a word. He went as white as death, and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> But again Mark Foster put himself in the way.|$|E
60|$|They {{were quite}} {{alone in the}} room. As Betty {{finished}} speaking and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> Miller intercepted her. She recoiled in alarm from his white face.|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, {{you let me}} out of this!" [...] {{stormed the}} man named Haywood. [...] "I haven't done {{anything}} wrong. You let me go!" [...] And he <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|She <b>started</b> quickly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bedroom <b>door,</b> but {{something}} troubled me still.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll git my lantern, an' then we kin {{go after}} them tramps," [...] {{announced}} Elias Lacy; {{and in a moment}} more he reappeared with a smoky lantern and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door.</b> [...] "Come on, an' show me where them tramps are," [...] he said, determinedly.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he caught}} her hand and made as if to <b>start</b> with her <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> When she resisted, he bent and kissed her again and again.|$|R
60|$|He <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to {{terminate}} a conversation {{which had already}} begun to irritate him. For his anger, in these days, was very near the surface. She made one more desperate appeal.|$|E
60|$|He did not answer, but {{stared at}} her with horror. Slowly his eyes wandered over the room, {{for the first time}} taking in its details. Then he put on his cap and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|In answer, another {{rumbling}} crash {{shook the}} atoll and the house. Almost {{in a panic}} the company <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In the dim light their sweaty faces appeared ghastly. Isaacs panted asthmatically in the suffocating heat.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>the</b> two <b>started</b> forward <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{which opened}} {{from the office}} upon the porch, and as they did so Barbara turned again toward Billy to caution him to silence for his spurs had tinkled as he moved. For a moment their eyes were not upon Eddie Shorter and Fate had it that {{at that very moment}} Eddie awoke and opened his own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just came}} from the library. I left a pair of skates in the gym., and I {{was going to get}} them. I've been in <b>the</b> library <b>for</b> half an hour," [...] went on the dude of the school. [...] "It's an outrage the way you've treated me. I am going to report it to Doctor Clay." [...] And he <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> school.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the midst}} of this, with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, burst {{one of the most}} angry and {{crashing}} storms of rain and hail ever heard. It beat like a deluge on the heavy glass roof of the hall, and the wind literally howl'd and roar'd. For a moment, (and no wonder,) the nervous and sleeping Representatives were thrown into confusion. The slumberers awaked with fear, some <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> some look'd up with blanch'd cheeks and lips to the roof, and the little pages began to cry; it was a scene. But it was over almost as soon as the drowsied men were actually awake. They recover'd themselves; the storm raged on, beating, dashing, and with loud noises at times. But the House went ahead with its business then, I think, as calmly and with as much deliberation as at any time in its career. Perhaps the shock did it good. (One is not without impression, after all, amid these members of Congress, of both the Houses, that if the flat routine of their duties should ever be broken in upon by some great emergency involving real danger, and calling for first-class personal qualities, those qualities would be found generally forthcoming, and from men not now credited with them.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah! that's good news!" [...] cried Andy, leaping to {{his feet}} and {{stretching}} himself. [...] "I must have a look!" [...] and, jamming his cap on his head, he <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The other Rovers followed him.|$|E
60|$|Hamel, too, rose {{once more}} to his feet. The two {{exchanged}} swift glances. Moved by a common thought, they both <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> only to find it suddenly opened before them. Mr. Fentolin glided into the room.|$|E
60|$|He <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the dining-room, but she interposed, {{and a very}} {{beautiful}} obstacle she made of herself. His left hand went out as if to grip her, then hesitated. He was patently awed by her soft womanhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "You understand," [...] said Bijah, {{screwing}} up his face. [...] "Guess your watch is a-comin' out." [...] He tucked it back caressingly, and <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> door--the back <b>door.</b> Involuntarily Wetherell {{put his hand}} to his pocket, felt something crackle under it, and drew the something out. To his amazement it was a ten-dollar bill.|$|R
60|$|Duane saw the tawny Poggin {{speak to}} his companions. He {{dismounted}} quickly. They followed suit. They had {{the manner of}} ranchers about to conduct some business. No guns showed. Poggin <b>started</b> leisurely <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bank <b>door,</b> quickening step a little. The others, close together, came behind him. Blossom Kane had a bag in his left hand. Jim Fletcher was left at the curb, and he had already gathered up the bridles.|$|R
60|$|The horrid gibbering was drowned by {{the noise}} he made. Quickly, without pausing, {{he began to}} hack at <b>the</b> oak <b>door</b> with all his might. In rapid {{succession}} his heavy blows rained down, and the sound echoed through the empty house. There was a crash, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> swung back. They {{had been so long}} in almost total darkness that they were blinded for an instant by the dazzling light. And then instinctively they <b>started</b> back, <b>for,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opened, a wave of heat came out upon them so that they could hardly breathe. The place was like an oven.|$|R
