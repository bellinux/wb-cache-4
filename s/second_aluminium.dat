40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} {{has been used}} to fabricate an aluminium alloy powder preform which is subsequently debound and infiltrated with a <b>second</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloy. This represents a new rapid manufacturing system for aluminium {{that can be used to}} fabricate large, intricate parts. The base powder is an alloy such as AA 6061. The infiltrant is a binary or higher-order eutectic based on either Al-Cu or At-Si. To ensure that infiltration occurs without loss of dimensional precision, it is important that a rigid skeleton forms prior to infiltration. This can be achieved by the partial transformation of the aluminium to aluminium nitride. In order for this to occur throughout the component, magnesium powder must be added to the alumina support powder which surrounds the part in the furnace. The magnesium scavenges the oxygen and thereby creates a microclimate in which aluminium nitride can form. The replacement of the ionocovalent Al 2 O 3 with the covalent AlN on the surface of the aluminium powders also facilitates wetting and thus spontaneous and complete infiltration.

The infiltration process was conducted under nitrogen, argon or a vacuum. The infiltration distance and infiltration pathway was determined by density measurements which were confirmed by metallographic examination and quantitative image analysis.

Comparing the microstructures of the surface and the centre of the as-infiltrated samples indicates that the pathway into the porous perform is dependent on the infiltration atmosphere. Under vacuum, the infiltrant firstly fills the interior of the sample and then propagates to the surface. In contrast, under nitrogen or argon, the infiltrant firstly penetrates along the surface before filling the inside. In all cases, the infiltrant preferentially fills the pore regions with the highest curvature. This causes the highly convoluted initial pore structure to decompose into a large number of smaller, rounder pores, which eventually fill and disappear. Copyright © 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some of {{the principles}} underpinning chemical microanalysis of bulk specimens in the scanning electron microscope using low beam voltages ([*]≤ 5 [*]kV) and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry. The advantages of this relatively new method lie primarily in the strong dependence of the sample penetration range on the electron beam energy (∼ 10 x from 5 [*]kV to 20 [*]kV). This directly yields superior spatial resolution and sensitivity {{for the analysis of}} sub-micron particles, surface films and at interfaces. The correspondingly shorter x-ray escape range reduces the importance of the complex matrix absorption and fluorescence terms; the parameters for which may not always be known accurately. A useful x-ray signal can only be generated with a beam energy which is at least 1. 3 x the excitation energy for the relevant characteristic x-rays. Low voltage fluorescent yields are relatively low and depend strongly on overvoltage (U[*]<[*] 3) and low voltage x-ray signals are relatively weak.

Cotton fiber is Tajikistan's leading agricultural export commodity, contributing 16% of total exports (it is <b>second</b> only to <b>aluminium,</b> which accounts for a staggering 60% of the country's exports). Cotton requires high temperatures and intensive irrigation, and it is primarily grown in hot river valleys: the Ferghana Valley on the Syr Darya in Northern Tajikistan (Sughd Province), the Lower Kofarnihon and Vakhsh valleys in south-western Khatlon, Kyzylsu and Panj valleys in south-eastern Khatlon, and Gissar Valley stretching west of Dushanbe to the border with Uzbekistan around the middle course of Kofarnihon River. Khatlon Province is the main cotton growing area in Tajikistan, contributing 60% of the cotton harvest; Ferghana Valley {{in the north of}} Sughd Province contributes 30% and Gissar Valley (in the Region of Republican Subordination) another 10%. The Tajik part of Zeravshan Valley in the south of Sughd Province is too cold for cotton, which grows only further west in the Uzbek part of the valley near Bukhara.

Further characterizations of particles were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. It was found that much finer particle size of α-Al 2 O 3 could be achieved when Al(NO 3) 3 was used as a precursor. The decrease in size accompanied by an increase in aspect ratio makes it an ideal reinforcing agent for high strength composites and results in its highly superior properties. The present study also involved the development of Zn-Al 2 O 3 composites by reinforcing the Zn-matrix with α-Al 2 O 3 as reinforcement. α-Al 2 O 3 is very attractive due to their unique combination of excellent mechanical properties and high thermal stability which makes them an ideal reinforcing agent for high strength composites.

40|$|The {{service life}} of {{industrial}} components is limited predominantly by chemical corrosion, mechanical failure or mechanical wear. In the aluminium high {{pressure die casting}} industry, liquid aluminium is extremely reactive with the constituents of H 13 die steel and {{has a tendency to}} form intermetallic layers. This chemical interaction results in sticking of molten metal to the die surface which produces defective castings and also damages the die surface. The use of thermal spray coatings provides protection to the surfaces operating in severe environments. An HVOF thermally sprayed coating has the advantage of having excellent bond strength and very low porosity levels (< 1 %). This research work is concerned with producing and evaluating the performance of titanium/alumina based composite coatings to improve the service life of tool steel (H 13) used for dies in aluminium high pressure die casting and dummy blocks used in Al extrusion. In this research work, the powder feedstocks for making the composite coatings were produced by high energy mechanical milling of a mixture of Al and TiO₂ powders in two different molar ratios followed by a thermal reaction process. The feedstock powder was then thermally sprayed using a high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) technique on H 13 steel substrates to produce Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ and TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coatings. The performance of the coatings was assessed in terms of Al soldering, liquid metal corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance and wear resistance. In an immersion test, the coated specimens were dipped into molten Al at a temperature of 700 ± 10 °C for different intervals of time. The performance of the coatings was tested in terms of liquid metal corrosion resistance and propensity to Al soldering. The dissolution behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by measuring weight loss after dipping the samples in to molten aluminium. The immersion test results showed that the coated samples have relatively few locations where aluminium soldering (reactive/chemical) occurred, however, an H 13 steel surface showed more tendency for aluminium soldering. It was found that composite coatings changed the molten Al attack on H 13 tool steel from a generalized to a localized one. No reaction between molten aluminium and a Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating was identified. The TiAl/Al 2 O₃ composite coating was found to be attacked by molten aluminium {{as a result of a}} reaction between the coating and molten aluminium. The metallic phase TiAl in the composite coating is believed to be attacked by the molten Al. A Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating was found to be a better protective coating than the TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coating due its stability against molten aluminium attack. The thermal shock behaviour of the composite coatings was investigated by subjecting the coated coupons to a number of cycles, each cycle consisting of a holding time of 30 <b>seconds</b> in molten <b>aluminium</b> at 700 ± 10 °C followed by quenching into water. The surfaces of the coupons were examined for Al soldering and an evaluation of surface spallation. Any cracks found in the coatings were studied to explain their thermal shock behaviour. A Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating on H 13 tool steel produced from a fine feedstock has better thermal shock resistance than the Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coatings produced from the agglomerated feedstocks. The study also describes and compares the tribological properties such as friction and sliding wear rate of the composite coatings both at room and high temperature (700. °C) under dry and lubricating conditions. The wear resistance of the coatings was investigated by a tribometer using a spherical ended alumina, flat ended high speed steel and spherical ended hardened steel pins as counter bodies. The experimental results show that the composite coatings look promising for high temperature applications due to their low wear rate at high temperature. However room temperature applications of the composite coatings can be improved under lubricated conditions.
