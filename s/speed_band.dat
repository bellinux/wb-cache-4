2500|$|Porsche {{developed}} an existing engine instead {{of creating a}} new one from scratch. The powerplant, a twin-turbocharged six-cylinder boxer engine with air-cooled cylinders and water-cooled heads, displaced 2.85litres, about half a litre less than a contemporary 911 engine. It was coupled to a unique manual gearbox offering five forward speeds plus a [...] "G" [...] off-road gear, as well as reverse. The engine had originally been developed for the [...] "Moby Dick" [...] race car and then been redeveloped slightly for the short-lived Porsche Indy Car and several other projects before being tuned a last time {{for use in the}} 961, the 959's racing counterpart. The water-cooled four-valve cylinder heads combined with the air-cooled cylinders and sequential turbochargers allowed Porsche to extract [...] from the compact, efficient and rugged power unit. The use of sequential twin turbochargers rather than the more usual identical turbochargers for each of the two cylinder banks allowed for smooth delivery of power across the engine <b>speed</b> <b>band,</b> in contrast to the abrupt on-off power characteristic that distinguished Porsche's other turbocharged engines of the period. The engine was used, virtually unchanged, in the 959 road car as well.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2001, Kloeden CN, Ponte G and McLean AJ of the Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University {{quantified}} the relationship, [...] "... between free {{travelling speed}} {{and the risk}} of involvement in a casualty crash in 80 km/h or greater speed limit zones in rural South Australia" [...] using a case control study design. They found, [...] "..the risk of involvement in a casualty crash increased more than exponentially with increasing free travelling speed above the mean traffic speed and that travelling speeds below the mean traffic speed were associated with a lower risk of being involved in a casualty crash." [...] Outlining past research in this area, they suggest that, in the Solomon research, [...] "Both the numerator (number of crashes in a particular <b>speed</b> <b>band)</b> and the denominator (number of vehicle-miles travelled in that same <b>speed</b> <b>band)</b> may have been quite inaccurate for relatively low speeds." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pressurisation: A tuned intake path {{can have}} a light pressurising effect similar to a {{low-pressure}} supercharger - due to Helmholtz resonance. However, this effect occurs only over a narrow engine <b>speed</b> <b>band.</b> A variable intake can create two or more pressurized [...] "hot spots", increasing engine output. When the intake air speed is higher, the dynamic pressure pushing the air (and/or mixture) inside the engine is increased. The dynamic pressure {{is proportional to the}} square of the inlet air speed, so by making the passage narrower or longer the speed/dynamic pressure is increased.|$|E
50|$|A constant-speed unit (CSU) or {{propeller}} governor is the device fitted {{to one of}} these propellers to automatically change its pitch so as to attempt to keep engine speed constant. Most engines produce their maximum power in a narrow <b>speed</b> <b>band.</b> The CSU can be said to be to an aircraft what the CVT is to the motorcar: the engine can be kept running at its optimum speed, no matter at what speed the aircraft is flying through the air. The advent of the CSU had another benefit: it allowed the designers of aircraft engines to keep ignition systems simple; the automatic spark advance seen in motor vehicle engines is simplified in aircraft engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) allows vacuum into the {{actuator}} by powering a solenoid valve when the engine rotation speed is low. At higher engine speeds (e.g. 4,200 rpm), vacuum is cut off and a spring inside the actuator causes the butterfly valve to fully open. The idea behind the system {{is that in the}} lower engine <b>speed</b> <b>band,</b> the speed of the intake air will be increased because the intake runner cross section per cylinder is smaller. However, when engine speed increases, the second runner is opened, decreasing airflow speed, but increasing the airflow volume, better matching the engine's airflow needs at higher revolutions. With modified engines it may be desirable to have the T-VIS open earlier than stock, because modifications that improve an engine's power output may do so by increasing airflow per engine revolution, resulting in a high airflow at a lower rpm.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century there were several hundred European {{manufacturers}} of hot bulb engines for marine use. In Sweden alone there were over 70 manufacturers, of which Bolinder is the best known; in the 1920s they had about 80% of the world market. The Norwegian Sabb was a very popular hot bulb engine for small fishing boats, {{and many of them are}} still in working order. In America, Standard, Weber, Reid, Stickney, Oil City, and Fairbanks Morse built hot bulb engines.A limitation of the design of the engine was that it could only run over quite a narrow (and slow) <b>speed</b> <b>band,</b> typically 50 to 300 rpm. This made the hot bulb engine difficult to adapt to automotive uses, other than vehicles such as tractors, where speed was not a major requirement. This limitation was of little consequence for stationary applications, where the hot bulb engine was very popular.|$|E
5000|$|Toyota {{designed}} the engine for performance; the valve angle {{was a relatively}} wide 50 degrees, {{which at the time}} was believed to be ideal for high power production. Today, more modern high-revving engines have decreased the valve angle to 20 to 25 degrees, which is now believed to be ideal for high-revving engines with high specific power outputs. The first generation 4A-GE is nicknamed the [...] "bigport" [...] engine because it had intake ports of a very large cross-sectional area. While the port cross-section was suitable for a very highly modified engine at very high engine speeds, it caused a considerable drop in low-end torque due to the decreased air speeds at those rpms. To compensate for the reduced air speed, the first-generation engines included the T-VIS feature, in which dual intake runners are fitted with butterfly valves that opened at approximately 4,200 rpm. The effect is that at lower rpm (when the airspeed would normally be slow) four of the eight runners are closed, which forces the engine to draw in all its air through half the runners in the manifold. This not only raises the airspeed which causes better cylinder filling, but due to the asymmetrical airflow a swirl is created in the combustion chamber, meaning better fuel atomization. This enabled the torque curve to still be intact at lower engine speeds, allowing for better performance across the entire <b>speed</b> <b>band</b> and a broad, flat torque curve around the crossover point. During rising engine speed, a slight lurch can occur at the crossover point and an experienced driver will be able to detect the shift in performance. Production of the first-generation engine model lasted through 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Development of the 959 (originally {{called the}} Gruppe B) started in 1981, {{shortly after the}} company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's head {{engineer}} at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on {{for years to come}} and that could be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rally racing as the perfect arena to test the new mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the go ahead to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.Porsche developed an existing engine instead of creating a new one from scratch. The powerplant, a twin-turbocharged six-cylinder boxer engine with air-cooled cylinders and water-cooled heads, displaced 2.85 litres, about half a litre less than a contemporary 911 engine.

40|$|Lifting body {{technology}} has been demonstrated—via computational fluid dynamics (CFD), scale-model tests, and full-scale at-sea trials—to provide reduced motions at zero and loiter speeds while providing dynamic lift at high speeds to reduce hull drag and to provide active ride control. Hypothesizing that incorporating a lifting body with the bow of a monohull may capture {{the positive effects of}} bulbous bows, preliminary CFD studies showed potentially significant benefits of such a configuration in reducing total hull resistance. This led to additional computational studies resulting in the design of a notional 91. 4 m, 50 -knot monohull with a patented bow lifting body. Scale-model tests, conducted with and without a lifting body, confirmed CFD predictions of improved resistance of the bow lifting body configuration over a wide <b>speed</b> <b>band.</b> Based on these results we developed a quarter-scale technology demonstration craft: a 21. 3 m stabilized monohull with bow lifting body. This paper describes the conceptual design, computational analysis, and scale-model testing of the notional 91. 4 m bow lifting body ship; the design, construction, and at-sea testing of the 21. 3 m bow lifting body technology demonstration craft, including implementation of an active ride control system; and future opportunities and direction for this technology...|$|E

40|$|A {{proof of}} concept of a {{continuously}} variable rotor speed control methodology for rotorcraft is described. Variable rotor speed is desirable for several reasons including improved maneuverability, agility, and noise reduction. However, it {{has been difficult to}} implement because turboshaft engines are designed to operate within a narrow <b>speed</b> <b>band,</b> and a reliable drive train that can provide continuous power over a wide speed range does not exist. The new methodology proposed here is a sequential shifting control for twin-engine rotorcraft that coordinates the disengagement and engagement of the two turboshaft engines {{in such a way that}} the rotor speed may vary over a wide range, but the engines remain within their prescribed speed bands and provide continuous torque to the rotor; two multi-speed gearboxes facilitate the wide rotor speed variation. The shifting process begins when one engine slows down and disengages from the transmission by way of a standard freewheeling clutch mechanism; the other engine continues to apply torque to the rotor. Once one engine disengages, its gear shifts, the multi-speed gearbox output shaft speed resynchronizes and it re-engages. This process is then repeated with the other engine. By tailoring the sequential shifting, the rotor may perform large, rapid speed changes smoothly, as demonstrated in several examples. The emphasis of this effort is on the coordination and control aspects for {{proof of concept}}. The engines, rotor, and transmission are all simplified linear models, integrated to capture the basic dynamics of the problem...|$|E
40|$|One way to {{increase}} the aircraft fuel efficiency is to reduce structural weight while maintaining adequate structural airworthiness, both statically and aeroelastically. A design process which incorporates the object-oriented multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization (MDAO) tool and the aeroelastic effects of high fidelity finite element models to characterize the design space was successfully developed and established. This paper presents two multidisciplinary design optimization studies using an object-oriented MDAO tool developed at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. The first study demonstrates the use of aeroelastic tailoring concepts to minimize the structural weight while meeting the design requirements including strength, buckling, and flutter. Such an approach exploits the anisotropic capabilities of the fiber composite materials chosen for this analytical exercise with ply stacking sequence. A hybrid and discretization optimization approach improves accuracy and computational efficiency of a global optimization algorithm. The second study presents a flutter mass balancing optimization study for the fabricated flexible wing of the X- 56 A model since a desired flutter <b>speed</b> <b>band</b> {{is required for the}} active flutter suppression demonstration during flight testing. The results of the second study provide guidance to modify the wing design and move the design flutter speeds back into the flight envelope so that the original objective of X- 56 A flight test can be accomplished successfully. The second case also demonstrates that the object-oriented MDAO tool can handle multiple analytical configurations in a single optimization run...|$|E
