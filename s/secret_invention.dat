40|$|It is an {{important}} concern that innovators by waiving their patent rights might obstruct the disclosure of knowledge and therefore retard progress. This paper explores this concern by using a simple model of two innovators who must decide sequentially whether to protect an innovation with limited patent rights. Two features are crucial to the disclosure decision. First: the second inventor may use his valid patent right to exclude the …rst inventor from using a <b>secret</b> <b>invention.</b> Second: when waiving her patent right, the …rst inventor may disclose her knowledge outside of a patent. Disclosure informs the Patent O ¢ ce and courts that related inventions from later inventors may lack novelty and hence should not be protected by valid patent rights. This paper shows that when the …rst inventor chooses not to patent the innovation, the amount of disclosure {{is related to the}} intellectual property choices in a paradoxical way: the amount of disclosure will be ‘large’ (‘small’) when the second inventor chooses secrecy (patenting) to protect the innovation too...|$|E

50|$|The <b>secret</b> of the <b>invention</b> {{is the use}} of {{a process}} called crosslinking. Cotton is {{composed}} of a material called cellulose. Like synthetic nylon and polyester fibers, cellulose is a polymer; that is, its molecules are shaped like long chains containing many thousands of atoms. The long, chainlike shape of the molecules is what makes cellulose, like nylon and polyester, a good fiber. She discovered a way to treat cotton fibers so that the chainlike cellulose molecules were joined together chemically. This procedure is known as crosslinking, and it makes cotton resistant to wrinkling.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there were}} various plans for submersibles or {{submarines}} during the Middle Ages, the Englishman William Bourne designed {{one of the}} first prototype submarines in 1578. This was to be a completely enclosed boat that could be submerged and rowed beneath the surface. Comprising a completely enclosed wooden vessel sheathed in waterproofed leather, it was to be submerged by using hand operated wooden screw thread adjustable plungers pressing against flexible leather bags located at the sides in order to increase or decrease the volume of water to adjust the buoyancy of the craft. The sketch (left) suggests that the depth adjustment was by means of a crankset projecting above the surface. There is no obvious accommodation for crew. The first submersible to be actually built in modern times was constructed in 1605 by Magnus Pegelius. Its fate was to become buried in mud. In 1596 the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his <b>Secret</b> <b>Inventions</b> the following: [...] "These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers, other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform."It's unclear whether or not Napier ever carried out his plans. Henry Briggs, who was professor of mathematics at Gresham College, London, and later at Oxford, was a friend of Napier, whom he visited in 1615 and 1616, and was also an acquaintance of Cornelius Jacobszoon Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England, who designed and built the first successful submarine in 1620. Hence, it is not impossible that {{it was because of the}} interest taken by Napier in the submarine that Briggs came in touch with Drebbel.Drebbel's submarine was propelled by oars and is thought to have incorporated floats with tubes to allow air down to the rowers. The precise nature of this submarine is unclear, it may be possible that it resembled a bell towed by a boat. Two improved types were tested in the River Thames between 1620 and 1624. Of one of these tests Constantijn Huygens reports in his autobiography of 1651 the following: ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with the original {{definition of the term}} [...] "patent", patents are intended to facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovations into the public domain for the common good.

Theoretical results on the relation between patenting and innovation size are then confronted with survey data for small European firms.
