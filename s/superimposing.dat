5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For the opening scene of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film strip of an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then <b>superimposing</b> a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, the Swedish concept {{designer}} Niklas Jansson {{created an}} adaptation of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, <b>superimposing</b> the Flying Spaghetti Monster over God. This became and remains the Flying Spaghetti Monster's de facto brand image. The Hunger Artists Theatre Company produced a comedy called The Flying Spaghetti Monster Holiday Pageant in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism. The production has spawned a sequel called Flying Spaghetti Monster Holy Mug of Grog, performed in December 2008. This communal activity {{attracted the attention of}} three University of Florida religious scholars, who assembled a panel at the 2007 American Academy of Religion meeting to discuss the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by <b>superimposing</b> shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E
40|$|<b>Superimposed</b> {{information}} {{is used to}} supplement existing sources of information, while maintaining connections {{back to the original}} data. It can be used for organizing, highlighting, annotating, connecting, and reusing selected elements within information sources. With the growing amount of digital information available today, especially on the web, more and more applications are being developed that use <b>superimposed</b> information. However, generic support to store, create, update, and transform <b>superimposed</b> information does not exist. <b>Superimposed</b> applications must implement their own representation and storage capabilities, which also makes <b>superimposed</b> information difficult to share across applications. We seek to represent <b>superimposed</b> information {{for a wide variety of}} model-based applications (e. g., XML and CASE tools, Topic Map navigators, SQL, and even spreadsheet editors) that use <b>superimposed</b> information. Our solution leverages a metamodel that is used to define multiple superimposed-information models. We employ a flat representation scheme, using the Resource Description Framework, to represent models (defined by our metamodel), schemas, and instances of <b>superimposed</b> information. As a result, we are able to provide model-based applications with a uniform, generic representation of <b>superimposed</b> information. While the generic representation is stored explicitly, it need not be visible to an application, which we support through a variety of application programming interfaces. The APIs provide ease of use and rapid superimposed-application development. The representation also enables mappings between <b>superimposed</b> layers, which allows applications to dynamically share <b>superimposed</b> information. 1...|$|R
40|$|A person {{working with}} diverse {{information}} sources—with possibly different formats and information models—may recognize and wish to express conceptual structures {{that are not}} explicitly present in those sources. Rather than replicate the portions of interest and recast them into a single, combined data source, we leave base information where it is and <b>superimpose</b> a conceptual model that is appropriate to the task at hand. This <b>superimposed</b> model can be distinct from the model(s) employed by the sources in the base layer. An application that <b>superimposes</b> a new conceptual model over diverse sources, with varying capabilities, needs to accommodate {{the various types of}} information and differing access protocols for the base information sources. The <b>Superimposed</b> Pluggable Architecture for Contexts and Excerpts (SPARCE) defines a collection of architectural abstractions, placed between <b>superimposed</b> and base applications, to demarcate and revisit information elements inside base sources and provide access to content and context for elements inside these sources. SPARCE accommodates new base information types without altering existing <b>superimposed</b> applications. In this paper, we briefly introduce several <b>superimposed</b> applications that we have built, and describe the conceptual model each <b>superimposes.</b> We then focus on the use of context in <b>superimposed</b> applications. We describe how SPARCE supports context and excerpts. We demonstrate how SPARCE facilitates building <b>superimposed</b> applications by describing its use in building our two, quite diverse applications...|$|R

5|$|During the Classic period (c. AD 250-900) {{the royal}} dynasty of Tikal {{developed}} the complex into a royal necropolis, with each successive ruler <b>superimposing</b> new temples over earlier structures. Around AD 250, the pre-existing architecture was demolished {{and a new}} basal platform was built, supporting four corbel-vaulted structures. Around AD 400 the complex was expanded southwards from its original basal platform {{with the addition of}} a row of tall pyramids that divided the original architecture from Tikal's main plaza. Towards the end of the 7th century, King Jasaw Chan K'awiil I ordered the construction of a new version Temple 33, possibly to house the remains of Nuun Ujol Chaak, his father. This new building completely blocked the entrance to the North Acropolis, formerly ending its role as the preferred burial ground of Tikal's kings. Around AD 734 king Jasaw Chan K'awiil was entombed in Temple I on the east side of the plaza, ending the tradition of interring rulers within the North Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered <b>superimposing</b> Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} of <b>superimposed</b> preeclampsia in women with essential chronic hypertension receiving antihypertensive therapy prior to conception. Methods: A retrospective study of 211 patients that analyzed {{risk factors of}} <b>superimposed</b> preeclampsia at first prenatal visit. Variables with a p,. 1 at univariate analysis were included in a logistic regression analysis. P,. 05 was considered as significant. Results: <b>Superimposed</b> preeclampsia occurred in 49 (23. 2 %) women. In logistic regression analysis, previous preeclampsia [OR: 4. 05 (1. 61 – 10. 16) ], and mean arterial blood pressure of 95 mmHg or higher [OR: 4. 60 (1. 94 – 10. 93) ] were associated with increased risk of <b>superimposed</b> preeclampsia. When both variables were present, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio for <b>superimposed</b> preeclampsia were 43 %, 94 %, 70 %, 85 %, and 7. 71 (95 % CI: 3. 20 – 18. 57), respectively.

40|$|Partially {{supported}} by the Technical University of Gabrovo under Grant C- 801 / 2008 One of the main problems {{in the theory of}} <b>superimposed</b> codes is to find the minimum length N for which an (N, T,w, r) <b>superimposed</b> code exists for given values of T, w and r. Let N(T,w, r) be the minimum length N for which an (N, T,w, r) <b>superimposed</b> code exists. The (N, T,w, r) <b>superimposed</b> code is called optimal when N = N(T,w, r).
