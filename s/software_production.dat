500|$|Iwata {{became the}} company's {{coordinator}} of <b>software</b> <b>production</b> in 1983, the {{time during which}} he helped HAL create a relationship with Nintendo so {{they would be able}} to produce games for its newly released Nintendo Entertainment System. He traveled to Kyoto himself to request permission to work on games for the NES, to which Nintendo obliged. His first commercially published game was Joust for the NES—a port of the 1982arcade game. Other video games he worked on were Balloon Fight, NES Open Tournament Golf, EarthBound, and the Kirby games. Nintendo initially contacted several other developers to produce Open Tournament Golf; however, all of them declined as they did not believe the large amount of data could be stored within an NES cartridge. Iwata seized this opportunity and [...] "recklessly" [...] stepped up to develop the game. It proved particularly taxing as Iwata had to create his own data compression method in order to fit all 18courses into the game. Similarly, HAL had to program parallax scrolling for F-1 Race as the NES hardware did not initially support it.|$|E
