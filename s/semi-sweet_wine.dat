50|$|A lot of Sylvaner {{was planted}} in Germany and Alsace after the Second World War, {{reaching}} 30% and 25% respectively of total vineyard {{area in the}} 1960s - 1970s. It was Germany's most grown variety until it was overtaken by Müller-Thurgau around 1970. Much of the German crop was blended into Liebfraumilch, but overproduction ruined its reputation, and changing tastes led to many vines being grubbed up. However, in Franconia, where Liebfraumilch may not be produced and which primarily stuck to dry white wines in the decades when most other German regions produced <b>semi-sweet</b> <b>wines,</b> Silvaner has kept its popularity. Single-variety semi-sweet Silvaner, {{which used to be}} common, has all but disappeared from the German wine production.|$|R

40|$|To {{explore the}} effects of harvest time on {{phenolic}} compounds during wine fermentation, grape berries (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Vidal) were harvested at 17. 5, 22. 8 and 37. 2 º Brix and were used to make dry wine, <b>semi-sweet</b> <b>wine</b> and icewine with low alcohol levels, respectively. Phenolic acids and flavan- 3 -ols were assayed during the fermentation of wines by means of reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that concentrations {{of most of the}} phenolic acids and flavan- 3 -ol in musts increased with harvest time delay and higher total levels of these species were detected in all wines, compared with those measured before fermentation (the total phenolic acid content in wines was 1. 5 - 2. 0 fold that of in musts). Except for p-coumaric acid and (-) -epicatechin, other phenolic acids and flavan- 3 -ols had similar variation patterns (wave-like rise) during fermentation in dry wine and <b>semi-sweet</b> <b>wine.</b> However, some detected compounds, including gentisic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and sinapic acid showed obviously different trends from the other two wines in the icewine making process. It is thus suggested that the harvest time has a decisive effect on phenols in final wines and influences the evolution of phenolic acids and flavan- 3 -ols during wine fermentation...|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates {{effects of}} pectolytic enzyme {{treatments}} of red grape mashes on the microbiological quality of wines and wine stability with counting {{of the presence}} yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), after incubation on Sabourald-maltose agar.

Pectinolytic enzyme preparation Trenolin Rot DF showed the best results. Pectolytic enzyme treatments of red grape mashes had a pronounced effect on the microbiological quality of wines and wine stability.
