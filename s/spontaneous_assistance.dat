40|$|International audienceMany medical {{students}} use exchange programmes to enrich their portfolio. However, such {{a confrontation with}} reality can be challenging because custom and practice sometimes differ radically between countries. Exchange students post specific peculiarities, as encountered by them abroad, onto the medical exchange website. They can ask for the community’s help {{and are expected to}} describe the (preliminary) solution that they have found. The ‘‘journal of astonishment’’ is structured by country and is designed not only to provide help for current exchange students but also to prepare future students for their stay abroad. Upon conclusion of the exchange, its satisfaction to both student and host institution is evaluated. Following the intervention, non-illness related drop out rates decreased by nearly 30 % and student satisfaction improved by 1. 7 points on a 10 -point satisfaction scale. Host academic institution satisfaction also increased. Postings from the community were considered helpful. Female students especially benefited from the exchange website when preparing for their exchange. The journal of astonishment thus helps students better to select and prepare for an exchange with a particular academic institution. Moreover, the interactive web-based platform can provide <b>spontaneous</b> <b>assistance</b> with problem handling. The journal of astonishment is a low-cost tool that enhances student and host academic institution satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the research work towards improving human computer interaction by providing intelligent assistance to users. This has {{been approached by}} incorporating principles of a cognitive theory in a Graphical User Interface (GUI), that deals with file manipulation and is called IFM. The cognitive theory is called Human Plausible Reasoning (HPR) and {{has been used to}} simulate users ’ reasoning in the user model of the system so that the GUI may provide <b>spontaneous</b> <b>assistance</b> to users ’ errors. Such a goal is difficult to achieve and depends heavily on the development process. However, {{there is a shortage of}} reports on the software engineering process of intelligent assistants. Moreover, in the literature of intelligent assistants there is evidence that some important phases of their development process may have been omitted and thus the understanding of delicate issues has not improved significantly. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on presenting and discussing the software engineering process of the intelligent assistant developed. Special emphasis has been put on the description of the experimental studies, which were conducted prior and after the development of the system. Theses studies were used for the specification and refinement of the overall design as well as the adaptation of HPR in it. The experimental results have shown that the intelligent assistant may follow the users ’ reasoning and provide helpful advice to a satisfactory extent as compared to human advisors...|$|E
30|$|According to Alavi and Leidner [45], {{knowledge}} is the information processing {{that takes place}} in human minds, as well as personalized information related to facts, procedures, concepts, interpretations, ideas, observations, and judgments. Davenport and Prusak [46] defined knowledge sharing as processes that involve exchanging knowledge between individuals and groups. An individual imparts his or her understanding, expertise, or insight to another individual so that the recipient may acquire and leverage the knowledge to create more values. Knowledge sharing lies at the core of continuous improvement processes and is quintessential in terms of transforming an individual’s process improvements into actual learning. Clearly, active knowledge sharing requires the willingness of individual member to provide <b>spontaneous</b> <b>assistance</b> without assurance of reciprocation, which relates greatly with customer citizenship behavior. In knowledge management context, sharing knowledge with others without expectation of return represents altruistic behavior. The contributors participate conscientiously and actively (courtesy) with civic virtue and tolerating the efforts of resources given (sportsmanship) when sharing knowledge. Thus, knowledge sharing behavior in VCEs is viewed as a typical customer citizenship behavior. Organ and Konovsky [47] identified five types of OCB: (1) Altruism, voluntary actions, helps another person with work-related problems; (2) conscientiousness goes well beyond the required levels of responsibility; (3) civic virtue has responsible and constructive involvements in the political process of an organization; (4) sportsmanship tolerates the inevitable inconvenience and impositions of work without complaining; and (5) courtesy provides advance notice to people who need such information. Furthermore, knowledge has been widely studied in various application fields, such as web [48, 49] and system [50 - 52].|$|E

A number of 59. 2 % of the users were very satisfied with the hospital and 68. 8 % considered the service better than expected. Less "clarity concerning health" was reported for shelter regarding hospital admittance and home care (p< 0. 05). Users under hospital admittance presented greater satisfaction and better expectation compared to acceptance and emergency medical assistance (p< 0. 05). User profile characteristics as "skin color" and "health plan" presented statistical differences regarding general satisfaction. The study showed that the adoption of a humanized model of assistance in healthcare as the proposal of this Hospital resulted in user satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{combination}} of propofol-remifentanil for procedural deep sedation in spontaneously breathing patients {{is characterized by}} the frequent incidence of side effects, especially respiratory depression. These side effects may be due to either the drug combination or the drug delivery technique. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) might optimize drug delivery. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy, we thus tried to answer two questions: first, if adding remifentanil to propofol surpasses the disadvantages of the {{combination of}} these two products, and second, if administration of remifentanil via TO decreases the incidence of side effects, compared to manually controlled administration. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective colonoscopy were randomly assigned to receive remifentanil via manually controlled continuous infusion (MCI) (0. 125 mu g. kg(- 1). min(- 1) for 2 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0. 05 mu g. kg(- 1). min(- 1)), TCI remifentanil (1 ng/mL), or placebo (normal saline either as TCI: or manual infusion of equivalent rate). All patients received TO propofol, adjusted to a target concentration level that provided deep sedation in which patients were not responsive to verbal commands, but maintained <b>spontaneous</b> ventilation without <b>assistance.</b> RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the placebo group showed movement, cough and hiccup, which transiently interfered with the examination. There were no clinically significant differences in hemodynamic or recovery variables among all groups. Remifentanil administered via TO resulted in a decrease in propofol requirements. The incidence of hypopnea and apnea was less frequent when remifentanil was administered via TCI compared to MCI (TCI n = 7, MCI n = 16, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The combination of remifentanil and propofol for deep sedation in spontaneously breathing patients, offered better conditions for colonoscopy than propofol used as a single drug. Remifentanil administered via TCI resulted in a decrease in propofol dosing and in a lower incidence in apnea and respiratory depression (TCI n = 7, MCI n = 16, P < 0. 05), compared to manually controlled administration of remifentanil...|$|R
