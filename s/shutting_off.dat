5|$|July 18–20, 2015: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Dolores brought scattered showers and thunderstorms throughout Southern California, breaking many rainfall records and causing flooding. One such flash flood caused {{a bridge to}} collapse which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe, effectively <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the primary Phoenix-to-Los-Angeles route. The good news was that the rain helped firefighters contain the North Fire within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|After the Camp Jackson Affair, {{there were}} no more {{military}} threats to Union control until 1864, although guerrilla activity continued in rural areas {{for the duration of the}} war. Union General John C. Frémont placed the city under martial law in August 1861 to suppress sedition; after Fremont's dismissal, Union army forces continued to suppress pro-Confederate demonstrations. The war significantly damaged St. Louis commerce, especially after the Confederacy blockaded the Mississippi <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> St. Louis's connection to eastern markets. War also slowed growth during the 1860s, with an increase of only 43,000 residents from 1860 to 1866.|$|E
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors {{twice as fast as}} the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies who are not in the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out to {{diagnose}} faults in an automotive engine using acoustic emission method. Proton Persona’s engine, which is a four cylinder engine, powered by 1. 6 liters double overhead camshaft (DOHC) with two different locations (Point A and Point B) marked {{was used as the}} main test-rig. There were three tests conducted for this project, the pencil-break test, engine under idle condition and engine under fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition. Pencil-break test is performed in order to check the most suitable material to be used as medium to transfer the signals. The source of the Acoustic Emission (AE) signals was from the condition where the fuel injector was <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> when the engine is running, and it was captured using AE sensor with the help from Physical Acoustic AE-win 3. 1 software. For engine under idle and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition, all the domain parameters (RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and energy) was processed using MATLAB software. The parameters were then compared between idle and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition for each fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off.</b> The results shows that the different of AE parameters between Point A and Point B, where Point B shows higher value than Point A in idle condition and also under fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition. During <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> condition, the RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and energy produced higher energy level compare to idle condition. This indicates defects or faults occurred. In addition, Pekan number, X was introduced as the indicator or ratio of value before fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> to value during fuel injector <b>shut</b> <b>off...</b>|$|R

5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} and months prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a lack of confidence in the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} infamous {{incidents}} in tournament history occurred in 1987 in Piestany, Czechoslovakia, where a massive brawl involving all players on both teams occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union. It began when Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Theoren Fleury and the Soviet Union's Evgeny Davydov came off the bench, eventually leading {{to most of the}} players from both teams joining the brawl. The officials, unable to break up the fight, walked off the ice and eventually tried <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the arena lights, but the brawl lasted for 20 minutes before the game was declared null and void. An emergency IIHF meeting resulted in the delegates voting 7–1 to disqualify both teams from the tournament. While the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4–2 {{at the time of the}} brawl. The gold medal ultimately went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had been eliminated from medal contention, was awarded the bronze. The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. Player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players such as Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament. The brawl helped raise the profile of the tournament in Canada, where the tournament now ranks as one {{of the most}} important hockey events.|$|E

25|$|The two first stages {{are mounted}} on {{independently}} closable valves, {{as a first}} stage freeze free-flow can only be stopped by <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the air supply from the cylinder until the valve has thawed out.

25|$|By the mid-1970s, forces {{opposing}} {{uncontrolled growth}} had become stronger than those favoring development. On April 8, 1975, the City Council {{passed a resolution}} to limit the city's population to 85,000 through zoning. In order to limit growth in adjacent areas, such as Goleta, it was standard to deny water meters to developments which had {{been approved by the}} County Board of Supervisors, effectively <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> growth.

25|$|The Type B2 cabinet (also {{known as}} a Total Exhaust BSC) is {{expensive}} to operate because no air is recirculated within. Therefore, this type is mainly found in such applications as toxicology laboratories, where the ability to safely use hazardous chemistry is important. Additionally, there is the risk that contaminated air would flow into the laboratory if the exhaust system for a Type B1 or B2 cabinet were to fail. To mitigate this risk, cabinets of these types generally monitor the exhaust flow, <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the supply blower and sounding an alarm if the exhaust flow is insufficient.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E
25|$|As long as {{this process}} is gradual, the tissue gas loading in the diver will reduce by {{diffusion}} and perfusion until it eventually re-stabilises at the current saturation pressure. The problem arises when the pressure is reduced more quickly than the gas can be removed by this mechanism, {{and the level of}} supersaturation rises sufficiently to become unstable. At this point, bubbles may form and grow in the tissues, and may cause damage either by distending the tissue locally, or blocking small blood vessels, <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> blood supply to the downstream side, and resulting in hypoxia of those tissues.|$|E

25|$|Earthquake warning {{systems could}} {{potentially}} give people {{time to take}} cover {{in the event of}} a quake, preventing injuries caused by falling debris, automatically stopping trains or <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> gas lines. The system being developed at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (called ShakeAlert) in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey, the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington, will eventually cover the entire West Coast. The system would cost $80 million in funding to run for five years in California, or $120 million for the whole West Coast. In December 2014, United States Congress approved a $5 million allocation as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 in order to expand funding for development of the system.|$|E

25|$|The García {{government}} tried {{a series}} of major and minor new policy packages from early 1988 into 1990 to no avail. The new policies never succeeded in <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the rapid infusion of Central Bank credit that was feeding inflation, even when they did succeed in driving production down significantly in 1989. Manufacturing production fell 18 percent in that year, agricultural output 3 percent, and total GDP 11 percent. Simultaneously, inflation increased from a record 666 percent in 1988 to a new record of 3,399 percent for 1989. The one positive change was the external current-account deficit: the fall in domestic production and income was so steep that the current account went from a deep deficit to a substantial surplus. The internal cost was perhaps clearest in terms of real wages: the minimum wage in real terms for urban labor fell 61 percent between 1987 and 1989, and average real wages in manufacturing fell 59 percent.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors are ambush predators, {{so often}} lie {{in wait for}} an {{appropriate}} prey to come along, when they attack. However, they have also been known to actively hunt, particularly in regions with a low concentration of suitable prey, and this behaviour generally occurs at night. The boa first strikes at the prey, grabbing it with its teeth; it then proceeds to constrict the prey until death before consuming it whole. Unconsciousness and death likely result from <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> vital {{blood flow to the}} heart and brain, rather than suffocation as was previously believed; constriction can interfere with blood flow and overwhelm the prey's usual blood pressure and circulation. This would lead to unconsciousness and death very quickly. Their teeth also help force the animal down the throat while muscles then move it toward the stomach. It takes the snake about 4–6 days to fully digest the food, {{depending on the size of}} the prey and the local temperature. After this, the snake may not eat for a week to several months, due to its slow metabolism.|$|E
