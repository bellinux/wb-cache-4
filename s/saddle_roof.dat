Built in Swiss chalet style, it featured a <b>saddle</b> <b>roof</b> and was split between a public area and a residence for the station master. Unusual for stations at the time the residential door was on the front, rather than the side, of the building. The station was decorated in fretsaw ornaments in organic and Gothic styles.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{formation}} of hierarchic cable roofs and calculation principles. The structure is formed by negative Gauss bended type <b>saddle</b> shaped cable <b>roofs,</b> by suspending separate <b>saddle</b> <b>roofs</b> corners to a higher level cable structure created by high-strength carbon fiber cables. For these structures all prerogatives which are typical for a <b>saddle</b> shape cable <b>roof</b> can be applied however, with a better correlation between the covered volume and the area. The structure behavior is characterized by geometric nonlinearity. To reduce the complexity and the amount of calculation and to avoid calculation matrix convergence problem the method of substructuring is used. By using the available software, calculation of stress and displacements of complicated hierarchically subordinated structures can be made, and the effect of displacements of separate structural elements on the all the rest of them can be defined. It is suitable to use hierarchic cable structures for great span coverings, the areas without any snow or with insignificant snow load, as well as these structures may be used as completely or partially dismounted provisional coverings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} of hierarchic cable roofs and calculation principles have been investigated. The structure is formed by negative Gauss bending type <b>saddle</b> shaped cable <b>roofs</b> by suspending separate <b>saddle</b> <b>roof's</b> corners {{to a higher}} level cable structure. These structures are characterized by all the same advantages, which as well apply to a <b>saddle</b> shaped cable <b>roof,</b> however, with a better ratio between the covered volume and the area. These systems can be intercombined to form wider roof areas. It is suitable to use hierarchic cable structures for long span roofs as well as for completely or partially dismounted provisional coverings. In order to reduce the complexity and the amount of calculation, and to avoid the calculation matrix convergence problem, calculation of stresses and displacements of complicated hierarchically subordinated structures with various geometrical parameters of hierarchic roof could be accomplished by the method of substructuring. The effect of interdependencies of separate structural elements and higher level cable structure can be determined by the iterative approximation method. By using of the proposed principle, the hierarchic cable structure is treated under the different wind and accidental snow load conditions...|$|R
