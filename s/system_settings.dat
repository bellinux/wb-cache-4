25|$|Phonon is {{the name}} of the {{multimedia}} API in KDE4. Phonon is a different approach to multimedia backends than in previous versions of KDE. This is because Phonon only functions as a wrapper, abstracting the various multimedia frameworks available for Unix-like operating systems into runtime switchable backends that can be accessed through a single API. This was done to provide a stable API for KDE 4 and to prevent it from depending on a single multimedia framework. Applications that use the Phonon API can be switched between multimedia frameworks seamlessly by simply changing the backend used in <b>System</b> <b>Settings.</b> Nokia adopted Phonon for multimedia use in Qt4.4 and are developing backends for Gstreamer, Windows and OS X in the KDE SVN repository under the LGPL.|$|E

It includes quick access buttons for a News feed from Nintendo, eShop access, and a photo album for screenshots captured during gameplay; the 4.0 update to the software in October 2017 also enabled capturing and sharing video from select games. A single Switch console supports up to eight user profiles, which each can be tied to a Nintendo Account user ID. Profiles can be represented by either a pre-made avatar from an internal gallery, or using a Mii. The Mii creator was upgraded with increased color options for aspects such as hair styles; however, it is integrated into the <b>system</b> <b>settings,</b> rather than being an independent application.|$|E

40|$|Reducing energy {{consumption}} of climate control systems {{is important in}} order to reduce human environmental footprint. The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the climate control system may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the {{energy consumption}} of their climate control unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the climate control system and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the climate control system {{as a function of the}} <b>system’s</b> <b>settings,</b> and the other, models human comfort level as a function of the climate control <b>system’s</b> <b>settings.</b> Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the climate control system. The agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent...|$|R
