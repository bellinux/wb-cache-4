40|$|One {{implication}} of the pollution haven hypothesis is that countries export more by applying more lenient environmental regulations. Most studies that apply gravity-type equations do not find robust support for environmental regulations to affect bilateral exports. In this paper, we show that one can obtain robust negative effects of stringency, as long as gravity equations are well specified with respect to theory. Our results, based on the European data, are both very consistent with US studies on environmental regulations and another line of very recent studies that infer non-biased price or substitution elasticities from trade equations. We show that more stringent environmental regulations, when depicting a pure cost effect, are reducing exports. The coefficient is even larger in the case where exporting countries are Central and Eastern European countries, comparing to the EU 15. Further, we {{show that there is}} {{no significant difference in the}} impact of regulations on trade in case of dirty and clean sectors. Finally, when using GMM estimation, our environmental <b>stringency</b> <b>coefficient</b> gets significantly reinforced. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005. ...|$|E
