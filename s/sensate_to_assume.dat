An intellectual approach to truth will end only in agnosticism; and often in cynicism. But the whole being of man seeks to experience truth, to realise it. … This rising above rationalism to direct experience and realisation, this growth of man from the <b>sensate</b> <b>to</b> the super-sensual dimension, is the special message of Indian spiritual tradition.|$|R

Moreover, {{it shows that the}} concept of affordance is a means to produce a theory of causation that embraces physical, natural and cultural levels of order...|$|R

30|$|The {{current study}} {{considered}} aspects of urban design and architecture as external indicators {{of social change}} {{in a context of}} two master built communities: Masdar City and Sippy Downs. The mixed methods utilised in this study analysed both temporal and spatial perspectives of architecture and urban designs. The temporal perspectives situated the case studies within the framework of Sorokin’s theory of social change, enhanced with the analysis of postmodernism as a determining feature of the late sensate phase of societal development. The socio-semiotic analysis informed by the findings of CLA indicated a transition of Masdar City from the late <b>sensate</b> <b>to</b> the idealistic phase of social change, whereas the socio-semiotic analysis paired with the residents’ survey indicated that Sippy Downs, in spite of weak signals of idealistic cultural mentality, is still firmly grounded in the late sensate mentality embracing the postmodern worldview. The survey, as part of the mixed design, enhanced the understanding of drivers and the underlying processes of social change. However, because of the small sample size the results cannot be considered generalisible. Statistics from the previous comparison study cited were more robust, but since the survey designs differed and questions could only be overlaid to a limited extent, the statistical significance of the results was difficult to ascertain.|$|R

This time around, Lana experimented more with combining original and source music while working with Mounsey, who in the last episode of the season was credited as composer, along with Klimek and Tykwer. In the Christmas special episode [...] "Happy F*cking New Year", a cover of Leonard Cohen's [...] "Hallelujah" [...] is featured, which was arranged by Gary Fry and recorded by the Apollo Chorus of Chicago, with the lead vocalist being Daniel Martin Moore. The sequence, which depicts the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus singing, was originally cut to a different cover of the song, but days before the deadline of completion the licensing deal fell through, and Stoller had to order a custom version to be conducted to match their completed cut. The song was ready in five days, and the producers were happy with the end result, including Netflix, which made the song a prominent feature of the special's marketing campaign. In the fifth episode of the season, [...] "Fear Never Fixed Anything", a remix of [...] "What's Up?" [...] is played by Riley in a club, in an attempt <b>to</b> get other <b>sensates</b> <b>to</b> make themselves known, recalling the first season's appearance of the song.|$|R
