40|$|The summer {{flounder}} bottom trawl fishery has shown increased interactions with sea turtles as populations increase due to continued {{protection under the}} endangered <b>species</b> act. <b>In</b> this study, two separate gear designs that potentially can reduce sea turtle bycatch in the {{summer flounder}} bottom trawl fishery were tested for finfish catch efficiency. The first manuscript examines two experiments involving two separate turtle excluder device (TED) designs. The second manuscript examines a topless trawl as a possible replacement for fixed grid TEDs as sea turtle bycatch reduction devices. ^ In the first manuscript, experiment # 1 evaluated the catch efficiency of a certified National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) standard turtle excluder device (TED) to the standard trawl {{in response to the}} concern from commercial fishermen that their target catch, summer flounder was being lost due to the inefficient design of the TED. Experiment # 2 was performed to test an alternative TED design to the previous tested NMFS certified TED. In experiment # 1 the NMFS certified TED(experimental) was compared to a standard trawl (control) using a paired tow design on one vessel using consecutive tows, alternating between the control and the experimental trawl in the following sequence: ABBA (A=experimental trawl, B=control trawl) to minimize gear handling time. A paired t-test was used to test for differences between the combined mean weight (catch by <b>species)</b> per tow <b>in</b> <b>kilograms</b> of the standard trawl and NMFS certified TED. The NMFS certified TED evaluated in this project had a significant reduction in summer flounder catch as compared to the standard trawl (35 % loss). These findings indicated a need for NMFS to develop a more efficient alternative to the currently used NMFS certified TED. ^ Experiment # 2 evaluated the catch efficiency of the northeast modified TED to the NMFS certified TED used in experiment # 1. The evaluation used a paired tow design on two vessels using consecutive tows, alternating between the control (NMFS certified TED) and the experimental (northeast modified TED) trawl in the following sequence: ABBA (A=NMFS certified TED, B=northeast modified TED) to minimize gear handling time. A paired t-test was used to test for differences between the combined mean weight (catch by <b>species)</b> per tow <b>in</b> <b>kilograms</b> of the NMFS certified TED and northeast modified TED. The northeast modified TED evaluated in this project did not have a significant difference in summer flounder catch as compared to the NMFS certified TED. ^ The findings of this research indicate that there is a significant reduction in the summer flounder catch with both the NMFS certified TED and a northeast modified TED. These results indicate that NMFS should not move forward with regulations to implement the TED in the summer flounder fishery until a more efficient design for excluding turtles can be developed. ^ The evaluation of the catch efficiency of a topless trawl is described in the second manuscript. The study was conducted in response to a need for an alternative to turtle excluder devices (TEDs) which have a documented loss of summer flounder, the target species catch, ranging from 35 to 28 %. ^ The topless trawl (experimental) was compared to a standard trawl (control) using a paired tow design on one vessel using consecutive tows, alternating between the control and the experimental trawl in the following sequence: ABBA (A=experimental topless trawl, B=control trawl) to minimize gear handling time. A paired t-test was used to test for differences between the combined mean weight (catch by <b>species)</b> per tow <b>in</b> <b>kilograms</b> of the standard and topless trawl. The topless trawl net evaluated in this project had no significant difference in summer flounder catch as compared to the standard 2 -seam flounder trawl. ^ The findings of this research indicate that there is no difference between the catch rate of summer flounder when using a topless trawl in place of the standard summer flounder trawl net. These results indicate that NMFS should move forward with designing a study to determine the ability of a topless trawl to exclude wild sea turtles. ...|$|R
