50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of vestibules, passage between cars when a train was underway was both dangerous - stepping over a <b>shifting</b> <b>plate</b> between swaying cars with nothing on either side but chain guard rails - and unpleasant, due to being exposed to the weather, as well as soot, red-hot cinders and fly ash raining down from the exhaust of the steam locomotive hauling the train.

40|$|Two {{detectors}} for {{charged particle}} identification {{have been built}} and tested. First, a test setup for a diffusion box threshold detector, using a 5 cm thick aerogel radiator has been designed and tested at the KEK PS facility in Japan. Using white Millipore paper as a diffuse reflector inside a diffusion box, the Ĉerenkov light gets scattered randomly until it hits one of the photomultipliers. On average up to 20 photoelectrons detected for pions at 1. 2 GeV/c have been observed. Second, collection of Ĉerenkov light with an acrylic wavelength <b>shifting</b> <b>plate</b> was investigated. The test setup consisted of a plate, 30 cm long, 10 cm wide, and 1 cm thick placed behind a 5 cm deep stack of aerogel tiles. On the long ends the wavelength shifter was read out by two 5 -inch photomultipliers. The response of the system to pions and protons at 1. 2 GeV/c momentum was measured at the KEK PS facility in Japan. On average 6 photoelectrons radiated in the aerogel could be detected...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} efficiency for Cherenkov light incident on a wavelength <b>shifting</b> <b>plate</b> (WLS) {{has been determined}} during a beam test at the Proton Synchrotron facility located in the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan. The experiment was conducted {{in order to determine}} the detector’s response to photoelectrons converted from photons produced by a fused silica radiator; this allows for an approximation of the detector’s quality. The yield of the photoelectrons was measured as a function of the momentum of the incident hadron beam. The yield is proportional to sin 2 θc, where θc is the opening angle of the Cherenkov light created. Based on estimations and results from similarly conducted tests, where the {{collection efficiency}} was roughly 39 %, the experimental result was expected to be around 40 % for internally produced light from the WLS.

50|$|Episodic {{tectonics}} is {{a general}} term for a geodynamic regime that possesses aspects of both plate tectonics and stagnant lid dynamics.

40|$|The Northern Range of Trinidad is an east-west {{trending}} mountainous {{exposure of}} metamorphic rocks {{located in the}} Caribbean-South American plate boundary zone. With a maximum elevation of ~ 1 km, the Northern Range {{is the only place}} in Trinidad were metamorphic rocks have been exhumed to the surface. Prior to ca. 10 Ma the Caribbean plate was obliquely converging relative to the South American plate and began creating the geologically young mountains that we see today. However, ca. 5 - 10 Ma, the Caribbean <b>plate</b> <b>shifted</b> from oblique convergence to dextral shearing (strike-slip faulting), and near Trinidad is currently moving at ~ 20 mm/year toward N 86 °E ± 2 ° with respect to the South American plate. Using apatite fission-track methods, we test whether the Northern Range rocks were exhumed before or after this <b>shift</b> in <b>plate</b> motion to better understand the processes by which they were exhumed (unburied). Samples were collected over the past decade, and then the fission-track analysis was performed at Apatite to Zircon Inc. in the summer of 2008. We studied apatite fission tracks in fifteen samples: fourteen from the Northern Range, and one from the Paria Peninsula in Venezuela. All samples gave reset fission-track ages, between ~ 4 Ma and ~ 20 Ma. We recognize a spatial pattern in the ages: older fission-track ages (ca. 13 to 18 Ma) are located in the eastern Northern Range and younger fissiontrack ages (ca. 5 to 6 Ma) are located in the western Northern Range. The younger fission-track ages in the western Northern Range postdate oblique convergence of the Caribbean plate motion relative to South America. The older fission-track ages in the east predate the <b>shift</b> in <b>plate</b> motion. Inverse modeling using the HeFTy program also shows that exhumation occurred at a faster rate (ca. 15 ºC/m. y.) in the west than in the east (ca. 5 ºC/m. y.). Our interpretation is that a thick, buoyant crustal root is present in the western Northern Range and this resulted in isostatic uplift and associated erosion, exhuming rocks of the western rocks long after oblique convergence (transpression) shut off...|$|R
