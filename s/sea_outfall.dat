40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model {{is used to}} assess the bathing water quality of Bray and Killiney bathing sites in Ireland following changes to the sewage management system. The model, firstly calibrated to hydrodynamic and water quality data from the period prior to the upgrade of the Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW), was then used to simulate Escherichia coli (E. coli) distributions for discharge scenarios of the periods prior to and following the upgrade of the WwTW under dry and wet weather conditions. E. coli distributions under dry weather conditions demonstrate that the upgrade in the WwTW has remarkably improved the bathing water quality to a Blue Flag status. The new discharge strategy is expected to drastically reduce the rainfall-related incidents in which environmental limits of the Bathing Water Directive are breached.

40|$|Sewage <b>outfalls</b> {{into the}} <b>sea</b> {{have much in}} common with {{chimneys}} for emissions into the atmosphere: both are intended to release pollutants {{in such a way that}} they are rapidly diffused and reduced to harmless concentrations. Chimney design aims at restricting the concentrations of pollutants near the ground to a tolerable level whilst, in outfalls, the aim is to afford the upper strata of water and the coastal regions in particular the maximum possible protection against pollution. Yet an essential difference lies in the fact that the atmosphere into which chimneys discharge extends upwards for large distances and, generally speaking, is subject to a high degree of vertical mixing while the coastal waters into which waste is released are comparatively shallow. Waste outfalls and chimneys can have only a localized influence upon the reduction of concentrations of pollutants. At any great distance of discharge, it hardly matters what method is used to release pollutants. The sole decisive factor is how quickly they are decomposed by physical, chemical and biological processes. The continual release of substances which do not decompose is bound to cause an increase in the concentration. No discharge structure, however well designed, can remedy this. With decomposable substances this increase does not occur! Hence <b>sea</b> <b>outfalls</b> are acceptable for the harmless removal of pollutants such as domestic sewage but for nondecomposable substances they are just as unsuitable as any other form of dispersion...|$|R

The original building was gutted save for the original sprung dance floor and was concerted for the most part into the Anchor Pub.

Thus robbed of the lucrative profits from food as alcohol consumption fell due to social concerns, the centre's financial viability was stretched. When Pacini decided to pull all future funding this resulted in the lease being given up and control handed to the cafe proprietor, who abandoned the water-sports and ran the pub for a short while before closing its doors for good.The site has limitations mainly associated with decay of the building structures due to lack of maintenance and vandalism and the general deterioration of the old coastal walkways.

At each site, pairs of DGT units (one containing a 0. 4 mm {{and the other a}} 0. 8 mm diffusive gel layer) were deployed at three depths (50 – 70; 105 – 130; 135 – 155 m) for 4 – 7 days. Comparison of predicted water column DGT-labile metal concentrations in field deployments showed the 0. 8 mm DGT units were relatively enriched in metals, with the effect being greatest closer to the outfall for Pb and Mn and least for Fe, Cr, Ni and Zn. The most likely explanation for this is that in addition to simple ion diffusion, kinetic factors associated with ageing or desorption processes govern release of metals from iron and aluminium oxyhydroxide colloids which diffuse through the gels. The thicker gels have a longer residence time over which metals can be released for adsorption. This model explains why enrichment is most pronounced near the outfall; more distant sites have lower colloid concentrations because of the longer time for coagulation to increase particle sizes to the extent they cannot enter the gels. Total and filterable metal (FM) concentrations were frequently below the limits of detection (LOD) achievable by conventional ICP-AES (1 – 52 gL − 1) and this limited their usefulness for assessing environmental risk and for metal speciation determination. Because of its pre-concentration step DGT gave metal concentrations above their LODs and these decreased exponentially with distance from the outfall. Concentrations of DGT–labile metal fell below Australian water quality guidelines for protection of 99 % of marine organisms within 0. 13 km of the outfall for Cd, Cr and Ni and below that for protection of 95 % of marine organisms within 0. 4, 0. 7 and 3. 6 km for lead, zinc and copper, respectively...|$|R

The system can predict concentrations of parameters in the far field as well as the near field, and also {{can be used as a}} decision support system for designing. It is also capable of analyzing the near field of single port sea outfalls, and can be developed for the far field analyzing and design decisions of multiport diffuser discharges.

SOS HELP provides necessary information about long sea outfalls as well as information about the SOS.

40|$|Desalination of {{seawater}} produces brine, wastewater {{containing a}} high salt concentration to {{be disposed of}} into the environment. It is common practice for coastal seawater desalination plants to discharge the brine waste into the <b>sea</b> via an <b>outfall</b> at {{some distance from the}} beach. In Kish Island is the {{one of the most important}} seawater desalination plant which located in the Southern coast of Iran. It is important to understand how brine is dispersed into the sea so that we can minimize its potential environmental impact. One factor that affects the mixing of brine discharges is the tidal current. The tidal currents transports brine plumes back and forth before eventually dispersing it into the sea. As a seawater desalination plant is continuously disposing of brines at a constant rate, unacceptably high salinity in coastal water on both sides of the outfall are created due to the flow reversals. Therefore, it is important to optimize the intake location. In this study, the effect of a tidally oscillating flow in dispersing brine waste discharge into the sea has been studied using a two-dimensional model, MIKE 21 and results are presented graphically by plotting contours of concentration. It is found that not only are the plumes spreading far downstream of the outfall along the beach, but due to the flow oscillation, the plumes are also spreading towards the upstream side of the outfall. With attentive to results we forecast two fine positions for intake layout...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been to: 1) assess the state of {{pollution}} in the two study areas and relate them to recent changes found in the Kattegat - Belt Sea area; 2) examine the observed spatial and temporal variability in species composition, abundance and biomass in Arhus Bay and the Formes area and relate the variability to antropogenic and natural causes; 3) discuss and assess methods, particularly for the estimation of secondary production {{and the use of}} multivariate analyses as methods for examining changes in macrozoobenthic communities. Macrozoobenthos were sampled at 15 stations in Arhus Bay, Denmark from 1985 to 1991 while data from Formes (reference area) included 55 sampling stations from 1986 to 1990. Monthly sampling took place at one station in Arhus Bay in 1990 and 1991. The two study areas are both situated on the eastcoast of Jutland in the Kattegat - Belt Sea area at 13 - 17 m depth and both receive waste water from long <b>sea</b> <b>outfalls.</b> Although both areas are Subjected to salinity stratification for most of the year, the exposed position of the Formes area on the open Kattegat coast prevents it from suffering from severe oxygen deficiencies, unlike the Arhus Bay which is a sheltered, semi-enclosed sedimentation area where oxygen concentrations in the bottom water can be very low. At Formes the sediment is sandy while it is silty in Arhus Bay. The spatial and temporal variability in the benthos in Arhus Bay could to a great extent be explained by the variation in 7 important species: Abra alba, Corbula gibba, Mysella bidentata, Nepthys hombergii, N. ciliata, Ophiura albida and Echinocardium cordatum. The fluctuations in the number and biomass of A. alba had a pronounced effect on the total abundance and biomass in Arhus Bay. The severe winter of 1986 / 87 with low temperatures and oxygen depletion under the ice cover practically eliminated A. alba from the bay. A. alba quickly recolonized the area and was found in high numbers in 1988. Studies of growth of A. alba in 1990 and 1991 showed {{that by the end of}} 1990 the population had reached an average length of 10 mm while the average shell length was only 5 mm by the end of 1991. The difference between the two years could be attributed to the difference in sedimentation of phytoplankton from the water column. As in other parts of the Kattegat - Belt Sea area, Arhus Bay has experienced low oxygen concentrations in the bottom water in late summer early autumn throughout the 1980 s. Only the oxygen depletion under the ice cover in early spring 1987 and the local oxygen deficiencies south of the outlet in 1989 and 1990 actually killed parts of the benthic fauna. Apart from 1981, the oxygen deficiencies have thus been less severe in Arhus Bay than in other parts of the southern Kattegat in the 1980 s. The number of species, abundance and biomass decreased at Fornres from 1980 to 1985 while the discharge of BOD was fairly constant during the same period. From 1986 there was a slight decrease in the discharge of BOD but a considerable increase in the number of species, abundance and biomass. At least for the second half of the 1980 s there was no straightforward relation between the organic enrichment from the outlet and species composition, abundance and biomass and suggests that other factors are also important influencing the fluctuations in the benthic fauna. Estimates of total secondary community production were found to be very dependent on the method used. The method described by Brey (1990) was found acceptable for estimating secondary production in Arhus Bay but care should be exercised when comparisons are made with other areas where different methods have been used to estimate production. Secondary production was estimated more accurately for some of the abundant species in Arhus Bay on the basis of monthly samplings by the method described by Crisp (1984). Among the multivariate analyses the Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) proved to be the most successful with the Arhus Bay and Fornes data sets. Two Way INdicator SPecies ANalysis (TWINSPAN) did not work well with the Fornes data because it imposed discontinuities on data sets with continous variation in distribution of species among samples. As community types existed to a certain degree in Arhus Bay TWINSPAN worked well with these data. DCA and MDS were found to be useful techniques for analysing large data sets because they can summarize the data matrices to a manageable form and find possible patterns in the data sets. The results of the analyses can then be used as starting point for more detailed investigations of single species/samples or groups of species/samples. By using different transformations of the raw data the role of dominant or rare species can be assessed. A major 'problem in the assessment of multivariate techniques is the lack of external standards to compare with. The results of multivariate analyses must therefore be assessed critically on the basis of a careful examination of the species list combined with the knowledge and experience of the investigator. The methods used all had their advantages and limitations but each of the different methods added some important information to the picture of the benthic community in Arhus Bay and Fornes. It was thus an considerable advantage to use several different methods to analyse the spatial and temporal variability in the benthic fauna in relation to antropogenic and natural causes...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a numerical modeling study {{aimed at a}} preliminary assessment {{of the impact of}} the planned <b>sea</b> <b>outfall</b> of the city of Limassol, Cyprus, on the waters of Akrotiri bay. First the local meteorological and oceanographic conditions as well as the loading characteristics are briefly reviewed. Two-dimensional finite element hydrodynamic and dispersion models are subsequently applied to the study area. The results of the former show an eastbound flow pattern under the prevailing westerly winds, in general agreement with available field observations. The spread of BOD and N under continuous loading is then examined for eastward as well as for westward flow as an indicator for the extent of pollution to be expected. The computed concentrations are generally low and confined to the shallower parts of the bay.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} some pollution indicators [ammonia (NH 4 -N), faecal coliforms counts] {{has been carried}} out for three years (1993 - 95) in the urban area of the Ebrié lagoon, evaluating the impact of a <b>sea</b> <b>outfall</b> project. This project, for collecting and forwarding wastewaters of the city of Abidjan to the Atlantic ocean {{in order to reduce the}} pollutant load in the lagoon, was initiated in 1994. It failed a few months after the first operation and there is now an overall increase in pollution due to continuous use of the lagoon for dumping domestic as well as industrial and agricultural wastes as a consequence of the malfunctioning of the outfall, which was poorly designed, probably because of insufficient funding.

40|$|Abstract- Geostatistical {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study the spatial continuity of the salinity of a sewage outfall discharge. The data set used was obtained in a monitoring campaign to a <b>sea</b> <b>outfall,</b> located off the Portuguese west coast near Aveiro region, using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The spatial analysis package geoR was used for computing variograms and ordinary kriging. The robust estimator was used to compute the experimental semivariogram, which was fitted to spherical theoretical model, after a successful cross-validation. The prediction maps of the spatial distribution of salinity show clearly the effluent plume dispersion in the field. This study suggests that geostatistical methodology can provide estimates of effluents dispersion very valuable for environmental impact and management of sea outfalls. I...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} work is to {{describe}} and to model water quality into a short estuarine channel strongly conditioned by tidal oscillations. These typical transition water volumes are frequently subjected to discharge of effluent from urban drainage system or from wastewater treatment plant and are very important in sanitary conditioning of marine coastal areas. Field experiences are carried out during three days into the intake channel of the Etrurian Saline at Cervia (RA) and made possible a complete hourly parametric description of water quality during four tidal cicles. Concentration of biomass, ammonia, salinity, nitrate and orthophosphate are analyzed as a temporary step of two hours in surface and bottom samples catched at 200 m from the <b>sea</b> <b>outfall.</b> In {{the same time it}} has been measured water temperature, pH and sea level in outfall. Calculations developed in measured tidal flow conditions present a good agreement with results of field experiences...|$|E
40|$|Geostatistics {{has been}} {{successfully}} used to analyse and characterize the spatial variability of environmental properties. Besides providing estimated values at unsampled locations, geostatistics measures {{the accuracy of the}} estimate, which is a significant advantage over traditional methods used to assess pollution. This work uses universal block kriging to model and map the spatial distribution of salinity measurements gathered by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle in a <b>sea</b> <b>outfall</b> monitoring campaign. The aim is to distinguish the effluent plume from the receiving waters, characterizing its spatial variability {{in the vicinity of the}} discharge and estimating dilution. The results demonstrate that geostatistical methodology can provide good estimates of the dispersion of effluents, which are valuable in assessing the environmental impact and managing sea outfalls. Moreover, since accurate measurements of the plume’s dilution are rare, these studies may be very helpful in the future to validate dispersion models...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{superposition}} of pertinent fluxes {{of single}} jets or plumes, {{a model to}} predict the mean axial velocities and mean concentrations of the combined field due to merging is developed. The model equations are produced by the integral equations of momentum, tracer and kinetic energy for the mean flow, which are derived for any single jet or plume or the entire set assuming that turbulence contributes equally to the rate of kinetic energy flux for either a single or interacting plume. Superposition solutions are developed for sets of any number of jets or plumes and are applied to equally spaced identical jets or plumes in a row, assuming Gaussian profiles for mean axial velocities and mean concentrations of single fields. Predictions obtained by this method are compared to analytical and experimental findings described in Part I. The spatial mean dilution is determined using the integral continuity equation. Present results are discussed and compared with other reported works. The evolution of the flow and mixing fields is explained in detail, while the practical usage of the methods discussed in this paper and Part I, either for <b>sea</b> <b>outfall</b> design or laboratory simulation studies, is illustrated. © 2006 International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research...|$|E
