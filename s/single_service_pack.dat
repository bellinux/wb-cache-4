50|$|The first SP2 beta build {{was sent}} out in October 2008, a public beta arrived in December 2008, and an RC-escrow build {{was given to}} testers in January 2009.

50|$|Trainz Railway Simulator 2006 (known as Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006 in the USA), or TRS2006, was an {{transitional}} release, {{incorporating the}} stable Auran JET based TRS2004 GUI modules with only some graphics improvements, but introducing the data base manager Content Manager Plus (CMP) {{as a new}} core technology. ContentManager.exe (now called just CM) combines data base management, and secure FTP upload and download facilities and special user definable filters all in one integrated system. By defining a good filter, the user could 'selectively not see' the clutter of regional items in the Surveyor asset selection menus saving user time when world building. This important filtering feature was further improved in Trainz 2009, becoming far more powerful and easier to use. In addition to these improvements, several new routes were included, such as Hawes Junction (representing a small section of the Settle and Carlisle Railway and serving as a demo for TC3), Toronto Rail Lands 1954 (representing Toronto's sprawling railyard in 1954), and Marias Pass Approach (representing the BNSF Marias Pass line between Shelby, Montana and Cut Bank, Montana and serving as a demo for the full Marias Pass payware route). TRS2006 was published in September 2005, and the base release with its <b>single</b> <b>service</b> <b>pack</b> formed {{the core of the}} regional releases (most are joint ventures with 'Trainz Partners' combining payware content provider's products with the base Trainz software) {{over the next four years}} until the introduction of new technologies in TC3 and TRS2009. In Germany, it was published by Bluesky-Interactive, as ProTrain Perfect.|$|E
50|$|Because Windows Server 2008 {{is based}} on the Windows NT 6.0 <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 1 kernel, the RTM release is {{considered}} to be <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 1; accordingly, the first <b>service</b> <b>pack</b> is called <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2. Announced on October 24, 2008, this <b>service</b> <b>pack</b> contains the same changes and improvements as the Windows Vista <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2, as well as the final release of Hyper-V 1.0, and an approximate 10% reduction in power usage.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft {{released}} Windows NT 4.0 <b>service</b> <b>packs</b> {{primarily to}} fix bugs. Windows NT 4.0, during its lifecycle, had several <b>service</b> <b>packs,</b> {{as well as}} numerous service rollup packages and option packs. The last full <b>service</b> <b>pack</b> was <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 6a (SP6a).|$|R
25|$|Microsoft {{started work}} on <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 soon after <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 1 was released, as Windows Server 2008 {{uses the same}} {{codebase}} as Windows Vista <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 1.|$|R

50|$|Internet Explorer 6.0 {{supports}} Windows NT 4.0 (<b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 6a only), Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 1 update supports all {{of these}} versions, but Security Version 1 is only available as part Windows XP <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 and Windows Server 2003 <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 1 and later <b>service</b> <b>packs</b> for those versions. Versions after Windows XP include Internet Explorer 7 and higher only.|$|R
50|$|<b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 and <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 3 also remove {{features}} from Windows XP {{but to a}} less noticeable extent. For instance, Program Manager {{and support}} for TCP half-open connections are removed in <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2. The Energy Star logo and the address bar on the taskbar are removed in <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 3.|$|R
50|$|Internet Explorer 2 was bundled with Windows NT 4, which updated {{versions}} {{included with}} each <b>service</b> <b>pack.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 6, the last <b>service</b> <b>pack</b> for Windows NT 4, included Internet Explorer 6 SP1.|$|R
50|$|The RTM {{version of}} Windows XP Professional x64 Edition {{is based on}} Windows Server 2003 <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 1 codebase. Because Windows XP Professional x64 Edition comes from a {{different}} codebase than 32-bit Windows XP, its <b>service</b> <b>packs</b> are also developed separately. For the same reason, <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 for Windows XP x64 Edition, released on March 13, 2007, {{is not the same}} as <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 for 32-bit versions of Windows XP. In fact, due to the earlier release date of the 32-bit version, many of the key features introduced by <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 for 32-bit (x86) editions of Windows XP were already present in the RTM version of its x64 counterpart. <b>Service</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 is the last released <b>service</b> <b>pack</b> for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.|$|R

50|$|<b>Service</b> <b>Packs</b> for Microsoft Windows were {{cumulative}} through Windows XP.
