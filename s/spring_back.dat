5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

50|$|Cold worked items {{suffer from}} a {{phenomenon}} known as springback, or elastic springback. After the deforming force {{is removed from the}} workpiece, the workpiece <b>springs</b> <b>back</b> slightly. The amount a material <b>springs</b> <b>back</b> is equal to the yield strain (the strain at the yield point) for the material.|$|R

5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the seal}} is disturbed, the bladder walls {{instantly}} <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> {{to a more}} rounded shape; the door flies open and a column of water is sucked into the bladder. The animal which touched the lever, if small enough, is inevitably drawn in, {{and as soon as}} the trap is filled, the door resumes its closed positionthe whole operation being completed in as little as one-hundredth of a second.|$|E
25|$|Iron became {{increasingly}} common from the 13th century B.C. Before {{that the use}} of swords was less frequent. The iron was not quench-hardened although often containing sufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze swords. They could still bend during use rather than <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipment of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze weapons.|$|E

25|$|Only {{the third}} {{approach}} promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become {{upset about the}} disruptive state and thus change their current pattern {{to cope with the}} issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by blaming others and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, <b>spring</b> <b>back,</b> and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.|$|E
25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E
500|$|Commercially pure {{flat product}} (sheet, plate) can be formed readily, but {{processing}} {{must take into}} account the fact that the metal has a [...] "memory" [...] and tends to <b>spring</b> <b>back.</b> This is especially true of certain high-strength alloys. Titanium cannot be soldered without first pre-plating it in a metal that is solderable. The metal can be machined with the same equipment and the same processes as stainless steel.|$|E

500|$|The {{anatomy of}} the forelegs begin at the scapula. This is the {{shoulder}} in which provides the ease of movement as it is connected to various bones surrounding it such as the cervical vertebra (a section of the spine). The next bone is the humerus which leads onto the radius below. The radius is then connected to {{the bones of the}} knee. The carpus is located at front of the knee and the pisiform is the back of the knee. Below the knee is the cannon bone which is also known as the 3rd metacarpal. 55 million years ago when the Eohippus existed, the cannon bone used to be the 3rd toe of the foot. It's fusion took place in order to increase height and power of the limb. Behind the cannon bone are the splint bones. The splint bones are also known as the 2nd and 4th metacarpal and fused 25 - 35 million years ago {{during the time of the}} Miohippus. They provide extra strength and support of the cannon bone and used to be the 2nd and 4th toes of the foot. Below the cannon bone is the fetlock joint in which lays a structure if many bones. Firstly are the sesamoid bones that act as part of the system that allows the leg to drop as pressure is applied and <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> up as pressure is released. Below this is the proximal phalanx also known as the long pastern which is followed by the middle phalanx (short pastern). Below these bones are the navicular bone and the distal phalanx. the distal phalanx can be known as the coffin bone or the pedal bone. Below the navicular bone is the navicular bursa.|$|E
2500|$|The stumps used in indoor cricket are not, {{for obvious}} reasons, {{stuck in the}} ground. Instead, they are {{collapsible}} spring-loaded stumps that immediately <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> to the standing position when knocked over. The ball used in indoor cricket is a modified cricket ball, with a softer centre. The ball also differs {{in that it is}} yellow to make it more obvious to see indoors against varied backgrounds. Both traditional outdoor cricket bats or more specialised lighter-weight indoor cricket bats may be used. [...] The gloves are typically lightweight cotton with no protective padding on the outside. [...] The palm-side of the gloves usually have embedded rubber dots to aid grip.|$|E
2500|$|Resulting trusts in English law are trusts created where {{property}} is not properly disposed of. It {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to <b>spring</b> <b>back,</b> and was defined by Megarry VC as [...] "essentially a property concept; any property that a man does not effectually dispose of remains his own". These trusts come in two forms: [...] automatic resulting trusts, and presumed resulting trusts. Automatic resulting trusts arise from a [...] "gap" [...] in the equitable title of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed: it is against principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. They occur in one of four situations: where there is no declaration of trust, where an express trust fails, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Rules differ depending on the situation and the type of original trust under dispute; failed charitable trusts, for example, have the property reapplied in a different way from other forms of trust.|$|E

2500|$|The name {{resulting}} trust {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to <b>spring</b> <b>back.</b> It was defined in [...] Re Sick and Funeral Society of St John's Sunday School, Golcar, where Megarry VC stated that [...] "A {{resulting trust}} is essentially a property concept; any property that a man does not effectually dispose of remains his own". In Re Vandervell's Trusts (No 2), he divided them into two categories; presumed resulting trusts, which are created by the presumed intention of the transferor of property, and automatic resulting trusts, which arise regardless of the transferor's intention whenever he has failed {{to dispose of the}} beneficial interest. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in Westdeutsche Landesbank v Islington London Borough Council, disagreed with Megarry's classification. While he agreed there were two categories, he felt the dividing line was not based on intention, and the classes were [...] "where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B" [...] and [...] "Where A transfers property to B on express trusts, but the trusts declared do not exhaust the whole beneficial interest", with both involving a presumption of intention. It is possible to argue that Quistclose trusts are also a category of resulting trusts, but their classification is the subject of much debate and remains ambiguous.|$|E
