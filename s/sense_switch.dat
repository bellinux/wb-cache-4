50|$|A <b>sense</b> <b>switch,</b> {{or program}} switch, is a {{switch on the}} front panel of a {{computer}} whose state can be tested by conditional branch instructions in software. Most early computers had several sense switches. They were typically used by the operator to set program options.|$|E
50|$|On some machines, certain {{lights and}} {{switches}} were reserved for use under program control. These were {{often referred to}} as sense lights and sense switches. For example, the original Fortran compiler for the IBM 704 contained specific statements for testing and manipulation of the 704's sense lights and switches. These switches were often used by the program to control optional behavior, for example information might be printed only if a particular <b>sense</b> <b>switch</b> was set.|$|E

50|$|A typical running {{application}} has two modes: {{either it}} has nothing to do and awaits some user action, or, some action is in progress that will take a long time to complete.

50|$|Also in 1973, Volkswagen {{agreed to}} a {{settlement}} with the EPA, in which they admitted no wrongdoing and paid a $120,000 fine, for failing to disclose the existence of two temperature <b>sensing</b> <b>switches</b> that affected emissions function. In their 1974 model year application to the EPA, VW disclosed {{the presence of the}} switches and the EPA rejected them, so they were removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} computers did {{not support}} interactive input/output devices, often relying on <b>sense</b> <b>switches</b> and lights {{to communicate with the}} computer operator. This was adequate for batch systems that ran one program at a time, often with the programmer acting as operator. This also had the advantage of low overhead, since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction. Later a single system console was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} set of {{principles}} to tailor and enhance optical forces between parallel, periodic dielectric waveguides by molding the eigen-mode field distribution via the combined effects of highly symmetric slow light modes and waveguide morphology. The geometries here considered are amenable to standard lithographic techniques and possess strong repulsive and attractive optical forces that can be enhanced via slow-light band edge modes.

50|$|On some vehicles, a {{temperature}} <b>sensing</b> <b>switch</b> will apply manifold vacuum to the vacuum advance system when {{the engine is}} hot or cold, and ported vacuum at normal operating temperature. This is a version of emissions control; the ported vacuum allowed carburetor adjustments for a leaner idle mixture. At high engine temperature, the increased advance raised engine speed to allow the cooling system to operate more efficiently. At low temperature the advance allowed the enriched warm-up mixture to burn more completely, providing better cold-engine running.|$|R

25|$|A {{common problem}} with antenna systems {{of this sort}} {{is that it is}} not {{possible}} to know if the signal is being received by the front or back of the antenna, which are equally sensitive. To address this, once a null was seen, the bearing operator turned on a <b>sensing</b> <b>switch</b> which connected a second antenna located slightly behind the main one. The mixed output of the two clearly indicated which side the target lay on, front or rear. However, this led to problems in the phasing systems that were never wholly cured.|$|R

Obviously, {{the design of}} the threshold for channel switching is very important. In this paper, we set the threshold according to the link reliability without channel interference. It can be obtained through the wireless link test and evaluation. The channel switching information will be integrated into the ACK packet and shared with the telerobot. The event triggered <b>sensing</b> and <b>switching</b> mechanism can also avoid unnecessary <b>sensing</b> and <b>switching</b> overheads.|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{operating in}} the license-free spectrum suffer from uncontrolled interference as those spectrum bands become increasingly crowded. The emerging cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs) provide a promising solution to address this challenge by enabling sensor nodes to opportunistically access licensed channels. However, since sensor nodes have to consume considerable energy to support CR functionalities, such as channel <b>sensing</b> and <b>switching,</b> the opportunistic channel accessing should be carefully devised for improving the energy efficiency in CRSN. To this end, we investigate the dynamic channel accessing problem to improve the energy efficiency for a clustered CRSN. Under the primary users' protection requirement, we study the resource allocation issues to maximize the energy efficiency of utilizing a licensed channel for intra-cluster and inter-cluster data transmission, respectively. With the consideration of the energy consumption in channel <b>sensing</b> and <b>switching,</b> we further determine the condition when sensor nodes should <b>sense</b> and <b>switch</b> to a licensed channel for improving the energy efficiency, according to the packet loss rate of the license-free channel. In addition, two dynamic channel accessing schemes are proposed to identify the channel <b>sensing</b> and <b>switching</b> sequences for intra-cluster and inter-cluster data transmission, respectively. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel accessing schemes can significantly reduce the energy consumption in CRSNs. Comment: 13 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

50|$|A stopped-flow {{instrument}} is a rapid mixing device {{used to study}} the chemical kinetics of fast reactions in solution. In stopped-flow technique, the solutions are forced from syringes into a mixing chamber. After {{a very short period}} of flow, perhaps a few ms, the flow is stopped suddenly when the observation cell is filled by an opposing piston that is linked to a <b>sensing</b> <b>switch</b> that triggers the measuring device. Small volumes of solutions are used, and the kinetic equations for modeling the reactions are equivalent to those used in conventional methods in which concentration and time are measured. Stopped-flow is useful for studying fast reactions that have half-lives as short as a few milliseconds.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{electromagnetic}} mode that forms at {{the interface between}} two planar surfaces laid {{side by side in}} free space, effectively guiding energy along an infinitesimal, one-dimensional line. It is shown that this mode occurs when the boundaries have complementary surface impedances, and it is possible to control the mode confinement by altering their values correspondingly. The mode exhibits singular field enhancement, broad bandwidth, direction-dependent polarization, and robustness to certain defects. As a proof-of-concept, experimental results in the microwave regime are provided using patterned conducting sheets. Our proposed effective-medium-based approach is general, however, thus allowing for potential implementation up to optical frequencies. Our system is promising for applications including integrated photonics, <b>sensing,</b> <b>switching,</b> chiral quantum coupling, and reconfigurable waveguides. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Water level <b>sensing</b> <b>switch</b> type - Pressure {{switches}} {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|R

We find the transition temperature to be substantially reduced, with the high chalcocite phase appearing in the smallest nanocrystals at temperatures so low that they are typical of photovoltaic operation. Size dependence in phase trans- formations suggests the possibility of accessing morphologies that are not found in bulk solids at ambient conditions.
