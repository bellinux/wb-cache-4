This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E

25|$|Social constructivist {{scholars}} view {{learning as}} an active process where learners should learn to discover principles, concepts and facts for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in learners (Brown et al.1989; Ackerman 1996). In fact, for the social constructivist, reality is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can discover {{because it does not}} pre-exist prior to our social invention of it. Kukla (2000) argues that reality is constructed by our own activities and that people, together as members of a society, invent the properties of the world.|$|E

25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

500|$|The game uses an {{optimized}} {{version of}} the Dinosaur Hunter engine, which allowed developers to create environments with more complex geometry and incorporate a lighting system where light sources could cast shadows on objects in real-time. The game's distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect, resulting in players {{being able to see}} five time as far than they could in the original game. The game's progression, focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by the Mario and Zelda franchises. As Dienstbier explained, [...] "That's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> learned from Miyamoto: Start things off simple and gradually add to it as you progress. Later objectives will make far more use of the dynamic environments."

I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E

I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, but I tried to think of what the Klingon society would be like. The Japanese came to mind, so basically that's what it was, with the Sacred Emperor, the Warlord and so on."

[...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee, Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee, who is much easier to like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, struggling to survive and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E

Fans then therefore debated on {{what they thought of}} the new sound. Sara Ferrer of Orange County Reloaded said the album split the views of fans and critics into [...] "love-it versus hate-it groups". Montgomery expressed similar sentiments, saying the album [...] "alternately thrilled and thinned [...] substantial fanbase with its vast swaths of sonic sprawl (and overall lack of guitar solos)."
