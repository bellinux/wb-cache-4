The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that he is doing the same to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} anxious departure, five buses {{containing}} crowds of ravenous tourist anchovies {{stop at the}} Krusty Krab, its abundance of passengers furiously demanding meals. Unable to satisfy the anchovies' hunger and alarmed by the mob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the unsatisfied crowd. Before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical <b>spatula,</b> which he uses in speedily whipping up bundles of Krabby Patties for the anchovies and satisfying their hunger. After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick orders a Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly-unseen, and audibly manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat.|$|E

SpongeBob then gets nervous and almost reconsiders applying for {{a job at the}} restaurant until his best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, Mr. Eugene Krabs, decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on an impossible errand to purchase a seemingly non-existent high-caliber <b>spatula.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To compare fetal and {{maternal}} morbidities between operative deliveries by long Teissier's <b>spatulas</b> and Minicup vacuum extractor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective {{study was conducted}} from January 2003 to July 2008 at the maternity ward, Besançon teaching hospital. Operative deliveries in term cephalic singleton pregnancies performed by Teissier's <b>spatulas</b> (case group) were compared to previous deliveries by vacuum extractor Minicup (control group). RESULTS: During the study period, 69 operative deliveries by Teissier's <b>spatulas</b> have been performed. No {{significant difference was found}} between the two groups in terms of maternal characteristics. Two third-degree perineal tears occurred following delivery by Teissier's <b>spatulas</b> with no third-degree tear in the vacuum extractor group (p = ns). The episiotomy rate in the Teissier's <b>spatulas</b> group was 15, 9 % compared to 11. 6 % in the vacuum extractor group (p = ns). Duration of operative delivery was significantly shorter in the Teissier's <b>spatulas</b> group (3. 4 min vs 4. 95 min; p = 0. 007). Fetal morbidity was identical in the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study found no significant difference in terms of fetal {{and maternal}} morbidities between operative deliveries by Teissier's <b>spatulas</b> and vacuum extractor. Moreover, as opposed to Thierry's <b>spatulas,</b> the long Tessier <b>spatulas</b> can be adequately used in accordance with patient's wish and practice guidelines recommending a policy of restrictive episiotomy. However, a larger study is needed to confirm these preliminary results...|$|R

25|$|The paste is kept covered {{after it}} has been used, in its {{original}} container (be it plastic or ceramic).

A good paste would produce a clear impression in one go; if the impression is not clear requiring further impressions then it indicates that the paste is either too dry or the cinnabar has been depleted.|$|E
50|$|Kellar Autumn and his {{research}} group have conducted experiments to test and demonstrate this {{ability of the}} gecko. They also use the contact mechanical model to suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt particle to the substrate and those attracting the same particle {{to one or more}} <b>spatulae.</b> In other words, the Van der Waals interaction energy for the particle-wall system requires a sufficiently great number of particle-spatula systems to counterbalance; however, relatively few <b>spatulae</b> can actually attach to a single particle, therefore the contaminant particles tend to attach to the substrate surface rather than the gecko's toe due to this disequilibrium. Figure on the right shows the model of interaction between N <b>spatulas,</b> a dirt particle and a planar wall.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Risk {{factors for}} severe perineal {{lacerations}} are nowadays well-known and they include operative vaginal deliveries and extractions in occiput posterior (OP) positions. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess whether OP position increases the risk for anal sphincter injury when compared with occiput anterior (OA) positions in operative deliveries using Thierry's <b>spatulas.</b> METHODS: Retrospective study of 163 extractions with Thierry's <b>spatulas</b> over a five-year period (January 2000 to December 2005) performed in a general hospital. Singleton cephalic pregnancies at term were studied and the incidence of severe perineal lacerations was noted in deliveries in OP and OA positions. RESULTS: In these 163 cases, the varieties of presentation obtained by vaginal examination were 129 in anterior and 34 in posterior positions. Eleven posterior positions rotated anteriorly on delivery and 23 remained in a posterior position. The OA group (n= 140) and the OP group (n= 23) were constituted. Anal sphincter injury occurred significantly more often in the OP group compared with the OA group (17. 4 % versus 2. 9 %, p= 0. 014) with an odds ratio of 7. 1 (95 % CI 1. 6 - 31). Only one fourth-degree laceration was noted. Within the OP group, the incidence of vaginal lacerations was increased compared to the OA group, but without any significant difference (43. 5 % versus 27. 9 %, p= 0. 20). In a logistic regression model, the OP position was 6. 4 times (95 % CI 1. 3 - 31. 5) more likely to be associated with anal sphincter injury than OA position. The incidence of OP position was 14. 1 % within the whole population studied and Thierry's <b>spatulas</b> permit anterior rotations of occipito posterior presentation in only 32. 4 % of cases. CONCLUSION: The efficiency of Thierry's <b>spatulas</b> is proven. As with forceps and vacuum extractors, extraction with Thierry's <b>spatulas</b> is a risk factor for perineal laceration compared to a spontaneous delivery. In deliveries with <b>spatulas,</b> OP head positions further increase this perineal risk against OA positions. OP positions before fetal extractions do not seem to be an ideal situation for using <b>spatulas,</b> even if an anterior rotation is achieved in one-third of cases...|$|R

50|$|Synthetic setae {{emulate the}} setae {{found on the}} toes of a gecko and {{scientific}} {{research in this area}} is driven towards the development of dry adhesives. Geckos have no difficulty mastering vertical walls and are apparently capable of adhering themselves to just about any surface. The 5-toed feet of a gecko are covered with elastic hairs called setae and the end of these hairs are split into nanoscale structures called <b>spatulae</b> (because of their resemblance to actual <b>spatulas).</b> The sheer abundance and proximity to the surface of these <b>spatulae</b> make it sufficient for van der Waals forces alone to provide the required adhesive strength. Following the discovery of the gecko’s adhesion mechanism in 2002, which is based on van der Waals forces, biomimetic adhesives have become the topic of a major research effort. These developments are poised to yield families of novel adhesive materials with superior properties which are likely to find uses in industries ranging from defense and nanotechnology to healthcare and sport.|$|R
