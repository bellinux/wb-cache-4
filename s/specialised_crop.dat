40|$|This article {{presents}} a multi-temporal uncertainty-based method that incorporates a statistical regression {{model with a}} view to establishing the risk (probability) of land cover changes as a function of a set of environmental and socio-economic driving factors. The morphologic, climatic and socio-economic variables were examined using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Following the analysis, maps indicating the suitability to future changes were generated on the basis of observed transitions. From these maps two possible land use scenarios were built, applying the Markov chain principle. The region of Basilicata, in southern Italy, was selected for the analysis. The results highlight: a) a good inclination to change towards <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> systems, provided there is sufficient water supply; b) that some cropping patterns are not suitable for changes, partly because they are found in a context with severe limitations for alternative uses...|$|E
40|$|This {{study had}} two main {{objective}}s. One {{objective was to}} measure the aggregate impact of climate change on income from all agricultural production systems (crop, livestock and mixed) in Africa and to predict future impacts under various climate scenarios. In addition to measuring economic impacts, the study analysed determinants of farmers’ choices between alternative adaptation measures available to African farmers. The study {{is based on a}} cross-section survey of over 8000 farming households from 11 countries in east, west, north and southern Africa. To achieve the first objective, the cross-section (Ricardian) approach was used to measure the impact of climate change attributes (rainfall and temperature levels) on income from all agricultural production systems (crop, livestock and mixed) in Africa, controlling for other production factors. Based on empirical estimates from the Ricardian model, the study predicts future impacts under various climate scenarios. In addition to estimating impacts on mixed croplivestock farms, the study also measures and compares impacts on <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> and livestock farms. Responses of different production systems are analysed under irrigation and dryland conditions. The response of net revenue from crop and livestock agriculture across various farm types and systems in Africa, to changes in climate variables (i. e. mean rainfall and temperature) is analysed. The analysis controlled for effects of key socio-economic, technology, soil and hydrological factors influencing agricultural production. In addition to measuring impacts on aggregate revenue, the study examined variations in the response of three distinct production systems characterising African agriculture: specialised crop; specialised livestock and mixed crop and livestock systems. Differential impacts of climate change on the studied systems were measured under irrigation and dryland conditions. Results show that net farm revenues are in general negatively affected by warmer and dryer climates. The mixed crop and livestock system predominant in Africa is the most tolerant, whereas <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> production is the most vulnerable to warming and lower rainfall. These results have important policy implications, especially in terms of the suitability of the increasing tendency toward mono-cropping strategies for agricultural development in Africa {{and other parts of the}} developing world, in the light of expected climate changes. Mixed crop and livestock farming and irrigation offered better adaptation options for farmers against further warming and drying predicted under various future climate scenarios. For the second objective, the study employed a multinomial choice model to analyse determinants of farm-level climate adaptation measures in Africa. Results indicate that <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation (mono-cropping) is the most vulnerable agricultural practice in Africa in the face of climate change. Warming, especially in summer, poses the highest climate risk which tends to indicate switching away from mono-cropping towards the use of irrigation, multiple cropping and integration of livestock activities. Increased precipitation reduces the need for irrigation and will be beneficial to most African farming systems, especially in drier areas. Better access to markets, agricultural extension and credit services, technology and farm assets (such as labour, land and capital) are critical enabling factors to enhance the capacity of African farmers to adapt to climate change. Government policies and investment strategies that support the provision of and access to education, markets, credit, and information on climate and adaptation measures, including suitable technological and institutional mechanisms that facilitate climate adaptation, are therefore required for coping with climate change, particularly among poor resource farmers in the dry areas of Africa.

Before direct aids were introduced, there had been periods with decreasing prices for agricultural land and for rented agricultural area in real terms, according to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data base (<b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> farms in 53 regions for 11 years) and EUROSTAT data (B, DK, D-W, F, NL in the period 1975 to 1999). Regression analysis is used to show the relationship between hapremiums, land rental prices and other relevant economic variables, such as land prices, rental share, livestock density, the price index of agricultural products and farm income. The analysis shows increasing price effects due {{to the introduction of}} ha-premiums on prices for agricultural land and on rental prices. Landlords received a share of about 6 % to 18 % of the ha-premiums (depending on the data source). An in-sample simulation, 1999 -continuation scenario, and scenarios of further CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reforms are used for the assessment of the ex-post and ex-ante developments.

30|$|The {{application}} of E.C. Reg. 1782 / 2003 {{at the beginning}} of 2005 brought a new era in the sector. Full decoupling has been imposed by the Greek government for the sheep and goat sector as it was for most of the Greek agriculture sectors, which meant that production-oriented subsidies would have been paid on a 'historic rights' basis, i.e. a comprehensive subsidy was calculated {{on the basis of the}} unitary 2002 headage payment and the farmer's payment rights (calculated as the average of 3 years) and the amount 'frozen' until 2013. This was expected to have positive impacts by favouring the replacement of <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> systems with mixed crop and livestock systems and by returning non-profitable arable land to pasture lands. Sheep and goat farmers who had grazing land in their 'historic records' had to maintain these lands in good condition by grazing (maintaining a density of 1.4 head/ha), while the landless farmers, who used to use 'communal grazing land', had to continue breeding at least 50 % of their animals. The compensatory premium for breeding in the LFAs continued largely unaffected, while some agri-environmental measures (these including extensification and organic farming) were applied sporadically. The implementation of 'cross compliance' rules did not result in many constraints for sheep and goat farmers, except for the animal identification rules, since many traditional farmers were reluctant to enter the system and keep records.|$|E
40|$|Integrated crop-livestock {{systems have}} been shown to improve {{nutrient}} cycling, particularly by re-coupling nitrogen and carbon cycles. Yet the number of mixed crop–livestock farms has been falling steadily in Europe. Integration between crops and livestock at the local level, through exchanges between already specialised farms, is rarely implemented. Given the lack of knowledge on new ways to maintain or to reintegrate crops and livestock from the farm up to the local level, concrete guidelines are needed. In this paper, we developed a transversal analysis of three complementary case studies regarding development of crop–livestock integration at the farm and beyond farm level. To this aim, we reviewed three French case studies in which participatory approaches were used to design scenarios of crop–livestock integration. When crop–livestock integration disappears from the farm level due to labour organisation, exchanges between <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> farmers and livestock farmers is a way to redevelop such integration at the local level. Transversal analysis of case-studies allowed us to suggest guidelines for further research regarding the design of agroecological crop–livestock integration. Articulating options of change at farm level and collective level allows to consider the appropriate level of design and trade-offs between (1) farm and beyond farm level, and (2) social, environmental and economic dimensions Considering these different levels of organisation is needed to identify possible pathways to and policy incentives for integrated crop–livestock systems.

40|$|The {{influence}} on technical efficiency {{of access to}} credit and public support policies is studied for two groups of specialized small farmers in Chile. Using 2004 data, translog stochastic frontier production functions for 109 livestock and 342 crop producers are estimated. Mean technical efficiency is 89 % and 78 % for crop and livestock producers, respectively. Technical efficiency increases with decreasing use of inputs, dependence on on-farm income, farmer education, family size {{and the age of}} the family head. Extension services do not appear to help farms become more efficient, and even reduce efficiency among <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> pro-ducers. The volume of credit increases efficiency in crop production and reduces it in live-stock production. Correspondingly, credit constrained farmers are less efficient in crop pro-duction and more efficient in livestock. These results may reflect the fact that investments in livestock production can involve considerable adjustment costs in the short run. For livestock producers, credit volume and credit constraints are found to be endogenous to technical effi-ciency. A possible explanation is the organisation of public support for small livestock pro-ducers in Chile, which provides lenders with information about individual livestock produc-ers. This might enable lenders to target loans on the basis of efficiency. Correcting for this endogeneity does not lead to qualitatively different results, but does influence point estimates of parameters in the production function and inefficiency models. This highlights the impor-tance of testing for endogeneity in the variables used to model inefficiency effects...|$|E
40|$|Many {{farmers in}} {{tropical}} and temperate countries manage {{a mix of}} crops and animals. In these systems crop residues {{can be used to}} feed the animals and the excreta from the animals as nutrients for the crops. Other forms of mixing take place where grazing under fruit-trees keeps the grass short, where manure from pigs is used to 'feed' fish in a pond or where young animals bred in remote areas are fattened near urban centres with high demands for meat. In addition, inclusion of livestock alters the rate of nutrient turnover, it provides a labour opportunity in slack times for crops and adds value to crop (by-) products. Livestock thus affects the socio-economic and biophysical dynamics of the entire farming system. Indeed, a wide variety of forms and processes in mixed farming are known world-wide. To different degrees they are all essential for the livelihood of farmers and for the production of food and other commodities for cities and export markets. More recently, even highly <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> and livestock systems in developed and developing countries have rediscovered the advantages of mixed farming. Specialised industrial pig and poultry farmers have been banned from densely populated countries such as Singapore, and in Western Europe they are obliged by law to exchange their dung surpluses with crop farmers. Moreover, the essence of many modern organic farming systems lies in the mixing of crops and animals.

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{locations of}} Tell Atchana and Kinet Höyük between the Eastern Mediterranean region, North-Syria and South-Anatolia define {{them as a}} focal point of cultural and economic relations between these regions. One of the aims of this archaeobotanical study, {{which is based on}} the plant macro-remains from Kinet Höyük and Tell Atchana, is to contribute to the knowledge of the economic position of these settlements during the Late Bronze Age. It is of interest under which conditions the crops were grown, which general agricultural techniques were used, (e. g. soil management, fallowing etc.) as well as how and where crop-processing and storage were conducted within both settlements and how they compare to other relevant sites in the area. The main socio-economic question of this archaeobotanical study is whether crops were primarily brought to Tell Atchana and Kinet Höyük from neighbouring regions with trade relations or grown in their immediate vicinities by the inhabitants themselves or farmers from surrounding villages. The environment and its development under anthropogenic influence and natural factors is also focus of this investigation, as it defines the possibilities of cultural developments of Tell Atchana and Kinet Höyük during Late Bronze Age. In order to answer the mentioned questions, 33 samples from Kinet Höyük and 35 samples from Tell Atchana were studied. About 3350 seeds and fruits were identified, counted and grouped into 77 categories, which include plant species or types belonging to 20 families. Statistical analysis indicates that the organisation of agriculture in the stratified society of Tell Atchana, as far as plant production is concerned, is similar to north-eastern Syrian sites. Tell Atchana probably imported surplus food from surrounding villages and supported large-scale, but also small-scale <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> production. In Late Bronze Age Kinet Höyük there is evidence for intensification in large-scale agriculture, with a broad spectrum of crop plants, as a kind of risk-buffering. The spectrum of crops and wild species of Late Bronze Kinet Höyük and Tell Atchana reflects agricultural characteristics of the eastern Mediterranean cultures...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analysed}} how {{climate change}} (CC) has shaped African {{agriculture in the}} past and how it might impact on African farm economies in the future and what adaptation strategies African farmers have adopted to cope with these changes. The analyses covered all key farming systems and agro-climates of Africa in 11 countries in which data were collected from over 10, 000 farm household surveys. Results provided evidence that African agriculture and the welfare of its rural population are vulnerable to CC. The highest risk of future CC damages is associated with <b>specialised</b> <b>crop</b> and livestock farming (mono systems) particularly under dryland conditions in arid and semi-arid regions. This indicates {{how difficult it is to}} achieve an African green revolution under the current high reliance on dryland systems (more than 95 % of the land) given predicted harsh future climates (warmer and dryer projections) for most of the dryland areas in Africa. It will require substantial public and private investments in expanding irrigation and development of crop varieties and animal breeds that are tolerant to heat, water and low fertility stresses, and in building roads and marketing infrastructures that will improve access to critical inputs (e. g., fertiliser) and output trade. This essentially requires mainstreaming climate sensitivity as an integral component of all agricultural and broader economic development planning and policy design. Although the expected damages are large, many farming systems and communities in Africa face serious limiting conditions which reduce their ability to adapt and hence increase their vulnerability. Among the key factors found to constrain African farmers' ability to adopt effective adaptation measures are poor access to information, capital, technology and markets. Policies aimed at promoting farm-level adaptation need to emphasise the critical role of farmers' education; provision of improved climate, production and market information and the means to implement adaptations through affordable credit facilities. Other needed public interventions to help promote adaptation measures and reduce vulnerability include insurance against climate risks to farmers and provision of safety nets.

The empirical estimation reveals that three investment regimes are consistently identified in Germany and Hungary, across asset and support types, and in France for machinery and equipment. More traditional disinvestment-investment type behaviours characterise investment in farm building in France and the UK, across support types, and Italy for both asset classes under coupled payments. The long-run dynamic adjustment of capital stocks is consistently and significantly estimated to be towards a – mostly non-stationary – lower level of capitalisation of the farm analysed. By contrast, the expected largely positive short-run effects of an increase in output prices are often not significant.
