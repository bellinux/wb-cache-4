Objectives: The {{aim of the}} desertation is to record the video clips breaststroke disciplines in category of men on czech swimming Championship 2013 and to record the number of <b>stroke</b> <b>cycles</b> of top swimmers at national, Europien and globe level, based on indirect observation. The observation is made in 50 m, 100 m and 200 m breaststroke. Furthermore, the results from each discipline are compared. Methods: Quantitatification and indirect observation method were used to acquire dates in form {{of the number of}} <b>stroke</b> <b>cycles.</b> Mathematical- statistical method is used to process obtained data. Tables are used to overall assessment. Comparate method was used in numbers of <b>stroke</b> <b>cycles</b> between choosed competitive swimmers. Results: Results represent and compare the numbers of <b>stroke</b> <b>cycles</b> between selected national, European and global level swimmers at 50 m, 100 m and 200 m breaststroke. The measured indicator is the number of strokes. The results show, that the optimal code of the number of strokes, which provide the personal best performance, cannot be built by the results.

The air and fuel leakage, which occurs through the gas exchange, negatively affects {{the efficiency of the}} engine at high speeds and loads. An absolute sealing is assured by direct use of poppet valves, which are kept in fully closed position during the skipped mode. All the components of the mechanism were designed according to the real dimensions of the Anadolu Motor��� gasoline engine and modeled in 3 D by means of CAD software.
