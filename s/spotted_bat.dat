500|$|Before {{the area}} was urbanized, mammals such as bighorn sheep, mule deer, coyote, wolves, beaver, muskrat and jack rabbits would have been seen along the river. A [...] "varmint hunt" [...] was {{organized}} by John D. Lee around 1848, after the arrival of Mormon settlers. The final count of the hunt included [...] "two bears, two wolverines, two wildcats, 783 wolves, 409 foxes, 31 minks, nine eagles, 530 magpies, hawks and owls, and 1,026 ravens." [...] None of the original large mammals is found along the Jordan River today; they have, for the most part, been replaced by raccoons, red foxes and domestic pets. [...] Animals from the Jordan River area found on the Utah Sensitive Species List include the smooth green snake, the western toad, kit fox, <b>spotted</b> <b>bat,</b> and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to feral horses, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge {{is also a}} good place to see other wildlife and plant species. [...] Among the species found there are Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, black bears, blue grouse, cougars, elk, gray wolves, mule deer, ring-necked pheasant, and sage grouse. The Pryor Mountains are also home to the most diverse bat populations in Montana, with 10 species identified (and potentially other species also present). [...] The range is also home to several animals which BLM or the state of Montana considers sensitive to ecological change, such as Baird's sparrow, long-eared myotis (a species of vesper bat), pallid bat, peregrine falcon, <b>spotted</b> <b>bat,</b> Townsend's big-eared bat, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. There are also 15 species of plants on the range which have been granted special status by the state of Montana or the federal government.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, {{the double}} switch {{is a type}} of player substitution, usually {{performed}} by a team while playing defense. The double switch is typically used to make a pitching substitution, while simultaneously placing the incoming pitcher in a more favorable <b>spot</b> in the <b>batting</b> order than was occupied by the outgoing pitcher. (On the assumption that the pitcher will be a poor hitter, the incoming pitcher will generally take the <b>spot</b> in the <b>batting</b> order of a position player who has recently been put out, so as to avoid the pitcher's making a plate appearance {{in the next couple of}} innings.) To perform a double switch (or any other substitution), the ball must be dead.|$|R

50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>bat</b> (Euderma maculatum) is {{a species}} of special concern in Canada. The large-eared black bats were first {{discovered}} in Canada in 1979, with a range restricted to southern British Columbia. These solitary mammals prefer habitats along waterways in regions with hot summers and mild winters, preferring to roost on cliffs. There are fewer than 100 spotted bats in Canada, an insectivore threatened {{by the use of}} pesticides which is also an endangered species in the United States, and it is also protected by the Species at Risk Act and the British Columbia Wildlife Act.|$|E

50|$|This {{difference}} between the leagues (the DH) also affects relievers, {{but not to the}} same degree.
