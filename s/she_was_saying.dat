500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> 'You {{can do whatever you}} put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E
500|$|Within {{twenty minutes}} of Saldívar's surrender, {{she was taken}} to the {{downtown}} police station in Corpus Christi and placed in an interrogation room with investigators Paul and Ray Rivera. Paul Rivera, who had investigated homicides since 1978, informed Saldívar of her right to an attorney, which she waived. When police investigators surrounded Saldívar's truck, she had cried out, [...] "I can't believe I killed my best friend". Within hours, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> the shooting was accidental. Saldívar's bail bond was initially set at $100,000, but District Attorney Carlos Valdez persuaded the presiding judge to raise it to $500,000. When bail was announced, fans asked why the death penalty had not been sought. The Nueces County jail was deluged with death threats and there were public calls for vigilante justice. Some gang members in Texas were reported to have taken up collections to raise the bond for Saldívar so they could kill her when she was released. In prison, she faced more death threats from inmates. The Mexican Mafia, a dominant gang in the Texas penal system, reportedly placed a price on her head and spread the word that anyone who committed the crime would be a hero.|$|E
500|$|Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly said that, unlike Black's {{previous}} song, [...] "My Moment" [...] {{was not so}} bad it's good, and Michelle Woo of OC Weekly described [...] "My Moment" [...] as [...] "a {{lot less}} terrible" [...] than [...] "Friday", making it [...] "less awesome". Many compared the production to that of [...] "Friday". Mike Hale of The New York Times criticized Black's vocals for being [...] "as heavily processed" [...] as they were previously, but said that the tuning had [...] "been done much more artfully", meaning Black sounded [...] "more like a human being." [...] A reviewer for The Huffington Post said, [...] "if you were hoping for [...] "Friday" [...] part two, this certainly isn't it. Gone is the weird nasal, overly auto-tuned voice that made 'Friday' sound like <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> 'fried egg.'" [...] Black herself was called [...] "sweet but very self empowered" [...] by Stransky, and Adrian Chen of Gawker called the track [...] "a 'look-at-me-now' love letter" [...] to all [...] haters". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard saw the song in a similar light; for him, Black [...] "does offer a bit of vitriol to those who wrote her off as a one-hit Internet wonder." ...|$|E

500|$|Tom Burnett {{made several}} {{phone calls to}} his wife {{beginning}} at 09:30:32 from rows24 and 25, though he was assigned a seat in rowfour. Burnett explained that the plane had been hijacked by men claiming to have a bomb. He also said that a passenger had been stabbed with a knife and that he believed the bomb threat was a ruse to control the passengers. During one of Tom Burnett's calls, his wife informed him of {{the attacks on the}} World Trade Center and he replied that the hijackers were [...] "talking about crashing this plane.... Oh my God. It's a suicide mission." [...] He began pumping her for information about the attacks, interrupting her {{from time to time to}} tell the others nearby what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Then he hung up. He ended his last call by saying, [...] "Don't worry, we're going to do something." [...] An unknown flight attendant attempted to contact the United Airlines maintenance facility at 09:32:29. The call lasted 95 seconds, but was not received as it may have been in queue. Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called the maintenance facility at 09:35:40 from row33. She reported the flight had been hijacked by men with knives who were in the cabin and flight deck and had stabbed another flight attendant, possibly Debbie Welsh.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Task Review: Velocity {{decided to}} go for a {{contemporary}} calendar featuring kitten photos despite numerous protests from Jo. However, their pitches were not helped by Nargis, who lost track of what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> even snapping at the buyers, and the calendar received criticism for being irrelevant to the charity and for having the dates printed too small to make usable. Despite these issues, all three retailers made orders. Meanwhile, Invicta decided on a calendar featuring [...] "fun" [...] photos of children dressed up in various costumes. While the calendar's design was criticised, and Mani's early pitches were extremely poor, the team received a large order from one retailer that effectively earned them victory.|$|E

2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{presence}} of her sister-in-law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy. How could she {{go on with}} what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> in Maggie's presence? for <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> something {{that she had never}} said, all these years, to Maggie herself.|$|E
