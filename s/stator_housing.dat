40|$|The {{magnetic}} bearing consists of levitating a shaft {{so that it}} is free to rotate about its axis. The {{magnetic bearing}} has the advantages of being very quiet work and very cleanliness because there is no mechanical friction or lubricants. The shaft has two permanent magnets attached to it. These two magnets determine a straight line rotation axis of the rotor shaft. The magnets are radially levitated and centered within a cavity by a passive permanent magnetic field in the adding <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> assembly. The levitation and centering of the shaft axially is stabilized by a closed loop electronic servo circuit that regulates an electromagnetic field in the <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> that pushes and pulls on the shaft magnets. The rotor weight can be between one gram and forty five thousand, four hundred grams. In 1985, the first magnetic bearing was developed that it had used to applications of gas turbines and other compressors.

5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a <b>housed</b> <b>stator</b> assembly. The <b>housing</b> is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the development and}} study of a finite element model of a hermetic, singlevane compressor and a single-phase alternating current induction motor assembled in a common housing. The manufacturer of this unit is experiencing a high scrap rate due to interference during operation between the stator and rotor of the motor. The rotor shaft of the motor is non-typical because of its cantilever design. The finite element model was first subjected to eigenvalue analysis. This revealed that the interference producing displacements were {{not the result of}} torque application to the rotor at a frequency close to an eigenvalue of the mechanical system. After {{a review of the literature}} and discussions with Electrical Engineering Department faculty possessing extensive motor experience, it was surmised that the physical phenomenon causing the rotor displacement was unbalanced magnetic pull. This phenomenon occurs in the air gap of rotating electric machines due to eccentricity in the air gap. The model was then subjected to simultaneous harmonic force inputs with magnitudes of unity on the rotor and stator surfaces to simulate the presence of unbalanced magnetic pull. It was found that the rotor shaft acts as a cantilever beam while the <b>stator</b> and <b>housing</b> are essentially rigid. The displacements due to these forces were examined and then scaled to develop the motor parameters necessary to produce the radial forces required for stator/rotor interference. Several recommendations were then made regarding possible solutions to the interference problem. Acknowledgement...|$|R

40|$|The {{torque density}} of {{electric}} motors strongly {{depends on the}} performance of the cooling system. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, cooling inherently occurs through self-ventilation by both rotor discs. Nevertheless, an independent cooling system remains necessary for most applications. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, the individual stator cores with concentrated windings are potted in the <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> using an epoxy resin. These epoxy resins are relatively bad thermally conductive, and therefore, limit the heat transfer {{to the surface of the}} machine. Therefore, radially inward heat extraction fins are introduced in this paper. These fins provide an excellent thermal conduction path from the windings to the stator surface, where they can be abducted by conventional cooling techniques such as forced air or water jacket cooling. The focus of this paper is on the study of the radially inward heat extraction fins using thermal finite element modelling as well as experimental validation on a 4 kW axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine stator.

40|$|Abstract—We {{report the}} design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of a rotary micromotor supported on microball bearings. This {{is the first}} demonstration of a rotary micromachine with a robust mechanical support provided by microball-bearing technology. A six-phase bottom-drive variable-capacitance micromotor (φ = 14 mm) is designed and simulated using the finite-element (FE) method. The stator and the rotor are fabricated separately on silicon substrates and assembled with the microballs. Three layers of low-k benzocyclobutene polymer, two layers of gold, and a silicon microball housing are fabricated on the <b>stator.</b> Microball <b>housing</b> and salient structures (poles) are etched in the rotor and are coated with a silicon carbide film that reduces the friction without which the operation was not possible. A top angular velocity of 517 r/min, corresponding to the linear tip velocity of 324 mm/s, is measured at ± 150 -V and 800 -Hz excitation. This is 44 {{times higher than the}} velocity previously demonstrated for linear micromotors supported on the microball bearings. A noncontact method is developed to extract the torque and the bearing coefficient of friction through dynamic response measurements. The torque is indirectly measured to be − 5. 62 ± 0. 5 µN · m at ± 150 -V excitation which is comparable with the FE simulation results predicting − 6. 75 µN · m. The maximum output mechanical power at ± 150 V and 517 r/min was calculated to be 307 µW. The bearing coefficient of friction is measured to be 0. 02 ± 0. 002 which is in good agreement with the previously reported values.

An experimental test faciity was constructed and employed in the testing of a mixed flow marine waterjet rotor, <b>stator</b> and <b>housing</b> set. Full description of the facility and waterjet test procedures are discussed. The pumpset was designed using a coupled Lifting Surface/RANS procedure by Taylor et. al.

Detailed measurements of the pump performance is described including pump curves, tipgap studies, inlet, midstage and outlet velocity and pressure profiles in an axisymmetric inflow. Full accounting for losses including rotor and stator loss profiles as well as a full pumpset energy balance is presented. From the results of the experiment, dominant losses were found near the tip/duct junction casing along with a large and unexpected increase in swirl in this region. Detailed numerical modelling of this pumpset was performed using both a Lifting Surface/RANS procedure and a Lifting Surface/Euler solver. Effects of losses were modelled as well as tipgap effects. Prior work had developed these coupling procedures but the computationally efficient Euler coupling lacked the introduction of loss and drag induced swirl. This loss coupling was added to the model and the analysys results are discussed. Also, a model to align the wakesheet with the local flowfield in the Lifting Surface solver was developed and these results are discussed. by Richard Warren Kimball. Thesis (Ph. D.)

A computer simulation and modelling using finite element analysis for the proposed motor is discussed and used in the motor design development process. Finite element analysis has been used to evaluate the motor structure by performing an algebraic solution of a set of equations, describing an ideal model structure, with a finite number of variables. The established simulation and modelling for ultrasonic motor using finite element analysis enabled to select, the material of the flexural transducer, defining the operating parameters for the motor, determining the principles of motion and proposing an innovative technique to control the direction of motion, by controlling the phase between the two modes of vibrations. This enabled to create two directions of motion from a single vibration bar. A prototype of the proposed motor was fabricated and its characteristics measured.

40|$|A need {{exists for}} miniaturized, rugged, {{low-cost}} high-vacuum systems. Recent advances in sensor technology {{have led to}} the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other analytical instruments such as scanning electron microscopes. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was developed based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture molecular drag pump (MDP). The MDP is enabled by a miniature, very-high-speed (200, 000 rpm), rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. The key advantages of the pump are reduced cost and improved ruggedness compared to other mechanical hig-hvacuum pumps. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate rotor and stator blades for other pump designs. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor will likely not be necessary. Finally, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three over competing designs. The new pump forms the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications and on spacecraft and planetary landers. The MDP achieves high vacuum coupled to a ruggedized diaphragm rough pump. Instead of the relatively complicated rotor and stator blades used in turbomolecular pumps, the rotor in the MDP consists of a simple, smooth cylinder of aluminum.

40|$|Current {{designs for}} {{electric}} motors use a housing {{that acts as}} both a structural support and {{as a method of}} cooling the stator and rotor. This approach to cooling is not as effective as possible because heat must flow from the rotor and <b>stator</b> through the <b>housing</b> to the cooling media. Because the housing must contain the coolant, it is also larger, heavier, and more expensive than necessary. This project develops a motor that uses a direct lamination cooling (DLC) system, passing coolant directly through the stator and eliminating the need for bulky housing, thereby improving heat transfer. Motor size could be reduced by up to 30 - 40 %, mass by up to 20 - 30 %, and cost by up to 30 %. Phase I demonstrated that reliable lamination-to-lamination seals and reliable stack-to-manifold seals can be achieved using the methods identified. The addition of the selected sealants adds only slightly to the thermal resistance and pressure drop compared with unsealed counterparts. Phase II builds electric motors and inductors using the DLC method, obtain comparative performance data on the effectiveness of the method, and then obtain operational use data on these components through long term testing in a representative environment. The long-term testing will ensure that real world aspects of motor and inductor operation (including vibration, temperature cycling, and the presence of electrical and magnetic fields) do not degrade the seals such that leaking occurs or that the thermal performance degrades...|$|R

The aim is to offer one range of machines for marine applications such as propulsion, anchor and winches, and a separate range for industrial applications. In this regard, {{there is a need to}} identify possibilities for improvement of the cooling system. A study of competitors&# 146; cooling solutions revealed that cooling methods of the International Cooling (IC) code IC 71 W, IC 81 W, IC 01 and IC 411 occurred most frequently in marine applications. The machine, of which the design of the new range will be based, is a newly build 1, 4 MW unit, commissioned by W&# 228;rtsil&# 228;. This machine was tested to verify the performance characteristics of both machine and cooling system, which consists of combined air- and water-cooling. A surrounding water jacket primarily cools the <b>stator</b> and <b>housing,</b> representing 88 % of the total losses. The remaining 12 % loss from rotor, magnets and support is air-cooled by external fans. Losses were estimated to be 44, 1 kW and tests verified these estimations by recording actual losses of 43, 3 kW. The potential of replacing the external fans with a shaft-driven centrifugal fan was mapped out for five machines, representing the range project. A model of each machine was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 3 b. These models were used to obtain a system resistance curve, which was compared to the performance of centrifugal fans in the market. A single shaft-driven fan proved to be an impossible solution. Long active parts of 900 - 1200 mm required higher static pressure than the shaft speeds of 100 - 600 rpm could supply. Calculations and simulations stated an average deviation from required to obtainable pressure of 800 % for the five machines. Two parallel shaft-driven fans proved to be a theoretical option for machines with speed of 400 - 600 rpm. Theoretical heat transfer to the cooling air was calculated for comparative purposes. This indicated overcooling of close to 200 % for the simplified design of the W&# 228;rtsil&# 228; machine and between 20 - 120 % overcooling for the estimated design of the range project.

During the current reporting period, a shakedown of the system was completed. Several problems were encountered with the progressive cavity pump used to circulate the wax/catalyst slurry though the cross-flow filter element and reactor. During the activation of the catalyst with elevated temperature (> 270 C) the elastomer pump stator released sulfur thereby totally deactivating the iron-based catalyst. Difficulties in maintaining an acceptable leak rate from the pump seal and <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> were also encountered.

40|$|New {{challenges}} arise for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) engineers when {{electric motors}} are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). The noise signature from an electric traction motor {{is characterized by}} speed-dependent high frequency tonal components due to electro-magnetic excitation. Despite the relatively low overall levels, those tonal components can be prominent and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. With the rapid increase of various types of hybrid/electric vehicles (EV), new methods are required to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The objective of this thesis was to explore the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate experimental methods for assessment of noise transmission. The thesis is based upon seven papers. Four of the papers are oriented around tools and techniques for sound quality assessments of EV-noise. Due to the specific character, there is a proven need for engineers to identify relevant psycho-acoustic metrics for quantifying the subjective perceptions of an accelerating EV. The relationship between the metric prominence ratio (PR) and perceived annoyance was explored and requirement criteria were proposed. PR is appropriate for quantifying individual tonal components, well frequency separated from each other. For more complex sounds, e. g. with multiple proximate prominent tones, the suitability of this metric is questioned. Therefore, the harmonic content {{of a large number}} of EVs on the market was examined in order to bring further facts to the on-going discussion on sound quality quantification of EV specific noise. Furthermore, the assessment environment’s role as well as the impact of experiencing the sound sensation in the real environment for sound quality evaluations were studied. Finally, perception of the tonal components related to different DC/AC conversion techniques including randomized pulse-width modulation was explored. The main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise were studied. The acoustic transfer functions’ (ATF) spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise was investigated for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. ATFs and surface velocities are also central for the presented in-situ method for determination of radiated sound power from the <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> due to a dominant order. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for estimation of the radiation efficiency was derived. The two papers highlight the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> which enables sound power to be used as an acoustic source characterization, which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers. The final contribution of methods for handling EV-specific noise concerns structure-borne sound. The method of in-situ estimation of blocked forces, a theoretically independent source characterization, is evaluated for transfer path analysis (TPA) of a double isolated electric rear axle drive. The method has two main advantages; it is substantially faster compared to the conventional TPA method and the blocked forces allow for accurate prediction of the acoustic response when the same source is being integrated with a different receiving structure. The prerequisite for the second is that the source activity remains invariant and this was further studied.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{calculation}} of the microwave field distribution in a magic angle spinning (MAS) probe utilized in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments. The microwave magnetic field (B[subscript 1 S]) profile was obtained from simulations performed with the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software suite, using a model that includes the launching antenna, the outer Kel-F <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> coated with Ag, the RF coil, and the 4 mm diameter sapphire rotor containing the sample. The predicted average B[subscript 1 S] field is 13 μT/W[superscript 1 / 2], where S denotes the electron spin. For a routinely achievable input power of 5 W the corresponding value is γ[subscript S]B[subscript 1 S] = 0. 84 MHz. The calculations provide insights into the coupling of the microwave power to the sample, including reflections from the RF coil and diffraction of the power transmitted through the coil. The variation of enhancement with rotor wall thickness was also successfully simulated. A second, simplified calculation was performed using a single pass model based on Gaussian beam propagation and Fresnel diffraction. This model provided additional physical insight and was in good agreement with the full HFSS simulation. These calculations indicate approaches to increasing the coupling of the microwave power to the sample, {{including the use of}} a converging lens and fine adjustment of the spacing of the windings of the RF coil. The present results should prove useful in optimizing the coupling of microwave power to the sample in future DNP experiments. Finally, the results of the simulation were used to predict the cross effect DNP enhancement (ϵ) vs. ω[subscript 1 S]/(2 π) for a sample of [superscript 13]C-urea dissolved in a 60 : 40 glycerol/water mixture containing the polarizing agent TOTAPOL; very good agreement was obtained between theory and experiment.

40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} ultrasonic actuator with multidegree {{of freedom}} for autonomous vehicle guidance industrial applications {{is presented in}} this paper. The actuator is aiming to increase the visual spotlight angle of digital visual data capture transducer. It consists of three main parts, the <b>stator,</b> rotor and <b>housing</b> unit. The <b>stator</b> is a piezoelectric ring made from S 42 piezoelectric ceramics material, bonded to three electrodes made from a material that has a close Characteristics to the S 42. The rotor is a ball made from stainless steel materials. The actuator working principles is based on creating micro elliptical motions of surface points, generated by superposition of longitudinal and bending vibration modes, of oscillating structures. Transferring this motion from flexible ring transducer through the three electrodes, to the attached rotor, create 3 D motions. The actuator Design, structures, working principles and finite element analysis are discussed in this paper. A prototype of the actuator was fabricated and its characteristics measured. Experimental tests showed {{the ability of the}} developed prototype to provide multidegree of freedom with typical speed of movement equal to 35 rpm, a resolution of less than 5 μm and maximum load of 3. 5 Newton. These characteristics illustrated the potential of the developed smart actuator, to gear the spotlight angle of digital visual data capture transducers and possible improvement that such micro-actuator technology could bring to the autonomous vehicle guidance and machine vision industrial applications. Furthermore research are still undertaken to develop a universal control prototype, integrate the actuator with an infrared sensor, visual data capture digital transducers and obtain the trajectory of motion control algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} the basic prerequisites {{for the creation}} of an automated monitoring system for oil pumps of high-voltage transformers. This {{is due to the fact}} that the long operation of oil pumps results in deterioration and destruction of bearings, rubbing of the rotor, breakage and damage to the impeller, leakage, etc., which inevitably causes a significant decrease in the insulating properties of the transformer oil and leads to expenditures for its further recovery. False triggerings of gas protection sometimes occur. Continuous operation of the electric motor also requires additional equipment to protect the motor itself from various emergency situations, such as a short in the <b>stator</b> winding, a <b>housing</b> breakdown, an incomplete phase mode, etc. The use of stationary systems provides: diagnosing defects at an early stage of their development, increasing the reliability and longevity of the equipment components, increasing the overhaul period, decreasing the number of emergency stops, and adjusting the schedule of preventative maintenance. The basic principles of identification of the damaged part of the oil pump are given, the hardware and algorithmic solutions are considered in the work. The full-scale tests of the model sample on the power transformer of the high-voltage substation confirmed the assumption of the possibility of detecting the damaged unit separating it from the rest connected in one mechanical structure. A detailed analysis of the operation of each of the units is carried out by means of the general substation switchboard and displayed as graphs, diagrams and text messages. When the limit values of vibration are reached, faults in the operation of the unit are detected, the overlimit current values, a warning alarm is activated, and the command to disconnect the damaged unit is issued. The optimal solution for the organization of the information collection system using the principle of sensor networks, but combined via Wi-Fi technology, is give...|$|R
40|$|An {{incompressible}} air-flow {{model for}} a fluid film bearing is derived using a modified Reynolds equation for the thin-film dynamics of a rapidly rotating rotor and stator. Mathematical and numerical modelling {{is applied to the}} coupled processes of the fluid flow through the bearing and the axial motion of the rotor and stator. This work focuses on extending previous studies to incorporate the dynamics of a coned rotor operating at high speeds and an incompressible lubrication approximation. The dynamics of fully coupled, unsteady bearing motion and associated forcing of the rotor with axial periodic oscillations are studied. The axial motion of the stator is modelled as a spring–mass–damper system that responds to the rotor displacement through the film dynamics. In order to solve the modified Reynolds equation and stator equation simultaneously, a new variable is introduced, namely the time-dependent face clearance. This leads to explicit analytical expressions for the pressure and force in terms of the face clearance and the stator equation is transformed to a non-linear, second-order, non-autonomous, ordinary differential equation for the face clearance. Applying a transient solver gives solutions settling down to a stable periodic behaviour which motivates seeking a solver for periodic solutions. A Fourier spectral collocation scheme is derived to compute the periodic time-dependent face clearance. Both solvers have matching periodic solutions of O(1) with an absolute error of order of magnitude 10 − 5. The dynamics of the unsteady bearing are examined for a range of pressure gradients and configurations including an asymptotic investigation of small face clearance associated with a start-up transient. Results are provided relating to changes in the width of the bearing, strength of the spring holding <b>stator</b> to its <b>housing,</b> damping of the stator and strength of the force coupling and rotor mass. The dynamics of the bearing are also investigated relative to values of key system parameters including the coning of the rotor, rotation speed and value of the bearing squeeze number. A parameter investigation is undertaken to highlight ideal bearing configurations to maximize the load-carrying capacity, fluid stiffness and damping...|$|R
40|$|Static, dynamic, {{and thermal}} {{characteristics}} (measured and predicted) are presented for a 4 -pad, spherical-seat, TPJB with 0. 5 pivot offset, 0. 6 L/D, 101. 6 mm nominal diameter, and 0. 3 preload in the LBP orientation. One bearing is tested four separate {{times in the}} following four different lubrication configurations: (1) flooded single-orifice (SO) at the bearing shell, (2) evacuated leading edge groove (LEG), (3) evacuated spray-bar blocker (SBB), and (4) evacuated spray-bar (SB). The LEG, SBB, and SB are all considered methods of ?directed lubrication?. These methods rely on lubrication injected directly to the pad/rotor interface. The same set of pads is used for every test to maintain clearance and preload; each method of lubrication is added as an assembly to the bearing. Test conditions include surface speeds and unit loads up to 85 m/s and 2. 9 MPa respectively. Static data includes measured bearing clearances prior to operation (cold) and immediately after operation (hot), rotor-bearing eccentricities and attitude angles, and {{a new approach to}} locating the hot center of a bearing. Dynamic data includes: (1) impedance values calculated from measured accelerations, displacements, and excitation forces; and (2) four sets (one set for each bearing configuration) of direct and cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients derived from measurements and fit to a frequency independent KCM model. Thermal data include measured temperatures from sixteen bearing thermocouples along with inlet, outlet, <b>stator</b> <b>housing,</b> and ambient thermocouples. Twelve of the bearing thermocouples are embedded in the babbitt layer of the pads while the remaining four are oriented at the leading and trailing edge of the loaded pads exposed to the lubricant. Bearing thermocouples provide a circumferential and axial temperature gradient. The pivot stiffness (pad and pivot in series) is measured and incorporated into predictions. Measured static, dynamic, and thermal values are compared to predictions from XL_TPJB, a computer code developed at the Texas A&M University Turbomachinery Lab for predicting bearing performance. Measurements show significant cross-coupled stiffness terms with opposite signs and magnitudes that are 20 - 50 % of the direct terms, a max axial temperature gradient of 9. 6 ?C, and attitude angles as high as 29 ?; all of these indicate that the tilt motion of the pad may be impeded by friction between the spherical pivot and the pad. Temperature measurements show directed lubrication, coupled with an evacuated bearing housing, reduces max bearing temperatures up to 13. 9 ?C for the LEG, 10. 2 ?C for the SBB, and 12. 8 ?C for the SB. Although the SB and SBB reduce the max bearing temperature as intended, they can also cause an increase in temperatures at the leading and trailing edges of the loaded pads. The LEG typically reduced temperatures at all locations. Compared to the base case of the flooded SO, directed lubrication reduces the max bearing temperature. Additionally, the dynamics of the system can also be significantly impacted. Using directed lubrication can reduce direct stiffness by up to 18 % for the LEG, 25 % for the SBB, and 20 % for the SB. Similarly, the direct damping can be reduced by up to 24 % for the LEG, 45 % for the SBB, and 34 % for the SB...|$|E
40|$|Complete vehicle, {{system and}} {{component}} target setting for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) are important activities within automotive product development. New challenges arise when electric motors are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). Although the electric powertrain is generally quieter than ICEs, the sound character however {{is completely different}} and necessarily not more preferable. The noise signature from an electric traction motor is characterized by speed-dependent high frequency tonal components from the dominating electro-magnetic harmonics, covering a wide rpm-range. With relatively low levels of broad band masking noise from tires and wind, the tonal components can be accented in a large frequency range and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. Methods for good practice of NVH development work for traditional vehicles have been established and refined during the last decades. With the rapid increase of various types of electric powertrain-equipped low emission vehicles, new methodology is {{required in order to}} understand and fulfill expectations on these unaccustomed vehicle-acoustic phenomena. The objective with this thesis was to investigate the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate methods for assessment of noise transmission. The findings aim to support the complete vehicle, system and component target setting processes to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The thesis is based upon four papers. The first two papers address the human perception of the sound from the electric powertrain during driving. In Paper 1, the evaluation methodology of electric powertrain sound quality was investigated. It was concluded that the mean ratings of a specific acceleration sound stimulus was judged similarly in two laboratory test environments (listening room and “sound car” respectively) as during on-road driving. Further, with lower level of high frequency (> 1 kHz) tonal components, the overall satisfaction and annoyance ratings were improved. The annoyance due to tonal components, stationary as well as speed-dependent, was further studied in Paper 2. The psycho-acoustic metric prominence ratio (PR) was used to quantify the tone levels relative to the adjacent background noise. It was found that for PR-levels below 3 dB, the perceived annoyance was similar independent of frequency range. Increased PR-level provided higher probability of detecting the tones and the perceived annoyance was significantly increased compared to PR< 3 dB for tones above 2. 5 kHz. The findings from Paper 1 and 2 provide foundation for complete vehicle interior acoustic target specification. The following two papers (Paper 3 and 4) focus on the main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise. Paper 3 has emphasis on the experimental determination of acoustic transfer functions (ATFs) between the car’s interior to multiple positions located on the stator shell surface of an electric rear axle drive. It addresses the ATFs’ spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. A reciprocal relation was assumed; therefore the measured ATFs could be used to inversely reproduce the sound transmission from the stator shell to the interior. ATFs and surface velocities are also central in Paper 4, where a method for in-situ determination of radiated sound power from a stator shell was presented and validated. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for the radiation efficiency was estimated. Paper 3 and 4 highlights the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the <b>stator</b> <b>housing</b> which enables sound power as an acoustic source characterization which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers.

40|$|A {{parts of}} the {{contemporary}} rotary compressors are supported as by revolving crankshaft (rotor, roller, etc.), so by the <b>housing</b> (<b>stator,</b> pump, suction accumulator, etc.). Such dual supporting structure complicates assembly of a compressor due to the necessity of precision axial and radial positioning of the pump parts, motor rotor and stator. Developed novel rotary compressor provides a unitary assembly, in which a rotor of the driver -external rotor electric motor, is integrated with concentrically situated pump and rotatably arranged on stationary crankshaft. Stationary crankshaft is fixedly connected to the hermetic housing and supports as the fixed to it motor stator, so the rotor block and the piston block revolving around it. The single structure supporting the motor stator, the rotor block, the piston block and housing simplifies compressor assembly, and allows precision, reliable setting of the parts due to the common single reference - axial line. The piston block and the rotor block have only one line rolling contact, where tangential velocities of blocks are unidirectional and equal in magnitude. It means that the sliding frictional losses at the line contact are minimal. The frictional losses between the rotor blocks radial surfaces and facing surfaces of the piston block heads are also minimal due to the low relative rubbing speed between synchronously revolving in one direction contacting surfaces. Suction system of the novel rotary compressor excluded direct delivery of the refrigerant to the suction chamber by positioning a suction input cavity and a motor cavity in between the suction intake located {{at the top of}} the housing and suction port inlet {{at the top of the}} motor cavity. The arrangement of a refrigerant delivery eliminates external accumulator, increases the liquid refrigerant storage capacity and provides cooling of the compressor motor during and after its duty cycle. The vapor will be delivered substantially free of liquid refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged) due to the action of the impeller positioned in the motor cavity. The rotation of the piston block is due to the distributed forces which have been transmitted from an external rotor of the motor through the direct, no sliding line contact between both blocks and through a mechanical link – vane, which is rigidly fixed in the piston block wall. Another advantage of the novel rotary compressor is that the discharge gas will be tangentially ejected in form of one or more high-speed jets in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation. It creates a reaction forces acting in the direction of rotation and added to the forces revolving the piston block. The design modifications described above, employment of an external rotor motor as a driver, elimination of the roller, reciprocating movement of the vane, vane spring, and external accumulator, utilization of new developed tubular discharge valve improve performance of novel rotary compressor, make it compact, (smaller package space), reliable, and reduce manufacturing cost. *) Dreiman N.
