5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each instar becoming {{larger and}} more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.|$|E

25|$|The Brazilian {{public health}} system, the Unified Health System (SUS), is managed and {{provided}} by {{all levels of}} government, being the largest system of this type in the world. On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role. Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens {{of the country for}} free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area.

25|$|The chicks hatch after 15–16 days; {{they are}} {{initially}} hairless, save for some grey {{down on the}} back, and have dark skin. They start to grow feathers 5 days or so after hatching, starting with the remiges; the rectrices begin to emerge about 3 days later. The young are fed 1-2 times per hour on average, and the female <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> half of the day brooding and feeding her offspring, {{and the other half}} flying around and feeding. The young fledge after 22–24 days but still return to the nest to sleep and be brooded for some more days; they are independent some 2–3 weeks after fledging. Two broods may be raised subsequently, sometimes reusing the nest; due to the prolonged breeding season, three broods might be raised per year in theory, but this does not seem to happen. The species first breeds at 1–2 years of age.|$|E

As anticipated by the M-shape in Sect.  5.1, the two time windows mostly used are 10 – 12 and 16 – 18, but there are also some collective footprints in “unusual” time windows, e.g. (39) and (40).|$|R

25|$|Satellites Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 3 fly in {{geosynchronous}} (not geostationary) Tundra orbits. Like the geostationary orbit, {{the tundra}} orbit has {{a period of}} 23 hours, 56 minutes (one sidereal day). Unlike the geostationary orbit, the tundra orbit is elliptical, not circular, and is inclined {{with respect to the}} equator rather than orbiting directly over it. The eccentric orbit ensures that each satellite <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> 16 hours of each day high over the continental United States. At least one satellite is always visible, with another often visible as well. The orbit's high inclination places apogee just west of Hudson Bay in Canada, providing a much higher elevation angle for most of the country than is possible from a geostationary orbit. This reduces blockage from tall buildings in urban areas, allowing a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM, which uses geostationary orbits.|$|E
25|$|The {{ontogeny}} {{of sleep}} {{is the study}} of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human babies have 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of NREM sleep on an average. The percentage of time spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of postnatal development, there is a marked reduction in percentage of hours spent in REM sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> 6–7 hours in NREM sleep and only about an hour in REM sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies.|$|E

500|$|In the August 24, 2005 edition, the Marquette Mining Journal [...] {{reported}} that the Marquette County Board and the County Road Commission were negotiating with MDOT to transfer the jurisdiction of Marquette County Road480 to the state. Several routing options have been discussed, though all would make CR480 a part of M-28. Cost was the primary reason given behind rerouting M-28 along CR480. [...] "The road commission receives about $50,000 a year in state gas tax money but <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> $100,000 to maintain CR480 because of the type and volume of traffic it receives." [...] Handing CR480 over to the state would shift the maintenance costs to the state, as well.|$|E
500|$|The whale {{routinely}} dives to {{depths of}} more than [...] where it executes an average of four [...] "lunges", to accumulate krill. Each gulp provides the whale with approximately [...] of food. One whale can consume up to [...] of food a day, leading scientists {{to conclude that the}} whale <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> three hours a day feeding to meet its energy requirements, roughly the same as humans. If prey patches are not sufficiently dense, or are located too deep in the water, the whale has to spend a larger portion of its day searching for food. One hunting technique is to circle schools of fish at high speed, frightening the fish into a tight ball, then turning on its side before engulfing the massed prey.|$|E
500|$|The {{lesser kudu}} is mainly active {{at night and}} during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense {{thickets}} just after the sunrise. It can camouflage so well in such dense vegetation that only its ears and tail can indicate its presence. The midday is spent in rest and rumination in shaded areas. The animal <b>spends</b> <b>about</b> 35% of daytime foraging, 36% standing and lying, and 29% in roaming. As the thinnest tragelaphine, the lesser kudu can move through dense vegetation with ease. The lesser kudu is a shy and wary animal. When alarmed, the animal will stand motionless, confirming any danger. If it senses any approaching predator, it will give out a short sharp bark, similar to the bushbuck's. The lesser kudu would then make multiple leaps of up to [...] height with an upraised tail. If captured by the predator, the victim gives a loud bleat.|$|E
