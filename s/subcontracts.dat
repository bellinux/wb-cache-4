40|$|We {{assemble}} a new dataset to empirically investigate <b>subcontracting</b> in Italian public procurement. We use {{provisions of the}} pre-qualication system to disentangle two types of <b>subcontracting.</b> Under the provisions of this system, bidders in the auctions that award public contracts can be classied as either partially or fully qualied to execute the tendered project. Partially qualied bidders are required to find qualied subcontractors to execute {{part of the work}} (i. e. legally required <b>subcontracting),</b> while fully qualied bidders can freely choose whether to <b>subcontract</b> (i. e. voluntary <b>subcontracting).</b> We capture the effect of the terms of the <b>subcontract</b> on the firms' bids. We find that firms that <b>subcontract</b> by choice offer, on average, higher rebates (i. e., lower prices) than firms that are legally required to outsource. This result, which holds true after controlling for auction characteristics, firm fixed-effects, and <b>subcontracting</b> characteristics, indicates that firms discount their potential <b>subcontracting</b> position when they bid on rebates.

40|$|Companies {{that produce}} a high variety of {{customised}} products often suffer from large fluctuations in demand. <b>Subcontracting</b> {{can be an}} important means of overcoming resulting capacity shortages during high demand periods. A set of effective <b>subcontracting</b> rules, for determining which jobs to <b>subcontract</b> and which to produce internally, has recently been presented in the literature for this type of company. But evaluations of these rules have assumed subcontractor capacity is infinite. This study examines the impact of limited subcontractor capacity on the performance of the three best-performing <b>subcontracting</b> rules for make-to-order companies using a simulation model of an assembly job shop. Limiting subcontractor capacity inhibits the ability of a <b>subcontracting</b> rule to protect the internal shop from surges in demand, which negatively affects performance. However, significant performance differences between the rules evaluated are maintained, which underlines the importance of choosing the right <b>subcontracting</b> rule. Further analysis reveals that a limit on the work that can be <b>subcontracted</b> leads to less work being <b>subcontracted</b> more often, which requires adequate response by management. Meanwhile, the assumption of infinite capacity results in sporadically <b>subcontracting</b> a large amount of work. The results have important implications for future research and practice...|$|R
