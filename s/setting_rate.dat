50|$|The driven region, {{also called}} the {{propeller}} region, is the region {{at the end of}} the blades. Normally, it consists of about 30 percent of the radius. It is the driven region that produces the most drag. The overall result is a deceleration in the rotation of the blade. The driving region, or autorotative region, normally lies between 25 and 70 percent of the blade radius, which produces the forces needed to turn the blades during autorotation. Total aerodynamic force in the driving region is inclined slightly forward of the axis of rotation, producing a continual acceleration force. This inclination supplies thrust, which tends to accelerate the rotation of the blade. Driving region size varies with blade pitch <b>setting,</b> <b>rate</b> of descent, and rotor rotational speed.|$|E
40|$|Seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of rice grain yield. To date, only several genes regulating <b>setting</b> <b>rate</b> have been identified in plant. In this study, we showed that laccase- 13 (OsLAC 13), a member of laccase family genes which are known for their roles in modulating phenylpropanoid pathway and secondary lignification in cell wall, exerts a regulatory function in rice seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate.</b> OsLAC 13 expressed in anthers and promotes hydrogen peroxide production both in vitro and in the filaments and anther connectives. Knock-out of OsLAC 13 showed significantly increased seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate,</b> while overexpression of this gene exhibited induced mitochondrial damage and suppressed sugar transportation in anthers, which in turn affected seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate.</b> OsLAC 13 also induced H 2 O 2 production and mitochondrial damage in the root tip cells which caused the lethal phenotype. We also showed that high abundant of OsmiR 397, the suppressor of OsLAC 13 mRNA, increased the seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate</b> of rice plants, and restrains H 2 O 2 accumulation in roots during oxidative stress. Our results suggested a novel regulatory role of OsLAC 13 gene in regulating seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate</b> by affecting H 2 O 2 dynamics and mitochondrial integrity in rice...|$|E

30|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{is a major}} {{staple food}} {{for more than a}} half of the world population, mainly in Asia. Enhancing the {{production}} of rice will require improvements of the major yield components, such as the number of panicles per plant, the number of spikelets per panicle, the seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate,</b> and the weight of each grain. Furthermore, these improvements must maintain the balance of yield-related traits; for example, inordinate tillering often decreases the grain yield per plant, because late-producing, infertile tillers compete for resources with the main, fertile shoot, thus decreasing spikelet fertility or seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate</b> (Liu et al. 2013).|$|E

30|$|Our further {{phenotypic}} characterization {{showed that}} many agronomic traits related to yield and yield components were lower in HNIL(H 143) {{compared with the}} EL 1 HNIL(M 23). Especially, the seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly reduced, leading to a reduction of grain yield in HNIL(H 143), suggesting that the HNIL(H 143) el 1 allele affects yield and yield components (Fig.  4). The decrease of seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate</b> was also found in H 143 and ZH 11 (el 1), indicating that the el 1 mutation negatively affects spikelet fertility, because of low pollen viability (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, Additional file 2 : Figure S 2, Additional file 5 : Figure S 5 and Additional file 6 : Figure S 6). Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} a loss of function in EL 1 /CKI decreases SLR 1 activity and stability, inducing a constitutive GA response like the rice slr 1 - 1 mutants (Ikeda et al. 2001; Murray et al. 2003; Dai and Xue 2010).

40|$|Abstract: Large-panicle rice cultivars {{often fail}} to reach their yield {{potential}} due to the poor grain filling of inferior spikelets (IS). Thus, {{it is important to}} determine the causes of poor IS grain filling. In this study, we attempted to identify whether inferior grain filling of large panicles is restricted by superior spikelets (SS) and their physiological mechanism. SS were removed from two homozygous japonica rice strains (W 1844 and WJ 165) during flowering in an attempt to force photosynthate transport to the IS. We measured the effects of SS removal on seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate,</b> grain weight, grain filling rate, sucrose content, as well as hormone levels, activities of key enzymes, and expression of genes involved in sucrose to starch metabolism in rice IS during grain filling. The results showed that SS removal improved IS grain filling by increasing the seed <b>setting</b> <b>rate,</b> grain weight, sucrose content, and hormone levels. SS removal also enhanced the activities of key enzymes and the expression levels of genes involved in sucrose to starch metabolism. These results suggest that sucrose and several hormones act as signal substances and {{play a vital role in}} grain filling by regulating enzyme activities and gene expression. Therefore, IS grain filling is restricted by SS, which limit assimilate supply and plant hormones, leading to poor grain filling of IS...|$|E
