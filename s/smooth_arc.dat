40|$|A thrackle is {{a drawing}} of a simple graph on the plane, where each edge is drawn as a <b>smooth</b> <b>arc</b> with {{distinct}} end-points, and every two arcs have exactly one common point, at which they have distinct tangents. Conway, who coined the term thrackle, conjectured {{that there is no}} thrackle with more edges than vertices – a question which is still unsolved. A full thrackle is one with n vertices and n edges, and it is called non-extensible, if it cannot be a subthrackle of a counterexample to Conway’s conjecture on n vertices. We define the notion of incidence type for a thrackle, which is the sequence of degrees of all vertices in increasing order. We introduce three reduction operations that can be applied to full subthrackles of thrackles. These reductions enable us to rule out the extensibility of many infinite series of incidence types of full thrackles. After defining the 1 - 2 - 3 group, we reduce Conway’s conjecture to the problem of proving that thrackles from the 1 - 2 - 3 group are not extensible.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} measure the ability of an astronaut to determine the altitude of his spacecraft above the lunar surface by purely visual means. Two techniques were used: one consisted of matching calibrated curved arcs to the projected horizon curvature, and the other consisted of measuring the visual arc subtended by a known sur-face feature. The slides used for projection were photographs of a relief map of the lunar surface. A second set of slides with a <b>smooth</b> <b>arc</b> for the horizon was used in order to evaluate the effect of horizon irregularity. For the limited field of view used (about 40 ') in the horizon-arc matching technique, the average errors for these measurements were as large as 36 miles (58 km) and the standard deviation was about 28 miles (45 km). Repeating the slides a second time or using the smooth-arc slides decreased the error but did not seriously affect the standard deviation. The results indicate that a learning process is involved and that features on the horizon do influence the altitude estimations. The surface-feature technique, when the surface feature was viewed from directly above, seemed to be considerably more accurate for determining altitude than the horizon-matching technique...|$|E

40|$|Background: Intra-articular distal radial {{fractures}} {{are frequently}} {{accompanied by a}} scapholunate interosseous ligament injury, which may adversely affect the outcomes. Arthroscopy may not be appropriate as a first-line evaluation method to diagnose these injuries because of time, expense, and availability issues. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of the modified carpal stretch test for screening for scapholunate interosseous ligament injuries in patients with an intra-articular distal radial fracture. Methods: The carpal stretch test is a radiographic evaluation in which disruption of the <b>smooth</b> <b>arc</b> of the proximal carpal row joint line indicates a lack of integrity of the scapholunate interosseous ligament. We modified the original carpal stretch test and prospectively performed the modified test on forty-eight patients with a total of forty-nine unstable intra-articular distal radial fractures. With the patient under anesthesia, the injured wrist was evaluated with themodified carpal stretch test with fluoroscopy. The wrist was then examined arthroscopically to classify the scapholunate interosseous ligament injury. Three observers independently determined whether there was disruption of the proximal carpal row joint line (Gilula’s arc II), used as an indicator of a grade-III or IV scapholunate interosseous ligament tear, on fluoroscopic images. The fluoroscopic results were compared with the arthroscopic findings. Results: The average sensitivity of the modified carpal stretch test was 78 %, the average specificity was 72 %, the average positive predictive value was 60 %, the average negative predictive value was 87 %, and the average accuracy wa...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} geometric algorithm for conic spline curve fitting and fairing through conic arc scaling. Given {{a set of}} planar points, we first construct a tangent continuous conic spline by interpolating the points with a quadratic Bézier spline curve or fitting the data with a <b>smooth</b> <b>arc</b> spline. The arc spline can be represented as a piecewise quadratic rational Bézier spline curve. For parts of the G 1 conic spline without an inflection, we can obtain a curvature continuous conic spline by adjusting the tangent direction at the joint point and scaling the weights for every two adjacent rational Bézier curves. The unwanted curvature extrema within conic segments or at some joint points can be removed efficiently by scaling the weights of the conic segments or moving the joint points along the normal direction of the curve at the point. In the end, a fair conic spline curve is obtained that is G 2 continuous at convex or concave parts and G 1 continuous at inflection points. The main advantages of the method lies in two aspects, one advantage {{is that we can}} construct a curvature continuous conic spline by a local algorithm, the other one is that the curvature plot of the conic spline can be controlled efficiently.

40|$|Numerical {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to interpret the observed "shock overtaking magnetic cloud (MC) " event by a 2. 5 dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in heliospheric meridional plane. Results of an individual MC simulation show that the MC travels with a constant bulk flow speed. The MC is injected with very strong inherent magnetic field over that in the ambient flow and expands rapidly in size initially. Consequently, the diameter of MC increases in an asymptotic speed while its angular width contracts gradually. Meanwhile, simulations of MC-shock interaction are also presented, in which both a typical MC and a strong fast shock emerge from the inner boundary and propagate along heliospheric equator, separated by an appropriate interval. The {{results show that the}} shock firstly catches up with the preceding MC, then penetrates through the MC, and finally merges with the MC-driven shock into a stronger compound shock. The morphologies of shock front in interplanetary space and MC body behave as a central concave and a <b>smooth</b> <b>arc</b> respectively. The compression and rotation of magnetic field serve as an efficient mechanism to cause a large geomagnetic storm. The MC is highly compressed by the the overtaking shock. Contrarily, the transport time of incidental shock influenced by the MC depends on the interval between their commencements. Maximum geoeffectiveness results from that when the shock enters the core of preceding MC, which is also substantiated to some extent by a corresponding simplified analytic model. Quantified by $Dst$ index, the specific result gives that the geoeffectiveness of an individual MC is largely enhanced with 80 % increment in maximum by an incidental shock.

30|$|It {{is common}} to employ a {{collocation}} method or analytic method based {{on the use of}} polynomial base functions to solve Volterra integral equations. Recently, several authors introduced SE and DE Sinc quadratures for solving integral equations. Muhammad and Mori proposed a numerical method of indefinite integration based on the DE transformation together with Sinc expansion of the integrand in [15]. Haber provided two formulas and approximation error for approximating the indefinite integral over a finite interval in [16]. The Sinc Nyström method for numerical solution of one-dimensional Cauchy singular integral equations given on a <b>smooth</b> <b>arc</b> in the complex plane has been described in [17]. Muhammad et al. [18] presented a technique for linear integral equations using the Sinc collocation method based on the DE transformation. Rashidinia and Zarebnia [19] developed an analogous approach for the system of linear Fredholm integral equations by means of SE transformation. More recently, Okayama et al. [20] reported error estimates with explicit constants for the Sinc approximation, Sinc quadrature, and Sinc indefinite integration. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of Sinc Nyström methods for linear integral and differential equations have been discussed in [21 – 23]. Similar numerical approaches for nonlinear Fredholm and Volterra integral equations of the second kind are also presented in [24, 25]. However, nonlinear Volterra integral equations of the first kind are still not solved. In this work, we develop SE and DE Sinc methods to solve Eq. (1) in terms of SE and DE Sinc quadrature rules; these methods have a simple structure and perfect approximate properties. The convergence rates of these methods are exponential. Therefore, the proposed methods improve the conventional polynomial convergence rate. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are stable because the discrete coefficient matrices are very well conditioned.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{studies of}} the interplanetary "shock {{overtaking}} magnetic cloud (MC) " event are continued by a 2. 5 dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in heliospheric meridional plane. Interplanetary direct collision (DC) /oblique collision (OC) between an MC and a shock results from their same/different initial propagation orientations. For radially erupted MC and shock in solar corona, the orientations are only determined respectively by their heliographic locations. OC is investigated {{in contrast with the}} results in DC Xiong 2006. The shock front behaves as a <b>smooth</b> <b>arc.</b> The cannibalized part of MC is highly compressed by the shock front along its normal. As the shock propagates gradually into the preceding MC body, the most violent interaction is transferred sideways with an accompanying significant narrowing of the MC's angular width. The opposite deflections of MC body and shock aphelion in OC occur simultaneously through the process of the shock penetrating the MC. After the shock's passage, the MC is restored to its oblate morphology. With the decrease of MC-shock commencement interval, the shock front at 1 AU traverses MC body and is responsible for the same change trend of the latitude of the greatest geoeffectiveness of MC-shock compound. Regardless of shock orientation, shock penetration location regarding the maximum geoeffectiveness is right at MC core on the condition of very strong shock intensity. An appropriate angular difference between the initial eruption of an MC and an overtaking shock leads to the maximum deflection of the MC body. The larger the shock intensity is, the greater is the deflection angle. The interaction of MCs with other disturbances could be a cause of deflected propagation of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). Comment: 38 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
