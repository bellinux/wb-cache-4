40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a new measuring method for impact tensile strength of brittle materials such as ceramics, concrete and so forth. The method {{is based on the}} superposition and concentration of tensile stress waves reflected both from the free ends of a specimen and a <b>striking</b> <b>bar.</b> By making use of the Hopkinson-bar technique impact tensile experiments on concrete are performed. The statistical analysis of the experimental data obtained in a series of impact tensile break tests is presented and compared with that of static tensile and bending tests. It is found that the tensile strength of concrete is significantly influenced by loading rate...|$|E
40|$|The tensile {{strength}} and strain rate sensitivity of concretes under impact loadings were examined {{by means of}} the method of reflected tensile stress waves. The experimental method is conducted by the Hopkinson bar technique and {{it is based on the}} superposition and concentration of tensile stress waves reflected both from the free ends of a <b>striking</b> <b>bar</b> and a specimen bar. The impact tensile experiment for concretes was carried out and the {{tensile strength}} of concretes under impact loadings was discussed as well as the effect of strain rates. This study focused on the estimation and measurement of strain rates using crack gages. As a result, the impact tensile strength of concrete at the strain rate of 100 sec- 1 was found to be approximately twice of the static tensile strength, and it was remarkably influenced by strain rates ranging from 100 to 101 sec- 1...|$|E

50|$|A common {{signaling}} {{device is}} a chime unit {{consisting of two}} flat metal bar resonators, which are struck by plungers operated by two solenoids. The flat bars are tuned to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the first solenoid's plunger <b>strikes</b> one <b>bar,</b> and when the button is released, a spring on the plunger pushes the plunger up, causing it to <b>strike</b> the other <b>bar,</b> creating a two-tone sound ("ding-dong"). If a second doorbell button is used, it is wired to the other solenoid, which strikes {{only one of the}} bars, to create a single-tone ("ding") sound.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} Fourier transform and wavelet packet analysis of stress waves {{in a split}} Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus where the compressive behaviors of 3 -D angle-interlock woven composite were tested at strain rate of 800 /s, 1600 /s and 2100 /s. The stress waves in incident and transmission bar are transformed into frequency domain to analyze the impact energy spectrum under different lengths and impact velocities of the <b>strike</b> <b>bar.</b> It {{was found that the}} energy-frequency distribution is irrelevant to impact velocity and will be left-shifted when the length of the striker bar (i. e., width of incident stress wave) increases. The impact energy is mainly concentrated on the low-frequency region. The wavelet packet analysis of the incident and transmission stress waves shows that the transform coefficients decrease from the low-frequency region to the high-frequency region. Furthermore, the coefficients in the high-frequency region only occur at the ascending and descending part of stress waves. Based on the time-frequency analysis results, a unique start point of the stress wave can be determined for the stress-time and strain-time history calculation. This method can improve the calculation precision of stress–strai...|$|R
