50|$|A <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve or tilting disc {{check valve}} is {{a check valve}} in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valves can come in various sizes, large check valves are often <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E
5000|$|Centrifugal pumps {{which are}} not {{designed}} with an internal or external self-priming stage can only start to pump the fluid after the pump has initially been primed with the fluid. In addition, a suction-side <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve or a vent valve must be fitted to prevent any siphon action and ensure that the fluid remains in the casing when the pump has been stopped. In self-priming centrifugal pumps with a separation chamber the fluid pumped and the entrained air bubbles are pumped into the separation chamber by the impeller action.|$|E
50|$|To {{provide a}} chamber of {{sufficient}} volume to allow {{an extension of}} time in which a given flow may be accelerated or decelerated without sudden large change in pressure. See also expansion tank. When shock waves of an incompressible fluid within a piping system exist, especially at a high velocity, {{there is a high}} chance for water hammer. To help prevent a <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> from slamming and causing water hammer, a spring-assisted non-slam check valve is installed. Rather than relying on flow or gravity to be closed, the non-slam design prevents a sudden velocity decrease and reverse flow.|$|E
50|$|If a {{ball that}} passes the batter {{goes through the}} strike zone, it is a strike even if a <b>swing</b> is <b>checked.</b> A <b>checked</b> <b>swing</b> {{sometimes}} results in an unintentional swinging bunt, where the ball hits the bat and rolls a short distance, although the batter apparently stopped his swing. If a ball is hit during a <b>checked</b> <b>swing,</b> it is in play {{as long as it}} is not ruled a foul ball.|$|R
50|$|A <b>checked</b> <b>swing</b> {{is a type}} {{of motion}} in {{baseball}} made by a batter. A <b>checked</b> <b>swing</b> occurs when a batter starts to swing his bat at the ball, but stops the swing in order to allow the ball to pass without hitting it. If the <b>swing</b> was indeed <b>checked,</b> so that there was no swing, then if the bat did not touch the ball and if the ball did not go through the strike zone, the pitch counts as a ball; but in that circumstance if the <b>swing</b> was not <b>checked,</b> so that a swing occurred, then the pitch counts as a strike.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the home}} plate umpire must {{determine}} if a <b>swing</b> was <b>checked</b> or not checked. If he indicates that it was checked, an appeal {{can be made by}} the catcher or his manager, and the home plate umpire can then make a request to either the 1st or 3rd base umpire to make the call as to whether the <b>swing</b> was indeed <b>checked.</b> (To maximize visibility, the 1st base umpire makes the call for right-handed batters, and the 3rd base umpire for left-handed batters.) To indicate a <b>checked</b> <b>swing,</b> the umpire will make a “safe” gesture with his hands; to indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.|$|R

40|$|This is a M. Eng. degree {{project at}} Uppsala University {{carried out at}} the Forsmark nuclear power plant in Sweden. The purpose of it is to compare the two codes RELAP 5 and TRACE during {{transient}} changes in mass flow against experiment. The change in mass flow will create a pressure wave and generate pipe loads. RELAP 5 is a transient analysis code used to model thermal hydraulic systems. TRACE {{is an effort to}} combine the previous codes TRAC-B, TRAC-P, RAMONA and RELAP 5. Both RELAP 5 and TRACE has been compared to experiments. These comprise two abrupt valve closures, the closure of an inertial <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve (a flapper disc which closes when the flow is reversed) and a pump start and stop. Both RELAP 5 and TRACE conforms well to the experiments with the abrupt valve closures. The check valve closes faster in the calculations compared to the experiment, both for RELAP 5 as with TRACE. The amplitude of the pressure wave from the closure of the inertial <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve is lower compared to the experiment in both RELAP 5 and TRACE. Numerical disturbances become visual as very high amplitudes in the time history diagram of the force in TRACE. The check valve oscillates between its open and closed position in RELAP 5, but not in TRACE. Both RELAP 5 and TRACE conforms well to the pump start.

40|$|In a {{previous}} thesis work a <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve was studied with CFD analysisin order to nd correlations {{that could provide}} a good input for a onedimensionalmodel of the same.

In this wayit becomes possible to analyze {{the behavior of the}} same valve with a 1 D codecalled RELAP 5. The rst part of the work was dedicated to understanding the dynamics lyingbehind the movement of <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> vale, and to the construction of a suitable 3 D CFD model being able to nd the required coecients. The results weresubsequently elaborated and implemented in the RELAP 5 code, in order to runthe 1 D simulations.

In the end, the data obtained in RELAP 5 were compared to those fromequivalent 3 D CFD analysis and from an alternative 1 D approach by Adamkowski. Although not completely matching, the results showed that the 1 D model byLi and Liou has a good ability to accurately simulate the valve.

40|$|Check valve in a {{pipeline}} {{is supposed to}} prevent the reverse flow and to allow the flow in the positive direction. The construction of check valves follows these requirements, but the check valve must not cause pressure pulsations in transients. It means when the fluid is accelerating or decelerating.

40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} made to {{increase}} {{the understanding of the}} dynamic characteristics of a typical large <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve used in a system that transports pressurized water to a reactor tank. 3 D FSI-simulations are performed for a number of transients in order to study the dynamic characteristics their dependence of the deceleration rate. The purpose is to find information about the dynamics {{that could be used in}} a future improvement of a 1 D-model. Steady state simulations are performed for angles in the whole spectrum. Seven transient FSI-simulations with different constantly decelerating flows from 630 kg/s 2 (6. 7 m/s 2) to 40 320 kg/s 2 (430 m/s 2) have been performed. The pressure on the disc caused by the hydraulic torque is integrated and the corresponding torque contribution, together with the weight torque, is used in the second law of motion to calculate the movement of the disc throughout the transients. Steady state simulations yield the pressure drop over the valve, which could be compared with field measurements in order to validate the CFD-simulations. Comparison of the pressure distribution on the disc for the steady state and transient simulations shows the importance of taking the disc angular velocity into account when modelling in 1 D. Correlations between the angle, angular velocity, torque and mass flow are obtained from the transient FSI-simulations. Torque coefficients according to (Li & Liou, Vol. 125) are also brought out from the simulated transients, but in order to create a model in line with this approach further simulations have to be performed. A prediction of the pressure rise that occurs when a <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve closes in backward flow according to the Joukowsky equation is brought out and gives an idea of the loadings that the system has to be able to handle...|$|E

40|$|The {{coil spring}} in a Space Shuttle liquid oxygen check valve failed due to cyclic fatigue in September, 1991. The dual-flapper, <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valve {{is used to}} prevent reverse flow to the Space Shuttle Main Engines. Upon {{inspection}} of the failed component, the spring tangs {{were found to be}} missing and heavy wear was observed on the inner diameter of the spring coils. The fracture surfaces revealed that the metal had been steadily worn away until a simple overload caused the final fracture. A series of flow tests using water and a water/gas mixture was conducted to identify the flow phenomenon which produced the cyclic wear. A Plexiglas outlet housing was utilized to view the flapper behavior under different flow conditions and to aid in high speed photography. The tests revealed that flow instabilities induced two oscillatory flapper responses: a rocking mode and a chattering mode. Initially, attempts were made to reduce the spring-flapper oscillations. However, the final solution to the problem was a springless configuration which satisfied the valve's design requirements and eliminated the oscillations. The springless design relied on the inherent ability of the reverse flow momentum to close the flappers...|$|E

40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} work {{performed}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) relative to nuclear industry check valve performance, no information was readily available regarding the failure characteristics of check valves based on valve type (e. g., <b>swing</b> <b>check,</b> lift check). Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining check valve performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry Check Valve Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed check valve failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including valve type. Since the valve type identification is not inherently included within the NPRDS engineering record for each component, ORNL had to rely upon input from NIC, valve manufacturers, and catalogs to supply the missing information. As {{a result of this}} effort, approximately 77 % of the check valve failures occurring during the 1991 - 1996 study period and nearly 62 % of the overall installed population were identified according to type. This data provided the basis to perform previously unavailable cross-correlations between parameters such as valve type versus failure mode and failure cause. Design characteristics and service applications differ markedly among check valve types, resulting in discernible differences in performance. This paper focuses on the performance characteristics of swing and lift type check valves since failure and population distributions have shown these to be the two most common types employed {{in a wide range of}} nuclear plant applications...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{check valves}} {{in the nuclear}} {{industry}} is of great importance from a safety precaution point ofview (McElhaney, 1995). Choosing check valves for these high-pressurized systems comes with agreat challenge. The valves causes what is called check valve slams when closing, leading to a hugepressure wave traveling through the system. To prevent this from happening calculations have to bedone {{to see what kind}} of forces are generated during a check valve slam. When the forces are known itis easier designing systems that will endure these slams. A commonly used software in the nuclearindustry is RELAP 5 (Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program), its main purpose is to calculatetransients in piping systems. This program can also be used when calculating a check valve slam. Buthow precise is the code compared to the real event? By doing an experiment measuring pressures created by <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valves during slams, the codewas compared to real data and analyzed to decide what was of importance when modeling for thesetypes of simulations. The RELAP 5 code was not initially designed to calculate transients during a check valve slam. This isclearly shown when the code overestimates the pressure waves in the system when using themanufacturer data for the check valve model. Matching the data from the simulations in RELAP 5 withthe data recorded from the experiment is not easy. The parameters used for this have no connection tothe specifications for the check valve, which means that transients are hard to estimate withoutexperimental data...|$|E
40|$|Simulations {{of water}} hammer {{transients}} are important e. g. regarding structural analysis of piping systems {{in a nuclear}} power plant. This project aims to validate TRACE with respect to analysis of such transients. Validation is performed against RELAP 5 and also, when available, against experimental data. RELAP 5 is currently used for such analyses at Ringhals nuclear power plant, and is approved by the authorities for this purpose. Since this system code {{is about to be}} phased out in a couple of years, it is of interest to determine whether TRACE may be a suitable successor. Five main cases are studied, including e. g steam collapse in horizontal and vertical pipes, closing of inertial <b>swing</b> <b>check</b> valves and other valves, as well as some pump modelling. The parameters of interest for this project are mainly process-related ones such as pressures, void fractions and mass ows. In some cases forces on the piping systems are considered. All simulations are carried out in both codes, and the results from TRACE are compared mostly to the corresponding ones from RELAP 5. Efforts are then made in TRACE to improve the results to be more similar to RELAP 5, e. g. by modifying the interfacial heat transfer coefficients. It is concluded that TRACE in general works as well as RELAP 5 for this type of analysis. There are some differences between the codes though, when it comes to certain modelling techniques and correlations. Further, a number of bugs and other problems exist in the software which need to be fixed. Also, both codes are rather poor at handling steam collapse. This may be due to a too small predicted interfacial area at the moments just before the last steam is about to collapse. In case the interfacial heat transfer is increased in TRACE, the modelling of steam collapse is slightly better in this code than in RELAP 5. However, further improvements are required in order to fully capture cavitation water hammers. Finally, it is noted that neither RELAP 5 nor TRACE is originally intended for use in analysing this kind of fast pressure transients...|$|E
