5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural <b>spring</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good <b>spring</b> <b>water,</b> with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{water is}} a natural <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute and the flow has never been known to cease.|$|E

5|$|In 1996 the Malvern Hills District Council {{appointed}} a Malvern Spa Water Strategy Working Group. Independently, in June 1996, sculptor Rose Garrard proposed to the MHDC {{the creation of}} a sculpture trail by nationally known sculptors, placed at forgotten springs around the town centre. The council began with the installation of new water features as part of its plan to beautify the town centre. In 1997 the District Council implemented a <b>Spring</b> <b>Water</b> Arts Project to map water sources around the hills. Garrard undertook a two-month artist's residency and collaborated with the public, who provided locations of over two hundred water sources. Garrard was commissioned to create the drinking spout, Malvhina, which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.|$|E
5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running <b>spring</b> <b>water.</b> The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E

5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when {{people living in the}} area of present-day Romania boiled <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, drought in 2006 dried out the rock that filters the water, allowing the water to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> under EU law.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E

5|$|While {{people have}} used canning and {{artificial}} refrigeration to preserve {{food for the}} last hundred years or so, salt has been the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> through the process of briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society's population soon after its initial production began. The harvest of salt from the surface of Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, {{making it one of the}} oldest verifiable saltworks.|$|E

5|$|Malvern {{water has}} been bottled and {{distributed}} in the UK and abroad from {{as early as the}} reign of James I, with water bottling at the Holy Well being recorded in 1622. Various local grocers have bottled and distributed Malvern water during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was first bottled on a large commercial scale by Schweppes, who opened a bottling plant at Holywell in Malvern Wells in 1850. As official caterers to the Great Exhibition of 1851, Schweppes introduced the water as Malvern Soda, later renaming it Malvern Seltzer Water in 1856. In 1890 Schweppes moved away from Holywell, entered into a contract with a Colwall family, and built a bottling plant in the village in 1892. The Holywell was subsequently leased to John and Henry Cuff, who bottled there until the 1960s. The Holywell became derelict until 2009 when {{with the aid of a}} Lottery Heritage grant, production of 1200 bottles per day of Holywell <b>Spring</b> <b>Water</b> was recommenced by an independent family-owned company. The well is believed to be the oldest bottling plant in the world.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, Malvern's reputation for purity suffered a blow when the rock that filters the water dried out during 2006, allowing the water from heavy storms to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process to take place efficiently. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> under European Union law.

5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's <b>spring</b> <b>water.</b> The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E
