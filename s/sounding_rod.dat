5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the <b>sounding</b> <b>rod</b> found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E

As Captain Morehouse came on deck, the helmsman reported a vessel about [...] distant, heading unsteadily towards Dei Gratia. The ship's erratic movements and the odd set of her sails led Morehouse to suspect that something was wrong. As the vessels drew close, he could see nobody on deck, and he received no reply to his signals, so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright in a ship's boat to investigate. From the name on her stern the pair established {{that this was the}} Mary Celeste; they then climbed aboard, where they found the ship deserted. The sails, partly set, were in a poor condition, some missing altogether, and much of the rigging was damaged, with ropes hanging loosely over the sides. The main hatch cover was secure, but the fore and lazarette hatches were open, their covers beside them on the deck. The ship's single lifeboat, a small yawl that had apparently been stowed across the main hatch, was missing, while the binnacle housing the ship's compass had shifted from its place, its glass cover broken.

60|$|Biddy, like an obedient {{and respectful}} servant, did as directed, quite {{satisfied}} if the pumps were tight. It was some little time, to be sure, {{before she was}} perfectly certain whether she were alive or not--but, once certain of this circumstance, her alarm very sensibly abated, and she became reasonable. As for Mulford, he dropped the <b>sounding</b> <b>rod</b> again, and had the same cheering report to make.|$|E
30|$|Numerous penetrometers are in {{practice}} worldwide for investigation and characterization of subgrade. There are many developments in geotechnical instrumentation which are noticed in both the penetrometers, but more {{have been made}} on the dutch cone penetrometer (DCPT). CPT has also got many improvements, which increases its capability to handle diverse ground conditions [4], accurately identifying soil types [3, 23, 29], and gives better estimates of relevant geotechnical soil parameters. The CPT equipment {{used in this study}} has the following accessories: anvil and driving rod, a 10  kg rammer, height of fall of 50  cm, 11 <b>sounding</b> <b>rods,</b> lifting device for <b>sounding</b> <b>rods,</b> and couplings all in a box casing weighing approximately 71  kg. The cone tip angle of the penetrometer used in this study is 60 ° and rods are 20  mm in diameter. Both qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the CPT readings in this study followed the guidelines of DIN: 4094 —Part 2 [10].|$|R
40|$|Combining several {{different}} investigation methods within one project {{is something that}} is done on a daily basis. This master thesis analyses results from a project where methods that are relatively unusually within the geotechnical society are combined. The sounding program was also almost entirely executed on water. In the thesis geotechnical investigations performed by Vectura Consulting for the City Link project are evaluated. The City Link project is a TBM driven tunnel under the city of Stockholm, and the investigations was performed on the behalf of “Svenska kraftnät”. The thesis is performed on behalf of Vectura in Sundsvall where Per Nilsson has driven the issues which are the subject of this thesis. The methods used in the project has been soil-rock sounding, reflection- and refraction seismic, MWD-guided down the hole drill (DTH) and core drilling sampling. Every sounding except the core drilling sampling has been conducted on water. The core drilling sampling has in this thesis been infringed for the other methods. Complications and solutions regarding the performed sounding on water were found during the project, which resulted in a list of recommendations for performing sounding on water. Soil-rock sounding has been linked to the performed refraction seismic to investigate whether the seismic inferred rock quality could be shown in the soil-rock sounding. The analysis shows that it strongly tends to be possible, although more studies have to be done to confirm this theory. The study also shows the importance of having a seismic survey within a large scale geotechnical investigation where the bedrock level is of interest. MWD-guided down the hole drill is, within the geotechnical society, an uncommon method for rock-sounding. In this project the DTH were carried out on the sounding points where soil-rock sounding was estimated not to be possible to use, because of too large sounding depths. The aim of the investigations where to find the bedrock surface, which it also did. Further analysis also indicates that the rock quality in relation to all executed DTH soundings within the project could be distinguished. For both soil-rock sounding and DTH the method to integrate the sink rate and to form an index has given a simpler graphical interpretation of the soundings. The index which is formed by the driving force and the sink rate has also, and can be used to interpret the rock quality. The study also showed some significance regarding the weight of the <b>sounding</b> <b>rods,</b> especially for rock-soil sounding. Validerat; 20130609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} system is suited {{to detect the}} solid/liquid interface in a directional solidification process of silicon. Such processes are used to produce large multicrystalline ingots from which silicon wafers for low cost solar cells for terrestrial power applications are sliced. Several ultrasonic techniques are discussed in this paper. A pulse-echo system has been built and attached to a commercial type solidification machine. The pulses of a piezoelectric transducer are coupled into the melt via a transmission rod made of an appropiate material that withstands the temperature and the reactivity of liquid silicon. Several ceramic rods have been considered, SiC and Al 2 O 3 {{were found to be}} suited best. Clear echoes from the liquid/solid interface have been detected. These signals allowed to calculate the depth of the melt and the solidification velocity. For comparison the depth was measured with an Al 2 O 3 <b>sounding</b> <b>rod.</b> Good agreement was found...|$|E
40|$|Stream flow {{information}} {{is essential for}} many important uses across {{a broad range of}} scales, including global water balances, engineering design, flood forecasting, reservoir operations, navigation, water supply, recreation, and environmental management. Growing populations and competing priorities for water, including preservation and restoration of aquatic habitat, are spurring demand for more accurate, timely, and accessible water data. To be most useful, stream flow information must be collected in a standardized manner, with a known accuracy, and for a long and continuous time period. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates over 7000 stream gauges nationwide, which constitute over 90 % of the nation’s stream gauges that provide daily stream flow records, and that are accessible to the public. Most stream flow records are not based on direct measurement of river discharge, but are derived from continuous measurements of river elevations or stage. These stage data, recorded to 3 -mm accuracy, are then converted into discharge by use of a stage/discharge relation (rating) that is unique for each stream gauging location. Because stream beds and banks are not static, neither is the stage discharge rating. Much of the effort and cost associated with stream gauging lies in establishing and updating this relation. Ten years ago, USGS personnel would visit stream gauging stations 8 to 10 times a year to make direct measurements of river depth, width, and velocity using mechanical instruments: a <b>sounding</b> <b>rod</b> or cable, a tagline, and a current meter. From these data, flow rates were computed. The range of measured flow and concurrent river stages were then used to build the rating curve for each site and to track changes to the rating curve. Once the correct rating was applied to the continuous stage records, the resulting stream flow data, typically accurate to within 5 – 10 % of actual flows, would be published in reports 6 – 18 months later. Unfortunately, there are some conditions under which direct measurement of discharge by mechanical current mete...|$|E
