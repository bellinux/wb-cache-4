5000|$|In media studies, <b>spreadability</b> is {{the wide}} {{distribution}} and {{circulation of information}} on media platforms. The term was coined by Henry Jenkins in the book Spreadable Media. <b>Spreadability</b> contrasts with the [...] "stickiness" [...] of aggregating media in centralized places.|$|E
50|$|Jenkins situates <b>spreadability</b> in a {{particular}} context. This concept is particularly contextualised in the social media era and the Web 2.0 culture. These two transformations can be considered prerequisites {{for the idea of}} spreadibility to exist and for spreadable media to adopt such mechanisms to achieve <b>spreadability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spreadability</b> is {{directly}} linked to the participatory culture which Jenkins also coined. Participatory culture is the backbone to <b>spreadability</b> as it depicts an image {{of people who are}} [...] "shaping, sharing, reframing, and remixing media content". This culture is based on grass-root audience practices online. In other words, any user of a platform (that provides sharing possibilities) is emancipated as an individual who can informally, and instantaneously share information online. It is also important how the participatory culture and the act of sharing online [...] "tends to be a communal act of giving and taking that links us to other people".|$|E
50|$|Sphericity and {{particle}} size uniformity create a ball-bearing effect in creams and lotions, {{resulting in a}} silky texture and <b>spreadability.</b> Smoothness and roundness can provide lubrication. Colored microspheres add visual appeal to cosmetic products.|$|E
50|$|Below is a {{table that}} {{describes}} how certain elements provided on a media platform engage the audience or viewer into {{becoming involved in}} the <b>spreadability</b> of information. The descriptions have been extracted from Jenkins, Ford & Green 2013.|$|E
50|$|There {{are special}} {{characteristics}} {{that help to}} define what <b>spreadability</b> actually is. One key movement that underlines all the other characteristics is the change from distribution to circulation. This means there is a community where individuals exchange 'meaningful bytes'.|$|E
50|$|Building on {{his work}} on {{convergence}} culture {{as well as being}} a direct outgrowth of the conversations between industry and academia fostered by the Convergence Culture Consortium, Jenkins developed the concept of spreadable media as an alternative to viral media and memes for use by both media scholars and practitioners. (This led to his 2013 book Spreadable Media: Creating Meaning and Value in a Networked Culture, co-authored with Sam Ford and Joshua Green). The idea of viral media or memes uses metaphors which leave little room for deliberate agency while Jenkins' idea of <b>spreadability</b> focusses on the active agency of the ordinary media user in sharing, distributing, creating and/or remixing media content. This focus on the active media user is understood through this concept as increasingly crucial in online/digital era media landscapes where participatory culture is more important than ever, and where the dominance of large-scale media content distribution tightly controlled by corporate or governmental owners has been undermined by the rise of grassroots circulation. The idea of <b>spreadability</b> also contrasts with the idea of “stickiness” in media strategy, which calls for aggregating and holding attention on particular websites or other media channels, <b>Spreadability</b> instead calls for media strategists to embrace how their audiences and users will actively disperse content, using formal and informal networks, not always approved.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{copy of the}} (textual, visual, audio) information {{does not need to}} be replicated perfectly in order to display the characteristics of <b>spreadability,</b> rather the original can be manipulated or maintained in its original form and still be a product of this process. Simply, this concept refers to the capability of media being spread.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{authors have}} preliminarily {{evaluated}} whether {{the use of}} a face cream made from donkey milk affected the perception of some sensory aspects. The results showed that treated cream resulted appreciated by dry skin consumers for the following sensory aspects: <b>spreadability,</b> total appearance, smoothness, moisturisation and total effectiveness [...] The overall judgement also resulted highest for face cream made with donkey milk ...|$|E
50|$|Jenkins also discuses in {{his theory}} that content may be global. As {{individuals}} help spread content by {{sharing it with}} people within their networks, the content {{has the opportunity to}} be shared outside of the original culture it originated from. He utilizes the example of the emergence of anime in the United States to show the power of <b>spreadability</b> in sharing content to different communities and cultures. Anime originally emerged in Japan, however, as anime fans began circulating the content online and informally translated anime shows into English, it spread to audiences in the United States and more Americans be came a part of the anime fan base. As a result, the anime fan base in Japan contributed to the popularization of Anime in a global context and introduced new content to the American marketplace. In comparison to Bruns' concept of open participation, Jenkins adds on that the <b>spreadability</b> of content may bring new audiences from a global standpoint, thus increasing the number of individuals who are able to participate and engage with the content or product.|$|E
5000|$|Jonah Berger, a {{professor}} of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania conducted {{a study on the}} <b>spreadability</b> of emotions via social media and concluded that, [...] "Anger is a high-arousal emotion, which drives people to take action...It makes you feel fired up, which makes you more likely to pass things on.” Additionally, online audiences may be susceptible to outrage porn in part because of their feeling of powerlessness to managers, politicians, creditors and celebrities.|$|E
50|$|Wetting theory: Wetting is {{the oldest}} and most {{prevalent}} theory of adhesion. The adhesive components in a liquid solution anchor themselves in irregularities on the substrate and eventually harden, providing sites on which to adhere. Surface tension effects restrict the movement of the adhesive along the surface of the substrate, and is related to the thermodynamic work of adhesion by Dupre's Equation. Measuring the affinity of the adhesive for the substrate is performed by determining the contact angle. Contact angles closer to zero indicate a more wettable interaction, and those interactions have a greater <b>spreadability.</b>|$|E
50|$|In addition, Jenkins elaborates on {{the idea}} that content is spreadable. He states that the <b>spreadability</b> of content is a logic of {{circulation}} and that content gains value as it travels through culture. He utilized viral videos as an example to show that individuals who share and spread this content are contributing to increasing its value, whether for potential commercial interests or for entertainment. As a result, he states that circulation is a grassroots hybrid system and shaped by the individuals from the bottom up who pass along the content by their own choice. This type of <b>spreadability</b> contrasts the traditional type of distribution from corporations who are the main entity distributing content or products. Similarly, Bruns' concept of open participation elaborates {{on the idea}} that the more individuals working and collaborating produces higher quality content. In addition, it emphasis collaboration rather than one individual taking sole ownership of a piece of work. Jenskins' and Bruns' theories compare in that they both value multiple individuals collaborating to improve upon a piece of work or contribute to spreading its content. Jenskins' theory of media convergence values that it requires multiple individuals to work together to spread content throughout culture, while Bruns' theory values the collaborative effort of individuals working together to critique, analyze and reconstruct a piece of work.|$|E
5000|$|The polymer {{employed}} {{should be}} non-toxic, non-irritant and devoid of leachable impurities. It should have good wetting and <b>spreadability</b> property. The polymer should exhibit sufficient peel, shear and tensile strengths. The polymer should be readily available {{and should not}} be very expensive. Film obtained should be tough enough so that there won't be any damage while handling or during transportation. Combination of microcrystalline cellulose and maltodextrin has been used to formulate Oral Strips of piroxicam made by hot melt extrusion technique. Pullulan has been the most widely used film former (used in Listerine PocketPak, Benadryl, etc.) ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spreadability</b> {{was coined}} by Henry Jenkins, a media scholar {{known for his}} work in {{communication}} studies. It [...] "refers to the potential - both technical and cultural - for audiences to share content for their own purposes, sometimes with the permission of rights holders, sometimes against their wishes". It is contextualised in the media landscape due to the strong connection with quick and easy sharing practices which have been enabled by media platforms. After Jenkins coined this term (in a rather optimistic context) many authors such as Christian Fuchs have interpreted this movement through a more pessimistic lens.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} enzymatic Interesterification was in 1844, when Théophile-Jules Pelouze published {{a study on}} the synthesis of a triglyceride through the esterification of glycerol by butyric acid. [...] In 1920, Wilhelm Norman, who also patented the catalytic hydrogenation of fatty acids, was granted a patent for the chemical Interesterification of edible lipids. This process became a viable option for the food industry as it improved the <b>spreadability</b> and baking properties of the common shortening lard. At this same time, the food industry was rapidly adopting partial hydrogenation to meet their oil and shortening needs. Cheaper than esterification, partially hydrogenated shortenings were considered to be all-purpose and were used {{for a wide range of}} products.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, the {{regulations}} for cream cheese stipulate {{that it is}} made by coagulating cream {{with the help of}} bacteria, forming a curd which is then formed into a mass after removing the whey. Some of its ingredients include cream (to adjust milk fat content), salt, nitrogen (to improve <b>spreadability)</b> and several gelling, thickening, stabilizing and emulsifying ingredients such as xanthan gum or gelatin, to a maximum of 0.5 percent. Regulations on preservatives used are that either sorbic acid, or propionic acid may be used independently or combined, but only to a maximum of 3,000 parts per million when used together. The only acceptable enzymes {{that can be used in}} manufacturing of cream cheese to be sold in Canada are chymosin A and B, pepsin and rennet.|$|E
50|$|Lime {{has many}} complex qualities as a {{building}} product including workability which includes cohesion, adhesion, air content, water content, crystal shape, board-life, <b>spreadability,</b> and flowability; bond strength; comprehensive strength; setting time; sand-carrying capacity; hydrolocity; free lime content; vapor permeability; flexibility; {{and resistance to}} sulfates. These qualities are affected by many factors during each step of manufacturing and installation, including the original ingredients {{of the source of}} lime; added ingredients before and during firing including inclusion of compounds from the fuel exhaust; firing temperature and duration; method of slaking including a hot mix (quicklime added to sand and water to make mortar), dry slaking and wet slaking; ratio of the mixture with aggregates and water; the sizes and types of aggregate; contaminants in the mixing water; workmanship; and rate of drying during curing.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{creation}} of YouTube, a video sharing website, {{there has been a}} huge surge in the number of viral videos on the Internet. This is primarily due to the ease of access to these videos and the ease of sharing them via social media websites. The ability to share videos from one person to another with ease means there are many cases of 'overnight' viral videos. [...] "YouTube, which makes it easy to embed its content elsewhere) have the freedom and mobility once ascribed to papyrus, enabling their rapid circulation across a range of social networks." [...] YouTube has overtaken television in terms of the size of audience. As one example, American Idol was the most viewable TV show in 2009 in U.S. while [...] "a video of Scottish woman Susan Boyle auditioning for Britain's Got Talent with her singing was viewed more than 77 million times on YouTube". The capacity to attract an enormous audience on a user-friendly platform is one the leading factor why YouTube generates viral videos. YouTube contribute to viral phenomenon <b>spreadability</b> since the idea of the platform is based on sharing and contribution. [...] "Sites such as YouTube, eBay, Facebook, Flickr, Craigslist, and Wikipedia, only exist and have value because people use and contribute to them, and they are clearly better the more people are using and contributing to them. This is the essence of Web 2.0." ...|$|E
5000|$|Research mobilizing mediatization {{theories}} {{explores the}} ways in which media are embedded in cultural transformation. For example, [...] "tactical" [...] mediatization designates the response of community organizations and activists to wider technological changes. Kim Sawchuk, professor in Communication Studies at Concordia University, worked with a group of elderly who managed to retain their own agency in this context. For the elderly, the pressure to mediatize comes from various institutions that are transitioning to online services (government agencies, funding, banks, etc.), among other things. A tactical approach to media is one that comes from those who are subordinates within these systems. It means to implement work-arounds to make the technologies work for them. For example, {{in the case of the}} elderly group she studies, they borrowed equipment to produce video capsules explaining their mandate and the importance of this mandate for their communities, which allowed them to reach new audiences while keeping the tone and style of face-to-face communication they privilege in their day-to-day practice. Doing this, they also subverted expectations about the ability of the elderly to use new media effectively.Another example of study is one which is focused on the media-related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, showing how media integrate and modulate their everyday practices. The analysis also demonstrates how the mediatization of these subcultural groups brings them to become part of mainstream culture, changes their rebellious and oppositional image and engages them with the global commercialization culture.An example of study mobilizing mediatization theories would be one interested in how media's omnipresence informs the ways Femen's protests may take place on public scenes, allow communication between individual bodies and a shared understanding of activist imaginary. It aims to analyse how their practices are moulded by the media and how these are staged in manners which facilitates <b>spreadability.</b>|$|E

40|$|Context: Oils {{and butter}} of seed from Brazilian {{biodiversity}} are extending {{the range of}} innovative products for cosmetics development. They have a fat potential similar to skin composition, leading to the improved performance of these product. Aims: Improve the emulsions <b>spreadability</b> through prior screening of grease composition and studying the viscosity, and the emulsions accelerated stability. Methods: Emulsions were formulated using oils from semiarid plants from Bahia: Syagrus coronate, Pachira retusa, and Pachira aquatica, so as to compare them with oils already standard {{in the production of}} cosmetics. <b>Spreadability</b> and stability tests were made comparing the results. The same criteria were used with Amazon seed butter: Virola surinamensis, Butyrospermum parkii, Astrocaryum murumuru, Theobroma cacao and Theobroma grandiflorum. For the emulsions screening and performance, a system was developed for oil/ butter, following tests of accelerated stability, viscosity, and <b>spreadability.</b> Results: The combined system of <b>spreadability</b> was optimized using screening. Emollients containing oleic and palmitic acids, and light chain fatty acids obtained good <b>spreadability.</b> The oil emulsion containing Pachira retusa and Virola surinamensis butter had a higher viscosity. Conclusions: With high content of fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic or the light chain fatty acids obtain an appropriated appearance, texture, and <b>spreadability</b> for cosmetic use. Thus, oils with a low fatty acid content may be combined with butter that have a high fatty acid content and vice-versa. Analyzing and strategically combining grease composition, one can optimize the performance of cosmetic formulations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>spreadability</b> of SAE- 30 oil on Al- 12 Si base (LM- 13) alloy {{containing}} dispersed graphite particles about 50 μm {{average size}} in its matrix {{is found to}} be greater than on either LM- 13 with no graphite or brass. It is also found that the <b>spreadability</b> on LM- 13 base alloys increase with increasing volume of graphite dispersion in the matrix of these alloys. Further increases in the <b>spreadability</b> of oil on machined LM- 13 -graphite particle composite test surfaces occur if these are rubbed initially against control discs of either LM- 13 or grey cast iron. The formation of a triboinduced graphite-rich layer, confirmed by esca, appears to be responsible for the improved oil <b>spreadability</b> on the rubbed test surfaces of LM- 13 base alloys as compared to the as-machined test surfaces prior to rubbing. The triboinduced layer of graphite is apparently responsible for the observed reduction in the friction, wear and seizing tendency of triboelements made from aluminium alloy-graphite particle composites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the textural differences between Bulgarian commercial pates with different ingredients and to adapt the used methods for later application in texture analysis of sterilized meat products. Texture parameters were studied by sensory and instrumental methods. The sensory panel was stated from students in similar age and was asked to fulfill a questionnaire about their likening the poultry pates bought from the commercial network. Nine points sensory scales were used, about appearance, colour, <b>spreadability</b> by knife to bread, flavor, consistency, taste, aftertaste and overall likening. The panelists were asked to rank the pates based on their colour, <b>spreadability</b> and consistency. Instrumental texture parameters – texture profile and <b>spreadability</b> work, were analyzed by Stable Micro Systems texture analyzer in Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) and compression methods. For further analysis of <b>spreadability,</b> the probes were scanned by flatbed scanner before and after compression and their area ratio was measured by image analysis method. The results of sensory analysis show that, the pate with duck meat received the highest liking based on the overall liking, followed by pate with turkey meat and pate from chicken meat and liver and the lowest liked was the pate with goose meat. Based on the sensory <b>spreadability</b> and consistency the hardest was the pate with goose meat followed by pate with turkey meat and pate from chicken meat and liver and the softest was the pate with duck meat. The results from instrumental <b>spreadability</b> and hardness showed positive correlations with the results of the sensory analysis. ...|$|E
