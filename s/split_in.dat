They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change {{and a slight}} rename to Van der Graaf. The band <b>split</b> <b>in</b> 1978. After many years apart, the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.|$|E

40|$|Present study {{examines}} the stock return behaviour vis-à-vis stock <b>splits</b> <b>in</b> Indian context {{during the period}} from December 1999 to December 2007. It also makes an effort to disentangle the liquidity, trading range and neglected firm hypothesis. Consistent to earlier evidence, the study also documents the stock split announcement and execution effect in Indian context. The results regarding trading volume and daily turnover led to negation of improvement in liquidity after stock <b>splits</b> <b>in</b> India. The study could not corroborate the trading range hypothesis as possible explanation of stocks <b>splits</b> <b>in</b> India as majority of shares which split were trading at low market prices. While the neglected firm hypothesis could firmly be associated with the stock <b>splits</b> <b>in</b> India...|$|R

5|$|This {{perspective}} {{was accepted}} within the Fourth International, yet sowed {{the seeds for}} the <b>split</b> <b>in</b> 1953.

The leaders {{of the majority of the}} Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and Pierre Lambert, refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent <b>split</b> <b>in</b> the French section.|$|E
5|$|U 956 {{was first}} {{documented}} by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), {{and later by}} Johan Peringskiöld (1710), who commented that the inscription was legible {{in spite of the}} stone having been <b>split</b> <b>in</b> two parts. Unlike modern scholars, Peringskiöld connected this stone, like the other Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars in south-eastern Europe from the 3rd century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone three times, and the last time was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noted that Peringskiöld had been wrong and that the stone was intact, although it gives an impression of being <b>split</b> <b>in</b> two, and the same observation was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.|$|E

40|$|The {{distributions}} of magnetization orientation for both Landau and diamond domain structures in nano-rectangles {{have been investigated}} by micromagnetic simulation with various exchange coefficient and anisotropy constant. Both symmetric and asymmetric magnetization <b>splitting</b> are found <b>in</b> diamond domain structure, as well as only symmetric magnetization <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> Landau structure. In the Landau structure, the splitting angle increases with the exchange coefficient but decreases slightly with the anisotropy constant, suggesting that the exchange interaction mainly contributes to the magnetization <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> Landau structure. However in the diamond structure, the splitting angle increases with the anisotropy constant but derceases with the exchange coefficient, indicating that the magnetization <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> diamond structure is resulted from magnetic anisotropy.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{incidence}} of undetected radiographically iatrogenic longitudinal <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> the anterior cortex during intramedullary nailing of the femur {{has not been}} well documented. Methods Cadaveric study using nine pairs of fresh-frozen femora from adult cadavers. The nine pairs of femora underwent a standardized antegrade intramedullary nailing and the detection of iatrogenic lesions, if any, was performed macroscopically and by radiographic control. Results Longitudinal <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> the anterior cortex was revealed in 5 of 18 cadaver femora macroscopically. Anterior splitting was not detectable in radiographic control. Conclusion Longitudinal <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> the anterior cortex during intramedullary nailing of the femur cannot be detected radiographically. </p...|$|R
