5|$|The new Vandalic Kingdom of Carthage, {{under the}} capable king Geiseric, {{immediately}} launched raids against {{the coasts of}} Italy and Greece, even sacking and plundering Rome in 455. The Vandal raids continued unabated {{over the next two}} decades, despite repeated Roman attempts to defeat them. The Western Empire was impotent, its navy having dwindled to almost nothing, but the eastern emperors could <b>still</b> <b>call</b> upon the resources and naval expertise of the eastern Mediterranean. A first Eastern expedition in 448, however, went no further than Sicily, and in 460, the Vandals attacked and destroyed a Western Roman invasion fleet at Cartagena in Spain. Finally, in 468, a huge Eastern expedition was assembled under Basiliscus, reputedly numbering 1,113 ships and 100,000 men, but it failed disastrously. About 600 ships were lost to fire ships, and the financial cost of 130,000 pounds of gold and 700 000 pounds of silver nearly bankrupted the Empire. This forced the Romans {{to come to terms with}} Geiseric and sign a peace treaty. After Geiseric's death in 477, however, the Vandal threat receded.|$|E
