40|$|An {{epidemiological}} {{and environmental}} study {{of rock and}} <b>slag</b> mineral <b>wool</b> production workers was undertaken at a plant {{that has been in}} operation since the early 1900 s. Size characteristics of fibres produced by each process at the plant and data from industrial hygiene surveys were used to evaluate current and past exposures. These data suggest that the average historical airborne fibre concentration probably did not exceed 2. 5 fibres/cc before 1935 and 1. 0 fibre/cc after 1935. A retrospective cohort mortality study was designed to assess mortality patterns. Detailed occupational histories were compiled on all plant employees. All jobs in the plant were assigned to one of eight potential exposure categories to assess the extent and severity of mineral wool exposure and the effect of other significant exposures on employee mortality. Findings included {{an increase in the number}} of deaths due to cancer of the digestive system and non-malignant respiratory disease among workers who had over 20 years' exposure to mineral wool or who had survived 20 years since their first exposure to mineral wool.

40|$|Consideration of {{the human}} {{epidemiology}} of diseases arising from exposure to naturally occurring and man-made mineral fibers encompasses the several forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite-actinolite), other naturally occurring silicates (talc, sepiolite, erionite, attapulgite, vermiculite, and wollastonite), and man-made mineral fibers (glass continuous filament, glass/rock/ <b>slag</b> insulation <b>wools,</b> ceramic and other refractory fibers, and glass microfibers). The diseases arising from exposures {{to some of these}} fibers include pleural thickening (plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and calcification), pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancers, mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, and other cancers). Risk factors important in assessing these diseases include assessment of latency, duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, fiber origin and characteristics (length and diameter), other possible confounding occupational or environmental exposures, and smoking. Methodological issues commonly presenting problems in evaluation of these data include assessment of the adequacy of environmental exposures, particularly in regard to fiber identification, distribution, and concentration over the duration of exposure, and the adequacy of study design to detect health effects (disease frequency, latency, and cohort size). Research priorities include further assessment and standardization of pleural thickening relative to fiber exposure, uniform mesothelioma surveillance, further epidemiological assessment of certain silicate and man-made mineral fiber cohorts with emphasis given to assessment of tremolite and small diameter glass and ceramic fibers. Further assessment of possible health risks of the general public should await improved definition of relevant fiber exposure in ambient air...|$|R

5000|$|Hall {{was on a}} {{business}} trip in Pittsburgh in 1897 and saw mineral wool being made from steel slag. Some of the drawbacks he noted were that it soon disintegrated into powder and was unstable when moist. He thought that perhaps Alexandria's abundance of limestone to make a rock wool product similar to the steel mineral wool might be something to work on. Hall, using his chemical engineering background, experimented with the bedrock material. He discovered that it had a melting point near that of glass. He played with this molten stone in steel cupola furnaces and drew fibers out of them with blasts of air. The result of this experiment was a wool-like substance {{similar to that of the}} steel <b>slag</b> mineral <b>wool.</b> His product however did not have sulfur in it, which he considered caused the problems with steel mineral wool. He eventually determined that his material was an excellent insulator. He organized some investors and with $600 started a plant in 1897 to produce this insulating material in Alexandria.Hall negotiated the purchase on several hundred acres of land that contained limestone that could be used in the future for making rock wool. At the time he was manufacturing this insulating material, the chief users of insulation were breweries, distilleries, and cold storage facilities. For their insulation they used cork that was imported from Spain and Portugal. These firms were skeptical of Hall's new insulating material, so he made board-like sheets under the brand name [...] "Rock Cork" [...] to make it more appealing to the market. Hall in 1902 created the Chemical Crystal Company to produce this product as the first factory in the United States to do so. A few years later the natural gas supply of the area had been used up. All the local industries moved out, including the original investors of Chemical Crystal Company and the company ceased to exist.|$|R

A method of making mineral wool was patented in the United States in 1870 by John Player and first produced commercially in 1871 at GeorgsmarienhÃ¼tte in OsnabrÃ¼ck Germany. The process involved blowing a strong stream of air across a falling flow of liquid iron slag which was similar to the natural occurrence of fine strands of volcanic slag from Kilauea called Pele's hair created by strong winds blowing apart the slag during an eruption.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slag</b> <b>wool</b> is {{the most}} {{expensive}} and valuable product of blast furnace slag processing. <b>Slag</b> <b>wool</b> is in great demand nowadays. The article highlights the factors influencing the mineral wool quality: chemical composition that determines the acidity of the module, the temperature of the molten slag and the required slag jet thickness consistency. Mineral wool is produced by blowing air or steam into a jet of molten slag. As a result of it the slag crushes into droplets stretching. The resulting wool contains 5 % slag and 95 % air. The quality of the obtained <b>slag</b> <b>wool</b> depends on the module acidity of the slag. The blast furnace slags of Â«Ilyich iron and steel works of MariupolÂ» and Â«Azovstal iron & steel worksÂ» are the main (short) slags â they give short fibers. To obtain high-quality long fiber wool it is necessary to add admixtures into basic blast furnace slag to reduce its basicity. As a result of the fuel and energy rising prices and the necessity to reduce the <b>slag</b> <b>wool</b> cost it is necessary to develop a new technology with fiery-liquid slag, with the removal of iron compounds and sulphur from the melts and the introduction of corrective additives {{to improve the quality of}} <b>slag</b> <b>wool.</b> Good thermal conductivity (about 0, 03 kcal/mâhâÂ°C) and other indicators (resistance, volume weight) make it possible to use the materials from <b>slag</b> <b>wool</b> (pads, rigid and semi-rigid plates) as heat and sound insulating material...|$|E

40|$|Man-made {{vitreous}} fibre (MMVF) is {{a generic}} name {{used to describe}} an inorganic fibrous material manufactured primarily from glass, rock, minerals, slag and processed inorganic oxides. The MMVFs produced are non-crystalline (glassy, vitreous, amorphous). Other names for MMVFs include manufactured vitreous fibres, man-made mineral fibres (MMMF), machine-made mineral fibres and synthetic vitreous fibres. Continuous glass filament is sometimes {{also referred to as}} âglass textile fibreâ. The term âmineral wool â has been used in the USA to describe only rock (stone) wool and <b>slag</b> <b>wool.</b> In Europe, âmineral wool â also includes glass wool. In this monograph, the terms rock (stone) wool, <b>slag</b> <b>wool</b> and glass wool are used rather than mineral wool, whenever possible. Man-made vitreous fibres are manufactured by a variety of processes based on the attenuation of a thin stream of molten inorganic oxides at high temperatures. All commercially important MMVFs are silica-based and contain various amounts of other inorganic oxides. The non-silica components typically include, but are not limited to, oxides of alkaline earths, alkalis, aluminium, boron, iron and zirconium. These additional oxides may be constituents of the raw materials used to make the fibres, or they may be added to enhance the manufacturing process or the product performance. Depending on the process of fibre formation, MMVFs are produced either as wool, which is a mass of tangled, discontinuous fibres of variable lengths and diameters, or as filaments, which are continuous fibres (of indeterminate length) with diameters having ranges that are more uniform and typically thicker than those of wool. (a) Categorization The previous IARC Monographs on man-made mineral fibres (IARC, 1988) grouped fibres into five categories based loosely on raw materials, production process and/or product application. These categories were: glass filament, glass wool, rock wool, <b>slag</b> <b>wool</b> and ceramic fibres. To reflect developments in the industry, the categories have been expanded an...|$|E
40|$|The {{group of}} {{man-made}} mineral or vitreous fibres (MMMFs or MMVFs) includes glass wool, rock wool, <b>slag</b> <b>wool,</b> glass filaments and microfibres, and refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs). Experimental observations have provided evidence that {{some types of}} MMVF are bioactive under certain conditions. The critical role of size parameters has been demonstrated in cellular and animal experiments, when intact fibres are {{in direct contact with}} the target cells. It is, however, difficult to extrapolate the results from these studies to humans since they bypass inhalation, deposition, clearance and translocation mechanisms. Inhalation studies are more realistic, but show differences between animal species regarding their sensibility to tumour induction by fibres. Fibre biopersistence is an important factor, as suggested by recent inhalation studies, which demonstrate positive results with RCF for fibrosis, lung tumours and mesothelioma. There is no firm evidence that exposure to glass-, rock- and <b>slag</b> <b>wool</b> is associated with lung fibrosis, pleural lesions, or nonspecific respiratory disease in humans. Exposure to RCF could enhance the effects of smoking in causing airways obstruction. An elevated standard mortality ratio for lung cancer has been demonstrated in cohorts of workers exposed to MMVF, especially in the early technological phase of mineral (rock <b>slag)</b> <b>wool</b> production. During that period, several carcinogenic agents (arsenic, asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) were also present at the workplace and quantitative data about smoking and fibre levels are lacking. It is not possible from these data to determine whether the risk of lung cancer is due to the MMVFs themselves. No increased risk of mesothelioma has been demonstrated in the cohorts of workers exposed to glass-, slag- or rock wool. There are in fact insufficient epidemiological data available concerning neoplastic diseases in RCF production workers because of the small size of the workforce and the relatively recent industrial production.

Some of these men were potentially exposed to man made vitreous fibres (MMVF). The vital status of the entire cohort was ascertained to the end of 1989. Of the 504 deaths that occurred between 1970 and 1989, 61 were attributed to lung cancer (cases). Individually matched controls were randomly selected from the remaining deaths. Attempts were made to locate and interview the surviving families of the cases and controls. The families of three lung cancer cases could not be located and no matched controls were found for another three cases. Included in the final analysis were 55 cases and 98 controls. Estimates of individual exposure to MMVF were based on employment records and industrial hygiene surveys. Data on smoking and histories of employment outside the MMVF industry were obtained from telephone interviews and employment records. Relative risks were calculated for cigarette smoking and exposure to MMVF. No increased risk of lung cancer was found associated with exposure to MMVF, and analysis by cumulative fibre exposure did not indicate any trend.
