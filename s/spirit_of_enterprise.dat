25|$|The {{commercial}} activity which raised Newport to its fame as a rich port was begun {{by a second}} wave of Portuguese Jews who settled there about {{the middle of the}} 18th century. They had been practicing Judaism in secret for three hundred years in Portugal, liable to torture and murder by the Inquisition if they were caught, and they were attracted to Rhode Island because of the freedom of worship there. They brought with them commercial experience and connections, capital, and a <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Most prominent among those were Jacob Rodrigues Rivera who arrived in 1745 (died 1789), and Aaron Lopez who came in 1752 (died May 28, 1782). Rivera introduced into America the manufacture of sperm oil, which became one of the leading industries and made Newport rich. Newport's inhabitants who were engaged in whaling developed 17 manufactories of oil and candles and enjoyed a practical monopoly of this trade until the Revolution.|$|E
