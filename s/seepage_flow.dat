50|$|When rain {{falls on}} the land mass, soil absorbs a part of rain water and {{remaining}} part of the rain water joins the nearby stream by flowing {{on the surface of}} soil. Some of the water absorbed by the soil gets evaporated from the soil, some part of the remaining water in the soil emerges into the surface stream as <b>seepage</b> <b>flows</b> and rest of water collects in the underground aquifer as ground water. This process also takes place when the land is irrigated by surface water. The surface run off and the subsurface seepage out of the total rainfall is the available water in the river basin after deducting the natural evaporation loss from the naturally formed water bodies (both perennial and non perennial) in the river basin in a water year. The water thus available is called primary water supplies / flows in a river. If there is no ground water extraction, {{over a period of time}} all ground water aquifers get saturated fully and further ground water percolation to the aquifers would join the river streams as enhanced <b>seepage</b> <b>flows</b> / base flows. Thus any underground water extraction / use from the river basin aquifers reduce the primary water flows in the river basin.|$|R
