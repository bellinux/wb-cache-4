40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{arrangements}} made by the EEC to establish a common market in <b>sheepmeats.</b> A system of intervention buying or deficiency payments ensures that producers are guaranteed a minimum price. In addition, compensatory payments up to a Reference Price level give farmers additional income support during the transition period from 1980 to 1984. The whole arrangement is protected from imports from third countries with a system of tariffs, licences and Voluntary Restraint Agreements. EEC exports, subject to a clawback tax under the Variable Premium System, and to refunds under the Intervention System, are maintained at traditional levels to current markets. Any increased production in the U. K. is likely to be exported to the Continent, so the British market should remain stable. New Zealand has agreed to limit sales to the EEC at 245, 500 tonnes in return for a reduction in the import levy to 10 %. There are a number of disadvantages and benefits for New Zealand attached to this agreement, for example no allowance for market growth but higher per unit returns. Whilst there is guaranteed access to the market for this quantity up to 1984, exporters need to keep a close watch on any further long term developments within the EEC...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{marketing}} agencies {{operating on}} behalf of New Zealand agricultural industries in export markets have placed increasing emphasis on market segmentation policies {{as a means of}} achieving producer objectives. However, many of the prescriptions for segmentation have been developed within the context of monopolistic or oligopolistic industries. Firms operating under these conditions have no or few competitors and have the ability to control output to profit maximization levels. However, typically structured agricultural industries do not have these features. In this study, an economic model of market segmentation without supply control was constructed. The model incorporated the optimal allocation of industry output to any number of market segments, and included aspects of promotion given this optimal pricing behaviour. From the model, it was determined that market segmentation outcomes were influenced by a number of variables. Producer returns were high when the price elasticities of demand and supply were low, and the divergence between demand elasticities in individual market segments was large. It was also noted that these demand elasticities are themselves influenced by a further set of factors, including the market share held in a particular market segment, the extent of product differentiation and competitive supply responses. Analysis of the promotion component of the model suggested that promotion activity should be carefully targeted, with more effort being directed towards less price elastic market segments. An application of the model to the export of New Zealand <b>sheepmeats</b> indicated that gains from market segmentation activity were high in the short-term. However, they were heavily eroded in the long-term, {{largely as a result of}} competitive supply responses...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years {{there have been a number}} of studies carried out of {{agricultural}} supply response in New Zealand. The parameters estimated in these studies are an essential ingredient in a wide variety of policy and forecasting studies. One example of such work is the study currently being carried out at the O. E. C. D. (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) to examine the medium term impacts of multilateral adjustments in agricultural protection policies. Of necessity these studies involve the simultaneous examination of changes in production, consumption and trade for a number of countries for a range of major agricultural commodities. The countries include the E. E. C., United States, Japan, other Western European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The O. E. C. D. has developed a framework with which to carry out the analysis. From New Zealand's perspective the major products involved include beef, wool, <b>sheepmeats,</b> dairy products and grain. These are generally exportable products as far as New Zealand is concerned. If protection in these products was reduced by importing regions, domestic prices around the world would be reduced because export supply functions from countries like New Zealand are elastic. The responsiveness of New Zealand's export supply in turn, depends upon the elasticities of New Zealand's domestic supply and demand. These are complex relationships that have important time, regional and quality dimensions. There are limits, however, to the extent to which these dimensions will be incorporated into the multi country, multi product model. The analysis will explore the impacts of trade policy changes from a medium term perspective. For this reason, the review of past studies focuses on medium term supply response parameters. The approach being used by the O. E. C. D. adopts an overall perspective of the agricultural sector in each country involved. This aggregate view of the sector is still a partial equilibrium approach in that factor and product market relationships with the rest of the economy are not included in a detailed fashion. Nevertheless, the aggregate sector view does require that the supply response parameters are consistent in the sense that they respect intermediate usage of agricultural products between subsectors within agriculture and that the total output supply response respects the supply response of primary factors. The first set of relationships is particularly important in countries where a high proportion of grain output is fed to livestock. The second is important where the availability of land and land sowing technology are major constraints in the medium term. Most previous supply response studies in New Zealand have been done on commodity lines and encompass a limited set of possible products. In surveying this literature there is a concern that response parameters selected may be biased in relation to the sector wide model which underpins the O. E. C. D. framework. One approach that can be used to overcome this problem is to select parameters from individual studies subject to overall sector restraints imposed by economic theory. Zeitsch (1985) has surveyed these restrictions on supply elasticities. In the case of New Zealand, it is not appropriate to assume that the supply of farm land and land saving technology is fixed and so the homogeneity condition derived from Diewert (1974) is not used in this survey. Furthermore, grain production and feeding is not a major activity for dairy, beef and sheep production. The second section of this report and Appendix 1 consists of the review of selected past studies at the national level. The third section contains a selection of these parameters for medium term policy forecasting purposes...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} the {{development}} of processed meat products from New Zealand mutton so that marketing of the country's <b>sheepmeats</b> can be diversified and expanded, if possible to new overseas markets. Thailand, a country with a relatively big population, {{may be one of the}} importing countries for mutton-based processed meat products from New Zealand. However, there was a possibility that the Thai people might be unlikely to accept the products made from this unfamiliar meat with strong aroma and flavour. There had never been research into the development of processed meat products made from New Zealand mutton for the Thais. Therefore, this thesis studied whether any product could be made acceptable to the target Thai consumers who were the middle and upper classes in the Bangkok area. The steps of the systematic product development process were followed to guide how such a product could be designed. In brief, the process started from surveying the Thai market for some suitable products, identifying the product (meatballs) to be developed using mutton, development of the formulation in New Zealand, improvement of the formulation in Thailand, and finally it ended with consumer testing of the developed product in the target market in Bangkok. Different types of sensory panels were used at various stages of the development. These included: a laboratory panel (n= 12) in Bangkok to identify important sensory attributes and the ideal profiles of some potential products in the Thai markets, a laboratory panel (n= 8) to control the formulation development in New Zealand, a small household consumer panel (n= 17) in New Zealand to test for acceptance of the intermediate product made by the selected formulation, a focus group panel (n= 6) in Bangkok to optimise the formulation and a 'home use' consumer test panel (n= 488) in Bangkok to test whether the final product was acceptable to the consumers. The success of the development was believed to rely heavily on the formulation process which combined the use of appropriate experimental designs with the sensory evaluation methods. Experimental designs controlled by a laboratory taste panel using the ideal profile technique were used to formulate the meatball product. A mixture design was used to choose the appropriate kinds and levels of meat and meat fat to be mixed with mutton. A full factorial design studied the texture development varying three ingredients - salt, phosphate and tapioca starch. Empirical equations relating the quantitative characteristics, determined either by subjective tests or objective tests, to the ingredient contents were derived so that the formulation could be directed systematically. A Plackett and Burman design was then used in the flavour development for screening of suitable spices. A quarter fractional factorial design was finally used to study the effects of the six ingredients, i. e. three texture improvers and three spices, on the sensory attribute acceptability of the product. An optimum formulation was selected and tested for acceptance by a small household consumer panel. This intermediate product was not highly acceptable. A series of focus groups were therefore conducted in Thailand to optimise the formulation. The focus group panels provided valuable information as to how the product could be improved and, as a result, the prototype formulation was obtained and then used in a production trial to make the final product for a consumer test in Bangkok. The consumer test panel played its role at the final stage of this project to identify whether the developed product was acceptable. The meatball product developed was acceptable to the target Thai consumers. It was believed that the product was successfully made by trimming of the mutton fat to reduce the strong aroma and flavour; this resulted in the high proportion (75 %) of mutton which could be used with pork and pork fat (replacing mutton fat). Added ingredients also significantly improved the sensory characteristics of the product. Tapioca starch, sodium tripolyphosphate and particularly salt helped improve the texture and the spices, white pepper, garlic, onion and ginger, helped improve the aroma and flavour...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{established}} in 1948 as the Primary Producers Cooperative Society based initially in the South Island of New Zealand as a meat marketing cooperative, predominantly of sheep. It became known as PPCS Limited but remained a minor player in the meat industry until the early 1970s when a new management team was appointed. The removal of subsidies to farmers, the New Zealand Meat Board ceding its monopoly on <b>sheepmeat</b> marketing, and meat processing industry over-capacity gave the cooperative opportunities to utilise its profitability built up over the previous decade. So in the 1980s it expanded from only minor processing operations by taking over meat processing cooperatives and companies in initially the South Island and later the North Island. In 1986 released asset value was returned to the farmer shareholders by {{the creation of a}} holding company Apex Limited. Apex was a vehicle that allowed the acquisition of Canterbury Frozen Meat. [...] Major consolidation of the New Zealand meat industry continued through the 1990s with PPCS actively involved but not getting caught out like competitors such as AFFCO Holdings. However, in 2006 it was forced to take over Hawkes Bay based Richmond Meats to resolve issues resulting from a secret investment that had commenced in the late 1990s. This saddled the cooperative with debt. It was renamed Silver Fern Farms in 2008 based upon one of its long standing brands. A takeover by PGG Wrightson fell through due to the 2008 financial crisis. In June 2008, PGG Wrightson had made an unconditional offer to buy half of Silver Fern Farms for NZ$220 million, but in September was unable to complete the equity raising required to finance the offer and defaulted. It had to pay $42 million in compensation to Silver Fern and wrote off a total of $50 million for the compensation and due diligence costs.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{physicochemical}} and sensory characteristics of fermented, cured sausages made from equivalent muscle groups of beef, pork, and <b>sheepmeat.</b> The last has no commercial examples and represents an unexploited opportunity. Using seven replicates of shoulder meat and subcutaneous fat, sausages were made with 64 %, 29 %, 4 %, 2 %, 0. 2 %, and 0. 01 % of lean meat, fat, NaCl, glucose, sodium pyrophosphate, and lactic culture, respectively. Following anaerobic fermentation (96  h, 30 °C), there were no significant differences between the species in mean texture (hardness, springiness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness) and pH, and only minor differences were seen in color. However, although not consumer tested, it is argued that consumers would be able to pick a texture difference due to different fat melting point ranges, highest for <b>sheepmeat.</b> This work was followed by a sensory experiment to find out if characteristic <b>sheepmeat</b> flavors could be suppressed to appeal to unhabituated consumers. To simulate a very strongly characteristic <b>sheepmeat,</b> beef sausage mixtures (above) were spiked, or not, with 4 -methyloctanoic, 4 -methylnonanoic acid, and skatole (5. 0, 0. 35, and 0. 08  mg kg(- 1), respectively). Sodium nitrite (at 0. 1  g kg(- 1)) and a garlic/rosemary flavor were variably added to create a 2 (3) factorial design. In a randomized design, 60 consumers found that spiked <b>sheepmeat</b> flavors caused an overall significant decrease in mean liking on a 1 - 9 scale (5. 83 vs. 5. 35,P =  0. 003), but this was completely negated by the garlic/rosemary addition (5. 18 vs. 6. 00,P <  0. 001). Nitrite had no effect on liking (5. 61 vs. 5. 58,P =  0. 82), although nitrite might be included in commercial examples to minimize fat oxidation and suppress growth of clostridia. Thus, <b>sheepmeat</b> flavors could be suppressed to appeal to unhabituated consumers. Commercial examples could thus be made for these consumers, but the mandatory use of the name "mutton" in some markets would adversely affect prospects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose was}} product {{development}} to increase <b>sheepmeat</b> liking for consumers unhabituated to its characteristic flavour. The development {{has centered on}} a cured, fermented sausage, traditionally flavoured with garlic and rosemary, aiming to suppress the intrinsic species flavour (from branched chain fatty acids) and flavours (mainly skatole) from New Zealand’s pastoral diets. However, appearance and texture are also important for liking. Therefore, the colour and textural properties of cured, fermented <b>sheepmeat</b> sausage were {{compared with those of}} beef and pork equivalents. The problem of between-animal variation was overcome by comparing replicates made from meats bought on seven dates from different butchers. During fermentation over four days, samples were tested for growth of lactic acid bacteria, pH decrease, and colour and texture changes. There {{were no significant differences between}} the species. Subsequently, the flavour of fermented beef sausage was assessed by consumers where the fat was pre-treated (or not as controls) with the ovine-characterising branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs), 4 -methyloctanoic acid and 4 -methylnonanoic acid, as well as with the pastoral flavour- characterising compound, skatole. Beef has no BCFAs and low concentrations of skatole, and was thus ‘turned into sheepmeat’ by addition of BCFAs and skatole. The sausage mixture was in eight treatments that were combinations of cured vs. non-cured, flavoured vs. non-flavoured, added BCFAs/skatole vs. non-added. For sensory evaluation, 60 consumers tasted samples in a randomized design and completed a 9 -point liking-score scale for each. Neither curing nor flavouring affected the liking of sausage treatments with or without added BCFAs/skatole. However, combined curing and flavouring significantly enhanced the liking of the added BCFAs/skatole treatment. Thus, appearance and texture of fermented <b>sheepmeat</b> were the same as for other species; species and pastoral flavours in <b>sheepmeat</b> may be more acceptable to unhabituated consumers where fermented sausage is flavoured with at least traditional European flavours...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} <b>sheepmeat</b> markets in three {{importing}} regions (North America, Japan and the Middle East) {{over the period}} 1960 - 80. These regions form so called 'development' markets for N. Z. <b>sheepmeat</b> exports as much of N. Z. 's traditional trade with the U. K. is being diversified into them. The U. S. A. has {{a large number of}} sheep but its production has declined markedly; consumption has followed a similar trend and per capita consumption of sheepmeats is very low. Imports are currently well below levels in the mid 1960 's but considerable potential exists for future expansion in the import market. Canada's <b>sheepmeat</b> market is of relatively minor importance but it has characteristics {{similar to those of the}} U. S. A. Imports have been quite substantial at times, though have declined recently. In both countries, N. Z. is now the main import supplier. A large and possibly expanding import market exists in Japan for <b>sheepmeat</b> but up until now it has been an erratic purchaser, especially in the mutton market. Changes in consumption are directly transmitted to exports as there is no domestic production. Promotion is needed to expand the market. Imports consist largely of mutton for manufacturing and Australia and N. Z. are the two main suppliers. However, it is possible that N. Z. could capture the growing market for lamb with Australia continuing to supply the mutton market. Finally the Middle East market has developed rapidly since the oil price rise in 1973 / 74. The main markets are Iran and Iraq while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other states also provide lucrative markets. Although it is planned to increase production in the Middle East, the potential for doing so is limited and domestic supply is unlikely to be able to satisfy increasing demand. The outlook is for continued expansion in imports therefore, though the market has a high potential risk due to political instability in the region...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, Australian <b>sheepmeat</b> {{and wool}} {{producers}} {{have been exposed}} to more volatile and less secure market environments, placing greater pressure on producer-funded investments to be efficient and profitable. Knowledge about the size and distribution of the potential returns from alternative broad types of R&D and promotion investments permits strategic-level decisions about resource allocation, both within and across research programs. This is particularly important for the Australian <b>sheepmeat</b> and wool industries because they are characterised by strong crosscommodity relationships due to the joint product nature of the industries. Mounter et al. (2007) developed an equilibrium displacement model (EDM) of the Australian <b>sheepmeat</b> and wool industries to account for these relationships and any indirect benefits and costs arising from spillover and feedback effects between the industries as a result of research-induced innovation or promotion. However, the values for many of the economic parameters in the EDM had to be specified subjectively due to the absence of relevant empirical estimates. Uncertainty about true parameter values raises concerns over the robustness of the results generated from the EDM. In this paper we use the EDM to estimate the potential annual returns and their distribution among the various industry sectors for nine hypothetical investment scenarios.

40|$|Patterns of production, {{consumption}} and {{trade in the}} EEC vary widely among the ten members. The U. K. and France are major consumers of <b>sheepmeat,</b> followed by Ireland, Italy, Germany and Greece. In the other States <b>sheepmeat</b> consumption is relatively unimportant. Production and trade are similarly distributed. However, the trends over the period considered show an increase in production in most states, {{and an increase in}} consumption in France, Greece, Germany and Italy, but a major decline in the United Kingdom. As the EEC produces only 60 per cent of its consumption, it is highly dependent on external sources for supply. Imports were at a maximum in 1969 (422 Kt), but have dropped steeply since, to 328 Kt. This is a result of declining demand in the U. K. and the EEC's imposition of a 20 per cent tariff. A further decline is expected following the introduction of a Common Policy for <b>sheepmeat</b> in 1980. The main suppliers to the Community are N. Z., Argentina, Australia and the East European states. In 1980 these countries supplied 80. 4 per cent, 30 per cent, 1. 9 per cent, and 13. 1 per cent of total imports respectively. The outlook for trade is for a continuation of the current trends, with a net decrease in imports. Trade with Germany, Italy, France and Greece should continue to grow, but may be offset by a decline in other states, particularly the U. K. Overall, because of the declining market, and protectionist import policies, the EEC will offer only limited opportunities for exporters during the 1980 's, though will continue to be the major and probably most stable of world markets...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of the world's <b>sheepmeat</b> exports come from the Southern Hemisphere, where production is based on extensive grazing systems. The three main exporters are Australia, N. Z. and Argentina. Australia's sheep industry is based primarily on wool production, with mutton generally a by product. Exports consist of mutton sales to Japan and South Korea and, more recently, sizeable but irregular sales to the U. S. S. R. and the Middle East. Large numbers of live sheep are also exported to the Middle East. N. Z. 's industry has been centred on lamb production, though wool and mutton are important secondary enterprises.

40|$|New Zealand {{has always}} been a nation {{strongly}} reliant on international trading. From the mid-nineteenth century wool was a major export commodity and with the advent of refrigeration in the 1880 s <b>sheepmeat</b> and dairy products, especially butter,gained prominence. These three commodity types became the export staples of New Zealand, and remained so in 1960. Britain, in turn, was clearly the most prominent importer of these products. New Zealand exports of wool, <b>sheepmeat</b> and dairy products to Britain therefore became imbedded as the 'traditional' pattern of trade. An interest in how these traditions survived {{to the end of the}} twentieth century was the stimulus for this thesis, which is an historical investigation into New Zealand's recent export trade with the countries of today's European Union. Agreements made between New Zealand and Britain in the first half of the twentieth century consolidated what had been established since 1890 as a regular pattern of trade.

The results indicate that Australian dairy exports operate in competitive markets in which pass-through is complete, but there is no stable long-run relationship between exchange rates and prices for any of the other livestock products.

40|$|The food {{industry}} of today is {{in a constant}} state of change [...] becoming increasingly globalised and consumer driven. Moreover, food consumption patterns in industrialized and many developing nations are changing dramatically, moving seemingly in parallel directions. As previous research has shown, food consumption patterns are altered with fluctuations in relative prices, changes in real income, emergence of technological forces, effects of advertising and promotion, shifts in the demographic structure of households and changes in lifestyles. Further, concerns regarding nutrition and health, food safety and environmental integrity are proliferating around the world. Consequently, these dynamic issues and trends have stimulated the diversification of consumption patterns and preferences within individual countries. This study is an initial attempt to identify key variables affecting meat consumption in the international marketplace and examine their potential effect on New Zealand sheepmeat's competitive position. The overall goal of the report was to explore and help define strategic issues, trends and challenges facing New Zealand's <b>sheepmeat</b> sector in today's fiercely competitive global environment. This study provides: 1. an in-depth look into the current and changing dynamics of world meat trade; 2. specific meat production and consumption trends worldwide; 3. a current snapshot of the New Zealand livestock and export meat industry with an emphasis on possible strategic responses to existing and emerging meat industry trends and challenges; and 4. an analysis of selected markets around the world and the potential for garnering increased market share. Some implications for the New Zealand <b>sheepmeat</b> industry are drawn based on emerging international trends, issues and challenges identified. This research effort represents the culmination of a comprehensive review of the extant literature as well as government and trade reports, joined with the personal observations of prominent trade analysts and observers from various parts of the world...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of an econometric model of the world <b>sheepmeat</b> market. Sheepmeats are only of minor importance in the world meat trade, but New Zealand plays a major role within this market. Since the 1960 's the pattern of trade has changed markedly, with a decline in the main importing market, the UK, and a diversification of exports to several new markets such as Japan, North America and the Middle East. A dynamic, non-spatial price equilibrium model was constructed in order to quantify factors causing these changes and to determine the structural relationships in the new markets. By having global coverage, account can be taken of the interactions among the markets and world prices. At the same time the model provides a simulation instrument which is used for predicting the level of trade and prices through the 1980 's. The effects of various policies and market changes are assessed against a Base simulation...|$|E
40|$|Notable {{structural}} changes {{have taken place}} in the world <b>sheepmeat</b> market over the 1960 - 80 period. Imports into the major consuming countries of the EEC are declining as a result of changing tastes, higher import barriers and other factors. World exports have steadily increased however, and sales diversified into a number of alternative, expanding markets. Little quantitative information exists on these markets. An econometric model was constructed to analyse the changes on a global basis. The model covers production, consumption and trade in the main importing and exporting regions over a twenty one year period. These components form a dynamic, simultaneous system which solves for the world price. It allows the impact of changes in any particular market to be evaluated in terms of the effect on other markets and international prices. Simulation analysis is employed to test the effects of various shocks to the market, and to evaluate the impacts of certain policy changes, such as those recently implemented in the EEC. The changes are assessed against a Base simulation, which also provides a forecast of the market situation through the 1980 's. From the conclusions various policy implications are drawn with respect to NZ's exports...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy implementation on the agricultural markets of the eight new EU Member States. The study is based on the AGMEMOD (AGricultural MEmber states MODelling) national econometric models. Two scenarios are simulated for each country. The "Baseline" scenario assumes the implementation of the Single Area Payment Scheme until 2008 and the subsequent introduction of the Single Payment Scheme from 2009 onwards. Complementary national direct payments would remain in force until 2013. The second scenario assumes the full decoupling of direct payments from 2007 and the introduction of modulation from 2013 onwards in the 2004 enlargement new Member States (EU- 8). The baseline scenario projections suggest that the introduction of direct payments would expand EU- 8 aggregate production, mainly of oilseeds, grains, <b>sheepmeat</b> and cheese, while beef and veal production would also increase. Consumption of more expensive beef and veal meat would be substituted by poultry and pigmeat. Full decoupling of direct payments will have only a moderate impact on the balance of supply and use for crop and animal production. commodity markets, CAP reform, new Member States, econometric model, Marketing,...|$|E
40|$|In 1998, the New Zealand sheep {{industry}} exported approximately 347, 100 tonnes of <b>sheepmeat</b> {{to international}} markets. In 1996, {{the total number}} of sheep in the country was 47. 3 million head with 9. 5 million hectares dedicated to sheep and beef cattle enterprises. Traditionally, <b>sheepmeat</b> has been directed towards commodity markets, but a more recent strategy has been to target premium markets for specialised lamb cuts. Vertical co-ordination among participants in the New Zealand lamb meat supply chain (breeders, finishers, processors, marketers and retailers) is necessary to compete in premium markets overseas. New Zealand's seasonal pastoral systems are characterised by their heavy dependence on external variation (i. e. weather, market prices). Seasonal pasture production determines a well-defined lamb supply pattern and affects the price that farmers receive for their produce. Adequate price setting for vertically co-ordinated participants is therefore necessary in order to achieve a consistent supply of <b>sheepmeat</b> for international markets. Long-term contracts between New Zealand producers and processors would be a feasible vertical co-ordination mechanism. However, contracts can only be established if participants agree on product specifications and price. Farmers therefore need to know their cost of production on a $/kg lamb meat basis {{in order to be able}} to negotiate a price for their sheep. The aim of the research was to appraise the importance of vertical co-ordination through forward contracting for the New Zealand lamb industry and to assess measures to control the risk exposure of lamb producers and processors. The research also aimed to provide processors, finishers and breeders with a better understanding of producers' risk-return profiles. The source of physical and financial information was the New Zealand Sheep and Beef Cattle Farm Survey for the 1995 - 96 season. The software Stockpol® was used to simulate the biological performance of sheep enterprises on different pastoral production systems. Activity-Based Costing (ABC) was then applied to determine cost of lamb production for participants in the supply chain. A discrete stochastic programming (DSP) model was also developed to evaluate the impact of variation in lamb production cost for participants under alternative conditions for business and financial risk. Risk was considered by simulating different weather conditions and by varying biological production and financial parameters. The average cost of production of a kilogram of lamb meat at the farm gate for all farm classes was estimated at NZ$ 2. 88. This break-even point is the market price at which direct and overhead expenses, including the cost of capital, are covered. The average price received by farmers for lamb meat during the 1995 - 96 season analysed was NZ$ 1. 97 /kg. This price was NZ$ 2. 33 /kg in 1997 and the estimate price for 1998 is NZ$ 2. 13 /kg. This cost of production varied for the farm case studies according to their financial structure, biological efficiency parameters (lambing percentage, wool production lamb growth rates) and wool and lamb purchase prices. The simulation results showed that pasture production and utilisation (influenced mainly by weather conditions and farm management skills) has a big impact on the cost of lamb production. The modelling exercise suggested that a mix of contractual arrangements for the premium produce of the farm and spot market bargaining power for the remainder would be the optimum alternative for farm managers. The use of ABC for farm planning purposes can be considered as a means to control both 'risk exposure' and 'risk impacts'. The assessment of cost of production under possible scenarios of DM production could be used to evaluate innovative contractual arrangements between producers and processors. The study showed that supply chain synchronisation in the New Zealand lamb industry is necessary for targeting premium markets, and that a deep knowledge of participants' risk-return profiles is essential for building trust between participants in the supply chain. Traditionally, New Zealand farmers have worked in an adversarial environment, while new market requirements for their products require the opposite.

40|$|The New Zealand export meat {{industry}} has been through {{a considerable number of}} changes in the 1980 s. The deregulation of export slaughter facilities, Supplementary Minimum Prices, Producer Board intervention, declining livestock numbers and domestic cost pressures have all affected the performance of the domestically based processing sector. Major changes in market access and demand have influenced off-shore marketing operations, particularly for sheepmeats. Additionally, there has been a change in the type of meat exported with a greater proportion of further processed product shipped in recent years. As an example of the impact of these developments on livestock producers, the producer share of the United Kingdom wholesale market return for a representative prime lamb carcase has fallen from 40 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1988. In this article the pattern of intervention in the New Zealand pastoral meat industries from the mid- 1960 s is detailed, emphasising the different environments of the beef and <b>sheepmeat</b> enterprises. Then the principal factors influencing domestic processing margins for these products are empirically examined. Alternative model specifications and alternative estimation techniques are compared and contrasted. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of the historical patterns of assistance and structural change, and in terms of current rationalisation pressures on the meat processing sector.
