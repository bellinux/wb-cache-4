2500|$|In cricket, the <b>stumps</b> are {{the three}} {{vertical}} posts that support the [...] "bails" [...] and form the wicket. <b>Stumping</b> or being <b>stumped</b> is a method of dismissing a batsman.|$|R
25|$|If a bowler's {{delivery}} {{hits the}} <b>stumps</b> and if {{at least one}} bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} the <b>stumps,</b> the striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in the <b>stump's</b> spigots). The ball can either have struck the <b>stumps</b> directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not bowled out if the ball is touched by a fielder or touched by the wicket-keeper or the umpire before hitting the <b>stumps.</b> The batsman is not out if the bails remain on the <b>stumps.</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of inoculation of beech and oak <b>stumps</b> with a biological preparation of oyster fungus (Pleurotus ostreatus) mycelium. The inoculum was grown on a sawdust substrate at Warsaw University of Life Sciences Department of Mycology and Forest Phytopathology. The experiment was set up at the Forest Experimental Station in Rogów. <b>Stumps</b> were inoculated: i) immediately after tree felling or ii) at approximately 5 and 12 months after felling. A total of 60 beech <b>stumps</b> and 50 oak <b>stumps</b> were inoculated in the years 2002 - 2004. The infected <b>stumps</b> were then inspected for the presence of the mycelium and fruiting bodies of P. ostreatus. The presence of fruiting bodies of other wood-decaying fungi was also noted. The extent of rotting was determined macroscopically, with the causal agent being confirmed on the basis of isolation and identification of mycelium from fragments of colonized wood obtained from rooted-out <b>stumps.</b> Oyster fungus mycelium was found to colonise beech <b>stumps</b> much more effectively than oak <b>stumps.</b> <b>Stumps</b> inoculated immediately after, or five months after felling were more effectively colonized by the mycelium than those inoculated after one year.

40|$|Although conifer <b>stumps</b> can {{constitute}} {{a large proportion}} of the volume of wood remaining in clearcuts, the amount and pattern of use of conifer <b>stumps</b> by bats and other vertebrates is poorly known. We made 18 168 observations of conifer <b>stumps</b> in four clearcuts to examine use of bark crevices on conifer <b>stumps</b> in clearcuts in western Oregon, USA. Use of bark crevices by vertebrates did not exceed 1. 5 % of the <b>stumps</b> searched during any survey with upper 95 % confidence intervals not exceeding 5 %. Ten species of vertebrates were observed using bark crevices, with the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) most often detected. Use of <b>stumps</b> by bats was primarily limited to long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis). Most <b>stumps</b> used by vertebrates were relatively large Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) <b>stumps</b> located in open areas. Although bark crevices on conifer <b>stumps</b> in clearcuts provide habitat for some species of vertebrates they do not provide the breadth or long-term value as habitat for bats and other vertebrates as snags. Management of roost structures for bats, including the long-eared myotis, should focus on maintaining present and future availability of snags in an area.

5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl {{the ball at}} the leg <b>stump</b> or for batsmen to hit on the leg side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used leg theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg <b>stump</b> and the fielders placed on that side of the field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in county cricket.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{then lifted}} Laker for another six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head. The English captain, noted {{for his ability}} to break {{partnerships}} with his occasional bowling, brought himself on. Miller responded by striking a four over long on from Yardley's bowling to reach 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. The English skipper responded by stacking the leg side with outfielders and bowled outside leg <b>stump,</b> challenging Miller to attempt another hit for six. Yardley bowled a half-volley outside leg <b>stump</b> and the batsman obliged, but edged the ball off the back of his bat onto wicket-keeper Evans' head and was caught by a forward-diving Edrich at short fine leg.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the striker}} steps {{in front of}} the crease to play the ball, leaving no part of his anatomy or the bat on the ground behind the crease, and the wicket-keeper is able to remove the bails from the wicket with the ball, then the striker is out. A <b>stumping</b> is most likely to be {{effected}} off slow bowling, or (less frequently) medium-paced bowling when the wicketkeeper is standing directly behind the <b>stumps.</b> A <b>stumping</b> is the only method of dismissal, from a wide delivery that the bowler gets credit for on the scoreboard. As wicket-keepers stand several yards back from the <b>stumps</b> to fast bowlers, stumpings are hardly ever effected off fast bowlers. [...] But a keeper may throw down the <b>stumps</b> and the batsman is still out <b>stumped</b> if he is out of his ground, but not attempting a run. [...] Similarly, the ball can bounce off a keeper (but not external non-usual wicketkeeping protective equipment, like a helmet) and break the <b>stumps</b> and still be considered a <b>stumping.</b>|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) applied inundatively {{to suppress}} insect pests {{are more likely}} to persist and establish in stable agroecosystems than in annual crops. We investigated a system of intermediate stability: three <b>stumps</b> harbouring the large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.; Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a major European forestry pest. We tested whether persistence of EPN Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) applied around <b>stumps</b> is maintained by recycling of EPN through pine weevils developing within <b>stumps.</b> Steinernema carpocapsae was detected in soil around and under the bark of treated tree <b>stumps</b> up to two years, but not 4 – 5 years after application. Differences in nematode presence between sites were better explained by tree species (pine or spruce) than soil type (mineral or peat).

40|$|Effects of <b>stumping</b> {{back on the}} {{performance}} of browsed or poorly developing Fraxinus angustifolia seedlings were investigated in the present study. One year old bareroot seedlings of F. angustifolia were planted at a spacing of 2 x 2 m in March, 2004.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first Test, West Indies were bowled out 296 as Grimmett took seven wickets, including Headley first ball. In the second innings, with West Indies 80 behind, Grimmett again attacked Headley's leg <b>stump.</b> After having his scoring restricted, Headley lost patience and after scoring 11 was stumped, trying to hit Grimmett. Bowled out for 249, West Indies lost by ten wickets. After scoring only three in the following tour match against Tasmania, Headley contributed 14 and two in an innings defeat in the second Test. After two heavy Test defeats for the tourists, some critics believed that the series was too one-sided and that some of the five Tests should be cancelled. Headley's poor run of form continued in the West Indian victory over Queensland and, having put on weight, he was also struggling with his fitness. In an effort to overcome Australia's leg <b>stump</b> attack Headley had altered his batting stance; instead of standing at right angles to the bowler, he turned his body more front-on, to enable him to improve his placement of the ball on the leg side. His quick footwork enabled him to alter his position if necessary to play the ball on the off side. He also eliminated from his strokes a risky cover drive he had developed on Caribbean pitches. During the third Test at Brisbane, Headley made his first substantial contribution to the series, after Australia scored 558 batting first. Facing Grimmett's leg side tactics, Headley managed to score freely, and forced Grimmett to alter to an off <b>stump</b> attack. With ten fours in total, Headley became the first West Indian to score a century against Australia, and was left 102 not out when West Indies were bowled out for 193. Forced to follow-on, West Indies were dismissed for 148 of which Headley made 28, the highest score of the innings. Ironmonger tricked him into playing the leg glance and he was caught by the wicket-keeper who had moved across in anticipation of the shot.|$|E
5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg <b>stump,</b> {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off <b>stump.</b> At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and the 1930s, {{the number}} of runs scored by batsmen, and the {{proportion}} of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play {{and the extent to which}} batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off <b>stump,</b> simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg <b>stump,</b> frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used in Australia in 1932–33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} collar {{diameter}} and lifting period on shoot biomass production of Teak (Tectona grandis Linn. F) <b>stumps</b> were investigated during the 2006 dry {{season on the}} research farm of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. The lifting period is time when planting of <b>stumps</b> is delayed. A 3 x 5 split-plot factorial experiment in randomized complete block design was used. The main aim was to determine suitable methods of converting teak seedlings into <b>stumps</b> and evaluate the consequences of delaying planting of teak <b>stumps</b> to enhance high amount of teak shoot production thus address the persistent problem of poor sprouting and low biomass productivity {{in the early stages}} of planted teak in large-scale planta-tion development in Ghana. Collar diameter of <b>stumps,</b> and time as well as the interaction of collar diameter and period of delay of planting <b>stumps</b> and the combined effects of these factors had significant effect on number of shoots per plot. The highest number of teak shoots was ob-tained from teak <b>stumps</b> of collar diameter of 2. 75 cm planted immediately after harvesting. For teak <b>stumps</b> of collar diameter of 2. 75 cm if planting is delayed for 4 weeks the number of shoots reduces to 25 % of its value if planted immediately.
