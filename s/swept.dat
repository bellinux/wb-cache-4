5|$|The {{explosive}} {{charges in}} HMS Campbeltown detonated {{at noon on}} 28 March 1942, and the dry dock was destroyed. Reports vary {{on the fate of}} the two tankers that were in the dock; they were either <b>swept</b> away by the wall of water and sunk, or <b>swept</b> {{to the far end of}} the dock, but not sunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 89–73. The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Rockies advanced to the NL Division Series where they <b>swept</b> the Philadelphia Phillies. After advancing, they <b>swept</b> the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series, winning their first pennant in franchise history. However, the Rockies were, in turn, <b>swept</b> in the 2007 World Series by the Boston Red Sox, ending their season. In baseball statistics the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E
5|$|A large wave {{breaking}} on {{the cliffs}} of Maré Island in New Caledonia <b>swept</b> away a spectator, who was presumed dead after the rough conditions delayed searching efforts. The storm disrupted classes and school activities {{in parts of}} the archipelago, but little to no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from the ovary, the egg is <b>swept</b> into the fallopian tube by the fimbria, which is a fringe of tissue {{at the end of}} each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.|$|E

After leaving Maverick, Morissette released her most recent album, Havoc and Bright Lights (2012) independently via Collective Sounds.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} plague <b>swept</b> through Europe and Anglo-Saxon England. Amongst its victims was Bishop Cedd, Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury, and Eorconbehrt of Kent. Æthelwold also died in 664.|$|E
5|$|At the {{far north}} end of {{platform}} 4 are {{the remains of the}} Ladywell Sidings, most of which was <b>swept</b> away by the ring road built in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{bottlenose}} dolphins {{that lived}} at the Marine Life Aquarium in Gulfport, Mississippi were <b>swept</b> away from their aquarium pool during Hurricane Katrina. They were later found and returned to captivity from the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was reported}} {{throughout the state}} of Sinaloa. A total of 26 neighborhoods were flooded with up to 4.9ft (1.5m) {{of water in the}} town of Culiacán, while a 14-year-old boy was <b>swept</b> away by a swollen river.|$|E
5|$|In 1519 and 1520, {{before the}} arrival of the Spanish in the region, a number of {{epidemics}} <b>swept</b> through southern Guatemala. At {{the same time as the}} Spanish were occupied with the overthrow of the Aztec empire, a devastating plague struck the Kaqchikel capital of Iximche, and the city of Q'umarkaj, capital of the K'iche', may also have suffered from the same epidemic. It is likely that the same combination of smallpox and a pulmonary plague <b>swept</b> across the entire Guatemalan Highlands. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% of the population of the highlands perished. Population levels in the Guatemalan Highlands did not recover to their pre-conquest levels until the middle of the 20th century. In 1666 pestilence or murine typhus <b>swept</b> through what is now the department of Huehuetenango. Smallpox was reported in San Pedro Saloma, in 1795. At the time of the fall of Nojpetén in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{the bridge}} was nearly {{destroyed}} after a live naval mine washed ashore close to the bridge during stormy weather. The mine briefly <b>swept</b> one of the pillars, but did not detonate.|$|E
5|$|In 1998–99, the Senators {{jumped from}} 14th in the {{previous}} season to third, with 103 points—the first 100-point season in club history. The team, however, took an embarrassing pratfall in the playoffs, being <b>swept</b> by Buffalo after scoring just three goals in the entire series.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Jenner {{appeared}} in the Adam Sandler comedy Jack and Jill in a scene with Al Pacino as an actor in a play. Like Can't Stop the Music, the film won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and <b>swept</b> every Razzie category.|$|E
5|$|It was {{threatened}} by a fire in 1874 that <b>swept</b> through the long grass and other vegetation of the south districts of the colony and reached Charles V's wall before burning out.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{people were}} killed in the Dominican Republic: two {{fishermen}} went missing at sea during the storm and the others were <b>swept</b> away by flood waters when rivers burst their banks in Guaricanos and Puerto Plata. Otherwise, the damage in the Dominican Republic was minimal.|$|E
5|$|October 30, 1991 — The 1991 Perfect Storm kills one {{man when}} he is <b>swept</b> off a bridge, and causes {{moderate}} to severe beach erosion.|$|E

5|$|September 12, 1979- Hurricane Frederic makes {{landfall}} {{near the}} Alabama/Mississippi border, having produced tropical storm force winds in the Dry Tortugas {{a few days}} before. The hurricane drops rainfall throughout the state and kills one person off Pensacola {{when a person is}} <b>swept</b> from their boat.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{was knocked}} {{unconscious}} and <b>swept</b> downstream. A third {{member of the}} group raised the alarm by mobile telephone by 14:05 (GMT), less than five minutes after Shaw had been <b>swept</b> away, and Devon and Cornwall Police, a Royal Navy helicopter and the Dartmoor Rescue Group were mobilised to search for Shaw. Believing that the weather conditions may be too bad for the helicopter to fly, members of the Dartmoor Rescue Group—a volunteer organisation which co-ordinates the four separate charities who undertake search and rescue operations on Dartmoor—set out on foot in an attempt to reach the scene of the accident.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 season {{started with}} a further {{reduction}} in teams. Harbin and Qiqihar combined into a single team and became {{owned and operated by}} the San Jose Sharks. They took the name of their new owner and became the China Sharks. Kangwon Land renamed to High1. With only seven teams, the league reduced the number of games played to its lowest at just 30 games. The league continued with an unbalanced schedule and the Korean and Chinese teams played each other more than the Japanese teams did. After three years of dominance, the Nippon Paper Cranes slipped to fourth place and the regular season was won by the Prince Rabbits. Alex Kim, playing for High1, recorded the most goals with 23 and most points with 51. Joel Prpic continued to find himself on top of the pack with 30 assists. With six of seven teams going to the playoffs, the Sharks were the only team that didn't find themselves in a playoff spot. The first round was over quickly as the Cranes <b>swept</b> Halla in three games and Oji did the same to the Ice Bucks. Nippon faced their rivals, the Rabbits, in the second round and defeated them three to one. High1 couldn't repeat their success from the previous year by winning a series and were <b>swept</b> by Oji in three games. For the first time, the final series was not between the Cranes and Rabbits. Oji continued to roll over their opponents and <b>swept</b> the Cranes, marking the only time a team in Asia League had <b>swept</b> its way through three rounds. Due to their dominance on the ice, the point race was also <b>swept</b> by Oji. Takeshi Saito led the playoffs with nine assists and 15 points, while Shane Endicott had the most goals with 6. Kunihiko Sakurai, also from Oji, won the MVP of the Year and Eum Hyun-seung, from High1, won the Young Guy of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|The F-84 {{nomenclature}} can {{be somewhat}} confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with <b>swept</b> wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop {{version of the}} F-84F. The F-84F <b>swept</b> wing version {{was intended to be}} a small variation of the normal Thunderjet with only a few different parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.|$|E
5|$|The Flames rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs in the 2016-17 season as the conference's first wild card seed, but they were <b>swept</b> by the Ducks {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Household Brigade {{crossed the}} crest of the Allied {{position}} and charged downhill. The cuirassiers guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, and so were <b>swept</b> over the deeply sunken main road and then routed.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} <b>swept</b> wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also <b>swept.</b> The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} sailed for the Far East on 8 April 1945 and {{was assigned}} convoy escort duties on arrival. On 2 July, they <b>swept</b> the {{approaches to the}} Nicobar Islands during Operation Collie and destroyed 167 mines. As the Pacific War was ending on 15 August, they <b>swept</b> the Strait of Malacca and the approaches to Singapore. Together with the light cruiser , Pelorus {{was one of the}} first British ships to re-enter Singapore harbour. She returned home in May 1946 and was paid off.|$|E
5|$|The other {{period of}} {{interruption}} occurred between 350 and 250 Ma when sporadic pulses of mud <b>swept</b> southward into the Death Valley region during {{the erosion of}} highlands in north-central Nevada.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of undigested {{food in the}} stomach and seed pods still {{in the mouth of}} many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure are likely. The maturity of this ingested vegetation places the time of death in autumn rather than in spring, when flowers would be expected. The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them. Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers, perhaps through being <b>swept</b> away by floods. In one location, by the Berelekh River in Yakutia in Siberia, more than 8,000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot, apparently having been <b>swept</b> there by the current.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{brought the}} {{heaviest}} rainfall totals to Dhofar in 30years, causing flooding and creating rivers in wadis, or typically dry riverbeds. Several people drowned after their vehicles were <b>swept</b> {{away by the}} flooding. The storm caused locally heavy damage, totaling $25million (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|Waves between 5 and 13feet (1.5–4meters) were {{reported}} along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maryland. A weather buoy in Outer Banks, North Carolina reported swells up to 10feet (3meters). One death occurred by drowning in New Jersey. A 37‑year‑old man {{was reported missing}} in New York City and presumed dead after his houseboat capsized in the heavy surf. Another houseboat also capsized, drowning a 58‑year‑old woman. On shore, a large wave <b>swept</b> two fishermen into the sea, where they drowned. Overall, four fatalities occurred {{in the state of}} New York. In Rhode Island two teenagers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after being <b>swept</b> into the water by the waves.|$|E
