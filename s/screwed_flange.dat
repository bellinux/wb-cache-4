40|$|Radiation {{leakages}} are {{a considerable}} problem when measuring waveguide structures at high frequencies. In {{order to maintain}} good electrical contact, flanges need to be tightly and evenly screwed to the device under test. This can be a time-consuming operation, especially with repeated measurements. We present a metamaterial-based adapter, which prohibits leakage even {{in the presence of}} gaps at the interconnects. This so-called gap adapter has been fabricated from a metallized polymer (SU 8). The reflection coefficient is below - 20 dB throughout the band for a 50 -mu m gap {{on both sides of the}} gap adapter. In comparison, a conventional waveguide with a 50 -mu m gap on both sides has a reflection coefficient of - 10 dB. The gap adapter can be used to perform fast measurements, since the normal <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> are redundant. We compare the SU 8 gap adapter with a Si version and to a smooth metal waveguide reference disc. The SU 8 gap adapter performed better than the Si version and much better than the waveguide disc in all test cases. SU 8 gap adapters were used to measure on a waveguide component. The SU 8 gap adapters with 50 -mu m gaps performed comparable with the waveguide component with the <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> carefully tightened. The polymer also makes the gap adapter mechanically robust and easy to mass fabricate. [2015 - 0113...|$|R
50|$|These metal drums {{have two}} {{openings}} with flanges (2 in NPS and Â¾ in NPS). Once the drums are filled, the plugs (bungs) are <b>screwed</b> in the <b>flanges</b> using pneumatic or hand operated bung tightener (plug wrench). To secure {{the contents of}} the drums against theft and adulteration during shipment, cap-seals made of metal and other types like metal-plastic laminates are used. These cap-seals sit on top of the flanges and are crimped, using a drum cap-seal crimping tool, also called a drum cap sealer. Once cap-seals are crimped, the plugs can be unscrewed only by breaking these cap-seals. Pneumatic and hand-operated cap-seal crimping tools are available. Pneumatic ones are used in production lines for high production.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first micromachined {{double-sided}} contactless WR 03 pin-flange adapter for 220 - 325 GHz based on gap waveguide technology. The pin-flange adapter {{is used to}} avoid leakage at the interface of two waveguides even when a gap between them is present and can be fitted onto any standard WR 03 waveguide flange. Tolerance measurements were performed with gaps ranging from 30 - 100 mu m. The performance of the micromachined pin flange {{has been compared to}} a milled pin flange, a choke flange and to standard waveguide connections. The micromachined pin flange is shown to have better performance than the standard connection and similar performance to the milled pin flange and choke flange. The benefits of micromachining over milling are the possibility to mass produce pin flanges and the better accuracy in the 2 D design. Measurements were performed with and without <b>screws</b> fixing the <b>flanges.</b> The flanges have also been applied to measure two devices, a straight rectangular waveguide of 1. 01 inch and a ridge gap resonator. In all cases, the micromachined pin flange performed flawlessly while the standard flange experienced significant losses at already small gaps...|$|R

Cementless PKR depends on bone growing into the implant surface for long-term fixation. Implant loosening may occur {{due to high}} tensile strain resulted from large mechanical loads during rehab exercises. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate whether external fixations such as superior <b>screw</b> and frontal <b>flange</b> could reduce the tensile strain at the implant-bone interface. Three medial PKRs were designed. The first PKR had no external fixations.

Finite element analysis was performed to examine the tensile strain at the implant-bone interface during weight-bearing exercises. The PKR with no external fixations exhibited high tensile strain at the anterior implant-bone interface. Both the screwed and flanged PKRs effectively reduced the tensile strain at the anterior implant-bone interface. Furthermore, the flanged PKR resulted in a more uniform reduction of the tensile strain than the screwed PKR. In conclusion, external fixations are necessary to alleviate tensile strain at the implant-bone interface during knee rehab exercises...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Corrugated web girders {{emerged in}} the past two decades. Their main {{advantages}} consists in the possibility to use slender webs avoiding the risk of premature local buckling. Consequently, higher moment capacity might be obtained increasing the beam depth with really thin webs, which are stiffened by the corrugations. Increased interest for this solution was observed for the main frames of single-storey steel buildings and steel bridges. A new solution was proposed at the Politehnica University of Timisoara, in which the beam is composed by a web of trapezoidal steel sheet and flanges of back-to-back lipped channel steel sections. This solution uses self-drilling <b>screws</b> for connecting <b>flanges</b> to the web and to ensure the continuity of the web as seam fasteners. Starting from this new technological solution the paper extends and investigates the use of spot welding as seam fastening to build the web, in order to increase the degree of automation of fabrication. Experimental work of specimens in shear having two or three layers of steel sheets connected by spot welding will be presented. The results will be implemented on a numerical model in order to study the behaviour of the beams presented above...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{ultrasonic}} sandwich type transducer {{was designed}} for preventing and cleaning the undesired calcarous depositions on the inner walls of heat exchanger and pipes. It uses as active elements two piezoceramic rings sandwiched between a cylindrical back end part of stainless steel and a front end piece of duraluminum, terminated with a convex shaped stainless steel tip. The whole construction is clamped by a hardened steel bolt at a prestressed pressure of about 25 MPa. The transducer works in immerse regime being tightly <b>screwed</b> in a <b>flange</b> of the heat exchanger. The ring shaped piezoceramic active elements are made of a special lead titanate zirconate material, whose main piezoelectric properties do not change significantly up to temperatures of 200 o C, so that the transducer can be effectively used in hot water with high efficiency. The ultrasonic vibrations produced by the piezoactive elements, when excited by an electric signal from a high frequency high power generator, are transmmited and amplified by the front end cap and diffused within the water by the convex shaped stainless steel tip, so that one prevents, to a high percentage, any undesired deposition on the metallic wall because both water and walls are in permanent vibration. The transducer can be easy used with any type of heat exchanger just by changing and adapting the screwed part of the front end piece...|$|R

Transport of the system will typically be north of the Wye Barricade between WRAP and the 222 -S Laboratory. The samples are intended to conform to the US Department of Transportation (DOT) regulation 49 CFR 1 73. 4, ``Exceptions for small quantities. `` The regulations require prototype testing of the package to demonstrate the effectiveness of the packaging system. The test procedure consisted of one 24 -hour compression test and five drop tests of various orientations onto an unyielding drop pad. The testing of the Sample Transfer Canister System was performed between February 16, 1998 and February 25, 1998. The results of the testing concluded that the Sample Transfer Canister System successfully met the testing requirements with certain modifications to the original system. The modifications included replacing the original eight <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> which were cold rolled 316 stainless steel with greater strength grade 8 high carbon-carbon steel screws, replacing the initial two glass receptacles with a better performing single glass receptacle which proved not to leak during testing, and adding more bubble wrap as extra padding...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} high {{frequency}} antennas is rapidly increasing {{with the development}} of new wireless rate communication technology. Planar antennas have an attractive form factor, but they require a distribution network. Microstrip technology is most commonly used at low frequency but suffers from large dielectric and ohmic losses at higher frequencies and particularly above 100 GHz. Substrate-integrated waveguides also suffer from dielectric losses. In addition, standard rectangular waveguide interfaces are inconvenient due to the four <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> that must be tightly fastened to the antenna to avoid leakage. The current paper presents a planar slot array antenna that does not suffer from any of these problems. The distribution network is realized by micromachining using low-loss gap waveguide technology, and it can be connected to a standard rectangular waveguide flange without using any screws or additional packaging. To realize the antenna at these frequencies, it was fabricated with micromachining, which offers the required high precision, and a low-cost fabrication method. The antenna was micromachined with DRIE in two parts, one silicon-on-insulator plate and one Si plate, which were both covered with Au to achieve conductivity. The input reflection coefficient was measured to be below 10 dB over a 15. 5 % bandwidth, and the antenna gain was measured to be 10. 4 dBi, both of which are in agreement with simulations...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) {{scattering}} parameters (S-parameters) {{play an important}} role to characterise RF signal transmission and reflection of active and passive devices such as transmission lines, components, and small-signal amplifiers. Vector network analysers (VNAs) are employed as instrumentation for such measurements. During the last years, the upper frequency limit of this instrumentation has been extended up to several hundreds of GHz for waveguide measurements. Calibration and verification procedures are obligatory prior to the VNA measurement to achieve accurate results and/or to obtain traceability to the International System of Units (SI). Usually, verification is performed by measuring well-matched devices with known S-parameters such as attenuators or short precision waveguide sections (shims). In waveguides, especially above 110 GHz, such devices may not exist and/or are not traceably calibrated. In some cases, e. g. filter networks, the devices under test (DUT) are partly highly reflective. This paper describes the dependency of the S-parameters a) on the calibration procedure, b) on the applied torque to the <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> during the mating process of the single waveguide elements. It describes further c) how highly-reflective devices (HRD) can be used to verify a calibrated VNA, and d) how a measured attenuation at several hundreds of GHz can be substituted by a well-known coaxial attenuation at 279 MHz, the intermediate frequency (IF) of the VNA, to verify the linearity. This work is a contribution towards traceability and to obtain knowledge about the measurement uncertainty of VNA instrumentation in the millimetre-wave range...|$|R
40|$|Osseointegration {{is vital}} to the success of total knee arthroplasty. This {{intimate}} bone integration however, mostly occured on the femoral component but not on the tibial component. Failure to achieve sufficient primary fixation of the tibial component has been regarded as the major factor affecting bone growth. The problem would be more apparent under eccentric loading which created complex rocking motions in both flexion and extension during gait. Fixation features in terms of protrusion on the undersurface of the tibial component include <b>flange,</b> <b>screws</b> and stem. In this study, the effect of three fixation features under physiological loading was analysed using non-linear contact finite element analysis. Three dimensional model of a human tibia was reconstructed from CT dataset. Three different tibial compartments Ã¢â¬â the cross-flange, the linear flange and the tapered cylindrical shaft Ã¢â¬â were modeled without the polymeric tibial insert. The component was then positioned on the tibial plateau and bone preparation was virtually simulated. Each model was then meshed with solid tetrahedrals and material properties were assigned to the bone and the prostheses. Coefficient of friction between the bone and the implant was set to 0. 3. Pressure was applied on the medial plateau with magnitude corresponds to an eccentric load of 1250 N. Non-linear contact analysis was performed on each of the three components, together with a validated micromotion algorithm to predict instability at the bone-implant interface. Results showed that the cross flange was the most stable under eccentric load with micromotion values did not exceed the threshold limit for osseointegration...|$|R
40|$|Many {{years of}} {{technological}} development and surgical experience in total hip arthroplasty, {{have increased the}} lifetime of implants to 15 years for 80 % of young patients (65). Complications after a primary hip implant often lead to a revision surgery as the only option to reconstruct the functionality of the hip joint. Loosening, failure or removal of implant components regularly involve bone loss, resulting in revision after revision surgery, leading to large acetabular defects and even pelvic dissociations. For these patients, a custom implant based on medical images is a new solution with good short to mid-term results. However, {{the complexity of the}} technology and the labor-intensive design process makes these implants very expensive for both the patient and the healthcare system. The goal of this thesis is to use state-of-the-art methods to reduce the implant design time, standardize the design process and improve the quality of the implants {{to take full advantage of}} the potential of patient-specific implant solutions. Before designing an implant, CT-images need to be segmented to make a 3 D-model of the pre-operative situation. Next, failed implant components need to be virtually removed. To determine the best treatment, it is important to quantify the bone loss and to consider biomechanical balancing of the contralateral hip joint. In this thesis, a statistical shape model of a healthy hemi-pelvis was constructed and an automatic method to compute a virtual anatomical reconstruction of a defect hemi-pelvis was developed. The reconstruction was later used to improve an existing bone loss quantification method, resulting in a more clinically relevant bone defect quantification. Finally, the shape model was used to determine the anatomical coordinate system of the pelvis, that is crucial for the positioning of the cup component of the implant and the biomechanical balancing compared to the contralateral hip joint center. The custom hip implant consists of a cup component, connected by three flanges that bridge the bone defect and are anchored in the remaining bone via <b>flange</b> <b>screws.</b> Underneath the <b>flanges</b> and around the cup, a porous structure is designed, filling the defect and allowing for bone ingrowth. Because the cup component is the most crucial component regarding biomechanics of the hip joint and because the rest of the implant is designed around this cup, research was done into objective cup evaluators that allow to compare different cup plannings. These evaluators were then used to develop an automatic cup optimization algorithm. Because every implant is unique, it is a challenge to guarantee the mechanical integrity of an implant during a normal implant lifetime. For economical reasons, this needs to be assessed without producing a copy of the implant and performing mechanical tests. Therefore, an automatic virtual mechanical test bench was developed using a finite element model, to allow identification and adaptation of weak spots in implants, during the implant design process. Through a validation experiment, it was shown that the virtual test bench gave good indications about the weak spots in the implant design that are prone to fatigue failure. In this research, a major step was taken in the direction of economically viable custom implants, by speeding up and standardizing the design process and improving the quality of the implants. Therefore, we expect that in the future it will be viable to bring custom implants to the market for patients with less severe bone defects. In that way, suboptimal solutions using standard revision components can be avoided. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate aspects of hybrid joint design for a shear connection. Part 1 is design considerations and a case study based on a engine mount. In Part 2, an experimental study is conducted regarding how relaxation and creep affects properties of a hybrid joint between carbon fiber vinylester and steel. Failure modes, loss of clamped force and ultimate strength of the joint and how these are affected by elevated temperature and different clamped forces are presented. Test specimens were 184 Ã 45 Ã 5 mm CFRP, in double lap joint between two steel plates of same dimensions, with either a single or double M 10 hexagon <b>flange</b> <b>screw.</b> Creep/ relaxation testing was preformed over a 28 day period. Results shows that the amount of initial clamped force does not effect amount of loss of clamped force, but increase in temperature significantly does. Average loss was between 8. 3 an 8. 8 % for single joint specimens, initial torque of 28, 37 and 46 Nm, and 10. 8 % for double joint specimens, 37 Nm. But losses for specimens subjected to heat, 80 Â°C, was 35. 5 %. Ultimate bearing strength of the lamina was not effected by any circumstances. Slip load was lower for specimens clamped with lower clamped force, the loss over the 28 day period was not enough to produced any clear results regarding the amount of loss. But tendencies point towards a lowered slip load of the same magnitude as the loss of clamped force i. e around 8 - 9 %. Slip load for specimens subjected to 80 Â°C did not decreased, even though the clamped force had been lowered. All specimens fail in bearing, single bolted joints had a far more progressive failure than the double joints, which failed catastrophically...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The work {{sets forth}} the search results of new, more {{efficient}} design solutions for metal silos, namely, {{the analysis of}} existing types of profiles cross-section in a steel wall of such silo and development of less material-intensive section of corrugated profile. Methodology. To achieve the set goal there were researched the existing types of capacitive structure profiles and their strain-stress state under the load. The analysis {{was performed on the}} results of computational experiments. The prototype object was mathematical computer models. The calculations were made using the finite-element method. For computational experiment there was used the design-computing system Structure CAD for Windows. Findings. In this work there were obtained the data allowing to assess work of the profiles and to find more effective type of cross-section in terms of its material consumption. In the process of joint study of the authors a new type of profile for capacitive structures was developed; it has higher utilization efficiency and the attachment point of individual steel sheets with this type of profile. Both solutions are easy to install, reliable in operation and can be manufactured in the conditions of modern industrial production using standard equipment, materials and components. Originality. A new type of corrugated profile cross-section for steel silo walls was proposed; it has higher load carrying capacity and rigidity and allows reducing the metal thickness without changing the structure carrying capacity that results in material consumption reduction of the whole structure. For this and similar types of profiles there was designed and proposed the attachment point of individual corrugated sheets <b>screwed</b> with extending <b>flange,</b> which enables the unit connection in case of small size corrugations, where the distance is not sufficient to accommodate the bolt cap between the individual corrugations. Practical value. Application of the proposed solutions can increase efficiency, manufacturability and maintainability of steel silo wall structures. The results obtained during the research show promise for further development of research on finding new and more economic solutions for corrugated steel silo wall design, as well as other ways to reduce material consumption of bulk material storage structures...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb stud assembly tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	<b>Screw</b> location (both <b>flanges</b> and single flange). Based on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing â Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b]. A proposal is also recommended to revise the wording in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing â Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b] to include provisions for the design of jamb studs based on the results of this research...|$|R
