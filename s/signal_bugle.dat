40|$|Half {{century has}} been almost passed since a marching which is a new musical {{expression}} was introduced to Japan from United states. Initially a <b>signal</b> <b>bugle</b> was used same as Unite States and still had lots of affection from military band, however, it is getting recognized as purely entertainer show require highly skilled musical techniques. A concept of Japanese marching is shifting from “Play with moving” towards “Move with playing” Here I would like to consider and suggest a future vision of Japanese marching, {{not only as a}} copy of American marching, but also one of Japanese new music culture and as an educational opportunity towards younger generations...|$|E

500|$|The British {{followed}} in rapid pursuit. [...] As they advanced, the British light troops <b>signalled</b> with <b>bugle</b> calls, which to Colonel Joseph Reed were {{reminiscent of a}} fox hunt, and seemed to him to be intended as an insult. [...] Probably about this time, the Second and Third battalions of British light infantry, along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements. Reed, who had met Knowlton, rode to Washington {{to tell him what}} was going on and encouraged him to reinforce the rangers. Instead of retreating, Washington, in what Edward G. Lengel calls [...] "an early glimmer of the courage and resolve that would rally the Continentals from many a tight spot later on", [...] devised a plan to entrap the British light troops. Washington would have some troops make a feint, in order to draw the British down into an area of open ground known as 'The Hollow Way', and then send a detachment of troops around to trap the British.|$|R
60|$|He spoke, sometimes, {{of these}} things to Mary, when they were {{together}} alone. She knew that numbers of young men were only waiting his signal to join him; that parties of them met him among the hills, and were there organized into companies, each with officers of their own choice over them; and that, unknown to the Romans at Scythopolis, there were daily held, throughout the country {{on both sides of}} the Jordan, meetings where men practiced with their arms, improved their skill with the bow and arrow, and learned to obey the various <b>signals</b> of the <b>bugle,</b> which John had now elaborated.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese and French were {{separated}} by {{a distance of about}} 100 metres. The situation called for regular, controlled volleys by the French, but the excited sailors were firing individually into the bushes, as fast as they could. Boulineau realised that they were simply wasting their ammunition. He repeatedly yelled orders to his men to cease fire, but {{only a small part of}} his command could hear him. No <b>bugle</b> <b>signals</b> could be sent, as Boulineaus bugler had been shot dead shortly after the start of the action. The French line continued to waste its ammunition on an elusive target.|$|R
2500|$|But the {{strategy}} failed {{when he realized}} that the Tonkawa had removed the white bands he had ordered them to put on their heads so he could differentiate between Indian allied and enemy warriors in the heat of battle. [...] (Ford and the most experienced Indian fighters probably could tell the difference, as the Comanche used distinctive dress, headdress, (Buffalo horns), and paint, but most of his men could not tell one from the other. [...] Seeing the Tonkawa apparently getting far the worse of the fighting, he <b>signaled</b> them with <b>bugles</b> to retreat. [...] As the Tonkawa withdrew, Ford then ordered a wholesale charge by his Rangers and Militia.|$|R
50|$|At {{some time}} in mid morning the knights would line up for the charge (estor). At a <b>signal,</b> a <b>bugle</b> or herald's cry, the lines would ride {{at each other and}} meet with {{levelled}} lances. Those remaining on horseback would turn quickly (the action which gave the tournament its name) and single out knights to attack. There is evidence that squires were present at the lists (the staked and embanked line in front of the stands) to offer their masters up to three replacement lances. The mêlée would tend then to degenerate into running battles between parties of knights seeking to take ransoms, and would spread over several square miles between the two settlements which defined the tournament area. Most tournaments continued till both sides were exhausted, or till the light faded. A few ended earlier, if one side broke in the charge, panicked and ran for its home base looking to get behind its lists and the shelter of the armed infantry which protected them. Following the tournament the patron of the day would offer lavish banquets and entertainments. Prizes were offered to the best knight on either side, and awarded during the meals.|$|R

In early 1919 disagreements arose between González and Guajardo, and after learning of these, Zapata wrote a letter to Guajardo, asking him to join the Zapatistas. The letter was intercepted by González who blackmailed Guajardo and used it as an opportunity to set up an ambush for Zapata. Guajardo, after making a show of loyalty to Zapata by executing a turn coat Zapatista chief, Victoriano Barcena, arranged a meeting with Zapata at Chinameca Hacienda at which he was supposed to deliver badly needed ammunitions. After Zapata arrived,on April 10, 1919, a guard of honor presented arms to him, but on the third <b>signal</b> of the <b>bugle</b> they opened up fire at point blank range, killing Zapata.|$|R

In the 146th Infantry Brigade area on the right flank, the 4th Lincolns and tanks of the 24th Lancers advanced and after an hour, their field radios became ineffective and the infantry struggled to keep direction, shouting to identify themselves as they advanced through mist, smoke and mortar bombs.

5000|$|Classic {{drum and}} bugle corps are musical {{ensembles}} that descended from military bugle and drum units returning from World War I and succeeding wars. Traditionally, drum and bugle corps served as signaling units {{as early as}} before the American Civil War, with these signaling units having descended in some fashion from ancient drum and fife corps. With {{the advent of the}} radio, <b>bugle</b> <b>signaling</b> units became obsolete and surplus equipment was sold to veteran organizations (such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion, two major organizers for classic drum corps). These organizations formed drum and bugle corps of civilians and veterans, and the corps performed in community events and local celebrations. Over time, rivalries between corps emerged and the competitive drum and bugle corps circuit evolved. The term [...] "classic" [...] is used {{for the purposes of this}} article to differentiate it from modern drum and bugle corps, using the time period of the establishment of Drum Corps International as a dividing point in the timeline of the two types of drum and bugle corps. Modern drum and bugle corps are a continuation of the classic variety, for all intents and purposes, having the same origins, though some corps in the [...] "classic" [...] model do still exist.|$|R
5000|$|Eager {{to engage}} and defeat {{one of the}} American frigates that had already scored a number of {{victories}} over the Royal Navy in single-ship confrontations, Broke prepared a challenge. [...] had already {{slipped out of the}} harbour under the cover of fog and had evaded the British. Constitution was undergoing extensive repairs and alterations and would not be ready for sea in the foreseeable future. However, Chesapeake appeared to be ready to put to sea. Consequently Broke decided to challenge Chesapeake, which had been refitting in Boston harbour under the command of Captain James Lawrence, offering single ship-to-ship combat. Whilst patrolling offshore, Shannon had intercepted and captured a number of American ships attempting to reach the harbour. After sending two of them off to Halifax, he found that his crew was being dangerously reduced. Broke therefore resorted to burning the rest of the prizes in order to conserve his highly trained crew in anticipation of the battle with Chesapeake. The boats from the burnt prizes were sent into Boston, carrying Broke's oral invitation to Lawrence to come out and engage him. Broke had already sent Tenedos away {{in the hope that the}} more favourable odds would entice the Americans out, but eventually began to despair that Chesapeake would ever come out of the harbour. He finally decided to send a written challenge. In this he was copying his adversary. Lawrence had earlier in the war, when captain of the sloop of war , sent a written invitation to the captain of the British sloop of war [...] to a single-ship contest. Lawrence's offer had been declined. As the Chesapeake appears now ready for sea, I request you will do me the favour to meet the Shannon with her, ship to ship, to try the fortune of our respective flags. The Shannon mounts twenty-four guns upon her broadside and one light boat-gun; 18 pounders upon her maindeck, and 32-pounder carronades upon her quarterdeck and forecastle; and is manned with a complement of 300 men and boys, beside thirty seamen, boys, and passengers, who were taken out of recaptured vessels lately. I entreat you, sir, not to imagine that I am urged by mere personal vanity to the wish of meeting the Chesapeake, or that I depend only upon your personal ambition for your acceding to this invitation. We have both noble motives. You will feel it as a compliment if I say that the result of our meeting may be the most grateful service I can render to my country; and I doubt not that you, equally confident of success, will feel convinced that it is only by repeated triumphs in even combats that your little navy can now hope to console your country for the loss of that trade it can no longer protect. Favour me with a speedy reply. We are short of provisions and water, and cannot stay long here. Philip Broke Captain Lawrence did not in fact receive Broke's letter and, according to author Ian W.

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 37 : 45 in lengthComposed in 1802, Ludwig van Beethoven???s 15 Variations and Fugue {{is a very}} challenging piece for the pianist. For this set of variations, Beethoven took a theme from his own contradance (WoO 14 of 1800 - 01) and he used the same theme in his Prometheus ballet music. Also, an interesting fact is that these variations were written earlier than the Third Symphony, with which they share their name, ???Eroica???. These variations do not start with the theme itself, but {{with the introduction of}} a bass ostinato which develops into variations on its own by adding two, three and four voices. Only after establishing the bass ostinato does the theme enter for the first time, followed by 15 variations and culminating with the four voice Fugue. The Fantasia in F minor Opus 49 composed in 1840 - 1841 by Frederick Chopin is rich with diverse ideas. It had been called a ???symphony for the piano,??? ???possibly Chopin???s most impressive single movement. ??? Most of the ideas in this work are derived melodically from the opening march-like theme. The music reflects picture-like images among which are an introduction, three marches, the second theme and the ending theme. Contrasting with these marches are the agitated main theme and the energetic transition to a majestic hymn {{in the center of the}} development. Another stormy transition leads to the recapitulation of the main theme and the last march. The Fantasia ends with the last statement of the recitative that flows into a rapid passage culminating in a cadence in A-flat major. At the end of the summer of 1911 Rachmaninov wrote nine piano pieces, Op. 33. At the first performance in St. Petersburg on December 5, 1911, the pieces were called preludes-Tableaux and only several days later at the Moscow premiere on December 13, the cycle received the name we know today, Etudes-Tableaux. The composer later called E-flat major Etude-Tableau ???the Fair. ??? Joyful ringing of bells and fanfares alternates with a happy song. The last calls of the fanfares end the etude. The next etude in G minor reminds us, by its mood, of Chopin???s G minor Ballade. Both pieces (Ballade and Etude) end with a G minor scale and two sorrowful chords. The melody of the etude is divided into two registers and has a feel of a conservation between the two hands. The lower register response is rhythmically compressed and has a descending half step instead of a whole step, otherwise the melodies are identical. Originally, the composer took the etude in D minor out of the cycle. A stern choral song-march alternates with distant <b>signals</b> of the <b>bugle.</b> By its thematic material and images this etude resembles the first movement of the first symphony (D minor, Op. 13) and the last theme of the Third Piano concerto (D minor, op. 30).
