5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat <b>scales</b> <b>as</b> opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|Foundational {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally diatonic) <b>scales</b> <b>as</b> music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E

5|$|Pholiota flammans, {{commonly}} known as the yellow pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap, is a basidiomycete agaric mushroom of the genus Pholiota. Its fruit body is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its cap and stem are covered in sharp <b>scales.</b> <b>As</b> it is a saprobic fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the stumps of dead coniferous trees. P.flammans is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in boreal and temperate regions. Its edibility has not been clarified.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many radio {{versions}} of the play. In 1925 the BBC broadcast an adaptation with Hesketh Pearson as Jack Worthing. Further broadcasts of the play followed in 1927 and 1936.

5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing <b>scales</b> <b>as</b> well as to the tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E

5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and <b>scales,</b> <b>as</b> well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} for feathers in tyrannosauroids {{came from the}} small species Dilong paradoxus, found in the Yixian Formation of China, and reported in 2004. As with many other theropods discovered in the Yixian, the fossil skeleton was preserved with a coat of filamentous structures which are commonly recognized as the precursors of feathers. Because all known skin impressions from larger tyrannosauroids known at the time showed evidence of scales, the researchers who studied Dilong speculated that feathers may correlate negatively with body size—that juveniles may have been feathered, then shed the feathers and expressed only <b>scales</b> <b>as</b> the animal became larger and no longer needed insulation to stay warm. Subsequent discoveries showed that even some large tyrannosauroids had feathers covering much of their bodies, casting doubt on the hypothesis {{that they were a}} size-related feature.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid <b>scales</b> (<b>as</b> opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or {{physical}} feature), a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time <b>scales,</b> <b>as</b> they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.|$|E
