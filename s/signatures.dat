40|$|In this paper, on {{the basis}} of Guilin Wang's proxy <b>signature</b> scheme and the Schnorr blind <b>signature,</b> we propose a secure proxy blind <b>signature</b> scheme. A proxy blind <b>signature</b> scheme is a digital <b>signature</b> scheme which {{combines}} the properties of a proxy <b>signature</b> and a blind <b>signature</b> scheme. Guilin Wang proposed a provably secure proxy <b>signature</b> scheme, which is based on a two-party Schnorr <b>signature</b> scheme. Also, using the proposed proxy blind <b>signature</b> scheme, we propose the proxy agent system for the electronic voting. We show the proposed scheme satisfies the security properties of both the blind <b>signature</b> and the proxy <b>signature</b> scheme and is efficient and optimal proxy blind <b>signature</b> scheme. ▸Keywords: digital <b>signature,</b> proxy <b>signature,</b> blind <b>signature,</b> public key cryptography, proxy agent, opimal algorith...|$|R

5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he {{was removed from the}} ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 <b>signatures</b> his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid <b>signatures</b> to be on the ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot. The vast majority of the rejected <b>signatures</b> were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>signature</b> file {{method is}} a popular {{indexing}} technique used in information retrieval and databases. It excels in efficient index maintenance and lower space overhead. Different approaches for organizing <b>signature</b> files have been proposed, such as sequential <b>signature</b> files, bit-slice files, S-trees, and its different variants, as well as <b>signature</b> trees. In this paper, we extends the structure of <b>signature</b> trees by introducing multiple-bit checkings. That is, during the searching of a <b>signature</b> tree against a query <b>signature</b> s q, more than one bit in s q will be checked each time when a node is encountered. This does not only reduce significantly {{the size of a}} <b>signature</b> tree, but also increases the filtering ability of the <b>signature</b> tree. We call such a structure a general <b>signature</b> tree. Experiments have been made, showing that the general <b>signature</b> tree uniformly outperforms the <b>signature</b> tree approach...|$|R

Biometrics can be classified into two types Behavioral (<b>signature</b> verification, keystroke dynamics, etc.) and Physiological (iris characteristics, fingerprint, etc.). <b>Signature</b> and Finger Print verifications are most widely used personal verifications and {{are one of the}} first few biometrics used even before computers. <b>Signature</b> verification is widely studied and discussed using two approaches. On-line approach and offline approach. Online <b>signature</b> verification represents the dynamic information related to <b>signature</b> which is captured at the time when <b>signature</b> made. The offline <b>signature</b> verification represents the static information of <b>signature.</b> Offline systems are more applicable and easy to use in comparison with on-line systems {{in many parts of the}} world however it is considered more difficult than on-line verification due to the lack of dynamic information. This paper presents about offline <b>Signature</b> identification method that had more attraction in recent years because of its necessity for use in daily life routines and when the <b>signature</b> needs to be immediately verified like bank checks, Security for Commercial Transactions, Cheque Authentication, attendance etc. In this paper we present, features types and recent methods used for features extraction in offline <b>signature</b> verification systems.
