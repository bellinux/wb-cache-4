5|$|The International System of Units (<b>Système</b> {{international}} d'unités or SI) is {{the current}} international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world. It {{is an extension of}} Giorgi's MKSA system—its base units are the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, candela and mole.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{definition}} of International System of Units (SI) {{along with the}} associated resolutions passed by the CGPM and the CIPM are published by the BIPM in brochure form at regular intervals.

5|$|Responding to Baron d'Holbach's <b>Système</b> de la Nature (1770) and David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) {{as well as}} {{the works}} of the French philosophers, Priestley {{maintained}} that materialism and determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.|$|E

5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French <b>Système</b> {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands were {{partially}} metricated {{when they}} were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French <b>système</b> usuel. (The reform was not followed in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch pond.) In Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.|$|E
5|$|Building on his progress, Champollion now {{began to}} study other texts in {{addition}} to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1823, he succeeded in identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts. With the help of a new acquaintance the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the Précis du <b>système</b> hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the Egyptian grammatical system.|$|E

The LFBB design {{was one of}} two projects within the ASTRA program, the other being Phoenix RLV. During development, scale models were constructed for testing various configurations in DLR's supersonic Trisonische Messstrecke Köln (TMK; English: Trisonic measuring section at Cologne) and in their Hyperschallwindkanal 2 Köln (H2K; English: Hypersonic wind canal at Cologne) wind tunnels. The preliminary mechanical design of other major elements was done by the companies EADS Space Transportation and MAN.|$|E
5|$|Pierre-Simon Laplace {{independently}} {{developed and}} proposed a similar model in 1796 in his Exposition du <b>systeme</b> du monde. He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout {{the volume of}} the Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem involved angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{weight of}} an apothecaries' pound ranged {{generally}} between 300g and 320g, {{slightly less than}} that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the large city of Milan the apothecaries' system based on a pound of 326.8g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in France the <b>système</b> usuel had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.|$|E
