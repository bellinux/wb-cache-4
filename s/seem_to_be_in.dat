25|$|The prosoma {{is covered}} by the {{carapace}} and always bears a pair of median eyes. In the probably basal families Palaeocharinidae, Anthracomartidae – and perhaps also Anthracosironidae – there is an additional pair of lateral eye tubercles which, at least in palaeocharinids, appear to have borne a series of individual lenses. In this sense palaeocharinids <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the process of reducing a compound eye.|$|E
25|$|The {{findings}} of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment {{are not likely to be}} effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a no-win situation.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{there is}} the {{question}} of the last three poems that were found among her papers. They <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> her handwriting, which is why Killigrew’s father added them to her book. The poems are about the despair the author has for another woman, and could possibly be autobiographical if they are in fact by Killigrew. Some of her other poems are about failed friendships, possibly with Anne Finch, so this assumption may have some validity.|$|E

25|$|Two of the New England {{states do}} have {{general-purpose}} municipalities of this type, however, {{to at least}} a limited extent. Connecticut has incorporated boroughs, and Vermont has incorporated villages. Such areas remain {{a part of their}} parent town, but assume some responsibilities for municipal services within their boundaries. In both states, they are typically regarded as less important than towns, and both <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> decline as institutions. In recent decades, many boroughs and villages have disincorporated, reverting to full town control.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms are not {{necessarily}} distinguishable from other kinds of distress. A dog might stand uncomfortably and <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> extreme discomfort for no apparent reason. Other possible symptoms include firm distension of the abdomen, weakness, depression, difficulty breathing, hypersalivation, and retching without producing any vomitus ("non-productive vomiting"). A high rate of dogs with GDV have cardiac arrhythmias (40 percent in one study). Chronic GDV may occur in dogs, symptoms of which include loss of appetite, vomiting and weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{reciprocity}} {{is an area}} {{of research}} in behavioral economics, evolutionary psychology, and evolutionary anthropology on the predisposition to cooperate even when there is no apparent benefit in doing so. This topic is particularly interesting to those studying the evolution of cooperation, as these behaviors <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> contradiction with predictions made by many models of cooperation. In response, current work on strong reciprocity is focused on developing evolutionary models which can to account for this behavior. Critics of strong reciprocity argue that it is an artifact of lab experiments, and does not reflect cooperative behavior in the real world.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} that followed, Mussorgsky's decline became {{increasingly}} steep. Although now {{part of a new}} circle of eminent personages that included singers, medical men and actors, he was increasingly unable to resist drinking, and a succession of deaths among his closest associates caused him great pain. At times, however, his alcoholism would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> check, and among the most powerful works composed during his last six years are the four Songs and Dances of Death. His civil service career was made more precarious by his frequent 'illnesses' and absences, and he was fortunate to obtain a transfer to a post (in the Office of Government Control) where his music-loving superior treated him with great leniency – in 1879 even allowing him to spend three months touring twelve cities as a singer's accompanist.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who typical painted exterior wings in grisaille, Memling shows the saints in a realistic manner. Although the donors in van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and van der Weyden's Beaune Altarpiece are also painted realistically, they are placed within architectural niches {{separate from the}} adjacent statue-like grisaille saints. Memling breaks with that tradition in these exterior panels, but the subdued palette he uses retains some sense of grisaille. The donors are dressed in their Augustinian habits; {{the two men in}} stark black and the two women in white on black. The saints are dressed in monochromatic clothing. St James wears a light blue cloak and St Anthony's is grey. St Agnes is dressed in drab green and St Clare is also in a dark habit. Although the figures <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> two niches, they are enclosed in a single shallow space, with stone walls behind, trefoil arches above, and two columns adorning the outermost edges. Where the wings open is a single column which has the appearance of two separate columns.|$|E
25|$|At the Dachau Trials, {{the issue}} of whether the donning of enemy uniforms to {{approach}} the enemy without drawing fire was within the laws of war was established under international humanitarian law at the trial in 1947 of the planner and commander of Operation Greif, Otto Skorzeny. Skorzeny was found not guilty by an American military tribunal of a crime by ordering his men into action in American uniforms. He had passed on to his men the warning of German legal experts, that if they fought in American uniforms, they would be breaking the laws of war, but they probably were not doing so just by wearing American uniforms. During the trial, a number of arguments were advanced to substantiate this position and that the German and U.S. military <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> agreement on it. In its judgement, the tribunal noted that the case did not require that the tribunal make findings other than those of guilty or not guilty, so consequently, no safe conclusion could be drawn from the acquittal of all accused.|$|E

500|$|By contrast, {{the novel}} was {{positively}} reviewed by such literary figures as George Eliot and Mrs. Humphrey Ward, whose 1888 novel Robert Elsmere was significantly {{influenced by the}} novel and by Froude's life. In a review in the Coventry Herald Eliot wrote that in reading The Nemesis of Faith [...] "we <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> companionship with a spirit who is transfusing himself into our souls, and so vitalising them by his superior energy, that life, both outward and inward, presents itself to us in higher relief, in colours brightened and deepened." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Rogier van der Weyden, {{who paid}} {{especially}} {{close attention to}} detail in the rendering of his models' fingers, to vanEyck hands were often something of an afterthought. They are generically rendered, do not contain much detail {{and may have been}} a later workshop addition. Yet they are very {{similar to those of the}} sitter in his [...] 1435 Portrait of Baudouin de Lannoy. The man holds a scroll that might be a legal document, letter, or pamphlet. In his early portraits, vanEyck's sitters are often shown holding objects indicative of their profession. The scroll contains six lines of illegible writing. The abbreviations are more prominent and <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> Latin, but may be vernacular.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{was stunned}} by their performance" [...] was Sinden's assessment. Former Montreal Canadiens' coach Claude Ruel commented that the Soviets' {{forwards}} {{were one of the}} most finely honed units he had ever seen. [...] "They are always moving, never standing around, they head-man the puck as well as anyone has ever done — and they always <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the right place." [...] According to Canada's goaltender Ken Dryden: [...] "We didn't play our game at all. After they tied it up, we started playing a panic type of game. Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once." [...] At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the works. Paramount has {{had quite a}} few {{corporate}} shakeups, {{which has led to}} many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, the best thing you could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now, I'm afraid I’m going to have to show you the real thing.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Herodotus's {{narrative}} {{after the}} Battle of Ephesus is ambiguous in its exact chronology; historians generally place Sardis and Ephesus in 498 BC. Herodotus next describes {{the spread of}} the revolt (thus also in 498 BC), and says that the Cypriots had one year of freedom, therefore placing the action in Cyprus to 497 BC. He next says that [...] "Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, all of them Persian generals and married to daughters of Darius, pursued those Ionians who had marched to Sardis, and drove them to their ships. After this victory they divided the cities among themselves and sacked them." [...] This passage implies these Persian generals counter-attacked immediately after the Battle of Ephesus. However, the cities that Herodotus describes Daurises as besieging were on the Hellespont, which (by Herodotus's own reckoning) did not become involved in the revolt until after Ephesus. It is therefore easiest to reconcile the account by assuming that Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes waited until the next campaigning season (i.e. 497 BC), before going on the counter-offensive. The Persian actions that Herodotus describes at the Hellespont and in Caria <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the same year, and most commentators place them in 497 BC.|$|E

[...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|E
