2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But {{there was always}} something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, <b>saw</b> <b>Bow</b> in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.|$|E

The Court knew it also, for every man who <b>saw</b> <b>bowed</b> towards me, yes, even the officers behind the King. One of the cup-bearers too brought me a goblet of the King's own wine, which I drank thankfully, calling down health on the King.|$|R

60|$|I {{returned}} disconsolately to the inn.

60|$|I was at Maynard House {{very soon}} after eleven, and, after chatting {{for a little}} while with my hostess, I hung around near the entrance, {{watching}} the arrivals. About midnight His Excellency the Chinese ambassador was announced, and I felt a little thrill of exultation. I was right! The tall, powerful-looking man whom I <b>saw</b> <b>bowing</b> over my cousin's hand was indeed the person whom I had seen with Delora a few hours ago. I ran Freddy to ground, and presently I found myself also bowing before His Excellency. He regarded me through his horn-rimmed spectacles with a benign and pleasant expression. I had been in the East, and I talked for a few moments upon the subjects which I thought would interest him.|$|R

50|$|A medieval {{guide to}} gem-carving {{techniques}} survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; {{it is unclear}} how they learned this technique. Mughal carvers also used drills. Inlay sections could be <b>sawed</b> by <b>bow</b> <b>saws.</b> In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity - since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.|$|R

50|$|In 1947, {{the ship}} was {{returned}} to Italy and underwent refit and modernization at a shipyard in Monfalcone in 1948.

60|$|He paused abruptly. The {{laughter}} died {{upon his}} lips and the look of gaiety out of his eyes, for Elsa sat more huddled up in herself than before.

50|$|The <b>Bow</b> <b>Saw</b> {{event is}} most {{typically}} {{run as a}} singles or as a team event. A 36-inch <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> fitted with a competition-grade peg and raker blade is most frequently used. In a singles event, a competitor is typically asked to cut a series of thin slices, called cookies, from a log, which is chained down to a stanchion. Each disk of wood sawn must be complete, or a penalty is assessed. As a team event, each member cuts one or two disks, and team members switch after completing their cuts. This event is scored for total time to complete all cuts.|$|R
50|$|This variant {{begins in}} a similar way to the jig sawing, with the {{assistant}} lying on a table and having a frame fixed over her midriff. The magician then presents a <b>bow</b> <b>saw</b> and proceeds to saw through the assistant, with the blade guided within the frame. Once the blade has apparently passed {{all the way through the}} assistant the frame is released and removed. It is then revealed that the assistant is encircled by the handle and blade of the <b>bow</b> <b>saw.</b> Then he/she will have a member of audience come up and look at the props.|$|R
