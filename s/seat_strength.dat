On the basis of this information, presented as working charts, the maximum deceleration loads experienced by the seat and passenger in response to the airplane deceleration pulse can be computed. This maximum seat-passenger deceleration is found to depend on the natural frequency of the seat containing the passenger, considered as a mass-spring system.

40|$|Increased market {{deregulation}} and the accompanied rise of LCCs {{over the}} last decades has put profit {{for many of the}} old FSCs under pressure forcing them to merge and form alliances. This sparked the research into finding the most efficient structure for a single airline network in terms of profit and passenger mobility. Along with this, the social and economical dependancy on air transport grew and hence the need to assess the robustness of the network rose. Complex network theory offers a way to assess the efficiency of the networks using amongst other the degree (distribution), the betweenness, the average path length and the clustering coefficient. The main focus of current literature is on the analysis of global and regional airport networks, with limited coverage of separate airline networks and codeshare and alliance formation. Furthermore current research uses very standardized methods of assessing robustness and more realistic assumptions are needed. The first aim {{of this study is to}} get an insight into the differences in structure of FSCs and LCCs by analyze the topology and robustness of 17 European separate airline networks, using complex network theory. The second aim is to investigate the influence of codeshare and alliance formation on the topology and robustness of ATNs. Finally the third aim is to improve the methods used to analyze the robustness of ATNs. First the topology of the seperate airline networks of both FSCs and LCCs is analyzed in order to distinguish between the business solutions used by the airlines (PPs and HSs). Additionaly the influence of using codeshares and an alliances on the topology of the airline networks is investigated. This is performed by using complex network indicators to compare the seperate and combined (both codeshare and alliance) network layouts. The analysis confirms literature regarding FSCs, which turn out to use SFN associated with HS. LCCs however, are found not found to have RN associated with PP as suggested in literature, but a SFN with multiple interconnected hubs. The most important difference found between FSCs and LCCs is that LCCs tend to focus on diversity of destinations over frequency, whilst FSCs tend to focus on frequency over diversity. Combining networks into codeshare networks or the Skyteam alliance, increases the diversity of the network, the size and number of hubs and brings the behaviour closer to LCCs, however still with a focus on frequency over diversity. After this the synthetic static robustness of the seperate airline, codeshare and the Skyteam alliance networks is investigated in order to distinguish between the robustness behaviour of both FSCs and LCCs. The link between the complex network indicators and the synthetic static robustness of the ATN is also explored. This is performed by simulating error and attack on the separate airline networks and the codeshare and Skyteam alliance networks. Error is based on the random removal of airports from the network, while attack is based on the consecutive removal of nodes based on the heights of the degree, <b>seat</b> <b>strength</b> and (weighted) betweenness of the airports. The analysis confirms literature regarding FSCs, which shows low robustness against attack and high robustness against error. LCCs again show similar behaviour as the FSCs, contradicting literature, but confirming the results from Chapter 3. The shape of the curve of the cumulative degree distribution can be directly linked to the robustness independant of the size of the network. The higher the amount of hubs (with relative high degree), the higher robustness against attack. The robustness against error is much higher and similar for all networks. Combining networks into codeshare netrworks or the Skyteam alliance, will thus increase the robustness against attack. Finally the robustness analysis of ATNs is improved by introducing new methods of simulating more realistic error and attack scenarios. The link between the realistic robustness analysis and the synthetic robustness analysis is also investigated Three different phenomena are simulated: weather, strikes and volcano eruptions. Weather and volcano eruptions are simulated using the introduced geographic attack. Geographic attack is based on starting at an initiation airport and removing the other airports using geographic radial spreading. Strikes are simulated using the geographic degree, which groups the airport into FIR. The analysis puts the synthetic robustness in perspective. It shows that not only the number of hubs is important in order to improve the robustness of an ATN, but also the geographic spreading of the hubs.

The test method outlined in this regulation is only partially predictive of seat performance in dynamic and/or real world impacts. Many seats continue to demonstrate gross deformations or catastrophic failures with potentially injurious occupant kinematics under the impact conditions of the FMVSS 301 Fuel System Integrity testing [2].

40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} {{the influence of}} the assistive pole, seat configuration, and upper-body and trunk strength on seated-throwing performance in athletes with a spinal-cord injury (SCI). Methods: Ten Paralympic athletes competing in wheelchair rugby, basketball, or athletics (seated throws) participated in 2 randomized sessions: <b>seated</b> throwing and <b>strength</b> tests. Participants threw a club from a custom-built throwing chair, with and without a pole. 3 D kinematic data were collected (150 Hz) for both conditions using standardized and self-selected seat configurations. Dominant and nondominant grip strength were measured using a dynamometer, and upper-body and trunk strength were measured using isometric contractions against a load cell. Results: Seated throwing with an assistive pole resulted in significantly higher hand speed at release than throwing without a pole (pole = 6. 0 +/- 1. 5 m/s, no pole = 5. 3 +/- 1. 5 m/s; P =. 02).

40|$|Due to the {{competitive}} nature of airline {{industry and the}} desire to minimise aircraft weight, there is a continual drive to develop lightweight, reliable and more comfortable seating solutions, in particular, a new generation slim economy seat. The key design challenge is to maximise the “living space” for the passenger, with strict adherence to the ‘Crash Safety Regulations’. Cranfield University is addressing the needs of airliners, seat manufactures and safety regulating bodies by designing a completely novel seat structure coined as “Sleep Seat”. A generous angle of recline (40 degree), movement of “Seat Pan” along the gradient, fixed outer shell of the backrest, and a unique single “Forward Beam” design distinguishes “Sleep Seat” form current generation seats. It is an ultra-lightweight design weighing 8 kg (typical seat weight is 11 kg). It has to sustain the static (CS 25. 561) and dynamic (CS 25. 562) “Emergency landing” loads as specified by “Certification Specifications (CS). Apart from maintaining structural integrity; a seat-structure must not deform, which would impede evacuation, should absorb energy so that the loads transferred to Occupants are within human tolerance limits and should always maintain survivable space around the Occupant. All these parameters, which increase a life-expectancy in a ‘survivable’ crash, can be estimated using either experimental testing or virtual simulation tools such as “Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Design of the “Sleep Seat” is still in its conceptual phase and therefore experimental testing for all the design iterations involved is unrealistic, given a measure of the costs and timescales involved. Therefore focus of research is to develop practical and robust FE methodologies to assess static and dynamic performances of a seat-structure so as to compare different design concepts based on their <b>strength,</b> <b>seat</b> interface loads (a limit defined by strength of aircraft-floor), maximum deformations and cross-sectional forces [...] .

MethodsFifteen individuals with a SCI performed the 20 -meter, slalom and 6 -minute wheelchair propulsion tests within 72 hours prior to discharge from comprehensive inpatient SCI rehabilitation. Trunk and U/E <b>strength</b> along with <b>seated</b> reaching capability with unilateral hand support were also measured. The relationships between the wheelchair propulsion tests and the other variables were assessed using bi-variate correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. ResultsThe 20 -meter propulsion-maximum velocity, slalom and 6 -minute propulsion tests were moderately or strongly correlated with anterior and lateral inclination trunk <b>strength,</b> <b>seated</b> anterior reaching distance {{and the majority of}} shoulder, elbow and handgrip strength measures. Shoulder adductor strength-weakest side explained 53 % of the variance on the 20 -meter propulsion test-maximum velocity.
