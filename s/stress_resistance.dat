25|$|The neocortex {{makes up}} {{half of the}} echidna's brain, {{compared}} to 80% of a human brain. Due to their low metabolism and accompanying <b>stress</b> <b>resistance,</b> echidnas are long-lived for their size; the longest recorded lifespan for a captive echidna is 50 years, with anecdotal accounts of wild individuals reaching 45 years. Contrary to previous research, the echidna does enter REM sleep, but only when the ambient temperature is around 25°C (77°F). At temperatures of 15°C (59°F) and 28°C (82°F), REM sleep is suppressed.|$|E
500|$|Ascorbic acid or [...] "vitamin C" [...] is a {{monosaccharide}} oxidation-reduction (redox) catalyst {{found in}} both animals and plants. As {{one of the}} enzymes needed to make ascorbic acid has been lost by mutation during primate evolution, humans must obtain it from the diet; it is therefore a vitamin. Most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets. Ascorbic acid {{is required for the}} conversion of the procollagen to collagen by oxidizing proline residues to hydroxyproline. In other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by protein disulfide isomerase and glutaredoxins. Ascorbic acid is a redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a substrate for the redox enzyme ascorbate peroxidase, a function that is particularly important in <b>stress</b> <b>resistance</b> in plants. Ascorbic acid is present at high levels in all parts of plants and can reach concentrations of 20millimolar in chloroplasts.|$|E

Ways in which superalloys can be designed for high <b>stress</b> rupture <b>resistance</b> are discussed. In describing the alloying procedures, the strengthening mechanisms involved and methods of avoiding phases detrimental to <b>stress</b> rupture <b>resistance</b> are identified.

40|$|AbstractThe {{literature}} of organizational change {{is dominated by}} the idea that <b>stress</b> and <b>resistance</b> are two independent phenomena, and that they are immediate and natural reactions to organizational change. This paper suggests a model of organizational change that views the stress as a mediator between organizational change and resistance to change. According to this model, <b>stress</b> and <b>resistance</b> are not inevitable reactions to organizational change. Rather, what makes organizational change stressful or susceptible to resistance of employees is the way people are treated during implementation of the change. The model introduces strategies for reducing negative <b>stress</b> and <b>resistance,</b> and for increasing positive stress and positive health outcomes among employees adapting to change...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} <b>stress</b> cracking <b>resistance</b> of halloysite nanoclay-polyester nanocomposites {{was investigated}} using fracture mechanics approach. The incorporation of halloysite nanoclay {{was found to}} improve the environmental <b>stress</b> cracking <b>resistance</b> of the nano-composites. The storage modulus of nano-composites measured by dynamic mechanical analysis increased remarkably {{as a function of}} halloysite nanoclay content. At 0. 7 wt% nanoclay, the Tg improved from 72 °C to 76 °C. The fracture toughness increased up to 33 % and time to failure improved 155 % with the addition of 0. 7 wt% of halloysite nanoclay. The maximum microhardness was found 119 % higher for the same nano-filler concentration compared to monolithic polyester. The reinforcement with 1 wt% showed lower fracture toughness due to agglomerations of nanoclay which act as flaws. The presence of agglomerates weakened the bond between nano-particles and matrix hence reduces the environmental <b>stress</b> cracking <b>resistance</b> by halloysite nanoclay reinforcement...|$|R

30|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in molecular breeding of rice for yield, quality, biotic and abiotic <b>stress</b> <b>resistances</b> and certain agronomic traits (Rao et al. 2014). However, the genetics rice: BPH interaction and molecular breeding for BPH resistance have been restrained due to the intricacy of interaction between rice and BPH. Host—plant resistance is an effective environmentally friendly approach to control BPH and maintain yield potential of cultivars (Jena and Kim, 2010). Future breeding approaches must focus on developing cultivars with durable, broad-spectrum resistance.|$|R
25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} {{molecular weight}} distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, <b>stress</b> crack <b>resistance</b> and an increased crack propagation resistance.

50|$|The {{importance}} of Agropyron cristatum is often undermined as the plant {{has not been}} domesticated for modern agricultural use. Agropyron cristatum’s ability to withstand various environmental and biological blighting makes it a truly unique and valuable organism. Recent studies highlight the {{importance of}} A. cristatum in future agricultural development because it exhibits several desirable traits {{for the improvement of}} domesticated wheat. While some of these traits may be related to yield production of the wheat, other significant traits include biotic and abiotic <b>stress</b> <b>resistance</b> genes that enable A. cristatum to grow proficiently. The importance of this knowledge is that researchers can use this genetic information regarding <b>stress</b> <b>resistance</b> genes to introduce new desirable traits in other domesticated wheat species that aid their growth in harsh environments. Ultimately, this leads to better yields for more human consumption.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{addition}} of Zr and Ag on the mechanical properties of a Cu- 0. 5 wt%Cr alloy have been investigated. The addition of 0. 15 wt%Zr enhances {{the strength and}} <b>resistance</b> to <b>stress</b> relaxation of the Cu-Cr alloy. The increase in strength is caused by both the decrease in inter-precipitate spacing of Cr precipitates and the precipitation of Cu 5 Zr phase. The <b>stress</b> relaxation <b>resistance</b> is improved by the preferentially forming Cu 5 Zr precipitates on dislocations, in addition to Cr precipitates on dislocations. The addition of 0. 1 wt%Ag to the Cu-Cr and Cu-Cr-Zr alloys improves the strength, <b>stress</b> relaxation <b>resistance</b> and bend formability of these alloys. The increase in strength and <b>stress</b> relaxation <b>resistance</b> is ascribed to the decrease in inter-precipitate spacing of Cr precipitates and the suppression of recovery during aging, and to the Ag-atom-drag effect on dislocation motion. The better bend formability of the Ag-added alloys is {{explained in terms of}} the larger post-uniform elongation of the alloys. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

Two additional functions of alpha crystallins are an autokinase activity and participation in the intracellular architecture. Alpha-A and alpha-B gene products are differentially expressed; alpha-A is preferentially restricted to the lens and alpha-B is expressed widely in many tissues and organs. Elevated expression of alpha-B crystallin occurs in many neurological diseases; a missense mutation cosegregated in a family with a desmin-related myopathy.|$|E
50|$|DMSP {{has also}} been implicated in {{influencing}} the taste and odour characteristics of various products. For example, although DMSP is odourless and tasteless, it is accumulated at high levels in some marine herbivores or filter feeders. Increased growth rates, vigour and <b>stress</b> <b>resistance</b> among animals cultivated on such diets have been reported. DMS, is responsible for repellent, 'off' tastes and odours that develop in some seafood products because of the action of bacterial DMSP-lyase, which cogenerates acrylate.|$|E

However, other adaptations, such as colonizing less hazardous microhabitats or other behavioral adaptations, could also contribute to acclimation in stressful habitats. Additionally, “normal” environments can also place stress on inhabitants (drought or seasonal changes, for example). These factors muddy the relationship between HSP expression and environmental <b>stress</b> <b>resistance</b> and HSP expression in nature is not well characterized.|$|E

Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: <b>stress</b> cracking <b>resistance</b> and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield <b>stress</b> and heat <b>resistance</b> decrease.

5000|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that calorie restriction displays positive effects on the lifespan of organisms {{even though it is}} accompanied by increases in oxidative stress.
