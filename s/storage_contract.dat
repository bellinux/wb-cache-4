40|$|We analyse a {{stochastic}} control {{problem for}} the valuation of a natural gas storage facility while taking into account operating characteristics. The underlying natural gas spot price dynamics is assumed to follow a time-inhomogeneous exponential L´evy process [6]. This underlying incorporates common features of gas spot prices such as seasonality, mean-reversion and price spikes with seasonal jump intensities. The corresponding HJB equation is the non-linear PIDE which is solved by an explicit finite difference method. The numerical approach gives us both {{the value of the}} <b>storage</b> <b>contract</b> and optimal operating strategy depending on the gas price, current level of gas in the storage and time. The effects of seasonality and seasonal jump intensity are investigated by observing the surfaces of control strategies and contract values...|$|E
40|$|When {{a company}} migrates to cloud storage, {{the way back}} is neither easy nor cheap. The company is then locked up in the <b>storage</b> <b>contract</b> and exposed to upward market prices, which reduce the company's profit and may even bring it below zero. We propose a {{protection}} means based on an insurance contract, by which the cloud purchaser is indemnified when the current storage price exceeds a pre-defined threshold. By applying the financial options theory, we provide a formula for the insurance price (the premium). By using historical data on market prices for disks, we apply the formula in realistic scenarios. We show that the premium grows nearly quadratically with {{the length of the}} coverage period as long as this is below one year, but grows more slowly, though faster than linearly, over longer coverage periods...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the gas spot market and the price of gas storage capacity. Contrary to the common belief, the auction prices for gas storage are mostly affected by the volatility of current market prices rather than by the winter-summer price differences. This paper provides a numerical solution for pricing storage capacity, by taking investor's activities through the spot market and storage service into account. A bivariate Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) model is employed for modeling the dynamics of the day-ahead and month-ahead spot market prices, as well as the time-varying volatilities and correlations. Under an incomplete market setting, our model is able to approximate the realized auction prices. Moreover, one interesting implication is that the implied average risk aversion of investor for a <b>storage</b> <b>contract</b> increases with the volatility of the spot market. This is an intuitive result because storage capacity can serve as an effective hedging product for the spot market, and the demand for this product is high when the market becomes risky: more risk averse investors are participating in the auctions. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis on different injection/withdrawal rates is also included, and particularly, contracts with higher capacity rates are priced at a higher level...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, one {{methodology}} {{for natural gas}} storage valuation is developed and two methodologies are improved. Then all of the three methodologies are applied to a <b>storage</b> <b>contract.</b> The first methodology is called "intrinsic rolling with spot and forward", which takes both the spot and forward prices into account in the valuation. This method {{is based on the}} trading strategy by which a trader locks the spot and forward positions by solving an optimization problem based on the market information on the first day. In the following days, the trader can obtain added value by adjusting the positions based on new market information. The storage value is the sum of the first day's value and the added values in the following days. The problem can be expressed by a Bellman equation and solved recursively. A crucial issue in the implementation is how to compute the expected value in the next period conditioned on the information in current period. One way to compute the expected value is Monte Carlo simulation with ordinary least square regression. However, if all of the state variables, spot, and forward prices are incorporated in the regression there are too many terms, and the regression becomes uncontrollable. To solve this issue, three risk factors are chosen by performing principle component analysis. Dimension of the regression is greatly reduced by only incorporating the three risk factors. Both the second methodology and the third methodology only consider the spot price in the valuation. The second methodology uses Monte Carlo simulation with ordinary least square regression, which is {{based on the work of}} Boogert and Jong (2006). The third methodology uses stochastic dual dynamic programming, which is based on the work of Bringedal (2003). However, both methodologies are improved to incorporate bid and ask prices. Price models are crucial for the valuation. Forward prices of each month are assumed to follow geometric Brownian motions. Future spot price is also assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion but for a specific month its expectation is set to the corresponding forward price on the valuation date. Since the simulation of spot and forward prices is separated from the storage optimization, alternative spot and forward models can be used when necessary. The results show that the value of the <b>storage</b> <b>contract</b> estimated by the first methodology is close to the market value and the value estimated by the Financial Engineering Associates (FEA) provided function. A much higher value is obtained when only spot price is considered, since the high volatility of the spot curve makes frequent position change profitable. However in the reality traders adjust their positions less frequently. M. S. Committee Chair: Deng, Shijie; Committee Member: Demko, Stephen; Committee Member: Goldsman, Davi...|$|E
40|$|This Master thesis {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} of trade relationships of obligation in Germany and the Czech Republic. In order to introduce and analyse the topic thoroughly at first the main legal acts connected with relationships of obligation and trade relationships of obligations in both compared countries are being introduced. The main stress is put {{on the content of}} these legal acts, on their historical development, their application methods as well as on their mutual relationship. The next part of this Master thesis then explains the term trade relationship of obligation with respect to the definitions obtained in both compared legal systems. After the theoretical introduction the general legal regulation of the trade relationships of obligation is being characterised. Since the general legal regulation of the trade relationships of obligation is based on the general legal regulation of the relationships of obligation at first the differences between these two legal regulations in Germany are explained. After that the German general legal regulation of trade relationships of obligation is being compared with the Czech general legal regulation of this area. After the characterisation of the general legal regulation of the trade relationships of obligation the individual types of German trade relationships of obligation are being compared with their equivalents in the Czech legal system.

40|$|Natural {{gas markets}} are {{incomplete}} due to physical limitations and low liquidity, but most valuation approaches {{for natural gas}} <b>storage</b> <b>contracts</b> assume a complete market. We propose an alternative approach based on indifference pricing which does not require this assumption but entails the solution of a high- dimensional stochastic-dynamic optimization problem under a risk measure. To solve this problem, we develop a method combining stochastic dual dynamic programming with a novel quantization method that approximates the continuous process of natural gas prices by a discrete scenario lattice. In a computational experiment, we demonstrate that our solution method can handle the high dimensionality of the optimization problem and that solutions are near-optimal. We then compare our approach with rolling intrinsic valuation, which is widely used in the industry, and show that the rolling intrinsic value is sub-optimal under market incompleteness, unless the decision-maker is perfectly risk-averse. We strengthen this result by conducting a backtest using historical data that compares both trading strategies.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we review}} various popular pricing {{models in the}} interest-rate market. Among these pricing models, we choose the LIBOR Market model (LMM) as the {{benchmark}} model. Based on market practice experience, we also develop a pricing model named the “Market volatility model”. By pricing vanilla interest-rate options such as interest-rate caps and swaptions, we compare the performance of our Market volatility model {{to that of the}} LMM. It is proved that the Market Volatility model produce comparable results to the LMM, while its computing efficiency largely exceeds that of the LMM. Following the recent rapid development in the commodity market, in particular the energy market, we attempt to extend the use of our proposed Market volatility model from the interest-rate market to the energy market. We prove that the Market Volatility model is capable of pricing various energy derivative under the assumption of absence of the convenience yield. In addition, we propose a new type of exotic energy derivative which has a flexible option structure. This energy derivative is named as the Flex-Asian spread options (FASO). We give examples of different option structures within the FASO framework and use the Market volatility model to generate option prices and greeks for each structure. Although the Market volatility model can be used to price various energy derivatives based on oil/gas contracts, it is not compatible with the structure {{of one of the most}} advanced derivatives in the energy market, the storage option.
