500|$|Erna's singing {{style has}} been stated as [...] "the snarl of James Hetfield", and [...] "composed of dark harmony that <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Alice in Chains". Merrill's bass style has been {{described}} as [...] "bulldozer bottom with occasional slap-bass reverb". Larkin's drumming is thought to [...] "worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham". And Rombola's guitar playing style has been praised as [...] "guitars that sound like percussion instruments".|$|E
500|$|The song {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kyle Anderson for MTV considered [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] as [...] "a similar-sounding anthem [...] with some streamlined rock guitar taking center stage (there's even a solo). It's catchy enough." [...] Spence D. of IGN considered [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] a [...] " [...] Martin's glossy grown-up pop" [...] song, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] a [...] "further hit" [...] from ...Baby One More Time, along with [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "Sometimes". Music critic Walt Mueller wrote [...] "When Spears starts to sing on this one, she <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Janet Jackson." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press {{noted that the}} song and [...] "Stronger" [...] are [...] "so lamely feel-good" [...] tracks that they [...] "could have been the theme song to a 'Karate Kid' sequel." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called it a [...] "lightly dorky" [...] song, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic deemed it as a [...] "fluffy dance-pop at its best." [...] In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was ranked ninth in a list of Spears' best songs. During the 2001 BMI Pop Awards, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was honored with the award of Most Performed BMI Song.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Some {{of the details}} ring uncannily true, like the slick oldies nightclub act {{that one of the}} Cruisers is still doing nearly 20 years after Eddie's {{supposed}} death. Other aspects of the film are inexplicably wrong. Eddie's music sounds good, but it also <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Bruce Springsteen's, and {{it would not have been}} the rage in 1963." [...] However, she did praise Paré's performance: [...] "Mr. Paré makes a fine debut; he captures the manner of a hot-blooded young rocker with great conviction, and his lip-synching is almost perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|News outlets began {{reporting}} {{on the story of}} a mystery illness causing deaths among young Navajo, often using the term [...] "Navajo Flu". Hearing a news report, a physician notified health officials to say that the illness <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> hantavirus, which he'd observed in Korea in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|He also {{starred in}} Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as a Mint Hotel clerk, who looked and <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> actor McLean Stevenson on M*A*S*H. He played a {{psychiatrist}} in the Lindsay Lohan thriller I Know Who Killed Me and, most recently, as a prison warden in Law Abiding Citizen.|$|R
5000|$|Whitaker was {{an immensely}} popular player in Detroit and {{during his career}} was greeted by chants of [...] "LOUUUUUUUUUU", which <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> boos at Tiger Stadium. He was an {{effective}} leadoff man, adept at drawing walks (averaging 81 BB per 162 games), quick on the bases, and able to drive the ball with power to all fields.|$|R
2500|$|Timothy then announces that, since Her Majesty the Queen is not available, Mr. Secombe has {{donned a}} [...] "floral {{cretonne}} frock" [...] and stepped in {{for her at}} the last minute. [...] Secombe then attempts to [...] "start the show" [...] which <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> starting, or rather failing to start, a car. [...] This play on words was used by Milligan in his other scripts, particularly the contemporaneous [...] "Milligna Show". [...] The tone of the whole show, in fact, was much more like Milligan's then-current writing {{than any of the}} original shows. [...] Although all the stock characters put in an appearance, the humour consists mostly of one-liners.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{concludes with}} the love songs, [...] "Comfort You", [...] "Come Here My Love", and [...] "Country Fair"—the latter two {{employing}} the traditional Irish ballad style. [...] To Clinton Heylin, the songs also spoke to [...] "the {{healing power of}} love... here at last are songs that speak of {{what he can do}} for her, rather than concerned solely with his needs and wants." [...] Heylin comments on the song, [...] "Come Here My Love": [...] "This is no 'Autumn Song'. Rather, it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> a man learning how to love again." [...] Morrison spoke of [...] "Country Fair" [...] as having the same kind of feeling as [...] "And It Stoned Me", although that song was used to open the Moondance album, instead of as a kind of closure.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic {{staff writer}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four and a}} half out of five stars. He said, [...] "This is further proof that Pearl Jam {{consciously}} turned away from the big, anthemic sound and spirit that won them a mass audience with Ten—they still had the songs and sound, they just chose to bury it. Lost Dogs crackles with that passion and it has another advantage: unlike most of Pearl Jam's albums, it's a fun, compulsive listen. More than any other album in its catalog, Lost Dogs captures what Pearl Jam stood for and what it felt like at their peak." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "for an album of odds 'n' sods, Lost Dogs sure <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> a pack of hits." ...|$|E
5000|$|Less Love {{collaborated with}} the band Wondernaut in 2013 to release their second album Paradigms in the Design. The album {{received}} positive reviews including being voted as Album {{of the year by}} Rust Magazine. [...] Mark King, rhythm guitarist of Oklahoma-based band Hinder, said that if Fleetwood Mac and Sonic Youth had an ugly love child, it would <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the new album Paradigms In The Design.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the {{recording}} career of the Carter Sisters & Mother Maybelle, {{much of the}} time, all four group members had individual recording contracts as well. [...] Though each had her own style, it is of note that {{all members of the}} Carter Sisters & Mother Maybelle group (in various combinations) often sang and played on one anothers solo recordings. Therefore, it was not unusual for the members solo recordings to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the group recordings.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{intensity}} of the sessions, the band still found time to goof off. Violinist Caitlin Cary remembers getting drunk and riding a horse bareback across a nearby field, while other band members played around with firecrackers - which inspired Adams to later remark: [...] "Out in the parking lot across the street... the Roman candles and Black Cats <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> I'd hope we'd one day sound - pretty little things all set on fire waiting to get destroyed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, at {{the asylum}} Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole catechism. I liked it pretty well. There's {{something}} splendid {{about some of}} the words. 'Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.' Isn't that grand? It has such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing. You couldn't quite call it poetry, I suppose, but it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> it, doesn't it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Fans of {{the group}} think that the new song <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Donna Summer's classic [...] "I Feel Love".|$|E
5000|$|Brazil: [...] "Olha o passarinho" [...] ("Look at {{the little}} bird") or [...] "Digam X" [...] ("Say X") (the name of the letter [...] "X" [...] in Portuguese (/ʃis/) <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the English word [...] "cheese").|$|E
25|$|The modern multi-tenors {{evolved from}} {{horizontally}} mounted dual single-headed bass drums first {{used by the}} Boston Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps in the late 1960s. Early multi-tenors had shells with a flat bottom. These drums <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> timpani, so they were called timp-toms. As drum sizes got smaller, more drums began {{to be added to}} multi-tenor configurations. The largest sets of multi-tenors had 7 drums and were carried by both the 1977 and 1992 Spirit of Atlanta Drum and Bugle Corps tenor lines.|$|R
5|$|On 28 January 2011, Michael Paget {{stated that}} the group had already drawn {{proportions}} for the next studio album and will <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Fever. He followed-along with stating that the band plans to have the songs for it written within 2011 and will begin recording the album {{by the end of}} the year. A couple tracks left from the Fever sessions might be re-done, re-arranged and re-recorded for the new record. The band played at Uproar Festival 2011, after which they began writing material for a fourth studio album.|$|R
2500|$|Greg Kot of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album two stars out of five, remarking, [...] "Good Charlotte {{are much more}} persuasive when they let their {{vulnerability}} crack through the surface of these slightly overbaked songs, in which elaborate production touches mask the band's three-chord limitations." [...] Kristina Feliciano of Entertainment Weekly deemed the record generic, writing, [...] "These 14 tidily produced songs not only <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> each other, they also resemble ones by someone else — namely, blink-182. And that band’s tunes derive from elsewhere still." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....an {{album that}} admittedly <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> every other emo-punk {{band in the}} genre, but still {{contains}} the energy and sense of melody {{that most of the}} other bands forget about." [...] - Punknews.org review of Hold On ...|$|E
50|$|Correctly {{translated}} the film's title is The Amazing Hesitations of the TV-man. Näköradio (vision radio) is an outdated expression for television. Siekailut comes from siekailla, an old word meaning to hesitate and which <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> seikkailu, meaning adventure.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Kirkwood said: [...] "The producer says it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Eighties, SST-era, Up On the Sun Meat Puppets. But there's more bouncy rhythms -- {{we do a lot}} more stuff that was inspired by the Selecter, the Specials and Bob Marley." ...|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 3 stars stating [...] "this trio, which {{worked as a}} rhythm section {{together}} on countless music dates of many styles during the 1950s and 1960s, obviously had what it took. But Jones is stuck on a campy honky tonk piano instead of a grand piano on {{the first half of}} the LP, so the performances tend to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the cornucopia of similar records made by pianists not in the leader's league. But the trio makes its best effort and succeeds in spite of the inferior keyboard".|$|R
5000|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{gave the}} album 4/5 stars, using a {{comparison}} to praise; [...] "You went digging {{around in your}} parents closet of old vinyl LPs from the 80s, found one with candy-coated colors on the cover, played it on their old turntable and discovered it really wasnt bad. Then {{a few days later}} after listening to it for the 15th time you realized you {{had fallen in love with}} the goofy, fun, sarcastic music. Its quite possible it <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Cobra Starships Hot Mess." ...|$|R
5000|$|Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph {{described}} the song as [...] "synth-heavy with oodles of key changes, on record it <b>sounds</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> standard karaoke ballad - think Take That-lite".|$|R
50|$|I {{found myself}} with {{a body of work}} that was dealing with a whole whack of themes that really weren't suited to Metric. It would've been very strange to bring those songs to a band. The way Metric songs usually develop is that I write {{something}} on the piano that <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> those songs.|$|E
5000|$|Jimmy Spark's {{voice was}} that of Billie Lou Watt. The voice of Inspector Blooper {{was that of}} Ray Owens. Old time radio {{listeners}} might find the Inspector Blooper <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the Willard Waterman/Harold Peary-voiced character [...] "The Great Gildersleeve." [...] Gilbert Mack voiced Dick Strong. Peter Fernandez provided the voices of other Gigantor characters.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{described}} the album {{as having a}} ska influence. He praised the music as a [...] "powerful slice of old-school punk — as powerful as any of their records" [...] and claims [...] "it actually <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> ...And Out Come the Wolves". The album received a rating of {{four out of five}} stars.|$|E
5000|$|Bolan {{had said}} in the late 1960s that {{at the peak of}} his career, he would change his stage name to [...] "Zinc Alloy", which is what he was going to address himself as with this album. However, the band name [...] "Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow" [...] <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars", David Bowie's 1972 album. The album itself was going to be called [...] "A Creamed Cage in August", hence why it is on the back cover. However the record company insisted on using the T. Rex name on the cover.|$|R
5000|$|The {{thing about}} [...] "Lost in the Echo" [...] was it <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> what the [...] "song" [...] sounds like, I think. When the guys heard it, I kind of said to them, [...] "What {{do you think}} about that?" [...] and their responses, {{for the first time in}} a few years, were pretty good. They were like, [...] "Yeah, we hear the merit. Let's develop that idea. Let's see what we want to do." [...] I said to them, [...] "You know, this is like a real moment for us, now, on this album." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zanda Wilson from Music Feeds wrote [...] "while {{there are}} plenty of songs that <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> {{previous}} tracks... it’s the subject material that differs and is significant", adding [...] "In saying that, it's not as if Diplomatic Immunity isn't a diverse record. It definitely is, and songs like the bass heavy 1990s style techno track [...] "Do It My Way" [...] and the funk-pop inspired [...] "Off White Limousine" [...] shows off the ability of Client Liaison to craft songs in unexpected ways. [...] "Where Do We Belong" [...] even has a killer horn riff throughout." ...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} among many Gadje (non-Roma persons) that Romani worship the devil. This is only because the word Devla <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the word devil but is actually a false cognate. The Romani word for devil, or Satan, is actually [...] "Beng". The Serpent name in Romani language is Sharkanis, Sherkano and Bizuzo.|$|E
50|$|Goodman is {{also known}} for his deep throat voice which has been poked fun at {{numerous}} times in Family Guy audio commentaries, particularly by the creator Seth MacFarlane and writer Alec Sulkin who both believe his voice <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Ray Romano's. As a result, Goodman has voiced parodies of Romano in Family Guy episodes by not doing an impression, but by simply talking.|$|E
5000|$|DJBooth commented, [...] "like 'Down', this jam has undeniable club/radio appeal - {{thanks in}} large part to J remy & Bobby Bass' upbeat, string-led {{instrumental}} - which <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> their boardwork on Down. [...] "Do You Remember" [...] may not be a drastic departure from its predecessor, but Sean's recipe for number-one success yields an equally appetizing result the second time around." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{interviews}} {{leading up}} to Hi-Five Soup!s release, lead vocalist Christian Jacobs (The MC Bat Commander) described the album as [...] "Yo Gabba Gabba!-meets-The Aquabats", noting [...] "the themes of the songs are just kind of silly and stupid...it's less trying {{to appeal to a}} little bit older crowd and just trying to appeal to the Halloween costume crowd". Of the album's music, he mentioned [...] "there's more stripped down punk kind of sounds" [...] and [...] "we have been relying <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more on the keyboards and there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more electronic stuff in there, but I think kids will be surprised that there are some songs that <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> old school Aquabats".|$|R
5000|$|... "Sometimes {{bad things}} just happen, and it's nobody's fault," [...] {{says one of}} the {{characters}} in Head Cases, a new Fox courtroom drama. Unfortunately that <b>sounds</b> <b>an</b> awful <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the producer of the show attempting to let himself off the hook.|$|R
5000|$|Reviews of The Young and the Hopeless were {{generally}} mixed. Tom Semioli of Allmusic called it [...] "downright predictable," [...] an album that [...] "rehashes worn clichés aplenty on each track."Greg Kot of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, remarking, [...] "Good Charlotte {{are much more}} persuasive when they let their vulnerability crack through the surface of these slightly overbaked songs, in which elaborate production touches mask the band's three-chord limitations."
