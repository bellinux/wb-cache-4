5|$|In his {{subsequent}} statement Smith admitted to {{being at the}} Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated {{when they went to}} another public house, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected. Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> did not, he said he then left her.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, Beshear {{unveiled}} his promised {{legislation that}} would allow casino gambling in Kentucky. Beshear's plan included a constitutional amendment allowing 12 casinos to be licensed in the state – seven {{at each of the}} state's horse racetracks and five additional free-standing casinos – and a companion bill specifying how the increased revenues would be spent. After the plan encountered initial resistance, House leadership reduced the number of casinos that would have been allowed to by the amendment to nine. One proposal, authored by House Speaker Jody Richards, would have guaranteed five casino licenses to the state's racetracks and allowed the other four to go to free-standing casinos. A competing measure, drafted by House Majority Whip Rob Wilkey and Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark, would have allowed all nine licenses to be awarded competitively, with none specifically reserved for racetracks. In late February, the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs committee failed to advance either proposal to the full floor of the House of Representatives. The following day, Speaker Richards removed Representative Dottie Sims from the committee; Sims claimed Richards retaliated against her for voting against the proposals, but Richards said he removed Sims because <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> would vote for the proposals and then voted against them. Following Sims' removal the committee passed the amendment.|$|E

500|$|The next {{opportunity}} for Rodin in America was the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Hallowell {{wanted to help}} promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was beaucoup moins beau que l'original but impossible, outside the rules. [...] Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, Cupid and Psyche, Sphinx and Andromeda. [...] All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.|$|E

500|$|As the German forces {{moved through}} Lanzerath {{and in front}} of their positions, Bouck and his men allowed lead members of the unit to pass, hoping to {{surprise}} the Germans. They were preparing to fire on three men who they believed were the Regiment's officers when a girl from the village emerged from one of the homes. Talking to the officers, she pointed in their general direction. An officer yelled a command, and the paratroopers jumped for ditches {{on either side of the}} road. The Americans thought she had given their position away and fired on the Germans, wounding several.

500|$|Arjona {{wrote the}} song for his mother, Noemí Morales. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> didn't {{like it because}} it make her cry.

[...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962.
