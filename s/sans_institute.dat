[...] It was designed to monitor computer systems and networks, {{and for this reason}} does not use SNMP natively, instead using a client–server model and its own network communications protocol. [...] Clients send status information over port TCP port 1984 every 5 minutes. [...] Since the clients only send information to a specific monitoring server, its creators claim it is more secure than SNMP-based protocols which poll clients for information. [...] For this reason, Big Brother was featured at <b>SANS</b> <b>Institute</b> security conferences in 1998. 1999, and at a SANSFIRE conference in 2001.|$|E
