5000|$|King Ludwig I, {{opened the}} glassworks in 1827 which {{continued}} production {{of high quality}} glass until the early 20th century. Franz Xaver Zettler headed the operation {{for much of this}} time. Together with his major competitor, Franz Mayer of the Royal Art Institute, these <b>stained-glass</b> <b>artists</b> developed the so-called [...] "Munich style" [...] of expert painting on relatively large glass panels (as opposed to the medieval technique of smaller pieces of colored glass held in a leaded framework, later adapted and modified by the great American designer Louis Comfort Tiffany).|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of glass factories, notably in Germany, USA, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce {{high-quality}} glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern <b>stained-glass</b> <b>artists</b> have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular Tiffany glass and Dalle de verre.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, {{stained glass}} {{development}} continued with the inter-war work of Johan Thorn Prikker and Josef Albers, and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included {{the abandonment of}} figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads. The works of Ludwig Schaffrath demonstrate the late 20th-century trends {{in the use of}} stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass. In the 1970s young British <b>stained-glass</b> <b>artists</b> such as Brian Clarke were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.|$|R

50|$|Pugin {{experienced}} {{great difficulty}} in finding <b>stained-glass</b> <b>artists</b> {{able to make}} windows to his complete satisfaction, and at the right price. The process involved the working-up of Pugins' drawings into full-sized cartoons, {{and the production of}} accurate colours by fusing various pigments onto the glass in a kiln at controlled temperatures. For the Cheadle windows he employed William Wailes of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. With the exception of the figure of St. Giles' in the south aisle, which he had altered at his own expense, Pugin was generally pleased with Wailes' efforts, noting that some of his best craftsmen had gone to Normandy to make special studies of old-style glass.|$|R
