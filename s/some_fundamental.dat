The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E

25|$|The current {{government}} of Ethiopia {{was installed in}} August 1995. The first President was Negasso Gidada.

25|$|The Age of Enlightenment {{was well}} {{received}} in Swiss cities, {{in spite of}} contemporary tendencies towards political conservatism. The early modern period {{was a time when}} Swiss science and literature flowered. In Zürich the scholar and physician Johann Jakob Scheuchzer wrote about Swiss history, geology, geography and science. In Basel the Bernoulli family and Leonhard Euler worked on mathematics and physics, coming up with <b>some</b> <b>fundamental</b> concepts in these fields. Albrecht von Haller and Jean-Jacques Rousseau praised the natural beauty and unspoiled state of Switzerland and triggered an early wave of tourism (notably, Goethe's visit to Switzerland in 1775).|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Hayek {{began the}} ‘Abuse of Reason’ project. His {{goal was to}} show how a number of then-popular doctrines and beliefs had a common origin in <b>some</b> <b>fundamental</b> misconceptions about the social science. In his {{philosophy}} of science, which has {{much in common with}} that of his good friend Karl Popper, Hayek was highly critical of what he termed scientism: a false understanding of the methods of science that has been mistakenly forced upon the social sciences, but that is contrary to the practices of genuine science. Usually, scientism involves combining the philosophers' ancient demand for demonstrative justification with the associationists' false view that all scientific explanations are simple two-variable linear relationships.|$|E
25|$|After the {{publication}} of MELTS, Ghiorso continued to improve and extend it {{with the help of}} colleagues such as Mark Hirschmann, Paul Asimow, Pete Reiners and Victor Kress. After they identified <b>some</b> <b>fundamental</b> problems with the theory at high pressure, they developed pMELTS, a model for high pressures (1-3 gigapascals (GPa)), and published it in 1995. Asimow and co-authors published phMELTS, a model for mid-ocean ridge basalts that incorporated the effect of water content. In 1998, Ghiorso, Hirschmann and Tim Grove established the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR), an online database for experimental results on solid-melt equilibria. With Gil Gualda, he modified MELTS to work better with rhyolite, a silicate-rich series of rocks, and released rhyolite-MELTS.|$|E

25|$|Raman {{amplifiers}} have <b>some</b> <b>fundamental</b> advantages. First, Raman gain {{exists in}} every fiber, {{which provides a}} cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2µm. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines {{can be used to}} increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification {{is that it is a}} relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth > 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|Even though <b>some</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{problems}} in the Spanish economy were already evident {{far ahead of the}} crisis, Spain continued the path of unsustainable property led growth when the ruling party changed in 2004. In these early times Spain had already a huge trade deficit, a loss of competitiveness against its main trading partners, an above-average inflation rate, house price increases, and a growing family indebtedness. During the third quarter of 2008 the national GDP contracted {{for the first time in}} 15 years, and, in February 2009, Spain (and other European economies) officially entered recession. The economy contracted 3.7% in 2009 and again in 2010 by 0.1%. It grew by 0.7% in 2011. By the 1st quarter of 2012, Spain was officially in recession once again.

This drew the ire of many fans, who thought that a quarterback of his caliber should know <b>some</b> <b>fundamental</b> rules; however, none of McNabb's critics accused him of not playing to win during the OT period in Cincinnati, and his play was tied into a game that was widely derided as one of the ugliest, most disjointed results in NFL history.|$|E
