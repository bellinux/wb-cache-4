5000|$|<b>Crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> {{are unable}} to bore cut, a {{technique}} that a chainsaw operator uses constantly. <b>Crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> require more space to operate. They also allow the sawyer to stand several feet {{farther away from the}} log, which is safer particularly when finishing cuts. <b>Crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> use does not require hearing protection, which makes communication between team members possible, and also allows the sawyer to listen to the noises made by the log as stresses change.|$|R

50|$|A <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> (thwart saw) is any saw {{designed}} for cutting wood perpendicular to (across) the wood grain. <b>Crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> may be small or large, with small teeth close together for fine work like woodworking or large for coarse work like log bucking, {{and can be}} a hand tool or power tool.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> classification, vintage and modern. Vintage saws are saws that can be {{anywhere}} from 30 to as much as 250 years old and are much sought after by professionals, and as such are typically very much more expensive than modern <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws.</b> Modern saws are typically stamped out of sheet metal and are manufactured from contemporary alloys; they behave very differently from vintage saws, which have historically been made by craftsmen who understood the nuances of the saws they produced.|$|R

5000|$|A kit for <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> work weighs {{much less}} than a kit for {{chainsaw}} work. A chainsaw kit includes fuel, oil, a few tools, and more personal protective equipment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> {{have been}} in use around the world since {{historic}} times, with {{the design of the}} saws (the cutting surfaces, the bow and shape of the saw, and the handles) changing over time to accommodate differences in the types of trees being cut, changes in metallurgy technology, and the application of experience. Records exist of <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> in use during the Roman Empire although not widely. [...] They came into wide usage in Europe {{in the middle of the}} 15th century. Early saws had a plain tooth pattern until the M tooth pattern was developed in 15th century south Germany. Prior to about 1880 <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> were primarily used for bucking, with axes used to fell trees. Starting in Pennsylvania about 1880, loggers began using the saws for felling trees as well. Despite the modern chainsaw, they are still in wide use around the world, not only in competition matches against chainsaws but also in regular, real-life usage since they afford certain advantages over gasoline-powered saws.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{maintenance}} {{carried out}} on <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> is sharpening, which requires a shop and a highly skilled filer. The primary maintenance on chainsaws is engine tuning, chain tensioning, and chain replacement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cutting edge}} of each tooth has a flat front edge and it is angled {{backward}} by about 8°, {{in contrast to a}} <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw,</b> which has teeth angled backward by about 15°.|$|R

5000|$|Crosscut: In woodworking, a cut made at (or close to) a {{right angle}} to the {{direction}} of the wood grain of the workpiece. A <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> is used to make this type of cut.|$|R
25|$|In solid timber, docking {{of members}} for a butt joint {{is usually a}} crosscut, so a <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> is best for this job. When working with sheetgoods, there is no {{distinction}} between crosscut and rip cut.|$|R
50|$|The cutting {{mechanics}} of the <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> tooth {{has been described as}} a ‘knife like’ cutting action. The sharp bevelled cutting edges sever the wood fibers perpendicular to the grain, reducing the amount of bending within the work-piece.|$|R
50|$|The Vallejo Gantner Hut {{is located}} at Macalister Springs near Mount Howitt and the <b>Crosscut</b> <b>Saw.</b> The {{construction}} commenced in late 1968. The hut was built as a memorial {{following the death of}} a young man named Vallejo Gantner.|$|R

50|$|Many <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> have {{a wooden}} handle {{with the return}} edge {{at right angles to}} the un-toothed edge of the saw blade, {{allowing}} the saw to serve as a square for marking material to be cut at a right angle.|$|R
50|$|The new {{directive}} specifies Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2358 (PDF) {{which covers}} classification of sawyers, their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) {{and numerous other}} aspects of required safety training and behavior when operating chainsaws or <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> on Federally-administered public lands.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{difference}} from the <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> is that the edges are sharpened {{at right angles to}} the cutting plane, forming chisel-like cutting surfaces, whereas the <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> is sharpened at an angle, so that each tooth has a knife-like cutting point in contact with the wood. This design keeps the saw from following grain lines, which could curve the path of the saw: by acting like a chisel, the saw can more easily cut across deviating grain lines, which is necessary if a straight cut is to be achieved. This feature enables the orthogonal cutting edge to efficiently transport wood-chips from the kerf, allowing subsequent teeth to perform a more effective cut.|$|R

50|$|The single buck event {{utilizes}} {{a two-man}} <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> operated by one individual, and is almost universally {{run as a}} singles event. The saw is typically of the same grade as the <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> used in the two man event, but may be custom filed for one person operation. The competitor is required to make a single cut or cookie through one large log. These logs are typically the largest diameter wood present at the competition. A competitor is allowed a starting cut, usually measured {{to be no more}} than 6-8 inches, or the width of a US One Dollar bill. A teammate is allowed to straddle the log and place a wedge to ease the competitor's progress and prevent binding of the saw.|$|R
50|$|A dragsaw is {{an early}} {{reciprocating}} saw using a 1.8 m (6-foot) steel <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> to buck logs to length. Prior to the popularization of the chainsaw during World War II, the dragsaw was a popular means of taking the hard work out of cutting wood.|$|R
5000|$|Two-man saws {{were known}} to the ancient Romans, but first became common in Europe in the mid-15th century. In America, <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> were used {{as early as the}} mid-17th century, but felling saws only began to replace axes for felling trees in the late 19th century.|$|R
25|$|In the United States Forest Service {{the use of}} {{chainsaws}} and <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> requires training and certification. A great deal of that training describes situational awareness as an approach toward environmental awareness but also self-awareness which includes being aware of one's own emotional attitude, tiredness, and even caloric intake.|$|R
50|$|Mount Buggery is a {{mountain}} {{located in the}} Alpine Shire within the Alpine National Park in the alpine region of Victoria, Australia.

50|$|A modern bow saw is a metal-framed <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> in {{the shape}} of a bow with a coarse wide blade. This type of saw is also known as a Swede saw, Finn saw or buck saw. It is a rough tool that can be used for {{cross-cutting}} branches or firewood (maybe up to 6 inches in diameter) down to size.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> {{are used}} within Designated Wildernesses where {{chainsaws}} are banned {{due to the}} prohibited use of motorized or mechanized tools and equipment, requiring that crosscut training also include {{the proper use of}} non-petroleum based lubricants as well as training in techniques which leave a minimal impact both ecologically as well as visually after trails are cleared of downed trees.|$|R
50|$|The contestants must {{install a}} nailing edge around their {{windows and doors}} in order to install trim and baseboards.

50|$|Traditionally {{over the}} past 250 years the use of <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> in the many forests of the United States lacked the use of safety {{clothing}} and equipment. However, safety training in contemporary usage in the United States dictates the mandatory use of gloves, eye protectors, chainsaw boots with hard tops and high-top ankle protectors, Kevlar chaps, and long sleeved shirts.|$|R
