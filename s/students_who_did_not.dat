5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938–40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.|$|E

However, the Chinese University of Hong Kong did not recognise it and required those students to pass an internal Chinese Language test.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2008 found that 11,739 homeschooled students, on average, scored 37 percentile points above {{public school students}} on standardized achievement tests.

25|$|Although it {{continued}} as a centre of clergy training until 1978, {{there was always}} a proportion of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> intend to be ordained. The 1896 charter specifically stated that the college could accept anyone, regardless of whether they intended to take Holy Orders and, since 1925, it had been possible to study for a BA at the college without studying any theology at all. Throughout the college's history, non-ordinands had been in a minority. In the 1950s however, the number of ordinands declined sharply and the College faced possible closure unless it could secure government funding. Principal J.R. Lloyd Thomas did not spare himself in the fight for survival and, in 1960, after much negotiation, University College, Cardiff, agreed to sponsor Saint David's. Thus the government finally began to assist SDC financially.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Long claimed support for Cooper, Pruitt et al. {{in the use of}} personas. In a partially controlled study, a group of students were asked to solve a design brief; two groups used personas while one group did not. The students who used personas were awarded higher course evaluations than the group who did not. Students who used personas were assessed as having produced designs with better usability attributes than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> use personas. The study also suggests that using personas may improve communication between design teams and facilitate user-focused design discussion. The study had several limitations: outcomes were assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the Hawthorne effect or Pygmalion effect) were not controlled for.|$|E

Mike and his sister Jane were raised in Solihull, where he attended Solihull School. At the age of 18 he was accepted to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to read economics. He did not enjoy the subject, so switched to history of art. Despite his public school background, Bullen felt out of place at Cambridge among <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> come from the urban West Midlands, later stating that [...] "Half the students were debutantes who {{spent a lot of}} time brushing their hair; the other half ended up working in Sotheby's."
