He was generally known in the world about him by a fond and familiar use of his Christian name. To call him [...] "Sir Richard" [...] in these pages (except in the character of one of his servants) would be simply ridiculous. When he lent his money, his horses, his house, and (sometimes, after unlucky friends had dropped to the lowest social depths) even his clothes, this general benefactor was known, in the best society and the worst society alike, as [...] "Dick." [...] He filled the hundred mouths of Rumor with his nickname, in the days when there was an opera in London, as the proprietor of the [...] "Beauty-box." [...] The ladies who occupied the box were all invited under the same circumstances. They enjoyed operatic music; but their husbands and fathers were not rich {{enough to be able to}} gratify that expensive taste. Dick's carriage called for them, and took them home again; and the beauties all agreed (if he ever married) that Mrs. Dick would be the most enviable woman on the face of the civilized earth. Even the false reports, which declared that he was privately married already, and on bad terms with his wife, slandered him cordially under the popular name.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) {{is characterized by a}} persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ADHD and drug dependence. Methods The presence and severity of ADHD and substance use were evaluated through questionnaires in 80 adult patients in therapeutic communities. Results No difference in drug use or dependence prevalence between ADHD and non-ADHD patients was found. However, ADHD patients had lower ages on admission (p = 0. 004) and at first contact with cocaine (p = 0. 033). In ADHD patients, there was a negative correlation between the age at first use of cannabis and the subsequent severity of cannabis use (p = 0. 017) and cocaine use (p = 0. 033). Conclusions Though {{there was no difference in}} prevalence of drug use among groups, results show that ADHD in patients in therapeutic communities may cause different addiction patterns, such as earlier use of cocaine and admission, and a more <b>severe</b> <b>use</b> of cocaine correlated to earlier contact with cannabis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Substance users being {{admitted}} to inpatient treatment experience {{a high level}} of mental distress. In this study we explored changes in mental distress during treatment. Methods Mental distress, as measured by the HSCL- 10, was registered at admission and at discharge among 164 substance users in inpatient treatment in Northern Norway. Predictors of reduction in mental distress were examined utilizing hierarchical regression analysis. Results We found a significant reduction in mental distress in the sample, but the number of patients scoring above cut-off on the HSCL- 10 at discharge was still much higher than in the general population. A more <b>severe</b> <b>use</b> of substances as measured by the AUDIT and the DUDIT, and being female, predicted a higher level of mental distress at admission to treatment as well as greater reduction in mental distress during treatment. Holding no education beyond 10 year compulsory school only predicted a reduction in mental distress. Conclusions The toxic and withdrawal effects of substances, level of education as well as gender, contributed to the differences in change in mental distress during treatment. Regression to the mean may in part explain some of the findings. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the winter}} Olympic sport of Skeleton, sliders sprint and load {{themselves}} onto the sled facing head forwards. The slider uses primarily {{their shoulders and}} torso to apply control to {{the direction of the}} sled as it progressively gains speed during its descent. These small control course keeping maneuvers alongside more <b>severe</b> <b>use</b> of toe tapping onto the ice will help determine the eventual trajectory of the sled. It is therefore of interest to consider for a possible trajectory what control actions will determine the fastest descent time and in particular what metrics should be examined. In this paper a three degree-of-freedom simulation has been developed to analyse the influence of different control strategies on the descent time of a bob-skeleton. A proportional-derivative (PD) controller is used to steer the simulation down a representation of the Igls ice-track. Parametric variations of the simulation's performance were analysed and compared to identify possible correlations for controllers assist the design of an optimal controller. Analysis of the results have identified positive correlations between descent time, transverse distance travelled and energy dissipation establishing that the fastest descent time is achieved by minimising the energy lost through the descent...|$|E

40|$|The {{legal rules}} {{governing}} {{the use of}} force between States {{is one of the most}} fundamental, and the most controversial, aspects of international law. An essential part of this area is the question of when, and to what extent, a State may lawfully use force against another in self-defence. This is particularly pertinent in the current climate within international relations when one considers that self-defence may be a possible means by which a State may respond to terrorist activity. However, the parameters of this inherent right remain obscure, despite the best efforts of scholars and, notably, the International Court of Justice. This thesis examines the relationship between the Court and the right of self-defence. Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, there have been three major decisions of the ICJ that have dealt directly with the law governing self-defence actions. This is in contrast to only two such cases in the preceding fifty years. Thus, the jurisprudence of the Court on this issue has for the first time been comprehensively drawn together, and then the merits of that jurisprudence have been assessed. It is argued that the contribution of the ICJ has been confused and unhelpful, and, moreover, is at odds with customary international law. The ICJ's fundamental conception of a primary criterion of 'armed attack' as constituting a qualitatively <b>severe</b> <b>use</b> of force must be brought into question.

The addition of user-recognizing-and-authorizing technologies to a firearm could eliminate the capability of an unauthorized user from firing an officer`s firearm. Sandia National Laboratories has been active in the research and development of nuclear security systems that include access and use control technologies.

An investigation into the end user requirements for smart gun technologies has been completed. During the remainder of the project, the user requirements are being transformed into engineering requirements. which will then be used to evaluate numerous technologies that could be used in a smart gun. Demonstration models will be made of the most promising technologies. Other potential applications are remote enabling and disabling of firearms, transportation of prisoners by corrections officers, military use in operations other than war, and use by private citizens...|$|E
40|$|Through a phenomenological {{qualitative}} approach, {{this study}} examined possible differences of introverted versus extraverted adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuse {{with regard to the}} coping mechanisms they chose. Preference modalities of introversion and extraversion were measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and data was collected through a semi-structured interview designed by the researcher. The interview contained questions about the 21 subjects' perceptions of their abuse {{and the ways in which}} they coped. Specific coping mechanisms included but were not limited to eating disorders, alcohol and/or drug abuse, high risk behavior, depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints. Results indicated that for both groups, the degree to which each of the individual coping mechanisms was used congregated at the level of "a driven pattern of behavior lasting for at least 7 days" or "on-going use resulting in severe problems". Extraverts showed higher percentages of <b>severe</b> <b>use</b> of the six coping mechanisms than did introverts. Depression was the most frequently used coping mechanism of both the introverts and the extraverts. Introverts showed higher percentages of stopping the use of eating disorders, alcohol/drug abuse, high risk behavior, and depression. Extraverts had higher percentages of discontinued use of anxiety and somatic problems. Introverts reported more somatic complaints, while extraverts reported more severe somatic problems. The most often reported somatic complaints of both groups were arthritis, migraines, sleep difficulty, nightmares, and gastrointestinal problems. The majority of each group used most of the coping mechanisms at some time, suggesting a need for therapeutic intervention that considers the possibility of difficulties stemming from combined use of many of these coping mechanisms in addition to focusing on the trauma of the sexual abuse itself...|$|E

A 74 -year-old {{man with a}} 15 -year history of diabetes mellitus was refilling a container with household detergent at home. He splashed the detergent in his eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed extensive epithelial damage to the left eye, leading to a persistent corneal epithelial defect. We used a bandage soft contact lens with levofloxacin eye drops as concomitant therapy {{in order to promote}} healing. However, a strain of fluoroquinolone-resistant Corynebacterium colonized the eye, so that the corneal ulcer eventually became <b>severe.</b> <b>Use</b> of the bandage soft contact lens was discontinued. His antimicrobial agent was changed to cefmenoxime, a drug to which fluoroquinolone-resistant Corynebacterium is sensitive, and topical instillation of autologous serum subsequently promoted improvement of the ulcer. On day 38 after injury, iris rubeosis led to hyphema and ghost cell glaucoma. With improvement of his corneal epithelial defect, the iris rubeosis and hyphema regressed and his visual acuity improved to 20 / 25 on the left eye. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case resulting in severe complications due to chemical injury by a neutral detergent. Ophthalmologists should be aware that corneal epithelial damage may become prolonged in elderly patients with diabetes, and unexpectedly severe when wearing bandage soft contact lens, with infection of Corynebacterium resistant to fluoroquinolones, even if the chemical agent is a neutral detergent.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} possible {{factors related}} to use of substances, with specific focus on psychological factors associated with increased risk of using illicit drugs. Thus, factors such as gender, personality traits, mental health status as well as family settings were investigated. Others factors also studied were use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs, age of debut for substance use, subjective response to illicit drug use, attitudes towards drug use and future intentions of illicit drug use. An additional aim was to validate the health relevant personality inventory (HP 5 i) for adolescents. Participants were 3419 male and female senior high school students (18 years) in a cross-sectional study. Respondents filled out a self-administered questionnaire and the study {{was carried out in}} the participants’ schools. Study 1 showed that HP 5 i is a valid inventory and traits found to be associated with risk consumption of substances were mainly antagonism and impulsivity. Results from Study 2 showed that additional factors, such as problems within the rearing family, individual mental health problems and regular and excessive intake of legal substances, was associated with illicit drug use. Furthermore, significant associations between excessive use of illicit drugs, positive drug effects as well as intention of future drug use were found. In Study 3 groups of adolescents with different psychological profiles, based upon levels of impulsivity, depressive symptoms and positive drug effect were identified. Individuals characterised by high levels of the clustering variables reported <b>severe</b> <b>use</b> of substances and occurrence of other well known risk factors associated with substance use. Similar cluster profiles were also identified in a sample of adolescent in treatment for substance abuse. The findings from this thesis emphasize the fact that several psychological factors are associated with substance use in adolescence. Notable, the variable “positive drug effect” seems to be highly related to excessive illicit drug use and to intention of future drug use. Enhanced knowledge about {{factors related to}} substance use is important for the development of effective preventive and treatment strategies concerning adolescents’ substance use...|$|E
40|$|The use of psychometric {{instruments}} in detecting problematic {{alcohol and drug}} use among adolescents has been most extensively investigated with the MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale (MAC), (MacAndrew, 1965). The MAC has been described as measuring a bipolar dimension of character, with “…high scores being indicative of a reward-seeking or `go 2 ̆ 7 orientation and low scores being indicative of a punishment-avoidance or `stop 2 ̆ 7 orientation” (MacAndrew, 1981). ^ Subsequently, MacAndrew, 1985, constructed the Substance Abuse Proclivity scale (SAP) geared to the early detection of “problem engineering {{alcohol and drug use}} in younger men. ” ^ This study examined the relative efficacy of the MAC-R, as well as other currently used alcoholism scales, the PRO, SAP, and ACK in detecting substance abuse among 1051 inpatient psychiatric adolescents ranging from age 13 – 17 in a private psychiatric inpatient setting. ^ The relationship between each scale and the SCID-PSUD was examined through kappa coefficients and analysis of variance. The presence of substance abuse was examined within three classifications: Reported no drug use versus any drug use, subjects reporting no use versus those who fell on the continuum of experimentation to multiple diagnoses of abuse; Reported experimentation versus <b>severe</b> <b>use,</b> subjects reporting no use or experimentation with cannabis and/or cannabis versus those who fell on the continuum of using alcohol or cannabis plus another drug to multiple diagnoses of abuse; and Reported symptoms meeting criteria for at least a single diagnosis of substance abuse versus no diagnosis, subjects reporting no symptoms indicating a diagnosis of substance abuse versus those who indicate at least a single diagnosis of substance abuse. Sensitivity and specificity values were generated as an attempt to identify MAC-R, PRO, SAP, and ACK raw cutoff scores that maximize the accurate classification of individuals (based upon level of drug use). ^ Each scale 2 ̆ 7 s ability to identify substance abuse/experimentation (sensitivity) improved across the classifications. All scales demonstrated at least good sensitivity within the “Reported symptoms meeting criteria for at least a single diagnosis of substance abuse versus no diagnosis classification. ^ With regard to specificity, the PRO and SAP scales revealed excellent specificity within the “Reported no drug use versus any drug use” classification and poor specificity within the “Reported symptoms meeting criteria for at least a single diagnosis of substance abuse versus no diagnosis. ” The MAC-R and ACK scales maintained stronger specificity within the “Reported symptoms meeting criteria for at least a single diagnosis of substance abuse versus no diagnosis classification. ” ^ Additionally, the impact of gender, age, and reported symptoms of psychopathology was examined by comparing the true positives and false negatives obtained from each scale. The results were varied. Report of externalizing symptoms was revealed as the most consistent difference between true positives and false negatives. The impact of gender was less consistent and age was not revealed as a significant factor for any of the scales. The MAC-R obtained the lowest overall success rate and the ACK scale obtained the highest overall success rate. The clinical utility and limitations of all four instruments are discussed as well as the applications for school-child clinical psychologists. * ^ *Originally published in DAI Vol. 59, No. 7.
