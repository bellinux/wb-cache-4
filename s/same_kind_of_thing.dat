40|$|Minority {{language}} {{communities that}} are seeking to develop their language may be hampered {{by a lack of}} vernacular materials.

Automated adaptation holds potential to enable these large volumes of materials to be efficiently translated into the resource-scarce language. I describe a project to assess the feasibility of automatically adapting text between Limbu and Yamphu, two languages in Nepal’s Kiranti grouping. The approaches taken—essentially a transfer-based system partially hybridized with a Kiranti-specific interlingua—are placed in the context of machine translation efforts world-wide. A key principle embodied in this strategy is that adaptation can transcend the structural obstacles by taking advantage of functional commonalities. That is, what matters most for successful adaptation is that the languages “care about the <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> ” I examine various typological phenomena of these languages to assess this degree of functiona...|$|R
40|$|Just as {{string theory}} in physics is {{bringing}} together the {{general theory of}} relativity and quantum mechanics, there may be similar promise in crossing the “strands ” of media ecology and applied behavioral science. While media ecology is the study of media environments and the effects of technology, applied behavioral science focuses on the theory and practice of group dynamics, organizational change, and societal change. Bringing these fields, or “strands, ” together has the potential to enhance awareness and improve actions for guiding business and social change in our increasingly technopolistic society. Departing from Duke Ellington’s song “It Don’t Mean A Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing” commenting on music, the <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> have been said about {{the general theory of}} relativity and quantum mechanics in physics.

40|$|During {{the early}} 17 th century, Finns {{migrated}} within the Swedish kingdom from interior Finland to virgin spruce forest areas in Sweden. There {{they settled in}} finnmarker, areas with Finnish-speaking households conducting large-scale swidden cultivation, huuhta in Finnish. Eventually they were called Forest Finns. There farms were centered around a rökstuga, a dwelling-house with a stone-oven without a chimney. Four Forest Finn farms have been excavated. The article discusses how the Finish households were integrated in the local and regional market economy, thus acquiring the <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> also used by their Swedish neighbours, including status and prestige objects, e. g. display ceramics and window glass panes. At the same time, they continued to live in their traditional rökstugor, which, owing to different space, light and warmth compared to a Swedish cottage with an open fireplace conditioned other relations between the individuals of the households. The process of change, Swedification, of the Forest Finns was not unilinear.   Ethnicity is the social process of meeting between two or more groups of people forming ‘us-and-them’-relations. The early-modern Forst Finns {{is an example of}} complex change as concerns materiality involved in ethnicity, in this case triggered by the meeting of ‘the others’ as a result of migration...|$|R

We review a number of core theories of visual category learning, specifically those theories instantiated as computational models, highlighting {{just some of the}} experimental results that help distinguish between competing models. We examine behavioral and neural evidence for single versus multiple representational systems for visual category learning.

60|$|Another {{case of the}} <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> can {{be found}} in the latest conceptions of humour. By the {{wholesome}} tradition of mankind, a joke was a thing meant to amuse men; a joke which did not amuse them was a failure, just as a fire which did not warm them was a failure. But we have seen the process of secrecy and aristocracy introduced even into jokes. If a joke falls flat, a small school of æsthetes only ask us to notice the wild grace of its falling and its perfect flatness after its fall. The old idea that the joke was not good enough for the company has been superseded by the new aristocratic idea that the company was not worthy of the joke. They have introduced an almost insane individualism into that one form of intercourse which is specially and uproariously communal. They have made even levities into secrets. They have made laughter lonelier than tears.|$|E
60|$|So {{much for}} why I am an anti-vivisectionist; and I {{should like to}} say, in conclusion, that all other anti-vivisectionists of my {{acquaintance}} weaken their case infinitely by forming this attack on a scientific speciality in which the human heart is commonly on their side, with attacks upon universal human customs in which the human heart {{is not at all}} on their side. I have heard humanitarians, for instance, speak of vivisection and field sports {{as if they were the}} <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> The difference seems to me simple and enormous. In sport a man goes into a wood and mixes with the existing life of that wood; becomes a destroyer only in the simple and healthy sense in which all the creatures are destroyers; becomes for one moment to them what they are to him--another animal. In vivisection a man takes a simpler creature and subjects it to subtleties which no one but man could inflict on him, and for which man is therefore gravely and terribly responsible.|$|E
6000|$|If I might {{pursue the}} figure of speech, I might briefly say that the whole Collectivist error {{consists}} in saying that because two men can share an umbrella, therefore two men can share a walking-stick. Umbrellas might possibly be replaced by some kind of common awnings covering certain streets from particular showers. But there is nothing but nonsense {{in the notion of}} swinging a communal stick; it is as if one spoke of twirling a communal mustache. It will be said that this is a frank fantasia and that no sociologists suggest such follies. Pardon me if they do. I will give a precise parallel to the case of confusion of sticks and umbrellas, a parallel from a perpetually reiterated suggestion of reform. At least sixty Socialists out of a hundred, when they have spoken of common laundries, will go on at once to speak of common kitchens. This is just as mechanical and unintelligent as the fanciful case I have quoted. Sticks and umbrellas are both stiff rods that go into holes in a stand in the hall. Kitchens and washhouses are both large rooms full of heat and damp and steam. But the soul and function of the two things are utterly opposite. There is only one way of washing a shirt; that is, there is only one right way. There is no taste and fancy in tattered shirts. Nobody says, [...] "Tompkins likes five holes in his shirt, but I must say, give me the good old four holes." [...] Nobody says, [...] "This washerwoman rips up the left leg of my pyjamas; now if there is one thing I insist on it is the right leg ripped up." [...] The ideal washing is simply to send a thing back washed. But {{it is by no means}} true that the ideal cooking is simply to send a thing back cooked. Cooking is an art; it has in it personality, and even perversity, for the definition of an art is that which must be personal and may be perverse. I know a man, not otherwise dainty, who cannot touch common sausages unless they are almost burned to a coal. He wants his sausages fried to rags, yet he does not insist on his shirts being boiled to rags. I do not say that such points of culinary delicacy are of high importance. I do not say that the communal ideal must give way to them. What I say is that the communal ideal is not conscious of their existence, and therefore goes wrong from the very start, mixing a wholly public thing with a highly individual one. Perhaps we ought to accept communal kitchens in the social crisis, just as we should accept communal cat's-meat in a siege. But the cultured Socialist, quite at his ease, by no means in a siege, talks about communal kitchens as if they were the <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> as communal laundries. This shows at the start that he misunderstands human nature. It is as different as three men singing the same chorus from three men playing three tunes on the same piano.|$|E
5000|$|Delpit {{attended}} Antioch College in Ohio, {{which was}} {{known at the}} time for its radicalism. After she obtained her Bachelor of Science Degree in Education, she was eager to utilize the progressive teaching strategies in her first teaching position at an inner-city open elementary school in Southern Philadelphia. The students were 60 percent poor black children from South Philadelphia and 40 percent white children from Society Hill. Delpit recalls: [...] "The black kids went to school there because it was their only neighborhood school. The white kids went to school there because their parents had learned the <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> I had learned about education." [...] Dissonance arose in Delpit's teaching when she realized her strategies did not work for all her students; her white students zooming ahead while her black students played games and learned to read, but only much slower than the white kids. Later on, when Delpit attended Harvard Graduate School of Education to pursue her Master's and Doctoral degrees in Curriculum, Instruction and Research, she came to {{understand the importance of}} students learning to write in meaningful contexts. Delpit went on to explore the novel views acquired about culture and learning by way of a fellowship she received which facilitated her work in Papua New Guinea.
