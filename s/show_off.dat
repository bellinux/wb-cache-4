5|$|According {{to a story}} relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports <b>show</b> <b>Off</b> The Record, Hart was {{originally}} supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, the match did not happen because Hogan changed his mind, as he was supposedly {{not happy with the}} planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead.|$|E

As punishment, Nelson is forced to return all stolen items to their owners and is sentenced to be a janitor alongside Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to drive}} sales of the system, Pixar {{employee}} John Lasseter—who had long been working on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as Luxo Jr. (1986), to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the device's capabilities—premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jeong-an's old boyfriend came over, and <b>showed</b> <b>off</b> his skiing skills which appealed to Jeong-an as she clapped her hands. The boyfriend stopped short of kicking her down, and even scratched away some ice in the process.|$|R

When it draws unwanted attention, Pam concludes {{that it is too}} revealing.|$|E
5|$|The Jean and Johnnie {{dance was}} an {{important}} part of Barbadian culture until it was banned in the 19th century. This was a popular fertility dance performed outdoors at plantation fairs and other festivals, and was functional in that it allowed women to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> to men, and more rarely, vice versa. The dance was eventually banned because the dance was associated with non-Christian African traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the V12 engine.|$|E

50|$|Countersignaling by contrast, is <b>showing</b> <b>off</b> by not <b>showing</b> <b>off,</b> or {{by playing}} humble. For instance, the nouveau riche {{are eager to}} flaunt their wealth, and often {{surround}} themselves with expensive luxury items. Those with old money are more understated, preferring not to waste money on such frivolities.|$|R
5|$|The smaller {{of the two}} cocks-of-the-rock, {{the male}} Guianan takes the lesser part in breeding. It is {{polygynous}} and {{has nothing to do}} with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that <b>show</b> <b>off</b> its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to the females.|$|E
5|$|To <b>show</b> <b>off</b> {{their new}} fighter, the Navy led {{a series of}} record-breaking flights early in Phantom development: All in all, the Phantom set 16 world records.

5|$|Allen {{acquired}} the stone quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. He used the unique honey-coloured Bath stone, {{used to build}} the Georgian city, {{and as a result}} made a second fortune. Allen built a railway line from his mine on Combe Down which carried the stone down the hill, now known as Ralph Allen Drive, which runs beside Prior Park, to a wharf he constructed at Bath Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal to transport stone to London. Following a failed bid to supply stone to buildings in London, Allen wanted a building which would <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the properties of Bath stone as a building material.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
5|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{developed}} by Zippo Games' founder Ste Pickford {{and was the first}} game that he developed for the NES. Steve Hughes also assisted in development, while Rare's video game composer David Wise did the music and sound. Pickford wanted to expand on the previous Wizards & Warriors game. Having experience with developing computer games, Pickford used various animation and graphics techniques to try and <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the NES' graphical capabilities. In addition, Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros on the game's cover.|$|E
5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that <b>show</b> <b>off</b> its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E
5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for auto companies to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E
5|$|The race {{itself was}} much like its Greek counterpart, {{although}} there were usually 24 races every day that, during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so {{that there could be}} even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (quadrigae) and two-horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> his skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical.|$|E
5|$|Top Hat began filming on April 1, 1935 {{and cost}} $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June {{and the first}} public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of {{approximately}} ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s. After Mutiny on the Bounty, it made more money than any other film released in 1935.|$|E
