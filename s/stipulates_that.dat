5|$|The UN Charter <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> each primary {{organ of}} the United Nations can {{establish}} various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Luka Rijeka d.d., {{operator}} of the Port of Rijeka, {{signed a contract}} of strategic partnership with the ICTSI and Jadranska vrata d.d.. The partnership aims to expand {{the capacity of the}} container terminal to 600,000 TEUs. The contract also <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> the concession regarding operation of the terminal is to last for 30 years with an investment of 54 million euro. It is estimated that ICTSI and Luka Rijeka d.d. will invest up to one billion kuna (135million euro) in the Port of Rijeka. Upgrades of other port terminals are also planned, with investments through the World Bank and through build-operate-transfer and public–private partnership schemes. They include cargo terminals in the city of Rijeka and the new passenger terminal opened in October 2009.|$|E

5|$|On September 5, 2008, Harper {{nominated}} Thomas Cromwell of Nova Scotia Court of Appeal to {{fill the}} Supreme Court seat left vacant by the departure of Michel Bastarache. By and large Cromwell's nomination was well received, with many lauding the selection; however, dissent has been noted surrounding the nomination. First, Harper bypassed parliament's supreme court selection panel, {{which was supposed to}} produce a list of three candidates for him to choose from. Second, Newfoundland justice minister Jerome Kennedy criticized the appointment, citing the Newfoundland government's belief that constitutional convention <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> a Newfoundlander should have been named to the court in the rotation of Atlantic Canadian supreme court representation.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the beach, or it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E
5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

5|$|When Willard {{tells her}} that the {{insurance}} company won't pay until her death, she dies of a heart attack. Her will <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> her killer must {{take care of her}} duck. After the duo spend a night in jail, the duck takes Willard to a brothel. After a wild night of partying, they wind up in the desert, where the duck dresses Willard in women's clothing in an attempt to get a ride. After several encounters with an old prospector dying of thirst, a racist police officer, two lesbians, and a short Mexican man, they are finally picked up by a trucker.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E
5|$|Hosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat as President of Egypt {{following}} Sadat's assassination in 1981. While al-Azhar {{would continue}} to oblige the government in granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates, the mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under Mubarak's regime. Under Jad al-Haq, the sheikh of al-Azhar from 1982 {{until his death in}} 1994, al-Azhar asserted its independence from the state, at times criticizing policies of the state for instigating extremist Islamist sects. Al-Haq argued that if the government wished al-Azhar to effectively combat groups such as al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya then al-Azhar must be permitted greater independence from the state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference. Under Mubarak, a number of powers of the state were ceded to al-Azhar. During the 1990s, modifications to existing censorship laws gave al-Azhar the ability to censor both print and electronic media. Though the law <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> al-Azhar may only become involved following a complaint, in practice its role has been much more pervasive; for example, television scripts were routinely sent to al-Azhar for approval prior to airing.|$|E

5|$|On 5 January 1840, Donizetti {{signed a}} {{rehearsal}} and performance contract with his librettists and Anténor Joly, who was operating a company named Théâtre de la Renaissance and giving performances at the Salle Ventadour in Paris. Théâtre de la Renaissance chose L'ange over Richard Wagner's Das Liebesverbot. Joly's company had premiered the French version of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor the previous year, and L'ange {{was meant to}} be its successor. The contract, which is on display at the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra National de Paris, <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> L'ange be performed uninterrupted twenty times unless three consecutive performances sold poorly, and that Joly could not premiere any other opera until the revenue from L'ange started to decline. The contract contains nothing about Donizetti's compensation; therefore, it is possible that another contract existed. L'ange was set to begin rehearsal on 1 February 1840. Donizetti had two other operas in various stages of preparation at other theaters during this time: Les martyrs and La fille du régiment.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Allied airmen {{who were}} {{captured}} after being {{shot down over}} Japan were mistreated. On 8September 1944, the Cabinet of Japan directed that indiscriminate bombing constituted a war crime despite the fact there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft at the time. As a result, captured Allied airmen were subject to trial and possible execution although the rules of war <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> only soldiers who engaged in combat or carry out acts of sabotage or espionage wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes behind enemy lines can be punished. The frequency of such executions differed between military districts, however. While no airmen were executed in the Tōbu district (eastern Musashi), which included Tokyo, those captured in the Tōkai, Chūbu and Seibu (western Musashi) districts were sometimes killed after a brief trial or summarily executed by the Kempeitai ("Military Police Corps"). For instance, 33 American airmen were killed by IJA personnel at Fukuoka, including 15 who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on 15 August. Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the men into custody. In addition to these killings, most captured B-29 crewmen were brutally interrogated by the Kempeitai.|$|E
