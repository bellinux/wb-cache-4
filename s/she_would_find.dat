5|$|Due to time constraints, some {{plot points}} of Asellus story were removed. During those events, Asellus was {{supposed}} to visit Dr. Nusakan's clinic, Bio Research Lab, Lambda Base, and Furdo's Workshop so that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> her true identity {{so that she would}} decide to live as a human being or as a mystic. These quests were also intended to affect her scenario's ending.|$|E

5|$|M. N. Rajam {{was cast}} as Manohari, {{the queen of}} Ratnapuri, and king Marthandan's wife. Ramachandran wanted Rajam for the role to avoid her being typecast as a {{character}} driven by jealousy and malice. For the role of Ratna, B. Saroja Devi was selected after a successful audition. Saroja Devi was not fluent in Tamil at the time, so her dialogues were written {{in such a way}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> it easier to pronounce them. P. S. Veerappa, M. N. Nambiar and Chakrapani played the antagonists Vijayavarman, Pingalan and Karmegam. T. K. Balachandran, who was prominent in Malayalam films, was cast as Bhupathi. K. R.

However, a deaf lunch lady storms in and says that she's actually Trina's mother. The lunch lady says that Lianne was a friend who covered up her pregnancy to protect her. Trina's father is Principal Moorehead, and Trina confronts him about leaving her at the prom in front of many faculty. Veronica finds the dead rat that Keith picked up at the bus.

5|$|Aloy {{helps the}} Nora tribe {{fight off the}} Eclipse and then enters the door beneath the Nora mountain. She finds a {{recording}} left behind by GAIA, revealing that a signal of unknown origin caused HADES to activate and seize control of her functions. As a last resort, GAIA self-destructed {{in order to stop}} HADES. Without GAIA to maintain the terraforming process, the entire system began to break down. As a contingency plan, GAIA created a clone of Dr. Sobeck in the form of Aloy, in the hope that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> GAIA's message, destroy HADES, and restore GAIA's functions. Aloy learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed her life to ensure the Faro robot swarm would not find GAIA. Aloy manages to obtain the System Override necessary to destroy HADES. Sylens admits that he was the original founder of the Eclipse, originally tempted by HADES' promises of knowledge. With Sylens's help, Aloy surmises that HADES wants to send a signal to reactivate the Faro robots so that they can once again extinguish all life on Earth. Aloy kills Helis and helps fight off waves of corrupted machines, before stabbing HADES with Sylens' lance, ending the war. Aloy then journeys to Dr. Sobeck's old home, where she finds her corpse, and has a moment of mourning for her predecessor. In a post-credits scene, HADES is shown to still be alive, but trapped by Sylens, who intends to interrogate HADES to find out who sent the signal that activated it in the first place.|$|E

5|$|The Creator, after {{creating}} Aquaria, {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E

He described various incidents and events he believes <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> interesting. His last letter in the Missouri Historical collection to his daughter Jo dated August 15, 1870 is reflective of his service.

In one violent incident, Ronnie Elliott dislocated his wife's shoulders and, during another, Elliott herself was threatened with a gun. At fourteen, Elliott's mother decided to end the situation; she fled with her daughter {{under the guise of}} taking a joyride on a local bus.

500|$|In 2002, Bonfire was retired, after {{a nine-year}} {{international}} career. The pair's gold-medal-winning freestyle dressage {{performance at the}} 1994 World Equestrian Games marked the first the time event had been held at the Games, and [...] "changed the world of dressage forever", according to fellow Olympic gold medalist Carl Hester. A statue was erected in Erp to mark Bonfire's achievements. In October 2013, he was euthanized following illness. After Bonfire's retirement, Van Grunsven stated that she never thought <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> another horse {{as good as he}} was; however, his successor Salinero proved to be even more successful. In March 2013, Salinero was retired. Van Grunsven and Salinero have been called the [...] "pioneers of the modern freestyle test", and were the first pair to have music written specifically for their performances. A horse known for his power and ability, he was also sensitive and, early in his career, prone to becoming tense, making him a more difficult horse to ride. Despite this, he was a star of the dressage world, winning numerous international competitions.|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} Skáldskaparmál, Idunn is {{mentioned}} {{in its first}} chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight ásynjur (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in Asgard for Ægir. In chapter 56, Bragi tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the jötunn Þjazi. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, Loki finds himself stuck to the bird. Loki is pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees. Loki feels that his arms might be pulled out from his shoulders. Loki shouts and begs the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would not be free unless he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts Þjazi's conditions and returns to his friends Odin and Hœnir. At the time Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into [...] "a certain forest", telling {{her that he had}} discovered some apples that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> worth keeping, and told Iðunn that she ought to bring her own apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples he has discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her and takes her to his home, Þrymheimr.|$|E
500|$|Perennially [...] "unlucky in love", Donna {{fits the}} tart {{with a heart}} stereotype. Her {{numerous}} romances during her tenure earned her the nickname [...] "Nurse 'Action' Jackson". In 2004, she had a lesbian liaison with Mickie. The scene in which they kissed was edited to half its original length after being deemed too explicit for pre-watershed broadcast. Later that year, Jacobs stated that her ideal storyline would be for Donna {{to find a good}} man and gain a promotion, hoping <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> someone who would treat her well and help her give up her recreational drug habit. Her love interests included physiotherapist Justin Fuller, registrars Ed Keating (Rocky Marshall) and Mubbs Hussein (Ian Aspinall), manager Bradley Hume, senior house officer Sean Thompson (Chinna Wodu), and a love triangle with married consultant Michael Spence and his cardiothoracic colleague Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Although Michael did not initially disclose to Donna that he was married, Jacobs stated that her character was aware of this [...] "deep down", but was unfortunately unperturbed. He treated her badly, to the point that he would only have sex with her in a toilet stall; nonetheless Jacobs assessed that Donna was in love with him, believing him to be [...] "the one" [...] and different from her previous lovers, branding her deluded in this respect.|$|E
500|$|The press heard rumours about Lennon's {{wife and}} child {{at the end of}} 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother's house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and {{neighbours}} protected their anonymity, but she was often approached by journalists. In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church, but didn't tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because she feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and he was angry as he hadn't wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian's godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon's secret wife and baby boy. Epstein told the other Beatles {{to make the best of}} the situation, and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. [...] After living at Lennon's aunt's house for some months, the couple [...] moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor's Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, and then go back down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles' fans soon found out where they were living, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> them camping out in the hallway, and have to push through them when leaving or arriving.|$|E

2500|$|As {{research}} for her doctoral dissertation, Jennifer Crusie determined to read 100 romance novels.

2500|$|By 1957, Fred and {{his brother}} John would socialise at a youth club in nearby Ledbury, though his {{distinct}} and guttural Herefordshire accent marked him as a [...] "country bumpkin".

When a girl did acquiesce to his advances, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> his sexual performance unsatisfying, as his primary objective was his own gratification.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the years}} went by, Emperor Huan became {{increasingly}} disgruntled at Liang Ji's {{control of the government}} and was also angered by Empress Liang's behavior. [...] Because of her position as Empress Dowager Liang and Liang Ji's sister, Empress Liang was wasteful in her luxurious living, far exceeding any past empress, and was exceedingly jealous. [...] She did not have a son and, because she did not want any other imperial consorts to have sons, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> some way to murder pregnant consorts. [...] Emperor Huan did not dare to react to her due to Liang Ji's power, but rarely had sexual relations with her. [...] In 159, angry and depressed that she had lost her husband's favor, Empress Liang died.|$|E
