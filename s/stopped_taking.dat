5|$|In a 1983 study, only 5% of {{patients}} who had abruptly <b>stopped</b> <b>taking</b> long-acting benzodiazepines after less than 8 months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% {{of those who had}} been taking them for more than 8 months did. With alprazolam– a short-acting benzodiazepine– taken for 8 weeks, 65% {{of patients}} experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering.|$|E

She returned to the United States, became severely depressed, and began taking lithium again. In 1986, Millett <b>stopped</b> <b>taking</b> lithium without adverse reactions. After one lithium-free year, Millett announced the news to stunned family and friends.|$|E

Stein had <b>stopped</b> <b>taking</b> the diuretic medication prescribed for this in the days leading up to the game, which has been suggested as a contributory factor to his eventual collapse.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Weston {{was found}} incompetent {{to stand trial}} due to mental illness as {{he was a man}} with {{schizophrenia}} who <b>stopped</b> <b>taking</b> his medication. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with antipsychotic medication without his consent in 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision. In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried, despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal charges against him. Weston was known to the United States Secret Service prior to the incident as a person who had threatened the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} went on {{an extensive}} hiatus from professional wrestling, beginning in August 2004. As was announced before ROH's Scramble Cage Melee, Mark {{was injured in}} a motorcycle accident between Testing the Limit and that show, and thus both brothers had left Ring of Honor. As Jay didn't wish to return to wrestling without his brother, they <b>stopped</b> <b>taking</b> bookings from any company. After making their returns in mid-2005 to Pro Wrestling Unplugged, followed in late 2005 at ROH, the company they had regularly been working for {{at the time of}} Mark's accident, hyped their return at the Fourth Anniversary Show in February 2006.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived on}} the 8 Mile, in Royal Oak, in Rochester, and in the suburb Sterling Heights, Black grew up in {{and spent most of}} her life in various parts of Detroit, Michigan. Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. He owned a hair salon and brought her along to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents {{separated}} when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also expelled, shortly after, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to dropout, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen. Black had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, tap, and ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer. After being expelled from her last school, Black ran away from home. She started begging, doing drugs, and drinking while crashing at friends' houses at night. After going on tour with Armor for Sleep, she returned to Detroit and <b>stopped</b> <b>taking</b> drugs.|$|E

40|$|QUESTION: Two of my {{patients}} are planning to become pregnant. One is taking paroxetine and the other lorazepam. We have discussed {{what to do when}} they become pregnant and have decided they should <b>stop</b> <b>taking</b> these drugs as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Is this the right decision? ANSWER: The decision to discontinue these drugs during pregnancy should be based on scientific evidence rather than "hearsay" that women should not take psychotropic medications during pregnancy. Recent epidemiologic studies have documented the relative safety of these drugs, so women should not feel compelled to <b>stop</b> <b>taking</b> them when they become pregnant. If, after receiving appropriate evidence-based information, a woman decides to <b>stop</b> <b>taking</b> the drugs, they should be gradually tapered off to avoid abrupt discontinuation syndrome...|$|R

5|$|Hill was a gymnast {{early in}} life, nearly broke {{a world record}} lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to {{climbing}} at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and {{became a part of}} the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to her first love: traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and has not <b>stopped</b> <b>taking</b> on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.|$|E
