50|$|The Tamiya Radio Controlled Nitro Off-road Vehicles {{entered the}} radio {{controlled}} (RC) nitro engine (glow engine) powered 1/8 <b>scale</b> <b>truck</b> market in July 2002. Produced by the Tamiya Corporation of Japan, these 1/8 <b>scale</b> <b>trucks</b> {{are designed for}} stadium competition. Tamiya's first nitro truck, TR-15, was introduced in 1994. Second truck was Mad Bison, released in 2000. Third attempt, Terra Crusher, departed greatly from the previous two. Terra Crusher (TG-01), released in July 2002, capitalized on the off-road monster RC boom of the time; subsequent trucks include the Wild Commando, TNX (TGM-03), TNX 5.2R, and Nitrage. The trucks perform in competitions for Remotely Operated Auto Racers (ROAR) abbreviated as ROAR. ROAR is the sanctioning body of competitive radio-controlled car racing in the United States and Canada, overseen by IFMAR (International Federation of Model Auto Racing).|$|R

40|$|In {{the north}} of Sweden, there are some wealthy mines that have being {{actively}} explored. To transport the metals from the mines to its destination there are being used Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV). This setup has two main restrictions: the HDVs must travel 4 minutes apart; and due to the roughness of the terrain there are some areas where only one vehicle can go through at a time. The project {{was developed in the}} Smart Mobility Lab (SML), in KTH, Stockholm. It was created a test platform that simulates the behavior of HDVs in <b>scaled</b> <b>trucks.</b> The <b>scaled</b> <b>trucks</b> are controlled with PID controllers to follow paths in a road network that was also created during this project and also keep a formation with a fixed distance between vehicles. To track the position of the trucks it was used a motion capture system. Basically, it was created a system that allows to test several features of platooning {{and at the same time}} apply traffic control with virtual traffic lights. On top of the system it was applied an instantaneous fuel consumption model that makes possible a fuel consumption analysis. Several scenarios were designed in order to showcase some features of the system and at the same time analyze its benefits. In the end of the thesis it was possible to see the benefits of using traffic control in the situation described. Also a big contribution of the thesis was the construction of the testbed that has been proven to be an effective showcase tool of platooning techniques and simple traffic control. The application developed was created in a generic way in order to serve as a base resource of knowledge for future works. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{weighing}} platform of the <b>truck</b> <b>scale</b> is a load-bearer, {{which is used}} for bearing a load. Its structure has many forms, in this paper, the finite element analysis of a structure with u-beam which is currently {{the most widely used}} for different loading modes, the traditional method of structural analysis of <b>truck</b> <b>scale</b> is to simplily the platform as a simply supported beam. As the model is too simplified, the result of this method will be unreliable and it cannot make part analysis about stress and strain. In this research, ANSYS was used to model, and loaded analysis. Through different loading, get the structure of {{weighing platform}} stress distribution and deformation.

40|$|Autonomous driving {{has been}} an {{important}} topic of research in recent years. In this thesis we study its application to Heavy Duty Vehicles, more specically, vehicles consisting of a truck and a trailer. An overview study is done on three fundamental steps of an autonomous driving system, planning, trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. In the planning part, we use RRT, and two other variants of the algorithm to nd trajectories in an unstructured environment, e. g., a mining site. A novel path optimization post-processing technique well suited for use with RRT solutions was also developed. For the trajectory tracking task several well-known controllers were tested, and their performance compared. An extension is proposed to one of the controllers in order {{to take into account the}} trailer. The performance evaluation was done on <b>scaled</b> <b>truck</b> systems in the Smart Mobility Lab at KTH. The obstacle avoidance is done with the aid of a simple, yet functional Model Predictive Controller. For this purpose, we developed dierent formulations of the optimization problem, corresponding to distinct optimization goals and vehicle models, in order to assess both the quality of the MPC, and of the assumed truck model. The outcome of this thesis is a fully autonomous system, able to plan and move in constrained environments, while avoiding unpredicted obstacles.

40|$|A scale-model {{hydrogen}} fuel-cell truck {{has been}} designed and its performance tested to gain an improved understanding of the technical challenges of full- <b>scale</b> <b>trucks</b> employing on-board storage and hydrogen fuel-cell systems. A 1 / 14 th scale battery-based replica of a Scania R 470 Highline truck was equipped with two 30 -W PEM fuel cell stacks and their control units, four metal-hydride hydrogen bottles storing in total 6 g hydrogen. A bank of super-capacitors was employed to smooth out the load placed on the fuel cells and meet the maximum demand of the truck. The hydrogen fuel cell system with the super-capacitor buffer was able to maintain stable operation and continuously supply the dynamic load of the truck over {{a full range of}} driving conditions, including during purging periods of the fuel cells. The fuel cell system was found to be more responsive to the changing load than the original batteries. The gravimetric energy density of the fuel cell system was measured to be about 30 % better than the original batteries of the truck...|$|R
