40|$|For {{the study}} of field wind erosion and the design and {{evaluation}} of wind erosion control techniques, detailed observations of soil particle transport and vertical destribution of eroded soil particles are needed. The objectives of this study were: 1) To describe one device for soil transport particle measurement, i. e. the BSNE sediment catcher; and 2) To assess vertical distribution of wind–eroded sediment with height in eastern Isfahan. The BSNE <b>sediment</b> <b>catcher</b> is a wind erosion sampler that traps eroded material at seven heights of 0. 24, 0. 60, 1. 08, 2. 00, 3. 00, and 4. 00 m above the soil surface. Each trap consists of a steel container with an inlet and outlet, mounted on a wind vane that rotates about a central pole. Before using the sampler in the field, it was tested and calibrated in the wind tunnel. The {{results showed that the}} average trapping efficiency with speeds ranging from 5. 2 to 7. 2 m sec- 1 for 4 different wind–eroded sediments was 0. 44 to 0. 68. However the trapping efficiency depended on wind speed, particle size distribution, particle density and type of sediment. The sampler had the lowest efficiency for particles &lt; 44 μm. A BSNE <b>sediment</b> <b>catcher</b> was installed in Babaii Air Base. After a sampling period, the sediment in each trap was collected and weighed. The trapped materials were a mixture of saltation and suspension particles. Vertical distribution of wind–eroded sediment showed that the amount of soil collected decreased with increased height and the percentage of fine particles (&lt; 63 μm) increased with height. The amount of trapped materials for each cm 2 frontal intake with increased height were 12. 00, 3. 42, 1. 44, 1. 56, 0. 75, 0. 21, and 0. 39 g cm- 2, respectively, for the one sampling period...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Wind can erode fertile topsoil {{and reduce}} soil {{fertility}}. Evaluating {{the effect of}} wind erosion on soil fertility is crucial to achieve sustainable agriculture in areas suffering from desertification caused by wind erosion. To estimate soil loss and associated soil nutrient loss by wind erosion, flux of coarse organic matter (COM) (defined here as free organic debris larger than 200 m) and soil particles (defined as the other soil components) must be measured separately. This is because their modes of transport are different, and COM plays {{a prominent role in}} soil nutrient dynamics in some semiarid zones where COM accounts for {{a large percentage of the}} total soil carbon. Because the Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) sampler can trap both COM and soil particles 0. 05 m above the surface, we designed a <b>sediment</b> <b>catcher,</b> the Aeolian Materials Sampler (AMS), to trap these components below 0. 05 m. This device can be manufactured easily at low cost. AMS performance was tested by wind tunnel experiments over a range of wind velocities typically observed in erosive storms and with six incident wind angles because the AMS is a buried‐type sampler that is unable to rotate toward the wind. The trapping efficiency of the AMS for COM and soil particles was not 100 %, but it can be calibrated easily using wind data. Therefore, we can estimate the mass flux of COM and soil particles and evaluate the effect of wind erosion on soil fertility using the AMS with the BSNE sampler...|$|E
40|$|The sediments of a core of. 1. 55 {{m length}} {{taken on the}} {{windward}} side of the Cross Bank, Florida Bay, are clearly subdivided into two portions, as shown by grain size analysis: silt-sized particles predominate in the relatively homogeneous lower {{two thirds of the}} core. This is succeeded abruptly by a thin layer of sand, containing fragments of Halimeda. They indicate a catastrophic event in the Florida Bay region, because Halimeda does not grow within Florida Bay. Above this layer, the amount of sand decreases at first and then continuously increases right to the present sediment-water-interface. The median and skewness increase simultaneously with the increase in the sand and granule portion. We assume that the changing grain size distribution was determined chiefly by the density of the marine flora: during the deposition of the lower two thirds of the core a dense grass cover acted as a <b>sediment</b> <b>catcher</b> for the fine-grained detritus washed out of the shallow basins of the Florida Bay, and simultaneously prohibited renewed reworking. Similar processes go on today on the surface of most mud banks of Florida Bay. The catastrophic event indicated by the sand layer probably changed the morphology of the bank {{to such an extent that}} the sampling point was shifted more to the windward side of the bank. This side is characterized by less dense plant growth. Therefore, less detritus could be caught and the material deposited could be reworked. The pronounced increase in skewness in the upper third of the core certainly indicates a strong washing out of the smaller-sized particles. The sediments are predominantly made up of carbonates, averagely 88. 14 percent. The average CaCO 3 -content is 83. 87 percent and the average MgCO 3 -content amounts to 4. 27 percent. The chief carbonate mineral is aragonite making up 60. 1 percent of the carbonate portion in the average, followed by high-magnesian calcite (33. 8 percent) and calcite (6. 1 percent). With increasing grain size the aragonite clearly increases at the cost of high-magnesian calcite in the upper third of the core. Chemically, this is shown by an increase of the CaCO 3 : MgCO 3 -ratio. This increase is mainly caused by the more common occurrence of aragonitic fragments of mollusks in the coarse grain fractions. The bulk of the carbonates is made up of mollusks, foraminifera, ostracods, and - to a much lesser extent - of corals, worm-tubes, coccolithophorids, and calcareous algae, as shown by microscopic investigations. The total amount of the carbonate in the sediments is biogenic detritus with the possible exception of a very small amount of aragonite needles in the clay and fine silt fraction. The individual carbonate components of the gravel and sand fraction can be relatively easy identified as members of a particular animal or plant group. This becomes very difficult in the silt and clay fraction. Brownish aggregates are very common in the coarse and medium silt fraction. It was not always possible to clarify their origin (biogenic detritus, faecal pellets or carbonate particles cemented by carbonates or organic slime, etc.). Organic matter (plant fragments, rootlets), quartz, opal (siliceous sponge needles), and feldspar also occur in the sediments, besides carbonates. The lowermost part of the core has an age of 1365 +/- 90 years, as shown by 14 C analysis...|$|E

40|$|Modified Wilson And Cook (MWAC) <b>sediment</b> <b>catchers</b> are {{commonly}} used for qantifying aeolian sediment transport in the saltation layer. The accuracy of aeolian mass flux and mass balance estimates using MWAC catchers has, however, not been reported in detail so far. By combining analytical error propagation equations and Monte Carlo simulations, this study proposes a random error propagation scheme which incorporates 6 sources of uncertainty: sediment mass, MWAC inlet diameter, vertical position of the catchers, trapping efficiency, horizontal spacing between catcher arrays and wind direction. The relative error on the measured unit mass transport is found to range between 2 ans 20 % {{with an average of}} 10 %. However, the relative uncertainty on the corrected cumulative unit sediment mass transport was found to be equal to 32 % on average, because of a high relative uncertainty on the trapping efficiency of 31 %. The relative uncertainty on plot-scale mass balances ranged between 32 and 80 %. Uncertainty on the trapping efficiency and on the measured unit mass transport contributed most to the mass balance uncertainty, but the uncertainty on wind direction sometimes also contributed substantially...|$|R
40|$|Wind Erosion Processes and Control Techniques in the Sahelian Zone of Niger G. Sterk, L. Stroosnijder, and P. A. C. Raats Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the main results and conclusions from three years of field research on wind erosion processes and control techniques in the Sahelian zone of Niger. Sediment transport was quantified with <b>sediment</b> <b>catchers,</b> and storm based maps of mass transport were made by applying geostatistics. The maps were used to calculate soil losses from the plot. In total, 45. 9 Mg ha- 1 were lost during four storms. Samples of trapped material were collected and analyzed on total element (TE) contents of K, C, N, and P. The losses of these elements during two storms were equal to approximately 3 % of the TE masses that were present in the top 0. 10 m of the soil. Wind erosion can be reduced by applying erosion control techniques. A survey in seven villages revealed that mulching with crop residues is the main control technique applied by farmers. Field tests with flat pearl millet stalks showed that small quantities of 1000 and 1500 kg ha- 1 can significantly reduce sediment transport during most storms. But, the availability of crop residues for mulching is limited due to other uses. Therefore, future research should concentrate on enhancement of biomass production for wind erosion control purposes...|$|R
40|$|Growth and {{yield of}} pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) in the West African Sahel are {{characterized}} by significant spatial variability at short distances (5 - 20 m). Several {{studies have suggested that}} this variability is caused by aeolian redistribution of relatively fertile topsoil material. The objectives of this study were (i) to quantify storm-based erosion/deposition patterns within a Sahelian millet field and (ii) {{to determine the effects of}} topography, erosion and deposition on millet growth and yield. An experiment was conducted at a research station in southwest Niger, on a sandy, siliceous, isohyperthermic Psammentic Paleustalf. Twenty-one <b>sediment</b> <b>catchers</b> were installed in a 40 m x 60 m plot within a pearl millet field. Four wind erosion events occurred during the 1993 growing season. Maps of wind-blown mass transport were created for each storm by applying a geostatistical space-time procedure. Maps showing the spatial distribution in erosion and deposition were derived by differentiation of mass transport in the direction of the mean wind. For 21 sub-plots of 4 m x 5 m the elevation, wind-blown mass balance, millet growth and yield were quantified. A correlation analysis showed neither a significant relationship between millet yield and topography, nor between millet yield and erosion/deposition. It is concluded that only wind-blown sediment transport occurring within one growing season cannot explain the spatial variability in millet growth and yield. A new hypothesis is defined that suggests aeolian erosion/deposition patterns as observed in previous studies were not the cause but more likely the result of spatial variability in millet growth.

Wind erosion is potentially a serious soil degradation process that impacts long-term sustainability of local agricultural systems, but the {{conditions and the}} rates of wind erosion in this region have not been studied extensively. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify windblown mass transport on asandysoil in CentralPatagonia. Aeolianmassfluxes were measured in the valley of Sarmiento (Chubut province, Argentina) using two saltiphones and 24 Modified Wilson and Cooke (MWAC) <b>sediment</b> <b>catchers.</b> The latter were installed along three transects: (1) a control on a bare strip of land cleared of its natural vegetation, to measure the maximum wind erosion; (2) a similar transect protected by an artificial windbreak with an optical porosity of 50 %; and (3) a transect in a cherry orchard protected with the same type of windbreak. Nine windstorms were recorded throughout the experimental period. Storms with wind speed peaks of 20 m s- 1 caused a total soil loss of 248 Mg ha- 1 in the control strip and heavily depleted the soil of its erodible fraction. The artificial windbreak reduced the soil loss by 51. 0 % on average, while no erosion was recorded in the cherry orchard. Measured maximum mass transport values were used to fit five sediment transport equations in order to select the best equation to integrate into a GIS-based wind erosion prediction system. The Kawamura (1964) equation showed the highest model efficiency and was considered to be the best sediment transport equation for the Patagonia conditions. It expresses total mass transport as a function of two empirical constants: the threshold friction velocity (u*t), and an erodibility coefficient CKa. It is concluded that wind erosion in CentralPatagonia poses a serious risk of soil degradation once the natural vegetation is removed due to overgrazing or other anthropogenic activities...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that wind erosion seriously affects the {{sustainable}} use of land in {{a large part of}} the world, no validated wind erosion model that predicts windblown mass transport on a regional scale exists. Vegetation has the potential to decrease soil loss by wind erosion through the protection of the soil surface, through the reduction of wind speed and through the entrapment of saltating particles. Simulation of wind erosion process will differ at regional scale from field scale and as a result it will represent by different parameters. These parameters include vegetation cover, wind barriers, soil surface roughness and some other soil properties. The interaction of wind erosion with vegetation is the best example of a process that changes from plot to regional scale. The objective of this research was to make a starting point for a regional scale wind erosion model by establishing relations between the intensity of windblown mass transport and vegetation cover in a patchy landscape in Syria. Measurements on windblown mass transport were executed at 9 different land uses (and thus vegetation cover) in agricultural stabilization zones 4 and 5 in Khansser valley, Syria. At each plot 16 MWAC (Modified Wilson and Cooke) <b>sediment</b> <b>catchers</b> were installed and wind speed was recorded with five-minute intervals. The RWEQ (Revised Wind Erosion Equation) was translated into the dynamic modelling language of PCRaster and applied to determine the relations between vegetation density and pattern and intensity of mass transport. The results of this application showed that RWEQ in PCRaster (RiP) gave acceptable predictions for the uniform fields without incoming sediment sources. So, the predicted and observed results are in the same magnitude. However RiP needs more calibration to improve its prediction of the spatial variation of the windblown mass transport. With completing the calibration process, RiP will have the potential to form the basis of a regional scale wind erosion mode...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{wind erosion}} {{processes}} are well described in literature many vul- nerable wind erosion areas as the steppe (Badia) of Jordan {{have not been}} studied extensively. The International Center of Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) {{has an interest in}} estimating wind erosion for different agricultural plots in Jordan. A wind erosion research was car- ried out on a experimental Barley, Water harvesting and Natural grazing plot at Al-Majidyya, (45 km South-East from Amman) Jordan. A mea- surement campaign consisting of a wind tower with five cup anemometers, three Saltation Detectors, a wind vane and 30 Modified Wilson and Cook (MWAC) <b>sediment</b> <b>catchers</b> were established during summer (June-Sept) 2011. No wind erosion storms were recorded by the anemometers (Max wind velocity = 7. 37 m/s) and no saltation was recorded by the Saltation Detectors. The sediment of the MWAC catchers were insufficient for data analysis. The cover and roughness characteristics of the three experimental plots were different, whereby the Water harvesting plot had a higher aero- dynamic roughness (Z 0 ≈ 17 cm) compared to the other two plots (Z 0 ≈ 10 cm) due to the presence of vegetation lines consisting of ridges and shrubs planted in furrows. The ridges on the Barley plot were parallel with the predominant wind direction (West) and therefore no obstacle for the wind. Three datasets were obtained, besides wind and soil data of Al-Majidyya (UU dataset) also weather data from the past of the Al-Muwaqar and Queen Alia Airport (Amman) stations were provided. A detailed historical wind analysis in combination with wind velocity comparisons were made. Accord- ing to ICARDA and The National Center for Agricultural Research and Ex- tension (NCARE),the wind erosion storm season was from June-September, however the historical wind analysis showed a potential wind erosion season from October-March. The Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) model was used to estimate mass transport and soil losses for each experimental plot. Four periods of the translated Al-Muwaqar dataset were selected and used in the RWEQ Model. These selected periods were {{based on the number of}} potential wind erosion days whereby U 2 > Uthreshold. This resulted in four periods from January- March of the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. The Barley and Natural graz- ing plot showed the highest mass transport rates, Q(x) barley = 0 − 3. 0 (kg/m) and Q(x) Naturalgrazing = 0 − 1. 0 (kg/m) for the potential wind erosion pe- riod of ≈ 10 days in 2002. However the Jan-March period of 2004 showed the highest average mass transport rate per 10 minute timestep, meaning that for a valid period of 5 days already a Q(x) barley = 0 − 1. 86 (kg/m) was obtained. The Barley plot was the most erodible plot followed by the Natu- ral grazing plot which was a third of the wind erosion quantities compared to the Barley plot due to lower erodible soil factors. However the Water harvesting plot showed almost no wind erosion due to the low Combined Crop factor caused by the vegetation lines. The wind erosion quantities of the Water harvesting plot were > 90 % reduced compared to the quantities of the Barley and Natural grazing plot...|$|R
40|$|Wind erosion is a {{critical}} environmental problem that threatens mainly the arid and semi-arid regions of our planet. Usually this problem is associated with desertification, poverty and other environmental and socioeconomic problems. Wind erosion causes the loss of fertile topsoil, and has {{a negative effect on}} agricultural production and on human health. When conditions favorable for wind erosion are present, the process can cause large scale environmental disasters like the Dust Bowl in the USA in the 1930 s. This event {{is considered one of the}} worst environmental disasters of the 20 th century, and was caused by a reduction in vegetation cover due to a change in land use combined with an increased dryness in the region. Wind erosion involves the detachment, transport and deposition of soil particles. Depending on their size, particles can move in three different types of transport: creep, saltation and suspension. Vegetation is one of the key factors in the protection of the soil against erosive winds. Although research on wind erosion has started a few decades ago there is still a big gap between the available knowledge provided by current measurement and modeling tools and the knowledge which is required by policy makers and land managers. This thesis focuses on improving the knowledge of the effects of vegetation cover and land use on regional scale wind erosion. The thesis covers improvement of wind erosion measurement techniques (Chapters 2, 3 and 5) and wind erosion modeling on the regional scale (Chapter 4 and 6). In Chapter 2, the efficiencies of the Vaseline Slide (VS) and Modified Wilson and Cooke (MWAC) catchers were determined with different sand particle sizes (< 50, < 75, 50 – 75, 200 – 400, and 400 – 500 μm) at a fixed wind speed (13. 3 m s– 1) and with different soil textures at different wind velocities (10. 3, 12. 3, and 14. 3 m s– 1). The study showed that whereas the VS trap is better for catching fine particles, the MWAC trap is better for trapping coarse particles. In the experiments with different soil textures, the efficiency of each catcher considerably changed with the with wind speed. This also varies importantly between catchers: for instance, for sand the MWAC efficiency was relatively high, whereas the efficiency of VS catcher was relatively low. Results concluded that the efficiency of each catcher varies critically with particle size, soil texture and wind speed. Equipment or measurement techniques for the observation of saltation at the regional scale does not exist although these are essential for improving the understanding of wind erosion problem at that scale. In Chapter 3, the portable plot method for measuring regional scale wind erosion with a specific focus on the saltation process was developed. With this strategy the number of measurement locations is increased with limited budget and time. The portable plot method was applied at agricultural stability zones 4 and 5 in the Khanasser Valley in Syria in 2009 and 2010. During the measurement period, a meteorological station was installed at each plot together with MWAC <b>sediment</b> <b>catchers.</b> Results showed that, with this method, information on the effect of wind regime on the aeolian mass transport for different land uses in the region can be obtained. Also, insights into the interrelation between neighboring land units can be gained and the data for scaling-up a field scale model to the regional scale are obtainable. We concluded that this method provides insight into the wind erosion at regional scale and data collected through it are important for progressing the modeling of wind erosion at a regional scale. The new measurement method enabled the calibration and validation of the field scale model of RWEQ (Revised Wind Erosion Equation) at several land use areas in the Khanasser valley in Syria (Chapter 4). In this chapter, the RWEQ model was modified to estimate mass flux and soil loss at a field scale for different types of land use. We implemented this modified version of RWEQ that represents wind erosion as a transient process, using time steps of 6 hours. Beside this, a number of adaptations including the estimation of mass flux over the field boundaries and the routing of sediment have been added. The results showed that this modified version of RWEQ provided acceptable predictions for the average mass flux from our measurement plots compared with the results of previous tests of the model. While the portable plot method provided insights on the effect of land use and climate on the quantity and intensity of wind erosion in a region, more knowledge was required on the border effect between different land uses as the portable plot method provided only limited knowledge on the effect of vegetation pattern and border effect. To get sufficient knowledge on this subject a simulation of sediment transport in a regional scale environment was designed and tested in wind-tunnel experiments (Chapter 5). This simulation showed the effect of vegetation pattern on sediment transport within a land unit and at the border between land units. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted with artificial shrubs representing Atriplex halimus, a native shrub in Khanassar valley. In the experiments, a wind speed of 11 m s- 1 was applied and after each 200 - 230 second wind run the sediment redistribution was measured using a graph paper. Results showed that: 1) the transport within a land unit is affected by the vegetation density and pattern for the land unit itself and for the neighboring units; 2) plans for re-vegetation of degraded land need to take into account the ‘streets’ effect; 3) the effect of neighboring land units includes a sheltering effect and the regulation of sediment passing from one land unit to the neighboring land units and 4) revegetation projects in regions vulnerable to wind erosion not only need to investigate the effect of vegetation pattern on erosion and deposition within the region in general, but also should consider the redistribution of sediment at smaller scales. In Chapter 6, The Regional Scale Wind Erosion Equation (RS-WEQ) was developed. This model takes the different land uses in a region into account, considers the interrelation between neighboring land units and considers saltation as the main transport mode. Although the RWEQ was the starting point for the development of RS-WEQ, the new model is not restricted in its application to a single field. RS-WEQ predicts mass flux, soil loss and deposition for all land uses in a region. The model considers the erodibility parameters for each land use independently and takes the effect of the borders into account. Its output provides a clear insight on wind erosion processes at the regional scale. RS-WEQ was run using scenarios that represent main land uses in dry regions in general and in Khanasser valley specifically. The model outputs showed that the wind speed, field length and land use patterns affect the quantity and severity of mass flux, soil loss and deposition in a region. Specifically, the results showed that the mean mass flux and its related abrasion risk increased with the increase in wind speed and field length. The model provides further details on the effect of field length and land use patterns on the severity of soil loss and deposition at the regional scale. Therefore the developed model can be considered as a useful tool for land managers and policy makers in regions that are vulnerable to wind erosion. This thesis showed that for comprehensive understanding of the aeolian sediment transport at regional scale a combination of measuring and modeling of wind-blown sediment transport is required. And the intensively calibrated and validated wind erosion models can be used in the framework of wind erosion mitigation...|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the efficiency of sediment samplers designed to measure the deposition of aeolian dust. Efficiency was ascertained relative to a water surface, which was considered the best alternative for simulating a perfectly absorbent surface. Two types of samplers were studied: the Marble Dust Collector (MDCO) and the inverted frisbee sampler. Four versions of the latter catcher were tested: an empty frisbee, an empty frisbee surrounded by an aerodynamic flow deflector ring, a frisbee filled with glass marbles, and a frisbee filled with glass marbles and surrounded by a flow deflector ring. Efficiency was ascertained for five wind velocities (range: 1 - 5 m s(- 1)) and eight grain size classes (range: 10 - 89 mu m). The efficiency of dust deposition catchers diminishes rapidly as the wind speed increases. It also diminishes as the particles caught become coarser. Adding a flow deflector ring to a catcher substantially improves the catcher's efficiency, by up to 100 % in some cases. The addition of glass marbles to a catcher, on the other hand, {{does not seem to}} increase the efficiency, at least not at wind velocities inferior to the deflation threshold. For higher velocities the marbles protect the settled particles from resuspension, keeping them in the catcher. The following five parameters determine the accumulation of aeolian dust in a catcher: the horizontal dust flux, the weight of the particles, atmospheric turbulence, resuspension, and the dust shadow effect created by the catcher. The final accumulation flux depends on the combination of these parameters. The catchers tested in this study belong to the best catchers currently in use in earth science and {{have been the subject of}} various aerodynamic studies to improve their efficiency. Nevertheless the catching efficiency remains low, in the order of 20 - 40 % for wind speeds above 2 in s(- 1). Other catchers suffer from the same low efficiencies. There is, thus, evidence to believe that dust deposition rates published in the aeolian literature and obtained by collecting the <b>sediment</b> in a <b>catcher</b> largely underestimate the true deposition. The errors are considerable, of the order of 100 % and more. A reconsideration of the literature data on aeolian dust deposition measured by catchers is, therefore, required. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The first {{scientific}} drilling {{expedition to}} the central Arctic Ocean was completed in late summer 2004. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302, Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX), recovered sediment cores deeper than 400 meters below seafloor (mbsf) in water depths of 1300 m {{at the top of}} the world, only 250 km from the North Pole. ACEX's destination was the Lomonosov Ridge, hypothesized to be a sliver of continental crust that broke away from the Eurasian plate at 56 Ma. As the ridge moved northward and subsided, marine sedimentation occurred and continued to the present, resulting in what was anticipated (from seismic data) to be a continuous paleoceanographic record. The elevation of the ridge above the surrounding abyssal plains (3 km) ensures that sediments atop the ridge are free of turbidites. The primary scientific objective of ACEX was to continuously recover this sediment record and to sample the underlying sedimentary bedrock by drilling and coring from a stationary drillship. The biggest challenge facing ACEX was maintaining the drillship's location while drilling and coring 2 – 4 m thick sea ice that moved at speeds approaching half a knot. Sea-ice cover over the Lomonosov Ridge moves with the Transpolar Drift and responds locally to wind, tides, and currents. Until now, the high Arctic Ocean Basin, known as "mare incognitum" within the scientific community, had never before been deeply cored because of these challenging sea-ice conditions. Initial offshore results, based on analysis of core <b>catcher</b> <b>sediments,</b> demonstrate that biogenic carbonate only occurs in the Holocene–Pleistocene interval. The upper 170 m represents a record of the past 15 m. y. composed of sediment with ice-rafted sediment and occasional small pebbles, suggesting that ice-covered conditions extended at least this far back in time. Details of the ice cover, timing, and characteristics (e. g., perennial vs. seasonal) await further study. Earlier in the record, spanning a major portion of the Oligocene to late Eocene, an interruption in continuous sedimentation occurred. This may represent a hiatus encompassing a time interval of nondeposition or an erosional episode that removed sediment of this age from the ridge. The sediment record during the middle Eocene is of dark, organic-rich siliceous composition. Isolated pebbles, interpreted as ice-rafted dropstones, are present down to 239 mbsf, well into the middle Eocene section. An interval recovered around the lower/middle Eocene boundary contains an abundance of Azolla spp., suggesting that a fresh/low salinity surface water setting dominated the region during this time period. Although predictions based on geophysical data had placed the base of the sediment column at 50 Ma, drilling revealed that the latest Paleocene to earliest Eocene boundary interval, well known as the early Eocene Thermal Maximum (EETM), was recovered. During the EETM, the Arctic Ocean was subtropical with warm surface ocean temperatures. ACEX penetrated into the underlying sedimentary bedrock, revealing a shallow-water depositional environment of Late Cretaceous age...|$|R
