40|$|Due {{to their}} {{central role in}} the {{regulation}} of apoptosis, the antiapoptotic BCL 2 -proteins are highly promising targets for the development of novel anticancer treatments. To this end, several strategies have been developed to inhibit BCL 2, BCL-XL, BCL-w, and MCL 1. While early clinical trials in haematological malignancies demonstrated exciting single-agent activity of BCL 2 -inhibitors, the response in <b>solid</b> <b>tumours</b> was limited, indicating that, in <b>solid</b> <b>tumours,</b> different strategies have to be developed in order to successfully treat patients with BCL 2 -inhibitors. In this review, the function of the different antiapoptotic BCL 2 -proteins and their role in <b>solid</b> <b>tumours</b> will be discussed. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of current small molecules targeting these antiapoptotic BCL 2 -proteins (e. g., ABT- 737, ABT- 263, ABT- 199, TW- 37, sabutoclax, obatoclax, and MIM 1) will be provided including a discussion of the results of any clinical trials. This analysis will summarise the potential of BCL 2 -inhibitors for the treatment of <b>solid</b> <b>tumours</b> and will unravel novel approaches to utilise these inhibitors in clinical applications.

40|$|Twenty {{cervical}} carcinomas {{were examined}} for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using 22 RFLP markers, which mapped to regions of putative oncosuppressor gene loci, identified as candidates in other common <b>solid</b> <b>tumours.</b> Allele losses {{were identified in}} six of the eight chromosomal arms examined, but at a significantly lower frequency than that reported in other common <b>solid</b> <b>tumours.</b> No association was observed between allele losses at any chromosomal location and the presence or integration of 'high risk' types of HPV determined by a sensitive, specific PCR method. HPV 16, 18 or 33 {{were found in the}} majority (75 %) of these tumours. We have looked at only a limited subset of chromosomal regions, but the results, so far, imply that carcinoma of the cervix may arise by different molecular events than other common <b>solid</b> <b>tumours,</b> and support the view that one of the distinctive events may be infection with HPV.

5000|$|Section {{sequencing}} {{can be done}} {{on multiple}} portions of a single <b>solid</b> <b>tumour,</b> and the variation in the mutation frequencies across the sections can be analyzed to infer the clonal structure.

The latter {{can be used to}} infer the frequency of clones in sections and provide insight on how a tumour evolves in space. To infer the clones genotypes and phylogenetic trees that model a tumour evolution in time, several computational methods were developed including Clomial, cloneHD, PhyloWGS, PyClone, [...] Cloe, phyC, Canopy, TargetClone, ddClone , PASTRI, and GLClone.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{fruit extract}} of Gleditsia sinensis Lam. (GSE) is a {{traditional}} herbal medicine that is saponinrich.

Methods: The activity of GSE was demonstrated in four cancer cell lines (breast cancer MCF- 7, MDA-MB 231, hepatoblastoma HepG 2 and oesophageal squamous carcinoma cell line SLMT- 1) using MTT assay, anchorage-independent clonogenicity assay, DNA laddering and in situ cell death detection. Results: The mean MTT 50 (the mean concentration of GSE to reduce MTT activity by 50 %) ranged from 16 to 20 £gg/ml of GSE. An anchorage-independent clonogenicity assay showed {{that all of the}} four <b>solid</b> <b>tumour</b> cell lines gradually lost their regeneration potential after treatment with GSE, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL analysis demonstrated that the action of GSE is both dose- and time course-dependent.
