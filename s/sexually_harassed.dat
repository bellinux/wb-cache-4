40|$|Some discursive {{incidents}} can {{be interpreted}} as either humorous or <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing.</b> Previous research has acknowledged <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing</b> situations to be ambiguous in nature, leading to questions of intent and outcome (Cohen 2 ̆ 6 Gutek, 1985; Keyton 2 ̆ 6 Menzie, 2007). Humorous incidents have also been acknowledged to be uncertain in nature (Bippus, 2003; Graham, Papa 2 ̆ 6 Brooks, 1992), in similar capacities as potentially <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing</b> messages. Each adds another layer of complication to an interaction. This study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to understand both generalized and individual approaches to and interpretations of <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing</b> or humorous situations. Implications for both research and practice are discussed. ...|$|R

A quasi-experimental panel design was used to assess change over an interval of six months. An instrument, the <b>Sexually</b> <b>Harassing</b> Behaviors Bystander Intervention Inventory (SHBBII), was developed to measure self-reported intervention response to different <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing</b> behaviors. College student peer <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing</b> behaviors were categorized as gender harassing, taunting or intrusive <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing</b> behaviors. Statistically significant differences were found between control and workshop students 2 ̆ 7 post-test interventions on Gender Intervention, Intrusive Intervention and Total Intervention scores. Students intervened more as observers among other witnesses than when they were sole witnesses. A causal model was constructed from a blocked hierarchical regression analysis for each of the <b>sexually</b> <b>harassing</b> behavior dimensions and for Total Interventions, using five student characteristics (student gender, academic class, racial/ethnic identity, resident assistant status and other sexual harassment training experience), pre-test scores and treatment condition. Implications for program assessment, educational policy, future legal directions and future research are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [57]- 64) The {{present study}} compared {{the effectiveness of}} a video program designed to reduce males’ likelihood to <b>sexually</b> <b>harass</b> to an educational video on sexual harassment and a control video. The treatment video was designed to educate males about sexual harassment, increase victim empathy, decrease sexual harassment myths, and increase the perceived cost of sexual harassment to the perpetrator. Results from the present study provided some support for the effectiveness of the treatment video in reducing males’ likelihood to <b>sexually</b> <b>harass.</b> The treatment video reduced participants’ scores on the Likelihood to <b>Sexually</b> <b>Harass</b> Scale (Pryor, 1987) and the Sexual Harassment Belief Inventory (Doolin, 1997). The reduction in participants’ scores on the Likelihood to <b>Sexually</b> <b>Harass</b> Scale at posttest and after a one-week follow-up support the use of the treatment video to help reduce the likelihood of males to <b>sexually</b> <b>harass,</b> as well as reduce males’ beliefs in sexual harassment myths.

As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has told her husband that he <b>sexually</b> <b>harassed</b> her.

5|$|The 0–14 {{record was}} {{matched by the}} 1980 New Orleans Saints, who won their {{penultimate}} game to end the season 1–15. The 1981 Baltimore Colts then won their opener and closer, but lost every game in between to equal the Buccaneers’ and Saints’ 14-game single-season losing streak. The 1982 Colts were winless in a strike-shortened season, but did get a tie in one game. The 1990 New England Patriots had a 1–1 record when several of the players <b>sexually</b> <b>harassed</b> a female reporter. The fallout from the scandal contributed to the team finishing 0–14 in its remaining games. The 2013 Houston Texans also managed to match the Buccaneers' single-season losing streak after starting 2–0. Most recently, the 2016 Cleveland Browns lost their first 14 games (including an 0–4 preseason) to match the Buccaneers' single season streak, but managed to avoid becoming the NFL's second 0–16 team by winning their penultimate game against the San Diego Chargers.|$|E
