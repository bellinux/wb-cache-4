This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a long}} history of {{interaction}} with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, <b>stupid,</b> <b>and</b> foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as <b>stupid</b> <b>and</b> patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

Mascarenhas also stated that he tweeted this after a night out and his actions were <b>stupid</b> <b>and</b> irresponsible and that he regretted any offence it may have caused and that his tweet didn't reflect his true views on Miller.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{conditions}} supposed, {{there is no}} doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces.

The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.|$|E

25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations {{of life as a}} black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were <b>stupid</b> <b>and</b> could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales like Home to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} the official university lectures, but complained that most were <b>stupid</b> <b>and</b> boring, {{and found himself}} too sensitive {{to the sight of}} blood. He was disgusted by the dull and outdated anatomy lectures of professor Alexander Monro tertius, and later regretted his failure to persevere and learn dissection. Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to George Combe's daringly materialist ideas of phrenology. As the exception to the general dullness, the spectacular chemistry lectures of Thomas Charles Hope were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend surgical operations twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before anaesthetics. He was long haunted by the memory, particularly of an operation on a child.|$|E
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} <b>stupid</b> <b>and</b> is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
