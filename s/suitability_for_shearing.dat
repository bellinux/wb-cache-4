40|$|Different test {{techniques}} <b>for</b> <b>shear</b> characterization are reassessed <b>for</b> their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> {{woven fabric}} composites. Considering {{the accuracy of}} results, ease of specimen fabrication, and simplicity of test technique, (+/- 45) degree off-axis tension test is recommended <b>for</b> <b>shear</b> characterization of woven fabric composites. Calculations show that for typical E-glass/epoxy LY 556 and T- 300 carbon/epoxy LY 556 two-dimensional orthogonal plain weave fabric laminates, the percentage shear contribution at failure is about 99 and 97 - 98, respectively. Hence, this test technique leads to a near pure shear condition in the test section for WF laminates...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to reveal the shifts in climate <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine {{production}} affecting Romanian wine growing regions. For this, we analyzed the spatial distribution over Romanian territory of the oenoclimate aptitude index (IAOe) for the 1961 to 1990 and 1991 to 2013 time periods. The IAOe has been calculated based on gridded data at 10 × 10 [*]km resolution of average daily temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration between 1961 – 2013, originating from about 150 weather stations across Romanian territory and recorded in the ROCADA database. The study reveals: northward shifts and to higher altitudes of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine production; the appearance of new areas suitable for wine production; the expansion or the shrinkage of the current areas suitable for wine production; shifts in classes of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine production in the current wine regions and appearance of premises of replacing their specific varieties and traditional wine type production; the tendency to level climate suitability at regional scale by diminishing <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> white wines and replacing it with climate <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> red wines. The study provides a solid support for developing strategies to adapt Romanian viticulture to climate change...|$|R
