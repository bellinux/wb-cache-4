50|$|Sectional: the {{structure}} is divided into usually two <b>sections</b> with <b>insulators</b> between, usually center-fed. This collinear arrangement enhances low-angle (ground wave) radiation and reduces high-angle (sky wave) radiation. This increases {{the distance to the}} mush zone where the ground wave and sky wave are at similar strength at night. This type of antenna is known as an anti-fading aerial. Practical sectionals with 120 over 120 degrees, 180 over 120 degrees and 180 over 180 degrees are presently in operation with good results.|$|R
5000|$|The {{potential}} gradient (electric field) across an insulator is not uniform, but is highest {{at the end}} next to the high voltage electrode. If subjected to a high enough voltage, the insulator will break down and become conductive at that end first. Once a <b>section</b> of <b>insulator</b> at the end has electrically broken down and become conductive, the full voltage is applied across the remaining length, so the breakdown will quickly progress from the high voltage end to the other, and a flashover arc will start. Therefore, insulators can stand significantly higher voltages if the {{potential gradient}} at the high voltage end is reduced.|$|R

One slab {{is located on the}} upslope margin of the terrace and close by, to the west, an Ironwood [...] "telephone pole" [...] tree with squared timber cross <b>section</b> and <b>insulators.</b> To the east of this cement pad a single strand of fence wire is strung from the ground and affixed high onto an adjacent Ironwood tree with wire netting attached to the lower part close to the ground (possibly a base for hessian camouflage netting). A number of possible walking pads zig-zag indeterminately upslope from this cement pad. The cement pad presents evidence of division into a roomed structure (with bolts protruding from the cement).|$|R

40|$|Advanced RTG {{concepts}} utilizing improved thermoelectric {{materials and}} converter concepts are under study at Fairchild for DOE. The design described here {{is based on}} DOE's newly developed radioisotope heat source, and on an improved silicon-germanium material and a multicouple converter module under development at Syncal. Fairchild's assignment was to combine the above into an attractive power system for use in space, and to assess the specific power and other attributes of that design. The resultant design is highly modular, consisting of standard RTG slices, each producing ~ 24 watts at the desired output voltage of 28 volt. Thus, the design could be adapted to various space missions {{over a wide range}} of power levels, with little or no redesign. Each RTG slice consists of a 250 -watt heat source module, eight multicouple thermoelectric modules, and standard <b>sections</b> of <b>insulator,</b> housing, radiator fins, and electrical circuit. The design makes it possible to check each thermoelectric module for electrical performance, thermal contact, leaktightness, and performance stability, after the generator is fully assembled; and to replace any deficient modules without disassembling the generator or perturbing the others. The RTG end sections provide the spring-loaded supports required to hold the free-standing heat source stack together during launch vibration. Details analysis indicates that the design offers a substantial improvement in specific power over the present generator of RTGs, using the same heat source modules. There are three copies in the file...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} metal stripe {{waveguide}} based sensor that functions like a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. It {{consists of three}} sections. The first and third sections are input and output metal stripe waveguides that support a long-range surface plasmon polariton (LRSPP). The second section is a sensing region; it comprises a substrate, which is common to {{the first and third}} <b>sections,</b> an <b>insulator</b> layer with a refractive index larger than 2 (e. g., TiO 2), and an Au layer much thicker than the skin depth of gold. For sensing, it is covered by an aqueous solution with a refractive index of about 1. 3. Because of the thick Au layer, separate single-interface surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagate along the top and bottom surfaces of the Au layer. Since the top and bottom SPPs rather than an LRSPP are used in the second section, it is not constrained by the condition of supporting an LRSPP, which is that the substrate should have almost the same refractive index as the solution. The top and bottom SPPs play the roles of sensing and reference arms of an interferometer, respectively. In this paper, the sensor is designed, and its bulk-sensing and surface-sensing characteristics are theoretically analyzed. The design results in the compact sensor whose sensing region is similar to 35 mu m long; the analysis demonstrates that the sensor has sensitivity higher than or comparable to that of previous plasmonic sensors. close 2...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{gives an}} {{introduction}} to the physics of interacting quantum systems, both bosonic and fermionic. Section 1. 2 introduces the physics of quantum particles in periodic lattices. Section 1. 3 examines, for the case of bosons, how the combined effects of lattice and interaction can turn the system into an insulator, the so-called Mott insulator, and discusses the corresponding physics. Section 1. 4 discusses what happens when the system is one-dimensional. Section 1. 5 moves on to the case of fermions. It discusses first Fermi-liquid theory and the concept of quasi-particles, Landauâ€™s description of the low-energy excitations of interacting fermion systems. Section 1. 6 shows how, like the method for bosons, the combination of a lattice and strong interactions can turn a Fermi liquid into a Mott <b>insulator.</b> <b>Section</b> 1. 7 looks at the properties of one-dimensional fermions, shows how Fermi liquid theory fails because low-energy excitations are now collective modes instead of quasi-particles, and examines the corresponding physics for both the conducting and insulating phases. Finally, Section 1. 8 draws some conclusions and give some perspectives...|$|R
40|$|The design {{principles}} and prototype manufacture of 11 kV silicone-rubber composite textured insulators are described. The moulded surface texture increases the maximum creepage length from 375 mm to 503 mm for the four-shed profile used. The trunk <b>sections</b> of the <b>insulator</b> are patterned with a square-section array of hemispherical protuberances, and the shed undersides with interlaced logarithmic spirals of hemispherical ridges. Both textures are sufficiently shallow to facilitate fabrication, to allow effective washing {{and to avoid}} an increased salt deposit density (SDD) in artificial pollution tests. The test procedures which were developed in Part 1 of the paper are applied here to the textured prototypes. These procedures had been shown to quantify reliably the performance of conventional non-textured insulators of the same profile: the variation of flashover voltage and leakage current due to the silicone-rubber formulation, SDD and wetting rate could be measured. For textured insulators, {{it is found that}} the increased creepage distance improves the flashover voltage by up to 27 %, with a corresponding reduction of pre-flashover leakage current. Comparative tests for two silicone-rubber formulations of different hydrophobicity and pollution performance were performed. Although very severe pollution causes a large reduction in flashover voltage, surface texturing mitigates this reduction effectively. This is particularly relevant to recent concerns expressed in IEC-TS 60815 - 3 (2008) relating to the selection and dimensioning of high-voltage a. c. polymeric insulators for use in heavily polluted conditions...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic (EM) railguns {{have yet}} to be fielded due to several {{technical}} issues that need to be worked out in the near future. One of the problems is the high electromagnetic repulsive force that pushes the rails apart and causes the armature to lose contact with them. In laboratory guns, rail deflections can be minimized by building a massive containment structure. For tactical launchers, however, {{there is a need to}} keep the containment structure as light as possible, and therefore laboratory type approaches cannot be used. This paper will look at two proposed designs for use as tactical launchers. The first design has an oval shaped cross <b>section</b> with thick <b>insulators</b> and has been studied many times in the past. The second design utilizes geometric considerations and high modulus composite fibers. In this approach, the sides of the containment are kept as flat as possible so that the fibers are highly loaded in tension as the rails attempt to separate. By using ultra high modulus fibers, a thin and light weight structure can be fabricated. This paper will describe these two approaches by analyzing their best and worst case scenarios. The best case is perfect bonding between all the parts. In that case, both the insulator and the wrap contribute to holding the rail in place. The worst case is with theoretically frictionless surfaces, where the insulator does essentially nothing in minimizing the rail deflection. By comparing the best and worst case for each of these designs, a better understanding of how to minimize rail deflections using geometric considerations can be achieved...|$|R
