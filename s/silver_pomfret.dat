40|$|Pampus argenteus is an {{economically}} important fish {{that is often}} erroneously identified as Pampus echinogaster. No population genetic analyses have been performed on the true P. argenteus species. Here, the mitochondrial control region (CR) {{was used to evaluate}} the population genetics and elaborate the historical demography of the <b>Silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> collected from six geographical locations in China, Pakistan, and Kuwait. A high level of genetic diversity was demonstrated in this species. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the genetic divergence was mainly derived from within the populations (P &lt; 0. 05). A historical demographic analysis indicated that the <b>Silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> experienced a recent population expansion during the late Pleistocene. The phylogeographical structure revealed two obvious lineages that diverged in the late Pleistocene, during which the <b>Silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> populations historically experienced exotic divergence and mixed again with differentiated populations. Currently, <b>Silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> populations have insufficient time to attain migration-drift equilibrium.

40|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>pomfret,</b> Pampus argenteus is an {{economically}} important seafood species. The fishery resource of pomfret in Indian waters shows a dwindling catch {{since the last}} few years and the pomfrets caught were mostly undersized which calls for immediate attempts for management of resources. An accurate definition of population structure is important for management of this species. The genetic stock structure of P. argenteus distributed along Indian coast was identified using analysis of 842 bp of complete ATPase 6 / 8 genes of mitochondrial DNA. Altogether, 83 <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> (P. argenteus) collected from 4 locations along Indian coast (Gujarat, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal) were sequenced. Twenty four haplotypes were identified among 83 individuals with haplotype diversity (0. 87) and nucleotide diversity (0. 0025). The significant pair-wise FST and AMOVA values, between samples from West Bengal (east coast) and other locations along the west coast (Gujarat and Kerala) indicated the occurrence of distinct population structure in <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> along the coast...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{establishment}} of a fish ban, the <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> (Pampus argenteus) biomass in the Northern Persian Gulf is declining due to overfishing, and other environmental stressors. To address this problem, the distribution of <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> in Kuwait waters and its habitat preference was analyzed in a Geographical Information System (GIS), as a basis to design a marine protected area (MPA). The data analyzed comprised catch, maturity stage, temperature, salinity and bottom type, obtained through a series of trawling surveys from 2004 to 2005. Bottom type, temperature and salinity preferences were determined using statistical and spatial analytical methods, including chi square comparisons and fuzzy overlay. Spatial distribution of the specie according to maturity stages was identified through Hot Spot Analysis (HSA). <b>Silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> prefers muddy bottom habitats, temperatures ranging from 15 - 22 °C and moderate salinity 34 – 40 ppt. Mature and juvenile hotspots are located northeast of Boubyan Island, west of the Shatt al Arab River discharge area, while immature adults (maturity stages 1 – 4) clustered inside Kuwait Bay, where catch was greater. This study provides GIS and statistical based support for the presumed location of spawning and nursery grounds as well as the migratory patterns of this species. Additionally, the present work confirms the roll of Kuwait Bay as foraging grounds for <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret.</b> The proposed MPA was identified where mature and juvenile hotspots were located coinciding with areas of moderate temperature and salinity, as well as the region between them, which constitute as marine ecological corridor...|$|E

Mean body weight gain and specific growth rates of fish fed 16 % and 20 % lipid diets {{were significantly higher than}} that of 12 % lipid diets. Daily feed intake was not affected by the dietary lipid levels, but there were significant differences in feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, apparent net protein utilization, energy and lipid retention values. Proximate analysis indicated that the lipid and fatty acid composition of whole body were affected by diets. Whole body of fish fed 16 and 20 % lipid diets showed significantly (p< 0. 05) higher values for protein and lipid than fish fed 12 % lipid diet. Higher Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Decosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) were accumulated in fish body fed 16 and 20 % lipid diets.

30|$|Streptococcosis, a {{bacterial}} disease, {{is one of}} the most significant diseases of tilapia worldwide. The causative agents of the disease have been attributed to multiple bacterial agents but most commonly Streptococcus and/or Lactococcus (Kang et al. 2004; Plumb and Hanson 2011). Streptococcosis is a common disease affecting various species of fish worldwide (Roberts 2012) including the Asian seabass (Suanyuk et al. 2010), barramundi (Bromage et al. 1999), grouper (Bowater et al. 2012), Japanese flounder (Nguyen et al. 2002), rabbit fish (Yuasa et al. 1999), rainbow trout (Eldar and Ghittino 1999), red drum (Eldar et al. 1999; Shen et al. 2005), red tilapia (Hernandez et al. 2009; Musa et al. 2009), seabream (Evans et al. 2002), <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> (Duremdez et al. 2004), and wild mullet (Evans et al. 2002). An annual global loss of about 250 million USD has been attributed to streptococcosis (Amal and Zamri-Saad 2011). The clinical signs of streptococcosis or lactococcosis include unilateral or bilateral exophthalmia, erratic swimming, pale gills, opaque cornea, external haemorrhages, enlarged spleen, ascites in abdominal cavities, and discolored liver (Suanyuk et al. 2005; Salati 2011).|$|E
30|$|Compared {{with that}} in the control group, the SOD {{activities}} in all trial groups increased after 6  h of exposure, suggesting that increased salinity can stimulate SOD activity within a short period.

As shown in Fig.  3, SOD activity returned near the initial level in the salinity 2.5  ‰ group, whereas those in the salinity 5 and 7.5  ‰ groups reduced significantly by 50 and 65  %, respectively. The study on the juvenile <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> Pampus argenteus by Yin et al.

40|$|Three {{species of}} Opisthomonorcheides Parukhin, 1966 are {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from Indonesian waters: O. pampi (Wang, 1982) Liu, Peng, Gao, Fu, Wu, Lu, Gao & Xiao, 2010 and O. ovacutus (Mamaev, 1970) Machida, 2011 from Parastromateus niger (Bloch), and O. decapteri Parukhin, 1966 from Atule mate (Cuvier). Both O. pampi and O. ovacutus can now be considered widespread in the Indo-Pacific region, with earlier records of these species being from Fujian Province, China and Penang, Malaysia, respectively. We redescribe O. decapteri from one of its original hosts, Atule mate, off New Caledonia, and report this species from Jakarta Bay, Indonesia, extending its range throughout the Indian Ocean into the south-western Pacific. All three species possess a genital atrium that is long, sometimes very long, and a genital pore that is located in the forebody. This validates the interpretation that the original description was erroneous in reporting the genital pore in the hindbody, well posterior to the ventral sucker. These observations verify the synonymy of Retractomonorchis Madhavi, 1977 with Opisthomonorcheides. A major discrepancy between the species of Opisthomonorcheides is that some are described with the uterus entering the terminal organ laterally and some with it entering terminally; this feature needs further analysis. Based on the length of the genital atrium and the posterior extent of the vitellarium, the 27 species of Opisthomonorcheides considered valid can be divided into four groups. Among the 53 host records analysed, the families Carangidae (53 % of records), Stromateidae (17 %) and Serranidae (5. 7 %) are the most common; the reports are overwhelmingly from members of the Perciformes (91 %), with further records in the Clupeiformes (5. 7 %), Gadiformes (1. 9 %) and Pleuronectiformes (1. 9 %). Two fish genera (Parastromateus Bleeker and Pampus Bonaparte) dominate the recorded hosts, with the black pomfret Parastromateus niger harbouring six species, the <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> Pampus argenteus (Euphrasen) harbouring six, and the Chinese <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> P. chinensis (Euphrasen) two. A host-parasite checklist is presented. We discuss the host-specificity of members of the genus, questioning some records such as that of O. decapteri in a deep-sea macrourid. We also comment on the morphological similarity, but phylogenetic distance, between the various Pomfret species, advancing the possibility that a series of host misidentifications has occurred.

40|$|Food {{and feeding}} habits of {{fourteen}} demersal finfishes exploited off the Karnataka coast were studied to investigate trophic interactions within the marine food web. The demersal finfi shes {{selected for the}} present study are Epinephelus diacanthus (rockcod), Grammopli/es suppasitus (spotfin flathead), Priacan/hus hamrur (bulls eye), Johnieops sina (drab jew fish), O/oli/hes cuvieri (lesser tigertooth croaker), Nempilerus japanicus (threadfin bream), Nemipterus mesoprion (thread fin bream), Leiognathus bindlls (si lvcrbclly), CYlloglosslIS macros/om liS (tongue sole), PUII/PIIS argenteus (<b>silver</b> <b>pomfret),</b> Lactarill. v lactarill. r (bigjawed jumper), Pseudorhombus arsius (Iargetooth flounder), Carcharhinus Iimba/us (blacktip shark) and Rhync'loba/us djiddensis (guitar fish). • For understanding the importance of various diet components, the widely accepted diet index, the Index of Relative Importance (IRI), which integrates large data on three diet indices such as number, volume or weight and frequency of occurrence, was used to quantify diet components of each predator. Ontogenetic, seasonal (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon) variation in feeding and prey-predator relationship studies were conducted. Prey-spece fi c abundance plots (Amundson plot) and Electivity index were drawn to interpret each predators feeding strategy and prey se lectivity respectively. • The resu lts showed that the rockcod, E. diacanthus is a demersal carnivore and preferred to feed largely on benthic crustaceans. Crustaceans followed by fishes and molluscs were the most important food components of E. diacanti 1 l 1 s. Of all the stomachs analysed, 73...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the dietary intake of {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by Kuwaiti population, concentrations of PAHs were determined in edible tissues of commercially important seafood (fish and shrimp) samples collected from fish markets in 2005. Naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthrene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene and chrysene were routinely detected in all samples analyzed. The concentrations of [PAHs ranged between 30 and 247 ng/g dry wt. with yellowfin seabream imported from Iran exhibiting the highest concentration followed by Nile tilapia imported from Egypt (218 ng/g dry wt.) and then by locally caught <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret</b> (142 ng/g dry wt.) and Jinga shrimp (139 ng/g dry wt.). The PAHs pattern was dominated {{by the presence of}} high molecular weight compounds with pyrene as the most prevalent compound (59. 1 % of the total). The mean exposure for the average adult Kuwaiti consumer to [PAHs and benzo(a) pyrene equivalents (BaPEs) was estimated to be 1. 3 >g/day and 0. 0013 >g/day, respectively. The concentration and composition of PAHs found in this study are similar to those reported for fish from the Arabian Gulf basin in other studies over the past two decades, suggesting that the sources of pollution might have remained relatively unchanged. Nevertheless, the levels of exposure to PAHs through seafood consumption in the Northern Arabian Gulf environment, particularly in Kuwait, do not represent a...|$|E

Duplicate {{groups of}} fish (average weight 98. 20. 2 g) were fed for 8 weeks three iso-nitrogenous {{experimental}} diets (49 % protein) containing 12, 16 and 20 % crude lipids with corresponding P:E ratio of 23. 66, 22. 62 and 21. 60 for diets 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean body weight gain and specific {{growth rates of}} fish fed 16 % and 20 % lipid diets {{were significantly higher than}} that of 12 % lipid diets. Daily feed intake was not affected by the dietary lipid levels, but there were significant differences in feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, apparent net protein utilization, energy and lipid retention values. Proximate analysis indicated that the lipid and fatty acid composition of whole body were affected by diets. Whole body of fish fed 16 and 20 % lipid diets showed significantly (p< 0. 05) higher values for protein and lipid than fish fed 12 % lipid diet. Higher Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Decosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) were accumulated in fish body fed 16 and 20 % lipid diets. This study demonstrated that there is no difference between the requirement for dietary lipid between juvenile and the sub-adult silver pomfrets and a dietary lipid level of 16 % in a 49 % protein diet corresponding to a P:E ratio of 22. 6 is optimum for better growth, feed utilization and whole body composition of sub-adult <b>silver</b> <b>pomfret.</b> ]]...|$|E
