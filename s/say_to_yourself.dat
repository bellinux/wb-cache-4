2500|$|Trump paid $100,000 of Trump Foundation {{funds in}} 2012 to Reverend Franklin Graham's Billy Graham Evangelical Association. NBC News has called Graham [...] "an early ally" [...] of Trump. [...] "The more {{you listen to}} him, the more you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'You know, maybe the guy's right,'" [...] Graham had told ABC News in 2011. In October 2016 Graham {{revealed}} to the Charlotte Observer that, in 2012, he had instructed Trump to make the $100,000 donation and that the money was {{used to pay for}} full page ads urging voters to support candidates in the 2012 presidential election who supported [...] "biblical values". [...] The Observer has suggested the timing and tone of the ads indicate they were placed in support of Mitt Romney's campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{originally}} {{announced that}} he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on [...] "filmic storytelling". Because the story of the Passion is so well-known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: [...] "I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'That is the question.'" [...] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a [...] professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic. Gibson chose to use Latin instead of Greek, which was the lingua franca of that particular part of the Roman Empire at the time, since there is no source for the Koine Greek spoken in that region. The street Greek spoken in the ancient Levant region of Jesus' day is not the exact Greek language used in the Bible. Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{the way of}} business, as a {{composer}} only; and you must <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> [...] "Ethelberta, as thou art but woman, I dare; but as widow I fear thee."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] said Béla, with {{a return}} to his former swagger, [...] "that you have been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> this past half-hour: 'Oho! but Elsa is not married yet! The vows are not yet spoken, and until they are I still have my chance.' That's what you have been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> eh, Mr. Guardian Angel?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{would then}} say, [...] "I {{know exactly what}} you are <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> you’re wrong, I know what you’re saying. You wicked lot. You’re the sort of people that get me a bad name!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh yes! I can fancy you {{grinning}} over my letter--I {{can hear}} you <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> [...] "Where did he pick up his experience, I wonder?" [...] I have no experience--I only have something that serves me instead of it, and I don't know what. The Elder Brother, at Tadmor, used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it was sympathy. But he is a sentimentalist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly, Comrade Parker. There must be no secrets, no {{restraint}} between us. I {{would not}} have you go away and <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Did I make my meaning clear? Was I too elusive?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try mental suggestion," [...] {{the young}} man advised, looking lovingly at his glass. [...] "Put it where the cat can't get it and <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'This {{is going to do}} me good.' Cheerio!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuredly, Comrade Parker. There must be no secrets, no {{restraint}} between us. We {{would not}} have you go away and <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Did I make my meaning clear? Was I too elusive?' Say on." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must say}} this for Pierre, {{that when he}} starts out to {{convince}} you of a matter there is in his manner and his voice such winning qualities, that even though at the outset you were positive {{he was in the}} wrong, before many minutes had passed you were <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> that all his words were true, all his beliefs noble, and all that he would do exactly right.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{you reach}} the end of the passage, <b>say</b> back <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> what the point of the whole passage is - again, using your own words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] she replied, [...] "and I {{suppose you}} are <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Here {{is a girl}} who has known me less than three days, and yet she asks me {{to tell her about}} my feeling towards another woman.' But, really, {{it seems to me that}} as you have not known that other woman three days, as much {{friendship}} and confidence might spring up in the one case as affection in the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Confounded heavy things!" [...] {{you will}} <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself.</b> [...] "Thank {{goodness}} I've {{got rid of}} them. Let him have the fun of dragging them about these ghastly roads. See how he likes the job!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say nothing,--not a word more to me. But <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> that faint heart {{never won}} fair lady. Good-night, my dear boy, good-night. I dine out to-morrow, {{but you can}} call {{and let me know}} at about six." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go, my dear: I cannot {{stay away}} from your aunts. But I {{will tell you what}} to do to-night, and other nights when I shall be away: <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> the ninety-first Psalm. I think you know it--'Whoso abideth under the defence of the Most High--'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the only}} {{possible}} explanation. Think what this means, my boy. Think how you will feel every time your wife says she is going out {{to do a little}} shopping! Think of yourself, left alone at home, watching the clock, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Now she is lifting a pair of silk stockings!' 'Now she is hiding gloves in her umbrella!' 'Just about this moment she is getting away with a pearl necklace!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{knew you}} were <b>saying</b> that <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> lad, {{so there was no}} need for me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it," [...] {{returned}} his friend, with a side-glance and a twinkle of the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{understand}} {{what you mean by}} 'success,'" [...] said Mr. Knightley. [...] "Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring {{for the last four years}} to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and <b>saying</b> it again <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked into}} your room {{to see what}} was the matter. He {{discovered}} you with the candle in your hand, just leaving your bed-chamber. He heard you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> in a voice quite unlike your own voice, [...] "How do I know? The Indians may be hidden in the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} me hard and cruel? Wait a little, and time will change {{that way of}} thinking. As the years go on you will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Basely as he deceived me, there was some {{generosity}} in him. He was man enough to release me of his own free will.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my own sake!" [...] she {{repeated}} scornfully. [...] "Do {{you believe it}} yourself? Do {{you really think that}} it is true? I will tell you why it is! It is because you have no thought, no imagination. You <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> she is not of my world. I cannot marry her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> {{and then}} the place will seem less dreary, because you will feel Who is with you. I will look in once more before I go away, and I think you will be asleep." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Chiara {{realized}} that {{she was not going to}} get better, she started to plan for her [...] "wedding" [...] (her funeral) with her mother. She chose the music, songs, flowers, and the readings for Mass. She wanted to be buried in her [...] "wedding dress" [...] a white dress with a pink waist, because her death would allow her to become the bride of Christ. She told her mother, [...] "When you're getting me ready, Mum, you have <b>to</b> keep <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Chiara Luce is now seeing Jesus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you'll be <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> the moment my back is turned. You'll be {{calling me a}} stage heavy father and an old snob {{and a number of}} other things. Don't {{interrupt}} me, dammit! You will, I tell you! And you'll be wrong. I don't think the Marshmoretons are fenced off from the rest of the world by some sort of divinity. My sister does. Percy does. But Percy's an ass! If ever you find yourself thinking differently from my son Percy, on any subject, congratulate yourself. You'll be right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely, my dear Bernadine," [...] de Grost assented. [...] "You <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> no doubt, 'One of us two must go!' Being yourself, {{you would}} {{naturally}} conclude {{that it must}} be me. To tell you the truth, I have been expecting some sort of enterprise of this description for a considerable time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it wants}} resolution, Terence, and I {{am afraid that}} you are {{deficient}} in that. It must not be half-and-half. You have got to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'This is glorious; I never enjoyed myself so well in my life,' {{and when you have}} said that and feel that it is quite true, the whole thing will be over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Their faith puts faith into you. If {{they believe}} what you say, you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> {{that there must be}} some truth in it. If you keep telling them you're Jesus Christ, there's nothing to prove you ain't, and if you tell them you're God, who ever saw God, and who can deny it? You can't deny it yourself--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In London!" [...] with {{a little}} sigh. [...] "Fancy," [...] she went on, turning towards him, [...] "I {{have never been in}} London! Just <b>say</b> that <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> and imagine what it means. The biggest town I have ever seen is King's Lynn. Have you ever been to King's Lynn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"You are innocent, my own--that I know; but <b>say</b> it <b>to</b> me <b>yourself,</b> for my comfort, then I {{can bear}} {{whatever}} is {{in store for}} us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Har. Now, captain Towerson, {{you have}} had the {{privilege}} to be examined last; this on the score of my old friendship with you, though you have ill deserved it. But here you stand accused of no less crimes than robbery first, then murder, and last, treason: What can you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> clear <b>yourself?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you want}} to {{remember}} is to keep that guard up. Nothing can beat that. And push out your left straight. The straight left rules the boxing world. And be earnest about it. Be as friendly as you like afterwards, but while you're in the ring <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> 'Well, it's you or me', and don't be too kind." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{toothache}} cannot hurt us {{so long as}} the daemon {{within us}} (that is to say, our will power) holds on to the chair and says it can't. But, sooner or later, the daemon lets go, and then we howl. One sees the idea: in theory it is excellent. One makes believe. Your bank has suddenly stopped payment. You <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was {{one thing}} more that I had to ask of you, {{relating}} to a poor lost creature {{who is in the}} room with us at this moment. But, oh, I am so weary! Mr. Fennick will tell you what it is. <b>Say</b> <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> sometimes--perhaps when you have married some lady who is worthy of you--There was good as well as bad in poor Emma. Farewell.|$|E
6000|$|He laughed. [...] "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "if {{anyone in}} the world ever needed sleep to-night, it is you. I am going to send you up to lie down at once. You must promise me, promise faithfully, that you will {{remember}} what I have said, that you will <b>say</b> this <b>to</b> yourself: 'The reprieve will come!' It is the truth, mind. <b>Say</b> that <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> and sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better <b>say</b> that <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> old man," [...] replied Ringrope, stooping {{close to}} the light to thread his coarse needle, which trembled in his {{withered}} hands like the needle, in a compass of a Greenland ship near the Pole. [...] "You ain't long for the sarvice. I wish I could give you some o' the blood in my veins, old man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Lady Lydiard, [...] "now you are here, {{what have}} you got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for <b>yourself?</b> You have been abroad, of course! Where?" ...|$|R
