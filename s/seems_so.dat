5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

For example, Atlamál hin groenlenzku is claimed by its title {{to have been}} composed in Greenland, and <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> by some internal evidence. If so, it can be no earlier than about 985, since there were no Scandinavians in Greenland until that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{scale of}} {{destruction}} in these waves {{was such that}} the Ghent historian Marcus Van Vaenewijk (1516–69) recorded that {{in the summer of}} 1566 the burning pyres on which the works were thrown could be seen from 10 miles away. Because of this, art historian Susie Nash points out that the Ghent work <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> unusual in part because {{it was one of the}} few major examples to survive wholly intact.|$|E

25|$|The {{background}} {{and purpose of}} The Alphabet of Ben-Sira is unclear. It {{is a collection of}} stories about heroes of the Bible and Talmud, {{it may have been a}} collection of folk-tales, a refutation of Christian, Karaite, or other separatist movements; its content <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish satire, although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany.|$|E
25|$|Crick {{hoped he}} might aid {{progress}} in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists {{from the many}} different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He even collaborated with neurophilosophers such as Patricia Churchland. In 1983, {{as a result of}} their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of REM sleep is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process 'reverse learning' or 'unlearning'. In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with Christof Koch that lead to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990 to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> mysterious because it involves very short-term memory processes that are as yet poorly understood. Crick also published a book describing how neurobiology had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick's book The Astonishing Hypothesis made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences. Crick was skeptical about the value of computational models of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function.|$|E

500|$|Cannibal Holocaust premiered on 7 February 1980 in the Italian city of Milan. Although {{the courts}} later confiscated the film {{based on a}} citizen's complaint, the initial {{audience}} reaction was positive.

The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> real that I think you will get in trouble with all the world." [...] In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million; in Japan it grossed $21 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that time after E.T. the Extraterrestrial. Internationally, it grossed $200 million.|$|E
500|$|The parks {{employees}} eat several dinosaur-themed entrees, {{served by}} a depressed waiter (Evan O'Brien), they enjoy [...] "Tyranna-Ceasar Salads" [...] and [...] "Surf and Turfasaurus". Tom <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> cheery that Leslie begins to suspect he is faking being sad. Ron pulls Tom aside and asks whether he could ask Wendy on a date once the divorce is finalized. Tom consents, but is visibly disappointed. Determined to cheer him up, Leslie agrees to compromise her morals and take Tom to his favorite strip club, the Glitter Factory. Leslie is horrified by the club and tries to encourage the strippers to change their lives. Ron is also uninterested in the strippers, but happily consumes the free breakfast buffet.|$|E

500|$|Unlike his provocative written language, Wills {{spoke in}} a breezy and laconic manner. In one of his {{borderline}} [...] "thought disordered" [...] letters, {{it is evident that}} at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: [...] "I do not know what I am standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot {{for the life of me}} make out what they are talking about—everything <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> curious." [...] In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.|$|E
500|$|Some reviews {{were less}} favorable. David Ansen of Newsweek said, [...] "While one respects the filmmaker's small-is-beautiful philosophy, this story {{may indeed be}} too small for its britches.... Beresford's nice little movie <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> afraid to make a false move that it runs the danger of not moving at all." [...] Linda Beath of The Globe and Mail said Duvall's {{performance}} was [...] "fabulous," [...] but that the film was [...] "very slight" [...] compared to Beresford's Australian pictures. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: [...] "Tender Mercies fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't always know when they've got ahold of {{the wrong end of}} the story they want to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|PopMatters {{named it}} the best album of 2010 in its year-end list. MTV and Entertainment Weekly placed it at number eight on their lists of the 20 Best Albums of 2010.

Monáe is young and fearless enough to try anything, gifted enough to pull {{almost all of it}} off, and large-hearted enough to make it feel like a communal experience: Us rather than Me". The ArchAndroid was voted the fourth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010. Five songs from the album were included in the poll's singles list, including [...] "Tightrope" [...] (number two), [...] "Cold War" [...] (number 22), [...] "Wondaland", [...] "Locked Inside", and [...] "Sir Greendown" [...] (all tied for number 549).|$|E

500|$|Writer and {{academic}} Mike Gonzalez believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to [...] "timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music". Gonzalez {{asserts that the}} aura evoked did not represent [...] "the real Cuba" [...] before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to [...] "enjoy the fruits of this confusion". The American Historical Review suggested that the Buena Vista Social Clubs mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s–30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959—which [...] "no longer <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> bad".|$|E
500|$|Although largely well-liked, Mulan's {{characterization}} {{has drawn}} some mild criticism and speculation, inspiring {{a series of}} generally mixed to positive reviews from some film critics. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Far more than Beauty and the Beast or the stolidly virtuous Pocahontas, Mulan showcases a girl who gets to use her wits ...a testament {{to the power of}} mind over brawn." [...] However, Gleiberman continued, [...] "Mulan finally falls a notch short of Disney's best... because the heroine's empowerment remains... an emotionally isolated quest." [...] Similarly, Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times hailed Mulan as [...] "a strong, engaging character who, unlike many of her Disney counterparts, needs no one to rescue her from danger," [...] while questioning her personality, asking, [...] "was it really necessary to bestow Mulan with self-esteem problems? Because she <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> confident and intelligent, her sad statement that she wants to 'see something worthwhile' in the mirror comes as a bit of a shock." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
