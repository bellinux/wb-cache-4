50|$|The {{status of}} the current {{official}} investigation is unknown. However, this kind of incident is a well-known hazard with some types of NPK fertilizers, and {{is responsible for the}} loss of several cargo ships and chemical plants, (see examples in Ammonium nitrate disasters). Large stockpiles of the material can be a major fire risk due to their supporting oxidation, it may also detonate. Ammonium nitrate (AN), a common element in inorganic fertilizers like NPKs, exothermically decomposes into gases when heated to temperatures above 210 °C. The reaction can become self-sustaining (known as <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>decomposition,</b> or SSD), which is a thermal runaway (i.e. a fire event with a chemistry not based on oxygen consumption).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an account of}} a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>decomposition</b> event of the NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium) fertilizer freight aboard the ship Ostedijk. The fire developed inside the cargo hold for several days until it was controlled. Analysis of plume images shows a rapidly growing fire and {{provides an}} estimate of the evolution of the mass loss rate, ranging from approximately 0. 5 kg·s- 1 the first day to 12 kg·s- 1 on the last day. Small-scale experiments were conducted to gain an insight into this incident. A three step decomposition mechanism is observed leading to a self sustained reaction eaching 250 - 275 °C. The measured heat of reaction is 6. 1 MJ/kg, about one third of the value for flaming wood. Measurements are applied to the Ostedijk events and allow estimation of the maximum fire size to be in the order of 70 MW. Incidents of this nature challenge the traditional concept of fire, since <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>decomposition</b> events are thermal runaways involving exothermic reactions but not based on oxygen chemistry. However, application of fire engineering concepts and experiments allows the study of the processes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA complex {{multiple}} flame {{structure is}} formed during the combustion of AP/HTPB base bleed propellant. The AP monopropellant flame {{is concentrated in}} a thin zone above the burning surface of AP crystal to maintain <b>self-sustained</b> <b>decomposition.</b> Due to the low temperature near the burning surface, the diffusion between the decomposition products of AP and the pyrolysis products of HTPB occurs, and a partly pre-mixed diffusion flame structure-leading edge flame (LEF) is formed. The effects of pressure, chemical reaction rate and AP particle size on diffusion flame structure {{in the range from}} 20  atm to 100  atm are discussed. The Peclet number increases from 6. 64 at 20  atm to 21. 91 at 100  atm when AP particle size is 140  μm. The high temperature zone is blown away from the burning surface because the convective transport rate increases with the increase in Peclet number. The chemical reaction rate is enhanced and the diffusion mixing is inhibited as Damkohler number increases. The chemical heat release is more concentrated and the chemical reaction zone becomes narrow when Damkohler number changes from 330 at 20  atm to 4700 at 100  atm. When AP particle diameter is decreased to 60  μm, the diffusion time scale is reduced due to the reduced diffusion length scale. So the diffusion mixing is enhanced and a more pre-mixed flame is formed. The burning rate increases because the more pre-mixed heat release increases the heat feedback to the HTPB binder...|$|R

A final chapter summarizes the findings and conclusions and suggests further areas of research. Chapter 1 presents a study of <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>decomposition</b> of ammonium nitrate containing inorganic fertilizer. This is of importance to the shipping industry which transports these materials in large quantities. Upon exposure to a heat source, ammonium nitrate may undergo exothermic decomposition which can propagate through the material, posing safety and economic threats. This reaction does not involve oxygenbased chemistry, but has many similarities to the propagation of a smoulder front in a porous material. Small-scale experiments to investigate the <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>decomposition</b> (SSD) behaviour of NPK (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous) 16. 16. 16 fertilizer were undertaken. Experiments showed that this material will undergo <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>decomposition</b> and are used to formulate a reaction framework. Findings were applied to the events that occurred aboard the Ostedijk in 2007. Chapter 2 is a study of smoulder in polyurethane foam to study the relationship between sample size, critical heat flux and spread rate. Smouldering fires are the leading cause of residential fire deaths in developed countries and polyurethane foam is ubiquitous in the modern world. The critical heat flux for ignition was found to decrease with increasing sample size and the spread rate was found to be a function of the sample size, smoulder propagation depth and the applied heat flux. This {{is the first time that}} results on the effect of sample size on smouldering have been reported in the literature and these can be used to aid the extrapolation of small-scale flammability testing results to large scale scenarios. Chapter 3 presents an experimental investigation into the ignition of porous fuels by hot particles. This is related to the problem of spotting ember ignition in wildland fires which is a major, but poorly understood, spread mechanism. The process of spotting occurs in wildland fires when fire-lofted embers or hot particles land downwind, leading to ignition of new, discrete fires. The work studies the ignition of a fuel as a function of ember size and temperature. Metal particles are used as a proxy for burning embers and powdered cellulose to represent the forest fuel. Relationships between the size and temperature of the particle required for flaming and smouldering ignitions are found. These results are used to assess the ability of hot-spot ignition theory to determine the particle size–temperature relationship required for ignition of a cellulose fuel bed. Chapter 4 is an investigation into the suppression of smouldering coal. Subsurface coal fires are a significant global problem with fires in China alone estimated to consume up to 200 million tons of coal per year. As global demand for coal increases, accidental fires are a waste of a useful energy resource as well as a source of pollution and greenhouse gases. The results are the first attempt reported in the literature to study the suppression of these fires under controlled laboratory conditions. The ignition, spread and suppression of subsurface coal fires were studied using small-scale laboratory experiments. Time to ignition was seen to depend on particle size with small and large particles resulting in long times to ignition, while medium sized particles resulted in the shortest time to ignition. The maximum temperature, spread rate and mass lost were found to be independent of particle size above a critical particle size. The effectiveness of three systems for delivery of a suppression agent were assessed – direct injection, shower and spray. The effect of particle size on the water required for extinguishing using a spray was found to be weak. Chapter 5 presents an experimental investigation of the smouldering behaviour of peat. This is of particular interest in understanding the impact of smouldering fires on the earth system. The longer burn durations and different combustion dynamics of smouldering compared to flaming means that they have been shown to consume large amounts of biomass in, and contribute significantly to the emissions from, natural fires occurring in peatlands. The dynamics of smouldering peat in shallow, strong fronts was studied in the Fire Propagation Apparatus and a smoulder reaction framework with two burning regimes is presented. The first regime is peat smouldering and was found to be controlled by the applied heat flux and the second regime corresponded to char smouldering and was more sensitive to the flow of oxidizer. Chapter 6 complements Chapter 5 with an analysis of the CO and CO 2 emissions for smouldering and flaming peat. This data can be used with large-scale measurement techniques to improve emission estimates. The emissions are found to be dependent of the burning regime and the type of combustion with flaming resulting in higher fluxes of CO 2 and lower fluxes of CO compared to peat smouldering. Char smouldering resulted in the highest yields of CO and CO 2. The large majority of emissions (85 % of CO 2 and 97 % of CO) are released during the smoulder phase of the reaction. This highlights the differences in the chemical processes occurring under these two modes of combustion. Chapter 7 summarizes the research undertaken in this thesis and presents possible further work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
