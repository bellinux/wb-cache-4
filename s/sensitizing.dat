40|$|OBJECTIVE: Humoral {{immunity}} {{has been}} clearly implicated in solid organ transplantation, but {{little is known}} about the relationship between humoral immunity and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study was designed to investigate that relationship. METHODS: <b>Sensitized</b> serum was obtained from a <b>sensitized</b> murine model established by allogeneic splenocyte transfusion. <b>Sensitized</b> serum was incubated with allogeneic bone marrow cells (BMCs) in vitro and the cytotoxicity was evaluated by the complement-dependent cytotoxicity method. Mice were transplanted with allogeneic BMCs incubated with <b>sensitized</b> serum after lethal irradiation. The engraftment was assayed by hematopoietic recovery and chimera analysis. Moreover, mice received passive transfer of <b>sensitized</b> serum 1 day prior to transplantation. Mortality was scored daily after bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: The in vitro experiments showed that <b>sensitized</b> serum was capable of impairing allogeneic BMCs through the complement-dependent cytotoxicity pathway. The animal studies showed that BMCs incubated with <b>sensitized</b> serum failed to rescue mice from lethal irradiation. The engraftment assay showed that the allogeneic BMCs incubated with <b>sensitized</b> serum were rejected with time in the recipients. Furthermore, the mice died of marrow graft rejection by transfer of <b>sensitized</b> serum prior to transplantation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicated that <b>sensitized</b> serum played a critical role in graft rejection during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Late {{asthmatic}} {{response is}} observed following antigen challenge in actively, but not passively, <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Although cough reflex sensitivity is increased after antigen challenge in actively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs, {{it is unknown}} whether the antigen-induced increase in cough reflex sensitivity develops in passively <b>sensitized</b> animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin after an inhaled antigen challenge between actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Methods Measurement of number of coughs elicited by increasing concentrations of capsaicin (10 - 6 and 10 - 4 M) and bronchial responsiveness to ascending concentrations of methacholine, and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were separately performed 24 h after an antigen challenge in actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Results Percentage of eosinophils in BALF and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were increased 24 h after the antigen challenge in both actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> animals compared with saline-challenged actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> animals, respectively. Absolute number of eosinophils in BALF from actively <b>sensitized</b> and antigen-challenged guinea pigs was significantly greater than that from passively <b>sensitized</b> and antigen-challenged animals. Cough response to capsaicin and concentration of substance P in BALF were increased 24 h after the antigen challenge in actively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs, but not in passively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Bronchial responsiveness, cough reflex sensitivity and substance P concentration and total cells in BALF were increased in actively <b>sensitized</b> and saline challenged guinea pigs compared with passively <b>sensitized</b> and saline challenged animals. Conclusion The results suggest that active sensitization per se increases cough reflex sensitivity accompanied by increased inflammatory cells and substance P level in BALF, and antigen challenge further increases them, while simple IgE- and/or IgG-mediated allergic reaction per se or the low intensity of eosinophil infiltration in the airway itself may not affect cough reflex sensitivity in guinea pigs. </p...|$|R

500|$|Light {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths {{of light to}} an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. [...] When regular light is used immediately following {{the application of a}} <b>sensitizing</b> substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapies. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment {{is often referred to as}} laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers, with examples being postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. [...] As of 2012, evidence for various light therapies was insufficient to recommend them for routine use. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. [...] Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and for outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E
