He stated: [...] "Usually, people who have no. 1 hits, even if they give it to you, want hundreds of thousands of dollars, in my experience. But Rihanna gave it to us for a really good price. That's been one of the cool and surprising things about this experience, that these people that the cast and we really admire and respect have found out about the show and are supportive." ...|$|E

The song is well {{received by the}} student body, however complaints from parents lead Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) to compile a list of pre-approved, sanitary songs which New Directions must choose from in future. Will is angry with Rachel for her actions, and when Quinn and fellow cheerleaders Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) audition for the club with a tongue-in-cheek rendition of [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer", he gives Rachel's solo on [...] "Don't Stop Believin' to Quinn.

500|$|Several songs {{performed}} by Agron as Quinn {{have been released}} as singles, available for digital download, also featured on the show's soundtrack albums. Agron made her musical debut {{at the end of}} the episode [...] "Showmance" [...] where she performed Dionne Warwick's [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer". Quinn's next solo was in the episode [...] "Throwdown", where she performed The Supremes' [...] "You Keep Me Hangin' On". The song was released on [...] Flandez deemed the cover of [...] "Keep Holding On", the ensemble performance on the episode, an [...] "emotionally satisfying showstopper", however was critical of Quinn's cover of [...] "You Keep Me Hangin' On", which he called [...] "thin and jarring". Aly Semigran of MTV observed that Quinn spontaneously bursting into song brought Glee [...] "dangerously close to High School Musical territory". Agron later performed a solo in the episode [...] "Hairography" [...] singing Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] after her father learns she is pregnant. This performance by Agron was released as a single. She performed a rendition of James Brown's [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" [...] in the episode [...] "Funk".

500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later {{that same}} year, Warwick earned her first RIAA Certified Gold single for U.S. sales of {{over one million}} units for the single [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer" [...] (from her album The Windows of the World). When disc jockeys across the nation began to play the track from the album {{in the fall of}} 1967 and demanded its release as a single, Florence Greenberg, President of Scepter Records, {{complied}} and [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer" [...] became Warwick's biggest U.S. hit to that point, reaching #4 on the U.S. and Canadian Charts and # 8 on the R & B Charts. The tune was also the first RIAA certified USA million seller for Bacharach-David. Aretha Franklin would record the song a year later; her version reached #10 on the U.S. charts.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{follow-up}} to [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer," [...] "(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls," [...] was unusual in several respects. It was not written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, {{it was the}} [...] "B" [...] side of her [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer" [...] single, {{and it was a}} song that she almost didn't record. While the film version of Valley of the Dolls was being made, actress Barbara Parkins suggested that Warwick be considered to sing the film's theme song, written by songwriting team André and Dory Previn. The song was to be recorded by Judy Garland, who was subsequently fired from the film. Warwick performed the song, and when the film became a success in the early weeks of 1968, disc jockeys flipped the single and made the single one of the biggest double-sided hits of the rock era and another million seller. At the time, RIAA rules allowed only one side of a double-sided hit single to be certified as gold, but Scepter awarded Warwick an [...] "in-house award" [...] to recognize [...] "(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls" [...] as a million selling tune.|$|E

The songs [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer" [...] and [...] "A House Is Not a Home" [...] were added for her to sing. Chenoweth and Hayes remained in the cast until the show closed on January 2, 2011, although she missed performances from December 29, 2010 to January 1, 2011 to perform a New Year's Eve concert at Walt Disney Concert Hall on December 31, 2010. She played televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker in {{a reading of the}} musical Rise in 2011.|$|E

In 1999 he contributed a chapter, [...] "Telexes in Space: A Tale of Two Films", to the collection, Second Take: Australian Film-makers Talk, edited by Geoff Burton and Raffaele Caputo, which provides an explanation of his film-making style.

2500|$|Smooth jazz can {{be traced}} back to at least the late 1960s. [...] Producer Creed Taylor worked with guitarist Wes Montgomery on three popular records (1967's A Day in the Life and Down Here on the Ground and 1968's Road Song) {{consisting}} of instrumental versions of familiar pop songs such as [...] "Eleanor Rigby", [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer" [...] and [...] "Scarborough Fair". While jazz musicians had performed pop hits since the early 1900s, Montgomery's commercially successful albums were somewhat of a departure from this tradition, containing little of the complex improvisation of his earlier recordings and being aimed squarely at pop music audiences. Reviewing A Day In the Life, critic Scott Yannow writes, [...] "although the jazz content is almost nil, the results are pleasing as background music." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{this was}} the more hopeless and {{exasperating}} to Grant since in the young girl's speech and manner there was not the slightest trace of coquetry or playfulness.

2500|$|On the February 5, 2007, {{episode of}} Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, Cole sang [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer" [...] at a benefit dinner for Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson). She {{can also be}} seen in the last scene of Nas' music video for [...] "Can't Forget About You". The song uses a sample of her father's song [...] "Unforgettable". Cole is sitting at a piano in a cabaret-style lounge mouthing her father's song with Nas {{standing}} beside her. Cole also performed [...] "Something's Gotta Give" [...] on American Idol on April 29, 2009. In September 2010, Cole performed with Andrea Bocelli in a concert at the Kodak Theatre, for his album My Christmas, in which she recorded a duet with him, and from December 10–13, 2009, she appeared with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square in their annual Christmas concerts. Both were videotaped for presentation on PBS in December 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Warwick {{had become}} the {{priority}} act of Scepter Records, according to the website [...] "The Scepter Records Story" [...] and producer/A chief, Luther Dixon in a 2002 A Biography of Burt Bacharach, {{with the release of}} [...] "Anyone Who Had a Heart" [...] in 1963. [...] Other Scepter LPs certified RIAA Gold include Dionne Warwick's Golden Hits Part 1 released in 1967 and The Dionne Warwicke Story: A Decade of Gold released in 1971. [...] By the end of 1971, Warwick had sold an estimated 35 million singles and albums internationally in less than nine years and more than 16 million singles in the U.S. alone. Exact figures of her sales are unknown and probably underestimated, due to Scepter Records' apparently lax accounting policies and the company policy of not submitting recordings for RIAA audit. Warwick became the first Scepter artist to request RIAA audits of her recordings in 1967 with the release of [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer." ...|$|E

[...] 65 were selected to proceed on to the next round. [...] The singers were expected to learn their songs that night and perform the next day in groups of three. [...] The girls and boys were separated and given crash course to learn their song, which was Dionne Warwick's [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer" [...] for the girls and [...] "For Once in My Life" [...] for the boys. [...] Many however frequently forgot the lyrics. [...] Again those who failed to impress were cut immediately after their performance.

2500|$|Franklin's debut Atlantic album, I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, {{also became}} commercially successful, later going gold. Franklin scored two more top ten singles in 1967 {{including}} [...] "Baby I Love You" [...] and [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman". Franklin's rapport with producer Jerry Wexler helped {{in the creation}} of the majority of Franklin's peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums, Lady Soul and Aretha Now, which included some of Franklin's most popular hit singles including [...] "Chain of Fools", [...] "Ain't No Way", [...] "Think" [...] and [...] "I <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Prayer". In February 1968, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys including the debut category for Best Female R Vocal Performance. On February 16, 1968, Franklin was honored with a day in her honor and was greeted by longtime friend Martin Luther King, Jr. who gave her the SCLC Drum Beat Award for Musicians just two months before his death. In June 1968, she appeared on the cover of Time magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Gilmore Girls non-diegetic {{score was}} {{composed}} by singer-songwriter Sam Phillips throughout its entire run. Sherman-Palladino, {{who served as}} the music supervisor of the series, was a big fan of the musician and secured her involvement. For the score's instrumental arrangement, Phillips primarily used her voice and an acoustic guitar, and on occasion included piano, violin, and drums. Many of the musical cues are accompanied by melodic [...] "la-la"s and [...] "ahh"s, which [...] developed because Sherman-Palladino wanted the score to sound connected to the girls themselves, almost like [...] "an extension of their thoughts ... if they had music going in their head during a certain emotional thing in their life." [...] Sherman-Palladino felt that the score elevated the series [...] "because it wasn't a wasted element in the show. Everything was trying to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> something, add a little something to it." [...] Several of Phillips' album tracks are also played in the show, and she made an appearance in the season six finale, performing part of [...] "Taking Pictures".|$|E
