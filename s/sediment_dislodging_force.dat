40|$|The {{effect of}} inter-implant {{distance}} on retention and resistance of implant-tissue-supported overdentures {{is lacking in}} the literature. An in vitro study was performed to evaluate this effect for mandibular implant-tissue-supported overdentures retained by two ball attachments. An acrylic cast of an edentulous mandible was fabricated. Three pairs of implants were symmetrically placed at {{both sides of the}} midline. The inter-implant distance was 10, 25, and 35 millimeters in positions A, B and C, respectively. A framework simulating the overdenture was fabricated on the cast. Six attachment housings were placed within the overdenture. For each sample, two ball abutments were screwed onto the implant pairs and two pink nylon inserts were seated in their respective attachment housings. The samples were tested in three groups of 15 (A, B, and C). The testing machine applied tensile <b>dislodging</b> <b>forces</b> and peak loads were measured in three directions: vertical, oblique, and anterior-posterior. A one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD was used to determine groups that were significantly different. Tests were carried out at 0. 05 level of significance. Peak loads for the anterior-posteriorly directed <b>dislodging</b> <b>forces</b> were significantly the highest for group C (P 0. 05). Inter-implant distance did not affect the vertical retention and oblique resistance of mandibular implant-tissue-supported overdentures; however, it affected anterior-posterior resistance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this in vivo study is to {{register}} the forces necessary to displace maxillary complete dentures fabricated by compression molding and injection molding techniques on {{one and the same}} patient and to compare the interfacial surface tension and capillarity which are achieved by both techniques. Material/Methods: Two maxillary complete dentures are made for each patient (total number of patients is 30) using both technologies. The magnitude of <b>dislodging</b> <b>force</b> is measured by a dynamometer. Results: Mean ± standard deviation for conventional cuvette technique is 17, 53 N ± 12, 11 N. Mean ± standard deviation for injection molding technique is 20, 73 N ± 13, 89 N. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed statistically significant differences in results achieved by conventional cuvette technique and injection molding technology. The results of injection technique were higher than those of compression molding technique (F= 123, 676, p< 0, 001). Conclusions: Based on the results we suggest a standard for <b>dislodging</b> <b>force</b> of maxillary complete dentures fabricated by conventional cuvette technique- 13 N, and by injection molding technology- 15, 5 N. These values would guarantee good interfacial surface tension and capillarity. The injection molding technique was found to produce better fitting maxillary complete dentures when compared to compression molding technique. This would ensure better retention, less traumatic manifestations after insertion and higher patient’s comfort and satisfaction...|$|R

The aim of this research was to compare the retention {{and resistance}} of Nobel Biocare Ball (NBB), Nobel Biocare Bar and Clip (NBBC) and Sterngold ERA Red (ERAR) attachments on an implant-tissue supported overdenture model. Materials and Methods: The attachment samples were divided into 3 groups of NBB, NBBC, and ERAR (5 samples in each group). Two parallel Nobel Biocare Branemark implants were placed symmetrically at the symphysis region of a mandibular test model. A metallic overdenture was fabricated precisely adapted to the model and attached to a Zwick testing machine (crosshead speed of 51 mm/min). <b>Dislodging</b> tensile <b>forces</b> were applied in three vertical, oblique, anterior-posterior directions and two situations, at the beginning and after 100 times of insertion/removal of the overdenture, for each sample.

40|$|Direct fossil {{evidence}} of scavenging ostracods is rare. A convincing example, representing the earliest recorded occurrence of ostracods feeding on vertebrate carrion, is described from the Bowland Shale Formation (Kinderscoutian, Upper Carboniferous) of Derbyshire, UK. It {{consists of the}} anterior end of a shark (Orodus sp.) whose upper surface is crowded with adults and juveniles of the nektobenthic ostracod Eocypridina carsingtonensis Wilkinson, Williams, Siveter & Wilby, 2004 (Myodocopida: Cypridinidae). Extrapolation of their preserved density suggests that the entire carcass may have hosted over a thousand individuals. It presented a rare opportunity for benthic scavenging in the Widmerpool Gulf because it was sufficiently large to have protruded above the inhospitable, and probably soupy, substrate surface. Although not necessarily a necrophagous specialist, E. carsingtonensis {{appears to have been}} well adapted to rapidly locating and exploiting widely dispersed nekton food drops. Its absence from the background sediment suggests that it commuted to the shark over relatively large distances, probably from adjacent basin highs. This implies a well-developed chemosensory capability. The ostracods are interpreted as having been overwhelmed by <b>sediment</b> <b>dislodged</b> during the sudden collapse of the partially buried carcass. ...|$|R

40|$|P>The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} an original portable device to measure attachment retention of implant overdentures both in the lab and in clinical settings. The device was built with a digital force measurement gauge (Imada) secured to a vertical wheel stand associated with a customized support to hold and position the denture in adjustable angulations. Sixteen matrix and patrix cylindrical stud attachments (Locator (R)) were randomly assigned as in vitro test specimens. Attachment abutments were secured in an implant analogue hung to the digital force gauge or to the load cell of a traction machine used as the gold standard (Instron Universal Testing Machine). Matrices were secured in a denture duplicate attached to the customized support, permitting reproducibility of their position on both pulling devices. Attachment retention in the axial direction was evaluated by measuring maximum <b>dislodging</b> <b>force</b> or peak load during five consecutive linear dislodgments of each attachment on both devices. After a wear simulation, retention was measured again at several time periods. The peak load measurements with the customized Imada device were similar to those obtained with the gold standard Instron machine. These findings suggest that the proposed portable device can provide accurate information on the retentive properties of attachment systems for removable dental prostheses.

40|$|Binding of the Fc {{portion of}} IgG coated on targets to Fcgamma receptors (e. g., CD 16) {{expressed}} on leukocytes (i. e., 2 D binding) is an initiating step for immune responses such as phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In vivo, circulating leukocytes {{are exposed to}} plasma IgG. The competition from soluble IgG (i. e., 3 D binding) may affect the 2 D binding. Many cell surface receptors, CD 16 included, have soluble counterparts. While their physiological significance is not clear, receptor-based competitive inhibition therapy, in which soluble receptors, ligands, and their analogs are employed to compete with surface-bound receptors and ligands to prevent unwanted adhesion, is widely used to treat various diseases. To provide a quantitative basis for design of these therapeutic approaches, we developed a mathematical model for 2 D and 3 D competition binding. The model relates cell-surface adhesion (in the presence and absence of <b>dislodging</b> <b>forces)</b> to the concentration of the soluble competitor, the densities of the surface-bound receptors and ligands, {{as well as the}} binding affinities of the 2 D and 3 D interactions.
