5000|$|Today {{all that}} remains are half a dozen tracks with loading ramps on the ends, located in a {{warehouse}} area. In addition, {{there is a small}} <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> next to the warehouses, an engine house and a small wye. The engine house was extended so that both locomotives can fit inside.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fiddle yard}} or <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> is a {{collection}} of model railway tracks that are hidden from view and allow trains to be stored and manipulated by the operators. These tracks are used to allow most model railways to be operated in a realistic manner. Whilst it is possible to have a realistic shunting yard in view, its operation is generally unreliable with models.|$|E
5000|$|Switching <b>yards,</b> <b>staging</b> <b>yards</b> or Shunting yards {{are most}} common {{generally}} graded to be flat yards where switch engines and man power manually shuffle and maneuver cars from: a) train arrival tracks, to a b) consist breakdown track, c) to an consist assembly track, thence to d) departure tracks of the yard.|$|R
5000|$|It {{featured}} {{two separate}} assembly lines. Partially completed vehicles were transported by truck from the Body Plant {{to either the}} North Line [...] "M" [...] or the South Line [...] "C" [...] for completion. Upon completion, cars were driven {{off the assembly line}} and under northbound Martin Luther King, Jr.Boulevard bridge. After final inspection, the cars were placed in <b>staging</b> <b>yards</b> to either be shipped by truck or by rail.|$|R
50|$|Free-mo can be {{utilized}} easily {{in either a}} club or a group. A club is a formal non-profit organization, while a group is simply a number of like-minded friends or acquaintances. Traditional modular layouts often require a club to own a complex centralized power supply system that includes DC throttles or DCC equipment, large <b>staging</b> <b>yards,</b> a set of four corners to form a closed loop, and a trailer to haul everything. Due to Free-mo's design, however, {{it is easy to}} have an informal group where individual members bring their own modules and Digitrax DCC equipment.|$|R
5000|$|... and lastly, a {{marshaling}} yard at Mountain Top with a rail road running down a ribs of a ridgeline down to White Haven {{and the new}} upper canal docks, with a turn around <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> there at the upper canal loading docks. In 1855, as alternative sources opened to steal market share, the canal reached its peak {{of more than one}} million tons of cargo. After that, coal mined in the Schuylkill Valley supplanted coal supplied by the Lehigh Canal.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{opening of the}} East and West Junction line, the layout at Fenny Compton placed the two {{railways}} side by side, with only a siding connection for exchange of goods wagons between the two. The SMJR line crossed over the GWR by a bridge further south. On 7 March 1960 however a new junction was installed at the station, providing a shorter route for iron ore trains from Banbury to South Wales than the former route by way of Leamington. A new <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> was provided at Honeybourne West Junction.|$|E
5000|$|This {{activity}} is duplicated in a Transfer yard, the difference {{being in the}} latter many or several businesses and industries are serviced by the local switcher, {{which is part of}} the yard equipment, and the industry pays a cargo transfer fee to the railroad or yard operating company. In the <b>staging</b> <b>yard,</b> the locomotive is most likely operated by industry (refinery, chemical company or coal mine personnel); and ownership of the yard in both cases is a matter of business, and could be any imaginable combination. Ownership and operation are quite often a matter of leases and interests ...|$|E
5000|$|A large {{sub-group}} of such yards {{are known}} as <b>Staging</b> <b>yards,</b> which are yards serving an end destination that is also a collection yard starting car groups for departure. These seemingly incompatible tasks are because the operating or road company and its locomotive drops off empties and picks up full cars waiting departure which have been spotted and assembled by local switch engines. The long haul carrier makes the round trip with a minimal turn around time, and the local switch engine transfers empties to the loading yard when the industries output {{is ready to be}} shipped.|$|R
2500|$|All bridge {{components}} were constructed on land, in purpose-built <b>staging</b> <b>yards</b> {{located on the}} shoreline at Amherst Head, fronting on Borden Harbour {{just east of the}} town and ferry docks, and an inland facility located at Bayfield, New Brunswick about [...] west of Cape Tormentine. The Amherst Head staging facility was where all large {{components were}} built, including the pier bases, ice shields, main spans, and drop-in spans. The Bayfield facility was used to construct components for the near-shore bridges which were linked using a launching truss extending over shallow waters almost [...] from the New Brunswick shore, and [...] from the Prince Edward Island shore.|$|R
5000|$|Armstrong pioneered and {{promoted}} modern layout design, stressing {{the concept of}} designing the model railroad as a totality, including its operational scheme, the prototype on which it was based (including its landscape setting), the use of double sided backdrops and other devices to control viewpoints and viewing angles, multiple levels of railroad, <b>staging</b> <b>yards,</b> and the operational plan or schema. Before his synthesis of the ideas of John Allen, Frank Ellison, Whit Towers and others, layouts were often {{little more than a}} [...] "spaghetti bowl" [...] of intersecting tracks on which trains ran in no particular order and with little or no sense of purpose.|$|R
50|$|In a 10-year period, the South Carolina Ports Authority {{plans to}} invest $1.3 {{billion in new}} and {{existing}} facilities. The funding for the capital plan will be internally generated based on the Ports Authority’s ability to borrow (in the form of revenue bonds) {{as well as its}} operating revenues. Additionally, the State of South Carolina has committed approximately $700 million in funding for port-related infrastructure projects in the works. These projects include a new dual-rail served container <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> in North Charleston, a port access road tying the Ports Authority’s new container terminal to I-26, as well as the state share of construction cost ($300 million) of the Charleston Harbor Deepening Project.|$|E
5000|$|Today main {{transportation}} is iron ore from North Bessemer interchange. Edgar Thomson gets it coke from the Clairton works {{that is also}} interchanged to Dexter yard, slabs from Edgar Thomson to Irvin works and finished steel products (coils) from Irvin works to the interchanges. Only the Port Perry Bridge remains open for rail traffic. For inner-mill service the Edgar Thomson plant uses US Steel own EMD-switchers to move the hot metal subs and for tressel unloading. Crews from the URR have their own motive power EMD's for general switching duties within the mill. Their duties include the movement of loaded ore and coke cars to the <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> and tressel, spotting and pulling the caster and slab mills, along with bringing in scrap and flux cars into the BOP [...] "Basic Oxygen Process". After closing the Riverton bridge in 2008 there is no rail connection between the URR network and Mckeesport Tubular Operations [...] "Camp Hill". Using URR motive power to switch McKeesport Tubular {{is the duty of}} McKeesport Connection Railroad (MKC), another subsidiary of Transtar. The Duquesne Coal Docks are still in operations unloading scrap metal from barges to be used at Edgar Thomson and coal barges to interchange with Norfolk Southern in the Kenny Yard.Union Railroad continues to serve the Mon Valley and have since expanded its customer base to include Dura-Bond pipe coating in the former Duquesne Works site and General Electric in West Mifflin hauling special oversize generators.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- A {{simulation}} {{model of a}} log transport logistics network was developed. The model could be structured to either share truck capacity {{among a group of}} loggers, or to assign a fixed number of trucks to individual loggers. Another variation of the model allowed the use of a <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> to set out loaded trailers and deliver them to destinations using dedicated shuttle trucks that operated continuously. Pooling trucks among loggers provided more flexibility in dealing with driver shift length constraints, and consequently delivered more wood to mills than did individual ownership. The magnitude of the difference was related to dispatch method. Accounting for logger status when dispatching trucks increased wood volume moved and reduced average trailer waiting times for all loggers. Staging yards were effective in maintainirig delivered volume of wood when severe delays were probable at destination mil!s...|$|E
5000|$|All bridge {{components}} were constructed on land, in purpose-built <b>staging</b> <b>yards</b> {{located on the}} shoreline at Amherst Head, fronting on Borden Harbour {{just east of the}} town and ferry docks, and an inland facility located at Bayfield, New Brunswick about 3 km west of Cape Tormentine. The Amherst Head staging facility was where all large {{components were}} built, including the pier bases, ice shields, main spans, and drop-in spans. The Bayfield facility was used to construct components for the near-shore bridges which were linked using a launching truss extending over shallow waters almost 2 km from the New Brunswick shore, and [...]5 km from the Prince Edward Island shore.|$|R
50|$|In the past, traffic {{consisted}} of shipments of: resins, scrap materials, lumber, logs, fertilizer, steel, feed grade grains, and tallow. However, in December 2011, EOG Resources opened an online Sand Processing Plant. Sand now represent over 90% of the shipments, with the railroad hauling an estimated 160,000 tons of sand per month. This {{volume of traffic}} has required a total rebuilding {{of much of the}} trackage as well as construction of new interchange and car <b>staging</b> <b>yards.</b> This new booming mining business, while making the Wisconsin Northern quite profitable, has also killed the railroad's hopes of expanding its trackage rights. Progressive Rail had planned to contract with the state of Wisconsin to operate a 45-mile extension that would have connected the Wisconsin Northern with the Canadian National Railway mainline, however when the CN discovered the booming Wisconsin sand market, they backed out of the sale of the rail line they had attempted to previously abandon.|$|R
5000|$|From {{an early}} <b>stage</b> the <b>yard</b> {{was not used}} at capacity: by the late 1960s road {{competition}} was biting hard into the railways' goods traffic, {{and in particular the}} wagon-load freight that required hump-yards like Tinsley was already declining. The economic malaise and industrial decline of the 1970s exacerbated this. By the 1980s British Rail was closing its remaining wagon-load freight facilities as being uneconomic.|$|R
40|$|Sixteen {{previously}} occupied {{temporary housing}} units (THUs) were studied to assess emissions of volatile organic compounds. The whole trailer emission factors were evaluated for 36 VOCs including formaldehyde. Indoor sampling {{was carried out}} in the THUs located in Purvis <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> in Mississippi, USA. Indoor temperature and relative humidity (RH) were also measured in all the trailers during sampling. Indoor temperatures were varied (increased or decreased) in a selection of THUs using the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Indoor temperatures during sampling ranged from 14 o C to 33 o C, and relative humidity (RH) varied between 35 percent and 74 percent. Ventilation rates were increased in some trailers using bathroom fans and vents during some of the sampling events. Ventilation rates measured during some a selection of sampling events varied from 0. 14 to 4. 3 h- 1. Steady state indoor formaldehyde concentrations ranged from 10 mu g-m- 3 to 1000 mu g-m- 3. The formaldehyde concentrations in the trailers were of toxicological significance. The effects of temperature, humidity and ventilation rates were also studied. A linear regression model was built using log of percentage relative humidity, inverse of temperature (in K- 1), and inverse log ACH as continuous independent variables, trailer manufacturer as a categorical independent variable, and log of the chemical emission factors as the dependent variable. The coefficients of inverse temperature, log relative humidity, log inverse ACH with log emission factor were found to be statistically significant for all the samples at the 95 percent confidence level. The regression model was found to explain about 84 percent of the variation in the dependent variable. Most VOC concentrations measured indoors in the Purvis THUs were mostly found to be below values reported in earlier studies by Maddalena et al., 1, 2 Hodgson et al., 3 and Hippelein 4. Emissions of TMPB-DIB (a plasticizer found in vinyl products) were found to be higher than values reported in comparable housing by Hodgson et al., 3. Emissions of phenol were also found to be slightly higher than values reported in earlier studies 1, 2, 3. This study can assist in retrospective formaldehyde exposure assessments of THUs where estimates of the occupants indoor formaldehyde exposures are needed...|$|E
40|$|Four unoccupied FEMA {{temporary}} housing units (THUs) were studied {{to assess their}} indoor emissions of volatile organic compounds including formaldehyde. Measurement of whole-THU VOC and aldehyde emission factors (mu g h- 1 per m 2 of floor area) {{for each of the}} four THUs were made at FEMA's Purvis MS <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> using a mass balance approach. Measurements were made in the morning, and again in the afternoon in each THU. Steady-state indoor formaldehyde concentrations ranged from 378 mu g m- 3 (0. 31 ppm) to 632 mu g m- 3 (0. 52 ppm) in the AM, and from 433 mu g m- 3 (0. 35 ppm) to 926 mu g m- 3 (0. 78 ppm) in the PM. THU air exchange rates ranged from 0. 15 h- 1 to 0. 39 h- 1. A total of 45 small (approximately 0. 025 m 2) samples of surface material, 16 types, were collected directly from the four THUs and shipped to Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The material samples were analyzed for VOC and aldehyde emissions in small stainless steel chambers using a standard, accurate mass balance method. Quantification of VOCs was done via gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry and low molecular weight aldehydes via high performance liquid chromatography. Material specific emission factors (mu g h- 1 per m 2 of material) were quantified. Approximately 80 unique VOCs were tentatively identified in the THU field samples, of which forty-five were quantified either because of their toxicological significance or because their concentrations were high. Whole-trailer and material specific emission factors were calculated for 33 compounds. The THU emission factors and those from their component materials were compared against those measured from other types of housing and the materials used in their construction. Whole THU emission factors for most VOCs were typically similar to those from comparative housing. The three exceptions were exceptionally large emissions of formaldehyde and TMPD-DIB (a common plasticizer in vinyl products), and somewhat elevated for phenol. Of these three compounds, formaldehyde was the only one with toxicological significance at the observed concentrations. Whole THU formaldehyde emissions ranged from 173 to 266 mu g m- 2 h 1 in the morning and 257 to 347 mu g m- 2 h- 1 in the afternoon. Median formaldehyde emissions in previously studied site-built and manufactured homes were 31 and 45 mu g m- 2 h- 1, respectively. Only one of the composite wood materials that was tested appeared to exceed the HUD formaldehyde emission standard (430 mu g/m 2 h- 1 for particleboard and 130 mu g/m 2 h- 1 for plywood). The high loading factor (material surface area divided by THU volume) of composite wood products in the THUs and the low fresh air exchange relative to the material surface area may be responsible for the excessive concentrations observed for some of the VOCs and formaldehyde...|$|E

40|$|The cruise {{industry}} is host to {{major changes in}} the way the skip's power plants are configured. Diesel-electric propulsion has replaced most diesel-mechanic systems for larger ships. Podded propulsion is making serious headway and gas turbines are currently under order. In future, fuel cells, permanent magnefiechnology and novel propulsion systems may appear. The cost/benefit analysis of the alternatives offered is pivotal for making the right decisions. The mission profile of the ship, its sailing schedule and the multitude of parameters describing the power plant heavily influence the outcome of this analysis. Various decision criteria are involved such as risk appraisal, economic considerations and measures of flexibility. In the early project <b>stage</b> <b>yard</b> and owner {{need to be able to}} design, analyse and evaluate the various solutions quickly and effectively. Preferably such a process would also include experience gathered with other ships. This paper will describe in some detail the toot developed for this purpose. It will dwell on the modelling of power plant components and their interactions. A method will be presented to configure, design and evaluate the entire system, not only in technical but also in economic and strategic parameters. Several technologies will be concisely dealt with, existing as well as planned, and the potential impact of these will be touched upon. Finally the methodology will be applied to the case of a hypothetical cruise ship. Various power plant implementations will be discussed and the implications for future development will be mentioned...|$|R

50|$|F-Class matches are all slow-fire, prone {{shooting}} ‘for score’. There {{are primarily}} two courses of fire in most major F-Class tournaments. A Palma match {{consists of three}} stages, 800, 900 and 1000 yards, with 15 shots for record at each distance. At 800 yards, the shooter is allowed unlimited sighters. However, only two sighters are allowed at 900 yards and 1000 yards. That dictates a different strategy for the longer distances. A tournament may consist {{of two or three}} Palma matches. The other course of fire that we commonly shoot has <b>stages</b> at 600 <b>yards</b> and 1000 yards, with 15- or 20-shot strings at each distance. A tournament will be three to five strings at each yardage, usually with unlimited sighters for each string.|$|R

50|$|By 31 August 1907 the {{railhead}} was at 12 miles (19.3 km). The {{line was}} opened to Mount Surprise in May 1908, and the railway station at Mount Surprise (108.5 km from Almaden) was named in December 1909. In 1916 Mount Surprise station had a gate, siding, telephone, scales, fork, cattle yards, and {{a horse and}} carriage loading bank. By 1932 it had a station building, closet, goods shed, loading bank, motor shed, camping quarters, two fettler's quarters, enginemen's quarters, coal <b>stage,</b> and cattle <b>yards.</b> Mount Surprise became an important cattle trucking centre after 1951, with the reconditioning of the line from Almaden for steam locomotives.

40|$|This manual {{documents}} the capabilities {{and functions of}} the Port Simulation (PORTSIM) Model, Version 4. 3, which operates on Windows NT 4. 0 or Windows 2000. Step-by-step procedures for using PORTSIM are provided. PORTSIM is a discrete-event simulation model that allows for a comprehensive analysis of all critical seaport operations for embarkation. It is applicable to ports worldwide. This simulation system addresses the complexities of port operations and gives you a way to measure the desirability of any given plan of action. PORTSIM models all cargo items, ships, and port infrastructure resources as individual objects. A typical scenario may process more than 10, 000 cargo items. Cargo is simulated from the time it arrives at a port to the time it is loaded onto a ship. Note that PORTSIM Version 4. 3 models only embarkation activities. Modeling of debarkation currently is being handled under another software framework. You can use PORTSIM to specify the availability of port resources to provide the most realistic simulation possible. The simulation provides detailed information on cargo throughput and infrastructure utilization. With PORTSIM, you can simulate the movement of entire military units through a specified port. You can also selectively constrain resources or operational parameters, to identify potential bottlenecks. To support your analysis, the software provides utilization statistics for all port resources (e. g., gates, <b>staging</b> areas, interchange <b>yards,</b> berths, inspectors, and container handling equipment). Simulation results are presented in three ways. (1) During the simulation run, utilization information is presented graphically in real time as continuous display meters {{that can help you}} monitor activity and identify potential problems visually as they develop. (2) During the run, you can also view a summary screen showing the current status of transports and cargo. (3) After the run, reports and graphs showing the final results can be viewed and saved...|$|R
