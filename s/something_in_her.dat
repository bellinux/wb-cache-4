5|$|As {{the clerics}} set up base camp, River accesses {{footage of the}} Angel from the Byzantium to verify its secure. She and the Doctor leave to study a text written about Angels, {{learning}} that even an image of an Angel can become an Angel itself. They are unaware that Amy stayed to watch the footage, and when she blinks, the Angel appears to move. The Doctor helps her stop the video feed, and believes Amy is safe, but she feels <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E
25|$|The third {{event was}} in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen Louisa Ulrika of Sweden, who {{asked him to}} tell her {{something}} about her deceased brother Prince Augustus William of Prussia. The next day, Swedenborg whispered <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained {{that this was something}} only she and her brother could know about.|$|E

60|$|She mused, and sighed, {{and turned}} to him with <b>something</b> pathetic <b>in</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

500|$|Swift's music {{contains}} elements of pop, pop rock and country. She self-identified {{as a country}} artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she described as a [...] "sonically cohesive pop album". Rolling Stone asserted, [...] " [...] might get played on the country station, but she's {{one of the few}} genuine rock stars we've got these days". The New York Times noted, [...] "There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville". According to The Guardian, Swift [...] "cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory".|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} the series, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan {{as a girl}} next door and chose her to convey this image. In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] but had to be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan {{was going to be}} my anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her at first. And then {{it occurred to me that}} one of these women should be divorced... I thought there was something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{finds himself}} too weak from the poison's effects to pilot the TARDIS to rescue his companions; River is {{inspired}} by the Doctor's sympathy, and finds herself guided by the TARDIS itself to pilot the ship, and rescues Amy and Rory in time. On returning to the café, the trio finds the Doctor near death; he asks River to find [...] "River Song" [...] {{and give her a}} message, then whispers <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> ear before he passes away. River, who at this point still only knows herself as Melody Pond, asks Amy who River Song is; Amy uses the Teselecta to show River her form stored in the robot's database of who she is to become. With this, River sacrifices her remaining regenerations to bring the Doctor back to life, and passes out. The Doctor, Amy, and Rory take her to a hospital in the far future, leaving the TARDIS-shaped diary as a gift by her bedside, and depart. Later, River is shown becoming an archaeologist so she can find the Doctor herself. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor has discovered the date of his death from the records aboard the Teselecta, but does not reveal this knowledge to Amy or Rory.|$|E

500|$|... "Back to December"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, who directed the video for Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream", and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed {{the idea for the}} video after being inspired from the film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He also told MTV News that he wanted the video to be simple yet metaphorical. He added, [...] "I wanted to work on the coldness of feelings in a very visual way, playing with the snow, the distance and sadness." [...] He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that she would come off as accessible, saying [...] "I wanted her to perform a very natural way, to make her look very European. This was the main challenge to me. All of Taylor's world is very far away from my culture, but I saw <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> that could be very rough and heartbreaking; far from the princess glittery outfits and glam that she often goes for." [...] Lemoine was allowed {{to take control of the}} whole production of the video, although it was Swift's idea to have her character leave the letter for her beloved. Swift's love interest in the video was played by male model, Guntars Asmanis. Lemoine commented that Asmanis was the perfect fit for Swift's love interest, saying [...] "I wanted a boy that was fragile and beautiful. I didn't want to go for a hunk or a perfect cheesy boy that would have killed the sincerity of the video." [...] The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on CMT and Great American Country. Footages of the school and baseball stadium in the video were filmed in Binghamton, New York, in MacArthur Park while scenes with Swift were shot in an old country mansion outside of Nashville.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E

After she is proven innocent, Gibbs angrily states that Ziva is [...] "off limits" [...] to Eli. They reconcile, with Ziva relaying the rest of what happened up to being taken captive. Gibbs then whispers <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> ear and kisses her forehead as she breaks down crying.|$|E
2500|$|Dancer David Atkins was {{originally}} cast as Billy Kwan. However, during rehearsals Weir {{began to feel}} that the relationship between his character and Mel Gibson's was not working so he decided to recast. Several actors auditioned, including Bob Balaban and Wallace Shawn, when Weir saw a photo of Linda Hunt. He asked for her to audition and decided to cast her. To accomplish the role during production, Hunt shortened [...] "her hair and dye it black wore padding around her waist, shaved her eyebrows, and carried <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> shirt pocket." [...] In her 1986 interview with Bomb magazine, Hunt remarked that Billy Kwan [...] "is supra-personal [...] layers of sexual ambiguity" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{third season}} premiered on September 24, 2006. In the third season, Bree marries Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), whose past and {{involvement}} with a recently discovered dead body becomes the main {{mystery of the}} season.

After being run over by Orson in the previous season finale, Mike falls into coma and suffers from amnesia when he wakes up. Edie sees her chance to make her move on Mike, and her family relations are explored throughout the season. Susan loses hope that Mike's memory will return and in the process moves on to a handsome Englishman whose wife is also in a coma, while her daughter Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen) starts dating Edie's nephew. Elderly neighbor Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) hides <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> freezer. A shooting at the local grocery store leaves two characters dead and changes everyone's lives forever.|$|E

2500|$|Garner rose to fame in 2001 {{when she}} was cast as {{the star of the}} ABC spy drama Alias. The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: [...] "I always thought she had <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{personality}} that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that." [...] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role. Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: [...] "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross." [...] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought [...] "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" [...] to the role. Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end. During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.|$|E
2500|$|Cleopatra is a {{difficult}} character to pin down because there are multiple aspects of her personality that we occasionally get a glimpse of. However, the most dominant parts of her character seem to oscillate between a powerful ruler, a seductress, and a heroine of sorts. Power is one of Cleopatra's most dominant character traits and she uses it {{as a means of}} control. This thirst for control manifested itself through Cleopatra's initial seduction of Antony in which she was dressed as Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and made quite a calculated entrance in order to capture his attention. This sexualised act extends itself into Cleopatra's role as a seductress because it was her courage and unapologetic manner that leaves people remembering her as a [...] "grasping, licentious harlot". However, despite her [...] "insatiable sexual passion" [...] she was still using these relationships as part of a grander political scheme, once again revealing how dominant Cleopatra's desire was for power. Due to Cleopatra's close relationship with power, she seems to take on the role of a heroine because there is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> passion and intelligence that intrigues others. She was an autonomous and confident ruler, sending a powerful message about the independence and strength of women. Cleopatra had quite a wide influence, and still continues to inspire, making her a heroine to many.|$|E
2500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was then}} a young schoolmistress, as yet unpublished, but Price saw <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> worth fostering, and became a friend and mentor. Through the {{minister}} (and through the young Anglican John Hewlett, who also introduced her to the eminent lexicographer Samuel Johnson), she met the great humanitarian and radical publisher Joseph Johnson, who was to guide her career {{and serve as a}} father figure. [...] Through him, with a title alluding to the husband of her other benefactor, she published Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (subtitled: with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life). The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening. A couple of years after she had had to leave Newington Green, these seeds germinated into A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women: Her biographer Claire Tomalin argues that just as the Dissenters were [...] "excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority", so too were women, and the [...] "character defects of both groups" [...] could be attributed to this discrimination.|$|E
