25|$|The {{market was}} forced to restructure. An ambitious plan {{entitled}} Reconstruction and Renewal was produced in 1995, with proposals for separating the ongoing Lloyd's from its past losses. Liability for all pre-1993 business was to be compulsorily transferred (by RITC) into a special vehicle named Equitas (which would require {{the approval of the}} UK's Department of Trade & Industry (DTI)) at a cost of around $21bn. Many Names faced large bills, but the plan also provided for a settlement of their disputes, a tax on recent profits, and the write-off of nearly $5bn of debts, skewed towards those with the most severe losses. The plan was debated at length, modified, and eventually strongly supported by the Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM) and most leaders of Names' action groups. Money was raised in many ways, including the <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaseback</b> of the Lloyd's building, and a tax on future business. Individual offers were accepted by 95 per cent of Lloyd's names. The past liabilities of all Names were transferred to Equitas in September 1996.|$|E

However, share trading in AI's Isle of Man–based holding company was suspended in August 1990, and administrative receivers were appointed in September. About 7-% of its debts of £50 million were owed to Alan Bond.|$|E

5000|$|A lease {{might not}} {{transfer}} {{ownership of the}} leased property to the lessee. In some circumstances, the lessee might nevertheless be required to record the leased item as an asset if the lessee intends to use the asset for {{a major portion of}} its useful life, or where the present value of the future lease payments is nearly equal to the fair value of the asset. Although the lessee is not the owner, the lessee may be required to record the asset as being owned by the lessee, based on the underlying economics of the transaction.Another example is the situation where a company short of cash sells its machinery to the bank and then leases the same property from the bank. This arrangement is called [...] "sale and leaseback". Although the legal ownership has been transferred to the bank, the underlying economic reality for the company remain the same. Under the substance-over-form principle, the <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> subsequent <b>leaseback</b> are considered one transaction.|$|R
25|$|The welfare <b>and</b> <b>leaseback</b> {{programs}} got {{an abrupt}} ending as well. Eventually rulings {{were made on}} the tax issues making the sale-and-lease-back model less favorable. This {{as well as the}} bad media coverage of Brixtofte meant that investors lost faith in the administration. This caused the collapse of various plans that should have kept the scheme going, such as the sale of certain building sites. On top of that came increasing rent costs from the previous <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> eventually the municipality was forced to abandon the extraordinary welfare programs and dramatically raise its taxes. It went from being one of the cheapest {{to one of the most}} expensive municipalities in Denmark.|$|R
