40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relationship}} between causal attribution beliefs of students and their self-esteem. The sample of the study comprised of 3614 students including 1868 male and 1746 female students studying in the 10 th grade from 72 public sector schools across 6 districts (selected on the geographical basis) of Punjab. The data were collected by using two research instruments. A 5 -point rating scale, Causal Attribution Beliefs Scale (CABS) was used to measure causal attributions beliefs of students. Eight attributes were included in the instrument i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, parent. <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and teacher. <b>s</b> <b>influence.</b> Another instrument, a 5 -point rating scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used to measure self-esteem of the students. According to the nature of the data and to address the research questions, different statistical techniques i. e. inferential statistics like Independent Sample t-Tests, MANOVA, Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were applied. The results of the study revealed that students endorsed all given causes (ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, parent. <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and teacher. <b>s</b> <b>influence)</b> as a potential cause of both success and failure. Identical patterns of success were observed in mathematics and English. Both girls and boys ranked teacher. <b>s</b> <b>influence,</b> effort and parent. <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> as their prime causes of success in mathematics. Both male students and female students believe teacher. <b>s</b> <b>influence,</b> effort, parent influence and ability as the primary causes of their success in English. However, there were significant differences in failure attribution patterns. Male students consider lack of effort, lack of interest and wrong use of strategy as the main causes of their failure in mathematics. Whereas, female students considered lack of effort, wrong use of strategy and task difficulty as major causes of their failure in mathematics. In the same way, male students. main causes of failure in English were ranked as lack of interest, lack of effort and wrong use of strategy. While female students ranked failure causes in English as lack of effort, task difficulty and wrong use of strategy. Majority of the students showed high self-esteem levels. Only 14 % of the male students and 10 % of the female students exhibited low self-esteem level. Gender difference was found in self-esteem. Girls showed higher self-esteem level than boys. Similarly, urban students showed higher self-esteem level than rural students and science students showed higher self-esteem level than arts students. Relationship between causal attribution beliefs of students and self-esteem was found at secondary level. A small, negative but significant correlation was found in failure attributions and self-esteem level of the students. The relationship between failure attributions in mathematics and self-esteem was found in three attributions i. e. ability, luck and parent. s influence: whereas the relationship between failure attributions in English and self-esteem was found in five attributions i. e. ability, strategy, luck, parent. <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and teacher. <b>s</b> <b>influence.</b> A small but positive correlation was found between success attributions and self-esteem level of the students. As far as success attributions in mathematics and self-esteem were concerned, four attributions i. e. ability, effort, interest and parent. <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> were positively correlated. Similarly, relationship between success attributions in English and self-esteem was found in six attributions i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, parent. <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and teacher. <b>s</b> <b>influence.</b> Attributional patterns are changeable and can be taught to the students. The teachers should encourage their students to the attributions of controllable causes, so that changed self-perception brings academic improvement. The teacher. s feedback is very important in changing students. attributional beliefs. They must be trained in approaching their students, motivating them intrinsically and provision of suitable oral / written feedback to them so that in result students. desire to learn, to discover, to comprehend, to develop etc, can be flourished...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{investigated}} the degree of U. <b>S.</b> <b>influence</b> on India’s room of manoeuvre with regard to Iran. India has several incentives to maintain relations with both countries, but the U. S. wants India to help it isolate Iran. I have analysed three cases where India has been faced with the dilemma of {{having to deal with}} Iran while being subjected to U. S. pressure. I have assessed whether U. <b>S.</b> <b>influence</b> has been a decisive factor behind India’s choice of policy towards Iran. The three cases that have been analysed are the votes against Iran in the IAEA in 2005 and 2006, the Iran—Pakistan—India Pipeline Project, and the developments linked to the North South Transport Corridor. A theoretical framework based on Samuel Bacharach and Edward Lawler’s Dependence Approach and David Singer’s Inter-Nation Influence model has been used to investigate the nature and the effects of U. <b>S.</b> <b>influence.</b> India’s interests and concerns, which make up its room of manoeuvre, have also been identified, and function as control variables. The findings indicate that the U. S. has some degree of influence on India’s policies towards Iran. U. <b>S.</b> <b>influence</b> attempts {{are more likely to be}} successful if the U.

40|$|Although few {{firms can}} {{function}} without {{an information technology}} (IT) department, senior executives often consider IT as secondary. Historically, studies have found IT departments to have low influence and power status compared to other departments. Few, if any, studies have investigated what factors contribute to this subservient position. Three research questions that inspired this study regarding the IT department 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and power included factors that shape the IT influence and power, the consequences for the firm 2 ̆ 7 s IT orientation and business performance, and how firm 2 ̆ 7 s IT orientation affects business performance. This quantitative study explored the notion that accountability, innovativeness, customer connectedness and partnering with other departments positively affect the IT department 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and power. A synthesis of resource dependence and strategic contingency theories framed the theoretical basis for the structural equation model analyzed in this study. Responses from a Web panel of 349 anonymous, voluntary senior managers of firms operating in various industry types provided the data. Analysis results showed that accountability, innovativeness, and partnering with other departments positively affect the IT department 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and power. Also, the firm 2 ̆ 7 s IT orientation, more so than IT department 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>influence</b> and power, positively affects business performance. Results help IT executives to become more influential and enhance their ability to participate in their firm 2 ̆ 7 s strategic decisions. From social change perspective, influential IT managers can affect strategic decisions regarding social programs, implement new IT tools {{to do more with}} less, and new ways of distributing critical information and resources to enhance the speed of response when and where needed...|$|R
