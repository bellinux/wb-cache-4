5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown <b>sclerotia</b> that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped <b>sclerotia</b> that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown <b>sclerotia</b> that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the <b>sclerotia</b> of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce <b>sclerotia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} {{grassland}} psilocybin mushroom {{species such as}} P.mexicana, P.tampanensis and Conocybe cyanopus, P.semilanceata may form <b>sclerotia,</b> a dormant form of the fungus, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing <b>sclerotia</b> on a malt agar surface culture.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} psychoactive {{grassland}} {{species such as}} Psilocybe semilanceata, Conocybe cyanopus, P.tampanensis can form sclerotia–a hardened mass of mycelia that is more resistant to adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This truffle-like form gives the fungus some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. Other Psilocybe species known to produce <b>sclerotia</b> include Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe caerulescens. <b>Sclerotia</b> are also produced when the species is grown in culture.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade with the remaining two species of Collybia. Because C.cirrhata {{is the only one}} of the three Collybia species lacking <b>sclerotia,</b> it has been suggested that this character trait is an anapomorphy—that is, unique to a single, terminal species within a clade.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these <b>sclerotia</b> grow into morels.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called <b>sclerotia.</b> These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with <b>sclerotia</b> of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like <b>sclerotia</b> may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E
5|$|Psilocin and {{psilocybin}} {{are scheduled}} drugs in many countries, and mushrooms containing them are prohibited by extension. In the United States, Federal {{law was passed}} in 1971 that put the psychoactive components into the most restricted schedule I category. For about three decades following this, several European countries remained relatively tolerant of mushroom use and possession. In the 2000s (decade), in response to increases in prevalence and availability, all European countries banned possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms; the Netherlands was the last country to enact such laws in 2008. However, they did not include psilocybin-containing <b>sclerotia</b> in the 2008 law, and thus, psilocybin-containing fungal compounds are available commercially in the Netherlands. In parallel legal developments in Asia, P.tampanensis was one of 13 psychoactive mushrooms specifically prohibited by law in Japan in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or <b>sclerotia,</b> younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
25|$|The basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are effused, thin, and whitish. Microscopically {{they have}} {{colourless}} hyphae, 3 to 9μm wide, without clamp connections. The basidia are ellipsoid to broadly club-shaped, 9 to 14 by 8 to 12μm, bearing four sterigmata. The basidiospores are ellipsoid and broadly fusiform (spindle-shaped), measuring 6 to 11 by 4 to 6μm. Pale brown <b>sclerotia</b> are sometimes produced, measuring 0.5 to 3mm across.|$|E
500|$|Baeospora myosura {{is similar}} in size and {{appearance}} to C.tuberosa, but grows on spruce and Douglas-fir cones. The [...] "Magnolia coincap" [...] (Strobilurus conigenoides) is smaller and grows on the cones of Magnolias. The two remaining Collybia species closely resemble C.tuberosa, but can be distinguished by examining the stem bases {{at the point of}} attachment into the substrate. C.cookei has roughly spherical, light brown to yellowish <b>sclerotia,</b> while C.cirrhata does not produce <b>sclerotia.</b> In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark reddish-brown <b>sclerotia</b> that somewhat resembles an appleseed. A microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the <b>sclerotia</b> of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. In contrast, C.cirrhata does not produce <b>sclerotia.</b>|$|E
500|$|The psychoactive {{compounds}} {{are also}} present in the sclerotia: in one analysis, the levels of psilocybin obtained from <b>sclerotia</b> ranged from 0.31% to 0.68% by dry weight, and were dependent upon {{the composition of the}} growth medium. <b>Sclerotia</b> are sold under the nickname [...] "philosopher's stones". They have been described as [...] "resembling congealed muesli", and having a somewhat bitter taste similar to walnut. Strains existing as commercial cultivation kits sold originally in countercultural drug magazines are derived from the original fruit body found by Pollock in Florida. Methods were originally developed by Pollock, and later extended by Stamets in the 1980s to cultivate the <b>sclerotia</b> on a substrate of rye grass (Lolium), and on straw. <b>Sclerotia</b> prepared in this way take from 3 to 12weeks to develop. Pollock was granted a US patent in 1981 for his method of producing <b>sclerotia.</b>|$|E
500|$|Psilocybe tampanensis is a {{very rare}} {{psychedelic}} mushroom in the Strophariaceae family. Originally collected in the wild in a sandy meadow near Tampa, Florida in 1977, the fungus has never again been reported in Florida, but was later collected in Mississippi. The original Florida specimen was cloned, and descendants remain in wide circulation. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) produced by the fungus are yellowish-brown in color with convex to conic caps up to [...] in diameter atop a thin stem up to [...] long. Psilocybe tampanensis forms psychoactive truffle-like <b>sclerotia</b> that are known and sold under the nickname [...] "philosopher's stones". The fruit bodies and <b>sclerotia</b> are consumed by some for recreational or entheogenic purposes. In nature, <b>sclerotia</b> are produced by the fungus {{as a form of}} protection from wildfires and other natural disasters.|$|E
500|$|The stalk is {{hollow and}} {{measures}} [...] tall and [...] thick. It can range in color from slightly yellowish to white. At the stalk's base {{there is usually}} a white to pink volva (a sac-like cup). When immature, the fruit body is encapsulated within the volva present as a peridium (skin-like tissue layer), which ruptures as the mushroom emerges. The volva attaches to the substrate with whitish or pinkish rhizomorphs (thick, cord-like strands of mycelia). Rhizomorphs and mycelia that are exposed to air eventually turn whitish in color; those freshly exposed from their substrate usually quickly turn bluish purple. The fungus produces watery and fleshy <b>sclerotia</b> that range in thickness from 1 to 10mm with a length of up to 30mm. The <b>sclerotia</b> are irregularly convoluted and lobed, and become hard and horny upon drying. <b>Sclerotia</b> have a color reaction similar to that noted for rhizomorphs, and, after long exposure to air, will gradually turn a uniform dark reddish brown. Phallus ravenelli is considered edible if in the egg form, and has a [...] "mild" [...] taste. The foul odor of mature mushrooms would dissuade most from collecting for the table.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Morchella rufobrunnea have been {{cultivated}} under controlled conditions in laboratory-scale experiments. Primordia, which are tiny nodules from which fruit bodies develop, appeared {{two to four}} weeks after the first watering of pre-grown <b>sclerotia</b> incubated at a temperature of [...] and 90% humidity. Mature fruit bodies grew to [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The gills are adnate (bluntly {{fused to}} the stem), {{becoming}} subdecurrent with age (running slightly {{down the length}} of the stem). The gill spacing is close to subdistant, and the individual gills are whitish to pinkish-buff, thin, narrow to moderately broad, and have straight edges. The stem is [...] long by , and roughly equal in width throughout its length. It is slender and thread-like, flexible and pliant, with a dry surface. The top of the stem is covered with scales or a fine whitish powder, while the lower portion has hairs ranging from delicate to coarse. The color of the stem is generally whitish to pinkish-buff, but it darkens after it has been handled. The stem interior is pithy, and becomes hollow with age. The stems originate from a dark reddish-brown sclerotium of variable shape, typically measuring [...] by [...] The surface of the sclerotium is initially smooth, but later becomes wrinkled or furrowed; its interior is solid and white. It is often compared to an apple seed in appearance. Typically, several <b>sclerotia</b> are connected by thin strands of mycelia. The sclerotium is a resting structure that allows to fungus to overwinter in its host. In 1915, William Murrill reported the <b>sclerotia</b> of C.tuberosa to be bioluminescent.|$|E
500|$|The cortex (outer tissue layer) of the {{sclerotium}} {{can be used}} as {{a diagnostic}} character to distinguish between D.racemosa and small white specimens of Collybia. The hyphae of the cortex of D.racemosa are [...] "markedly angular", in comparison with C.cookei (rounded hyphae) and C.tuberosa (elongated hyphae). The cortical layer in D.racemosa [...] has an arrangement that is known as textura epidermoidea—with the hyphae arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Heavy deposits of dark reddish-brown pigment are evident throughout the cortical tissue in or on the walls and the tips of hyphae. The remaining Collybia species, C.cirrhata, does not form <b>sclerotia.</b>|$|E
500|$|Dendrocollybia racemosa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{meaning it}} derives nutrients by breaking down dead or dying tissue. Its fruit bodies grow on the well-decayed remains of agarics, often suspected to be Lactarius or Russula, although the hosts' identities are often unclear {{due to an}} advanced state of decay. A 2006 study used molecular analysis to confirm Russula crassotunicata as a host for D.racemosa. This Russula has a long and persistent decay period, and, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States where the study was conducted, provides a [...] "nearly year-round substrate for mycosaprobic species". Dendrocollybia {{is one of four}} agaric genera obligately associated with growth on the fruit bodies of other fungi, the others being Squamanita, Asterophora, and Collybia. Dendrocollybia is also found less commonly in deep coniferous duff, in groups or small clusters. The fungus can form <b>sclerotia</b> in the mummified host fruit bodies, and may also develop directly from their <b>sclerotia</b> in soil. The fungus is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but rarely collected [...] "probably due to its small size, camouflage color, and tendency to be immersed in its substrate." [...] In North America, where the distribution is restricted to the Pacific Northwest, fruit bodies are found in the late summer to autumn, often after a heavy fruiting period for other mushrooms is over. In Europe, it is known from the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and Belgium. Dendrocollybia racemosa is in the Danish, Norwegian, and British Red Lists.|$|E
500|$|Wynnea americana, {{commonly}} known as moose antlers or rabbit ears, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcoscyphaceae. This uncommon inedible species is recognizable by its spoon-shaped or rabbit-ear shaped fruit bodies that may reach up to [...] tall. It has dark brown and warty outer surfaces, while the fertile spore-bearing inner surface is orange to pinkish to reddish brown. The fruit bodies grow clustered together from large underground masses of compacted mycelia known as <b>sclerotia.</b> In eastern North America, where it is typically found growing in the soil underneath hardwood trees, it is found from New York to Michigan south to Mexico. The species has also been collected from Costa Rica, India, and Japan.|$|E
500|$|Collybia cookei is {{a species}} of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family, and one of three species in the genus Collybia. It is known from Europe, Asia, and North America. The fungus {{produces}} fruit bodies that usually grow on the decomposing remains of other mushrooms, like Meripilus giganteus, Inonotus hispidus, or species of Russula; occasionally fruit bodies are found on rich humus or well-decayed wood. The fungus produces small white mushrooms with caps up to [...] in diameter, supported by thin stems that originate from a yellowish-brown sclerotium. The mushroom is difficult to distinguish from the other two species of Collybia unless an effort is made to examine the <b>sclerotia,</b> which is usually buried in the substrate. The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined.|$|E
500|$|Dendrocollybia racemosa fruit {{bodies have}} small pale grayish-white or grayish-brown caps up to [...] wide, and thin stems up to [...] long. The species is {{characterized}} by its unusual stem, which is covered with short lateral branches. The branches often produce spherical slimeheads of translucent conidiophores on their swollen tips. The conidiophores produce conidia (asexual spores) by mitosis. Because the fungus can rely on either sexual or asexual modes of reproduction, fruit bodies sometimes have reduced or even missing caps. The unusual stems originate from black pea-sized structures called <b>sclerotia.</b> The anamorphic form of the fungus, known as Tilachlidiopsis racemosa, is missing the sexual stage of its life cycle. It can reproduce at relatively low temperatures, an adaptation believed to improve its ability to grow quickly and fruit on decomposing mushrooms.|$|E
500|$|The false {{chanterelle}} has a golden-orange cap up to [...] across, initially convex but becoming funnel-shaped as the mushroom matures. The cap margin, which remains rolled in a little, becomes wavy or lobed in age. The cap surface {{is covered with}} a fine down. The decurrent gill-like structures are narrow and forked, which is a distinctive and distinguishing feature. They are generally a more intense shade of orange than the cap. Along the stipe, the gills may be slightly crimped. The orange stipe is [...] high and [...] thick, and lacks a ring. It often has a darker, brownish, base. The ability to form <b>sclerotia</b> (compact masses of hardened fungal mycelium) has been documented for H.aurantiaca in laboratory studies. These structures contain glycogen and protein that may be used as food reserves during spore germination.|$|E
500|$|Some {{species such}} as the fly agaric and {{psilocybin}} mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain. These {{are the focus of}} academic study and intense debate in the field of ethnomycology. In the 1950s, the American banker Robert Gordon Wasson participated in a Mazatec psilocybin mushroom ritual, and wrote an influential but controversial book claiming that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda was Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric. The mycologist John Ramsbottom however confirmed one element that Allegro later wove into his theory, stating in 1953 that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fresco in the Plaincourault Chapel depicted Amanita muscaria. The ergot fungi whose <b>sclerotia</b> appear as [...] "black grain" [...] in rye and other cereals are implicated in the witch trials of 17th century Norway. The hallucinations caused by ergotism, with visions of Satan as a black dog or cat, caused people to be accused of witchcraft. People in other cultures such as the Aztecs brewed drinks with ergot, which contains alkaloids based on lysergic acid.|$|E
500|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical, thick-walled, 3–6µm in {{diameter}} (although some specimens {{collected in the}} US range from 7.2 to 9.5µm), and are covered with minute spines or warts. The use of scanning electron microscopy has revealed that these ornamentations on the spores are typically 0.95µm long. Spore ultrastructure is distinctive among Calvatia species, and {{has been used to}} help verify taxonomic groupings and confirm the status of species within the genus. The capillitia (coarse, thick-walled hyphae in the gleba) are septate, with branches that are narrowed towards the tips; they are 3–8µm in diameter. When grown in pure culture in the laboratory, C.sculpta is, under certain conditions, able to grow structures called mycelial strands. These are linear aggregates of hyphae whereby older [...] "leading" [...] hyphae become enclosed by coiled layers of newer [...] "tendril" [...] hyphae. Mycelial strands provide a conduit for transporting water and nutrients across non-nutrient material, allowing the fungus to reach new sources of food. They are also implicated in the formation of fruit bodies and <b>sclerotia.</b> The mycelia of C.sculpta can be induced to form mycelial strands when there is a permeable physical barrier between it and the agar substrate. The wide hyphae {{in the center of the}} mycelial strands contain protein-dense structures on their cell walls that are shaped like a torus. Their function is unknown.|$|E

[...] Conidia (1.5-3.5 x 37-70 μm) are hyaline, curved, and mostly five- to seven-celled. [...] <b>Sclerotia</b> or sclerotialike stromatic mycelium, at first white to yellow-brown but later dark brown, may also {{be found on the}} lesions of infected plants.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sclerotium}} (...) , plural <b>sclerotia</b> (...) , is {{a compact}} mass of hardened fungal mycelium containing food reserves. One role of <b>sclerotia</b> is to survive environmental extremes. In some higher fungi such as ergot, <b>sclerotia</b> become detached and remain dormant until favorable growth conditions return. <b>Sclerotia</b> initially were mistaken for individual organisms and described as separate species until Louis René Tulasne proved in 1853 that <b>sclerotia</b> {{are only a}} stage in {{the life cycle of}} some fungi. Further investigation showed that this stage appears in many fungi belonging to many diverse groups. <b>Sclerotia</b> are important in the understanding of the life cycle and reproduction of fungi, as a food source, as medicine (for example, ergotamine), and in agricultural blight management.|$|E
50|$|In the Western world, <b>sclerotia</b> of Psilocybe mexicana are {{sometimes}} cultivated for entheogenic use. The <b>sclerotia</b> {{have a lower}} content of active substances than the actual mushrooms themselves.|$|E
50|$|Examples of fungi {{that form}} <b>sclerotia</b> are ergot (Claviceps purpurea), Polyporus tuberaster, Psilocybe mexicana, Sclerotium delphinii and many species in Sclerotiniaceae. The {{plasmodium}} of slime molds can form <b>sclerotia</b> in adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sclerotia</b> {{resemble}} cleistothecia in {{both their}} morphology and the genetic {{control of their}} development. This suggests the two structures may be homologous, <b>sclerotia</b> being vestigial cleistothecia that lost the capacity to produce ascospores.|$|E

50|$|Black and {{protruding}} <b>sclerotia</b> of C. purpurea {{are well}} known. However, many tropical ergots have brown or greyish <b>sclerotia,</b> mimicking {{the shape of}} the host seed. For this reason, the infection is often overlooked.|$|E
50|$|Many {{methods have}} been created to reduce the growth of agriculturally {{pathogenic}} <b>sclerotia</b> like changes in crop rotation, deeper ploughing and sifting out <b>sclerotia.</b> Fungicides, breeding disease resistance rye and cross breeding natural rye with hybrid rye have reduced C. purpurea infections. Other fungi that produce <b>sclerotia</b> are prominent pathogens for canola crops. These and related fungi are generally controlled {{through the use of}} fungicides and crop rotation.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most plant pathogens, Typhula blight's dormant stage {{occurs in}} the warm {{conditions}} of the summer months as <b>sclerotia,</b> a hard survival structure. Upon favorable conditions of cold, wet weather, the <b>sclerotia</b> germinates grayish white spore-bearing bodies called basidiocarps to produce hyphae with clamp connections. The disease then infects the plant tissue and resumes the disease cycle. It is there where the pathogen produces <b>sclerotia</b> to survive the next summer months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sclerotia</b> {{are often}} {{composed}} of a thick, dense shell with thick and dark cells and a core of thin colorless cells. <b>Sclerotia</b> are rich in hyphae emergency supplies, especially oil. They contain a very small amount of water (5-10%) and can survive in a dry environment for several years without losing the ability to grow. In most cases, the sclerotium consists exclusively of fungal hyphae, whereas some may consist partly of fungal hyphae plexus and partly in between tissues of the substrate (ergot, Sclerotinia). In favorable conditions, <b>sclerotia</b> germinate to form fruiting bodies (Basidiomycetes) or mycelium with conidia (in imperfect fungi). <b>Sclerotia</b> sizes can range from {{a fraction of a}} millimeter to a few tens of centimeters as, for example Laccocephalum mylittae, which has <b>sclerotia</b> with diameters up to 30 cm and weighing up to 20 kg.|$|E
