Evidence of bronze-casting and iron-smelting were found. Fine jewellery made from bronze bone have also been found showing a high degree of craftsmanship. Files and hammer heads were examined by metallography which showed that carbon compositions were found to be generally low. In 1905 an early British tin coin was discovered, believed to be from the 1st century A.D, which was sent to the British Museum. Various other objects from the excavation are also help by the British Museum.|$|E

50|$|Some angle {{grinders}}, most tile saws, {{and some}} grinders for <b>sharpening</b> <b>blades</b> used in woodworking are wet grinders. The fluid helps with lubrication of the cutting process and with cooling to avoid cracking or damaging {{the cutting tool}} or the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Some {{sandstones}} {{are resistant}} to weathering, yet are easy to work. This makes sandstone a common building and paving material including in asphalt concrete. However, some {{that have been used}} in the past, such as the Collyhurst sandstone used in North West England, have been found less resistant, necessitating repair and replacement in older buildings. Because of the hardness of individual grains, uniformity of grain size and friability of their structure, some types of sandstone are excellent materials from which to make grindstones, for <b>sharpening</b> <b>blades</b> and other implements. Non-friable sandstone {{can be used to make}} grindstones for grinding grain, e.g., gritstone.|$|E

50|$|The {{use of a}} <b>sharpened</b> <b>blade</b> for the {{slaughtering}} {{of livestock}} has been practiced throughout history.

50|$|The war hatchet is {{very similar}} in design to a battle axe and was {{influenced}} by the axes that the European settlers used. The hatchet consisted of a <b>sharpened</b> <b>blade,</b> made from iron or stone, attached {{to the end of a}} handle.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 20th century, {{the ancient}} traditions were commercialized and westernized. Over time the {{performing}} implement has changed. The wooden handle gradually lengthened and the blade got shorter. Eventually, the exposed portion {{was part of}} the handle. Some of the moves performed in shows now are more modern and flashy than traditional battle preparations. As such, they are often performed at accelerated speeds. It is probable that the danger of <b>sharpened</b> <b>blades</b> and the demand for multiple daily shows by top performers has caused the <b>sharpened</b> <b>blade</b> to disappear entirely from commercial performances. Now, when one travels to Hawaii, it is quite common to see commercial Fire Knife Dancing performed with wooden or aluminum poles wrapped in towels. These performances are often part of Luau festivities or Polynesian shows that include Poi Ball performances.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more acute}} the blade the more easily it will dull. As the blade is thin {{there is little}} {{material}} to remove from the fine edge before the edge is worn away to a thicker section. Also, thin blades will fracture easily. Thin edges are also very weak and the edge can literally roll over when force is applied it to and form something like the bottom part of a letter [...] "J". Straight edge razors, for example, are frequently stropped not to grind metal from the edge but to straighten the edge. <b>Sharpening</b> <b>blades</b> by grinding the edge thin {{to such a degree}} that a burr results on the side of the edge away from the stone. This burr, like the rolled edge of a straight edge razor or other knife, can be felt by running the finger from the spine to the edge and it will only be felt on the curled side. Steeling, whether on a grooved or smooth steel or even very gentle pressure on a curved stone, can straighten this roll as can stropping.|$|E

50|$|An insulation-displacement contact (IDC), {{also known}} as insulation-piercing contact (IPC), is an {{electrical}} connector designed {{to be connected to}} the conductor(s) of an insulated cable by a connection process which forces a selectively <b>sharpened</b> <b>blade</b> or blades through the insulation, bypassing the need to strip the conductors of insulation before connecting. When properly made, the connector blade cold-welds to the conductor, making a theoretically reliable gas-tight connection.|$|R

50|$|Dhabīḥah (ذَبِيْحَة) is a {{prescribed}} method of ritual animal slaughter; {{it does not}} apply to most aquatic animals. The animal must be slaughtered while mentioning the name of God (Allah in Arabic). According to some fatwas, the animal must be slaughtered specifically by a Muslim; however, other fatwas dispute this, ruling that, according to verse 5:5 of the Qurʼan, an animal properly slaughtered by People of the Book is halal.

5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, seeing that the {{traditional}} but unwieldy alpenstock might be a useful aid to climb steep slopes of snow or ice, Victorian alpinists fastened a <b>sharpened</b> <b>blade</b> (the pick) to the top of the alpenstock; this was used to provide positive aid. On the opposite [...] side, a flattened blade was placed (the adze), which was used for cutting steps in the snow or ice, an essential technique for moving over steep icy slopes before the advent of the crampon.|$|R

These modern sasumata are often made of aluminum, without the <b>sharpened</b> <b>blades</b> and spikes found on their medieval counterparts, they have been marketed to schools due to a growing fear of classroom invasions.

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{thrusting}} knives {{have been described as}} daggers, including knives that feature only a single cutting edge, such as the European rondel dagger or the Persian pesh-kabz, or, in some instances, no cutting edge at all, such as the stiletto of the Renaissance. However, in the last hundred years or so, in most contexts, a dagger has certain definable characteristics, including a short blade with a sharply tapered point, a central spine or fuller, and usually two cutting edges sharpened the full length of the blade, or nearly so. Most daggers also feature a full crossguard to keep the hand from riding forwards onto the <b>sharpened</b> <b>blade</b> edges.|$|R

Nas atividades desenvolvidas para condução das pastagens, a limpeza é considerada uma das tarefas mais importantes. Nesse contexto, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo estudar os órgãos ativos de uma roçadora, avaliando os oito tipos de componentes atuantes na máquina: lâmina nova com e sem afiamento, com e sem defletor; lâmina usada com e sem defletor; correntes com e sem defletor, substituindo as lâminas.
