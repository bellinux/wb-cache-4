40|$|In Bilcare Ltd. v. M/S The Supreme Industries Ltd., the Delhi High Court affirmed a {{lower court}} order vacating ex parte {{injunctions}} against an alleged infringer of a patent, rejecting arguments that the patent should be presumed valid even though the patent {{was the subject of}} opposition proceedings. In KSR International, Inc. v. Teleflex Co., the U. S. Supreme Court reversed the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s long-standing interpretation of Section 103 of the Patent Act, i. e., that a challenger seeking to prove invalidity must demonstrate a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art references. These cases reveal important insights (within varying procedural and substantive legal contexts) into statutory and judicial presumptions of validity that result from the grant of patents by administrative agencies. The article explains how such presumptions relate to evidence and proof rather than to the weight accorded to legal judgments. Using Bilcare as a reference, the article suggests that opportunities to present evidence challenging validity should be provided even in preliminary relief contexts, and discusses concerns that arise when validity is challenged in both administrative and judicial systems. The article then describes how the KSR decision adopted substantive legal rules for obviousness that supersede the <b>statutory</b> <b>presumption</b> of validity, shift the burdens of production and persuasion, and (for some inventions) limit the scope of relevant evidence that can be used by patent holders to prove non-obviousness.

These additional perspectives were supplied by several experts and committed professionals akin to those who participated in the Think Tank. We wish to thank all of the commentators for thoughtful analyses of what did, and did not, happen at the Think Tank. Each commentary provided a frame of reference useful to us, as the Reporters, in reflecting upon what was achieved and what tasks remain. Thirty-two professionals, representing a wide variety of disciplines and expertise, convened to discuss the issues surrounding shared parenting practices and policy. We reached consensus points, as noted in the Final Report and discussed in the commentaries. We also left some of the thorniest issues for subsequent discussion and work, much to the disappointment of some commentators. Reading through the commentaries, we felt a bit of déjà vu. The same divisions that made consensus so elusive at the Think Tank are evident in the nature and breadth of perspectives expressed in the commentaries.

Two legal practitioners writing together espoused no presumption generally, but would consider shared decision making in specific situations.

40|$|Our {{criminal}} justice system is founded upon a belief that one is innocent until proven guilty. This belief is what foists the burden of proving a person’s guilt upon the government and belies a <b>statutory</b> <b>presumption</b> in favor of allowing a defendant to remain free pending trial at the federal level. Though there are certainly circumstances in which a federal magistrate judge may—and sometimes must—remand a defendant to jail pending trial, it is well-settled that pretrial detention itself inherently prejudices {{the quality of a}} person’s defense. In some cases, a defendant’s pretrial conditions become so onerous that they become punitive and even burden his or her constitutional rights, including the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and the effective assistance of counsel, respectively. Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) consist of a variety of confinement conditions that the attorney general may impose on an individual defendant at his or her discretion. Their purpose is to severely restrict communication by defendants with the demonstrated capacity to endanger the public through their third-party contacts. Although Congress did not create SAMs with terrorists in mind, their use in terrorism cases is almost routine. This Note explores the constitutional implications of SAMs when they are imposed on terrorism defendants who are detained pending trial. Specifically, my interview with criminal defense attorney Joshua Dratel sheds critical light on the deleterious impact SAMs have on a defendant’s Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Circuit’s {{standard}} for proving invalidity of patent claims is clear. The Federal Circuit always requires {{clear and convincing}} evidence to prove that a patent claim is invalid. The rationale behind this standard, however, is unconvincing. There are significant reasons {{to believe that the}} Patent Office rarely considers the most relevant prior art and that, instead, alleged infringers often find prior art that is more relevant than the prior art considered by the Patent Office. It defies logic to apply the clear and convincing burden where the Patent Office considered only prior art that is less relevant than the prior art asserted in litigation. And while the Federal Circuit relies upon 35 U. S. C. § 282 as dictating the clear and convincing burden of proof, the statute includes no such burden. Indeed, every other circuit court of appeals has indicated that the <b>statutory</b> <b>presumption</b> of validity only requires a presumption that the Patent Office correctly ruled upon the evidence in front of it - not that the Patent Office considered the most relevant prior art or that it - illogically - correctly ruled upon evidence that it did not even consider. To encourage the disclosure of relevant prior art to the Patent Office, to increase patent quality, to ensure that patents serve their Constitutional purpose of rewarding inventors for disclosing discoveries, and to reduce transaction costs associated with ultimately invalid patents, the clear and convincing burden of proving invalidity should be replaced with a preponderance burden when litigation involves unconsidered, material prior art...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various <b>statutory</b> <b>presumptions</b> surrounding bail {{and the risk of}} bail refusal. Method: A total 37, 165 cases where defendants were either granted or refused bail by a Local Court were analysed to determine what impact the presumptions surrounding bail had on the risk of bail refusal. Controls included in the analysis were age; gender; Indigenous status of the defendant; number of concurrent offences; the number of prior criminal convictions; whether the offender had a previous conviction for a breach offence; the number of days between the date of first court appearance and the date of finalisation; whether the defendant had legal representation in the current case; and the plea in the current case at time of finalisation. Results: After adjusting for the effects of other factors, the risk of bail refusal was found to be higher for those charged with offences where there was a presumption against bail or where bail should only be granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The risk of bail was also elevated for those with a larger number of prior convictions and/or concurrent offences. Three main anomalies were noted. Firstly, nearly half of those falling into the ‘exceptional circumstance’ category were on bail at their final court appearance. Secondly, factors such as prior criminal record, number of concurrent offences and delay in finalising a case, exert a much stronger influence on the risk of bail refusal than the presumptions surrounding bail. Thirdly, the bail refusal risk was higher for those charged with offences where there was no presumption for or against bail than for those charged with offences involving a presumption against bail. Conclusion: The NSW Bail Act may need some simplification and clarification...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to assess the impact}} and influence of South Africa's Constitutional Court {{in the first two years}} of our democracy. To achieve this objective, some of the definitive and controversial cases already decided by the Court have been selected and analysed in an attempt to glean some jurisprudential perspectives of the Court. It focuses on the work of the Court over the past two years. It deals with the evolution of South Africa into a democracy, and analyzes the South African legal system prior to the beginning of the process of transformation. It briefly surveys the evolution of our constitutional system, dating back from the pre- 1910 colonial period and provides a broad outline of the legal system in the post-April 1994 period of transformation. It analyzes the Court from the point of view of, inter alia, its composition, jurisdiction and powers. The Court is also contrasted with courts in other jurisdictions which exercise full judicial review. The Court's emerging jurisprudence is examined. A review is made, inter alia, of the Court's understanding of, and approach to, the questions of the values underpinning the post-apartheid society and its constitutional system, and constitutional interpretation. The right against self-incrimination and South African company law and the two relevant Constitutional Court cases are discussed. The collection of evidence by the State and the constitutionality of provisions relating to search and seizure and the taking of fingerprints are looked into. The Court's approach to <b>statutory</b> <b>presumptions</b> and criminal prosecutions; some aspects of our appeals procedures; an accused's right to be assisted by a lawyer at state expense; the question of a fair trial and access to information; capital punishment; corporal punishment; committal to prison for debt; and the certification of constitutions is analyzed. Two of the cases in which the provinces clashed with the national government on the distribution of posers between provinces and the national government are discussed. The conclusion is that the Court has, overall, hitherto acquitted itself well in the handling of particularly the controversial quasi-political questions that arose in the cases it has decided.

40|$|New state-sanctioned family units {{headed by}} couples in {{committed}} relationships {{are on the}} rise. They include marriages encompassing same sex couples, civil unions, and domestic partnerships. These new family units can originate in state statutes or in judicial decisions. The pace of change is so fast that new units occasionally replace units only recently recognized, as when same sex marriages replace civil unions or domestic partnerships. U. S. Supreme Court precedents permit broad governmental discretion in sanctioning new families and in recognizing parentage therein. Yet such discretion is limited by constitutionally-recognized parental rights and interests when children are born of sex. At times states can and do deny parental status under law at birth to biological fathers. Differences in parentage laws will likely continue for some time. When same sex marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships are expanded or created, the new family units typically are deemed equal to, or the same as, longstanding opposite sex marriages. However, when there are children born of sex, equality and sameness are impossible. Same sex couples simply cannot produce children through intrafamily intercourse as can opposite sex couples. Yet, extrafamily intercourse by those in same sex, as well as opposite sex, families can produce children. Given the policies of equality and sameness, should all children conceived through adultery similarly be deemed born into sanctioned family units? That is, should there always operate a presumption of parentage as now typically operates for a husband in an opposite sex marriage? If so, are new written laws needed since the existing parentage presumptions for husbands usually require the possibility of genetic ties – an impossibility in same sex settings? Further, are there limits on any equality between same and opposite sex couples? Finally, are additional laws beyond parentage presumptions at birth needed for children born of sex to same sex couples? This article posits that explicit <b>statutory</b> <b>presumptions</b> are needed for children born to state-sanctioned same sex female couples although there cannot be genetic ties in both mates. Further, it proposes that current voluntary parentage acknowledgment processes, now operating for men who prompt children born of sex to married and unmarried women, be expanded to allow certain same sex male mates to become legal parents at birth, or sooner, to children born of sex into their family units...|$|R
40|$|Although the English courts {{appear to}} have assumed that a wife will not be prejudiced in raising a defence to {{possession}} of the family home based on her husband’s undue influence, regardless {{of the nature of}} the proceedings brought by the lender, it is evident that, in the majority of cases, this will not prevent the ultimate sale of the mortgaged property. In particular, where the application for a sale is made after one year from the vesting of the bankrupt’s estate in the trustee in bankruptcy, the court is to assume that the creditor’s interests prevail over all other considerations in the absence of exceptional circumstances. Given the practice of most lenders to wait until the expiry of the one year moratorium in order to avail themselves of the <b>statutory</b> <b>presumption</b> that the interests of creditors should prevail, the court will be bound in most cases to order a sale especially as the term “exceptional circumstances” in s. 335 A of the Insolvency Act 1986 has been given a very limited meaning in the case law. Only in extreme cases, it seems, will the wife’s voice prevail over that of the lender. This article, therefore, seeks to examine the court’s attitude to applications for a sale of the family home brought after one year of the vesting of the property in the debtor’s trustee in bankruptcy. It also considers whether arguments based on the wife’s right to respect for her home under Article 8 in Schedule 1 to the Human Rights Act 1998 have altered judicial attitudes in balancing the competing interests of the wife and her bankrupt husband’s creditors...|$|E
40|$|In December 1982 the Criminal Law Reform Committee {{presented}} to the Minister of Justice a comprehensive report on bail and made many recommendations {{for changes in the}} current law and practice in this area. The primary recommendation of the Committee is that in a majority of circumstances there should be a <b>statutory</b> <b>presumption</b> in favour of bail. The circumstances in which this presumption will operate and the factors {{to be taken into account}} in a decision as to whether it is rebutted will be discussed in detail. Although this writer has been critical of some of the detail of the proposed reform, and the implementation of it may require attention to be given to certain matters, it is undoubtedly capable of giving rise to a far more coherent and balanced law of bail than we currently have. The inclusion of the presumption in favour of bail, if it is preserved and observed, indicates a desirable shift in favour of preserving the rights of the accused person who has not yet been convicted. If nothing more comes from the Report than a recognition that these rights are not properly protected at present, the Report will have been a most valuable document. The scheme for the review of bail decisions may also, if adequate reasons are insisted on, allow for a relatively equitable and speedy procedure. It is to be hoped that the Government will see fit to include bail reform in its legislative programme in the near future; and that the strong points in the Report are not reduced or removed to demonstrate the Government's apparent wish to be seen as "getting tough" with those involved in the criminal justice system...|$|E
40|$|It is contended in {{this thesis}} that the {{introduction}} of a legal regime with a rateless structure, subject only to market forces and a rebuttable <b>statutory</b> <b>presumption</b> as to where the rate line of conscience should be drawn, can provide a solution if the rate charged by pawnbrokers is to be regulated. The thesis also shows that a uniform pawn ticket issued as a negotiable document of title, and transferable by special indorsement, can provide a solution to problems caused by current activities related to pawn ticket transactions. After having identified the legal issues requiring attention in the introductory chapter, and after a short historical review of the development of institutional pawnshops and the nature of usury law, the thesis takes a comparative approach to the question, examining the legal protection available to consumer users of pawnshops in France, the Netherlands, Germany, England, USA, Australia, Norway, Denmark and Finland, in order to cast the divergent interests into bold relief and suggest how those interests can be reconciled. The thesis will then concentrate on the competing policy arguments for and against usury control. The parties’ needs addressed and the methods utilized by legislation to meet such needs are identified and evaluated. The material differences distinguishing pawn tickets from other documents and instruments relating to personal property are next highlighted, and legislation with possible application to pawn tickets canvassed. The inadequacies of existing law are analysed in detail, and certain assumptions regarding the applicability of existing law are challenged. The thesis goes on to consider the question, drawing on historical and comparative experience, whether the law could be developed to control the exercise of pawn ticket functions. The findings of the study are then summarized and a series of recommendations made...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Article is to discuss common {{mistakes}} in the current debate on outsourcing authority. The first mistake in the debate on outsourcing authority is about the protagonists. To focus solely {{on the fact that}} some justices espouse this approach, while others do not, distorts the true picture of the rich debate that is ongoing at the bar, the bench, the academy, and beyond. Mistaking the voices in the debate will distort what is at issue in the discussion. The reality is much more complex. There is a groundswell of opposition to this trend from various corners and for a variety of reasons. It {{would be a mistake to}} discount the importance of this debate based on antipathy toward one or more justices or their constitutional persuasion. The second mistake in the debate is about the novelty of constitutional comparativism. Many proponents feel threatened by recent criticism of this movement and they seek comfort in the embrace of history. But those who maintain that there is nothing novel about the current rage of constitutional comparativism ignore the numerous ways in which history is not an accurate guide to present trend toward comparativism, including: (1) the manner in which foreign authority is cited; (2) the quantity and quality of foreign and international authority; (3) the move toward global constitutionalism and international human rights; (4) the concerted effort to lobby justices to become internationalists; and (5) the willingness of some justices to engage in foreign diplomacy. A third mistake in the debate on outsourcing authority is to fail to distinguish between statutory and constitutional interpretation. Some proponents of constitutional comparativism note approvingly the longstanding tradition of interpreting statutes consistent with international norms. A proper appreciation for outsourcing authority would make a sharp distinction between this relatively uncontroversial practice of importing international law through <b>statutory</b> <b>presumptions,</b> and the quite controversial practice of interpreting constitutional liberties consistent with international law. The final mistake in the debate on outsourcing authority is to assume that the outcome of constitutional comparativism will be an expansion of individual liberties. That has not proven to be the case in the United States, and there is no reason to assume it will be so in the future. It is a mistake to assume that advocates of constitutional comparativism will be limited to those who wish to expand constitutional liberties. The Court has not, should not, and will not rely on foreign authority as a one-way ratchet that only broadens constitutional liberties...|$|R
40|$|In this comment, we {{disagree}} with the Court of Appeal’s decision to disqualify two newly elected members of the Legislative Council from office. While we accept that the judiciary is empowered under Art 104 of the Basic Law to determine whether an oath taken is valid, it is our view that after the oath is judicially deemed invalid, it {{should be left to}} the President of LegCo to determine whether the lawmaker is to be denied a second chance of retaking the oath and be disqualified. First, the CA held that para 2 (3) of the relevant Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress “automatically disqualified [the pair of lawmakers] from assuming their offices”, but the term “automatic” or “automatically” is found nowhere in the Interpretation. The Interpretation only uses the term “forthwith”, which means “without delay”, and it would not be inconsistent with the Interpretation for the CA to punt the issue over to the President to proceed with the disqualification expeditiously. Second, reading ss 19 and 21 of the Oaths and Declarations Ordinance (Cap 11) together, we argue that a lawmaker can only be disqualified for declining to take the requisite oath if he had not taken a valid oath after a reasonable time had elapsed. Therefore, the lawmaker is not disqualified “automatically” on the first occasion where he declined to take the requisite oath. Third, the principle of non-intervention in the internal process of LegCo applies herein. Whilst the courts have jurisdiction to determine whether the President has the general power to grant or deny a newly elected LegCo member the opportunity of retaking the requisite oath after the original attempt was judicially deemed invalid, the courts will not exercise jurisdiction to determine the specific occasion or manner of exercise of this power by the President. Finally, if the Interpretation is treated as a piece of legislation instead of a judicial decision, and if Hong Kong courts were to approach this legislation using common law principles of <b>statutory</b> interpretation, the <b>presumption</b> against retrospectivity of legislation applies; and on the facts of this case, this Interpretation would not operate retrospectively to events that predated its announcement. postprin...|$|R
