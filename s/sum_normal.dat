40|$|AbstractGiven a {{fuzzy logic}} system, {{how can we}} {{determine}} the membership functions {{that will result in}} the best performance? If we constrain the membership functions to a specific shape (e. g., triangles or trapezoids) then each membership function can be parameterized by a few variables and the membership optimization problem can be reduced to a parameter optimization problem. The parameter optimization problem can then be formulated as a nonlinear filtering problem. In this paper we solve the nonlinear filtering problem using H∞ state estimation theory. However, the membership functions that result from this approach are not (in general) <b>sum</b> <b>normal.</b> That is, the membership function values do not add up to one at each point in the domain. We therefore modify the H∞ filter with the addition of state constraints so that the resulting membership functions are <b>sum</b> <b>normal.</b> Sum normality may be desirable not only for its intuitive appeal but also for computational reasons in the real time implementation of fuzzy logic systems. The methods proposed in this paper are illustrated on a fuzzy automotive cruise controller and compared to Kalman filtering based optimization...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the multiobjective {{co-design}} problem of optimal valve placement and operation in water distribution networks, addressing the minimization of average pressure and pressure variability indices. The presented formulation considers nodal pressures, pipe flows and valve locations as decision variables, where binary variables {{are used to}} model the placement of control valves. The resulting optimization problem is a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem. As conflicting objectives, average zone pressure and pressure variability can not be simultaneously optimized. Therefore, we present the concept of Pareto optima sets to investigate the trade-offs between the two conflicting objectives and evaluate the best compromise. We focus on the approximation of the Pareto front, {{the image of the}} Pareto optima set through the objective functions, using the weighted <b>sum,</b> <b>normal</b> boundary intersection and normalized normal constraint scalarization techniques. Each of the three methods relies on the solution of a series of single-objective optimization problems, which are mixed integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) in our case. For the solution of each single-objective optimization problem, we implement a relaxation method that solves a sequence of nonlinear programs (NLPs) whose stationary points converge to a stationary point of the original MINLP. The relaxed NLPs have a sparse structure that come from the sparse water network graph constraints. In solving the large number of relaxed NLPs, sparsity is exploited by tailored techniques to improve the performance of the algorithms further and render the approaches scalable for large scale networks. The features of the proposed scalarization approaches are evaluated using a published benchmarking network model...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a numerical method {{for determining the}} stress distribution {{in the interior of}} a three-dimensional body using experimentally determined surface stresses, and the interior displacements from surface displacements.
