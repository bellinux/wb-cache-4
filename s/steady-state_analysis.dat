The proposed thermal-via allocation minimizes the time-integral of temperature violation, and is solved by a sequential quadratic programming algorithm with use of sensitivities from the macromodel.

40|$|Ensemble and reduced-rank {{approaches}} to prediction and assimilation rely on low-dimensional approximations of the estimation error covariances. Here stability {{properties of the}} forecast analysis cycle for linear, time-independent systems are used to identify factors that cause the <b>steady-state</b> <b>analysis</b> error covariance to admit a low-dimensional representation. A useful measure of forecast/analysis cycle stability is the bound malrix, {{a function of the}} dynamics, observation operator and assimilation method. Upper and lower estimates for thesteady-state analysis error covariance matrix eigenvalues are derived from the bound matrix. The estimates generalize to time-dependent systems. If much of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>analysis</b> error variance is due to a few dominant modes, the leading eigenvectors of the bound matrix approximate those of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>analysis</b> error covariance matrix. The analytical results are illustrated in two numerical examples where the Kalmalt filter is carried to steady state. The first example uses the dynamics of a generaJizcd advection equation exhibiting non-modal transient growth. Failure to observe growing modes leads to increased <b>steady-state</b> <b>analysis</b> error variances. Leading eigenvectors of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>analysis</b> error covariance matrix are well approximated by leading eigenvectors of the bound matrix. The second example uses the dynamics of a damped baroclinic wave modelo The leading eigenvectors of a lowest-order approximation of the bound matrix are shown to approximate well the leading eigenvectors of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>analysis</b> error covariancc matrix.

40|$|All {{existing}} {{methods for}} thermal-via allocation {{are based on}} a <b>steady-state</b> thermal <b>analysis</b> and may lead to excessive number of thermal vias. This paper develops an accurate and efficient thermal-via allocation considering temporally and spatially variant thermal-power. The transient temperature is calculated using macromodel by a structured and parameterized model reduction, which generates temperature sensitivity with respect to thermalvia density. By defining a thermal-violation integral based on the transient temperature, a nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to allocate thermal-vias and minimize thermal violation integral. This optimization problem is transformed into a sequence of subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation, and each subproblem is solved by quadratic programming using sensitives from the macromodel. Experiments show that compared to the existing method using <b>steady-state</b> thermal <b>analysis,</b> our method is 126 X faster to obtain the temperature profile, and reduces the number of thermal vias by 2. 04 X under the same temperature bound...|$|R

If the variance estimator is strongly consistent, fixed-width confidence interval construction is valid for large samples. It has long been known that the spectral variance estimator of <b>steady-state</b> simulation output <b>analysis</b> is consistent in the mean-square sense. Here, we provide strong consistency of this estimator, thereby justifying fixed-width confidence interval construction for the spectral method. A characterization of spectral density function estimators is also introduced. This characterization provides insight into the relation between spectral methods and overlapping batch means-type variance estimators. Finally, some of the mathematical conditions provide qualitative insight into the relation between the process correlation and certain parameters of spectral methods. simulation, <b>steady-state</b> output <b>analysis,</b> spectral variance estimation, strong consistency...|$|R
