50|$|In general, the {{revision}} cycle for AJCC TNM staging {{has historically been}} 5 to 7 years. This approach provides sufficient time for implementation of changes in clinical management and cancer registry operations and for relevant examination and discussion of data supporting changes in <b>staging.</b> <b>Table</b> 1.1 shows the publication year for each version of the AJCC TNM system up through this current AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition was used for cancer patients diagnosed on or after January 1, 2010. The 8th Edition published in this manual is effective for cancer patients diagnosed on or after January 1, 2018. The AJCC recognizes that rapidly evolving evidence may necessitate more frequent updates of AJCC TNM staging in the future, and anticipates providing more frequent updates for disease sites as new and validated evidence becomes available. Moreover, the AJCC also recognizes that as clinical cancer care continues to evolve and incorporates factors that {{are not used to}} determine stage but that provide key information on specific outcomes and/or expected benefit from specific therapies, new, validated clinical tools will be needed to help clinicians efficiently and accurately use these important data to enhance clinical care (see Anatomic Staging and the Evolving Use of Nonanatomic Factors).|$|E

40|$|Vertebral {{development}} patterns {{have been}} well characterised in the Paleozoic "lepospondyls" and "labyrinthodonts", {{as well as in}} modern amniotes, frogs and caecilians. Each of those groups consistently develop either the neural arches before the centra or the centra before neural arches. Preliminary studies confirmed that members of the Urodela exhibit both developmental patterns. To understand if there is any consistency in patterns of vertebral development within and between families, as well as to investigate the distribution of patterns within the order, 120 salamander larvae from the ten living salamander families were cleared, stained and examined for osteological development. In order to provide a basis of comparison between different developmental stages observed in different families, a <b>staging</b> <b>table</b> was constructed.

40|$|International audienceEvery model species {{requires}} its own developmental table. Astyanax mexicanus, a teleost fish comprising both sighted {{river and}} blind cave populations, {{is becoming more}} and more important in the field of developmental and evolutionary biology. As such, a developmental <b>staging</b> <b>table</b> is increasingly necessary, particularly since comparative analysis of early developmental events is widely employed by researchers. We collected freshly spawned embryos from surface fish and Pachón cavefish populations. Embryos were imaged every 10 - 12 [*]min during the first day of development, and less frequently in the following days. The results provide an illustrated comparison of selected developmental stages from one cell to hatching of these two populations. The two morphs show an essentially synchronous development regarding major events such as epiboly, neurulation, somitogenesis, heart beating, or hatching. We also present data on particular morphological characters appearing during larval development, such as eye size, yolk regression, swim bladder, and fin development. Some details about the development of F 1 Pachón cave×surface hybrids are also given. Comparisons are made with Danio rerio (zebrafish) development...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Pipa is a Neotropical genus {{of frogs}} that dwell in {{freshwater}} environments. It includes four species that lack free-swimming larvae (P. aspera, P. arrabali, P. pipa, and P. snethlageae) and three with tadpoles (P. carvalhoi, P. myersi, and P. parva). Developmental tables {{such as the}} one proposed by Nieuwkoop and Faber might be useful for Pipa species with tadpoles. However, for the other Pipa species, to determine stages by this table or by any of the tables already prepared for frogs without tadpoles (e. g., Crinia nimbus, Eleutherodactylus coqui, and Oreobates barituensis) is impossible. By using embryonic, juvenile, and subadult specimens, we generated a <b>staging</b> <b>table</b> for P. arrabali, from the moment limb buds were first observed until birth, based on diagnostic features such as snout-vent length; growth, morphology, and reabsorption of the external tail; growth and differentiation of fore and hind limbs; development of intestine and vent tube; position of the angle of the mouth relative to nostrils and eyes; and color of preserved individuals. Based on these observations, we discuss some noteworthy traits (e. g., posture of hands and feet). We also compare the pattern of development of P. arrabali with that of other anuran species (with and without tadpoles) ...|$|E
40|$|Early {{development}} of flatfishes {{such as the}} summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus (Pleuronectiformes) has not been extensively documented, largely because of a dearth of material; however, the recent expansion of flatfish aquaculture has made embryos of P. dentatus readily available for developmental studies. We divide {{development of}} P. dentatus embryos and larvae into two main periods, pre- and posthatching, and assign stages within each of those primary divisions. Stages from fertilization to hatching loosely follow the general teleost staging scheme suggested by Shardo ([1995] J Morphol 225 : 125 - 167); stages from hatching through metamorphosis are aligned with the series used for Japanese flounder, P. olivaceus (Minami [1982] Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi 48 : 1581 - 1588; Fukuhara [1986] Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi 52 : 81 - 91). Although length, width, and age may serve as approximate indicators of developmental progression in summer flounder, these characteristics are too variable to form the sole basis of a <b>staging</b> <b>table.</b> Therefore, we define stages by morphological criteria drawn from {{the development of the}} jaw apparatus and digestive system, eye migration, and notochord tip flexion. Examination of these morphological features in hatched larvae allows accurate and consistent assessment of developmental stage despite variation in timing and size. The staging scheme for flounder embryonic and larval development presented here should facilitate both experimental and comparative research on summer flounder and other flatfish species.

40|$|Abstract Background Epimorphic {{regeneration}} {{results in}} the restoration of lost tissues and structures from an aggregation of proliferating cells known as a blastema. Among amniotes the most striking example of epimorphic regeneration comes from tail regenerating lizards. Although tail regeneration is often studied {{in the context of}} ecological costs and benefits, details of the sequence of tissue-level events are lacking. Here we investigate the anatomical and histological events that characterize tail regeneration in the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius. Results Tail structure and tissue composition were examined at multiple days following tail loss, revealing a conserved pattern of regeneration. Removal of the tail results in a consistent series of morphological and histological events. Tail loss is followed by a latent period of wound healing with no visible signs of regenerative outgrowth. During this latent period basal cells of the epidermis proliferate and gradually cover the wound. An additional aggregation of proliferating cells accumulates adjacent to the distal tip of the severed spinal cord marking the first appearance of the blastema. Continued growth of the blastema is matched by the initiation of angiogenesis, followed by the re-development of peripheral axons and the ependymal tube of the spinal cord. Skeletal tissue differentiation, corresponding with the expression of Sox 9, and muscle re-development are delayed until tail outgrowth is well underway. Conclusions We demonstrate that tail regeneration in lizards involves a highly conserved sequence of events permitting the establishment of a <b>staging</b> <b>table.</b> We show that tail loss is followed by a latent period of scar-free healing of the wound site, and that regeneration is blastema-mediated. We conclude that the major events of epimorphic regeneration are highly conserved across vertebrates and that a comparative approach is an invaluable biomedical tool for ongoing regenerative research. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The 7 th {{edition of}} AJCC staging manual implicitly states that only T 1 and T 2 lesions that lack {{regional}} lymph node metastasis but have tumor deposit(s) will be classified in addition as N 1 c, {{though it is}} not consistent in that pN 1 c is also an option for pT 3 /T 4 a tumors in the <b>staging</b> <b>table.</b> Nevertheless, in this TNM classification, how to classify tumor deposits (TDs) in colorectal cancer patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TDs simultaneously is still not clear. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the possibility of counting TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in TNM classification and to identify its prognostic value for colorectal cancer patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, 513 cases of colorectal cancer with LNM were reviewed. We proposed a novel pN (npN) category in which TDs were counted as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification. Cancer-specific survival according to the npN or pN category was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors. Harrell's C statistic was used to test the predictive capacity of the prognostic models. The results revealed that the TD was a significant prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses uniformly indicated that the npN category was significantly correlated with prognosis. The results of Harrell's C statistical analysis demonstrated that the npN category exhibited a superior predictive capacity compared to the pN category of the 7 th edition TNM classification. Moreover, we also found no significant prognostic differences in patients with or without TD in the same npN categories. CONCLUSIONS: The counting of TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification system is potentially superior to the classification in the 7 th edition of the TNM staging system to assess prognosis and survival for colorectal cancer patients...|$|E
40|$|Timing {{and pattern}} of {{expression}} of alkaline phosphatase was examined during early differentiation of the 1 st arch skeleton in inbred C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Embryos were recovered between 10 and 18 d of gestation and staged using a detailed <b>staging</b> <b>table</b> of craniofacial development prior to histochemical examination. Expression of alkaline phosphatase is initiated at stage 20. 2 in the plasma membrane of mesenchymal {{cells in the}} distal region of the first arch. Expression is strongest in osteoid (unmineralised bone matrix) and presumptive periosteum at stage 21. 32. Mineralisation begins at stage E 23. Expression {{is present in the}} mineralised bone matrix. Secondary cartilages form in the condylar and angular processes by stage M 24. The cartilaginous cells and surrounding cells in the processes are all alkaline phosphatase-positive and surrounded by the common periosteum, suggesting that progenitor cells of the processes, dentary ramus and secondary cartilages all originate from a common pool. Nonhypertrophied chondrocytes of Meckel's cartilage express alkaline phosphatase at stage M 23. Expression in these chondrocytes is preceded by the expression in their adjacent perichondrium. This is true of chondrocytes in all other cranial cartilages examined. 3 -D reconstruction of expression in Meckel's cartilage also revealed that the chondrocytes of Meckel's cartilage which express alkaline phosphatase and the matrix of which undergoes mineralisation are those surrounded by the alkaline phosphatase-positive dentary ramus. By stage 25, coincident with mineralisation in the distal section of Meckel's cartilage, most chondrocytes are strongly positive. The perichondria of malleus and incus cartilages express alkaline phosphatase at stage M 24. Nonhypertrophied chondrocytes along these perichondria also express alkaline phosphatase. Superficial and deep cells in the dental laminae of incisor and 1 st molar teeth become alkaline phosphatase-positive at the bud stage, stages 21. 16 and 21. 32, respectively. Dental papillae are negative until stage M 24 when alkaline phosphatase expression begins in the dental papillae and follicles of the incisor teeth and the dental follicles of the 1 st molar teeth. The dental papillae of the 1 st molar teeth express alkaline phosphatase at stage 25. Expression in the dental papillae and follicles appears to coincide with cellular differentiation of follicle from papilla. The presumptive squamosal, ectotympanic and gonial membrane bones, lingual oral epithelial cells connected to the dental laminae of the incisor teeth, hair follicle papillae and sheath and surrounding dermis all express alkaline phosphatase in a stage-specific manner...|$|E
