25|$|In October 2010, Soghoian filed a {{complaint}} with the FTC, in which he claimed that Google was intentionally leaking <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> to the sites that users visited after they clicked on a link from the search results page. Two weeks later, a law firm filed a class action lawsuit against Google for this practice. The lawsuit extensively quoted from Soghoian's FTC complaint. In October 2011, Google stopped leaking <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> to the sites that users visited, and then in 2015, the company settled the search query leakage class action lawsuit for 8.5 million dollars.|$|E

In February 2010, the CDC identified influenza cases spiking in the mid-Atlantic {{region of the}} United States.

40|$|Abstract—Opinion {{retrieval}} engines aim {{to retrieve}} documents containing user opinions towards a given <b>search</b> <b>query.</b> Different from traditional IR engines which rank documents by their topic {{relevance to the}} <b>search</b> <b>query,</b> opinion retrieval engines also consider opinion relevance. The result documents should contain user opinions which should be relevant to the <b>search</b> <b>query.</b> In previous opinion retrieval algorithms, opinion relevance scores are usually calculated by using very straightforward approaches, e. g., the distance between <b>search</b> <b>query</b> and opinion-carrying words. These approaches may cause two problems: 1) opinions in the returned result documents are irrelevant to the search query; 2) opinions related to the <b>search</b> <b>query</b> are not well identified. In this paper, we propose {{a new approach to}} deal with this topicopinion mismatch problem. We leverage the idea of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. Both queries and documents ar...|$|R

Digital epidemiologists at the lab's Information Systems and Modeling group are using clinical surveillance data, Google <b>search</b> <b>queries,</b> census data, Wikipedia, and even tweets to create a system that could predict epidemics. The team is using data from Brazil as its model; Brazil was notably threatened by the Zika virus as it prepared to host the Summer Olympics in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Google Flu Trends {{tries to}} avoid privacy {{violations}} by only aggregating millions of anonymous <b>search</b> <b>queries,</b> without identifying individuals that performed the search. Their search log contains the IP {{address of the}} user, {{which could be used}} to trace back to the region where the search query is originally submitted. Google runs programs on computers to access and calculate the data, so no human is involved in the process. Google also implemented the policy to anonymize IP address in their search logs after 9 months.|$|E

Pornographic fan works of online multiplayer games like Overwatch has always been relatively common: according to Pornhub vice-president Cory Price, the most popular video-game related <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> on Pornhub were Minecraft, Halo, Clash of Clans, and Call of Duty.

40|$|Access to {{knowledge}} about common human goals {{has been found}} critical for realizing the vision of intelligent agents acting upon user intent on the web. Yet, the acquisition of knowledge about common human goals represents a major challenge. In a departure from existing approaches, this paper investigates a novel resource for knowledge acquisition: The utilization of <b>search</b> <b>query</b> logs for this task. By relating goals contained in <b>search</b> <b>query</b> logs with goals contained in existing commonsense knowledge bases such as ConceptNet, we aim {{to shed light on}} the usefulness of <b>search</b> <b>query</b> logs for capturing knowledge about common human goals. The main contribution of this paper consists of insights generated from an empirical study comparing common human goals contained in two large <b>search</b> <b>query</b> logs (AOL and Microsoft Research) with goals contained in the commonsense knowledge base ConceptNet. The paper sketches ways how goals from <b>search</b> <b>query</b> logs could be used to address the goal acquisition and goal coverage problem related to commonsense knowledge bases...|$|R

25|$|The {{idea behind}} Google Flu Trends (GFT) is that, by {{monitoring}} millions of users’ health tracking behaviors online, {{the large number}} of Google <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> gathered can be analyzed to reveal if there is the presence of flu-like illness in a population. Google Flu Trends compared these findings to a historic baseline level of influenza activity for its corresponding region and then reports the activity level as either minimal, low, moderate, high, or intense. These estimates have been generally consistent with conventional surveillance data collected by health agencies, both nationally and regionally.|$|E
25|$|Inspired {{by these}} early, {{encouraging}} experiences, Google launched Google Flu Trends in 2008. More flu-related searches {{are taken to}} indicate higher flu activity. The results closely match CDC data, and lead it by - 1–2 weeks. The results appeared in Nature. More recently, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear approaches to influenza modelling from Google <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> have been proposed. Extending Google's work researchers from the Intelligent Systems Laboratory (University of Bristol, UK) created Flu Detector; an online tool which based on Information Retrieval and Statistical Analysis methods uses the content of Twitter to nowcast flu rates in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Windows <b>Search</b> <b>queries</b> are {{specified}} in Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) which supports not only simple text searches but provides advanced property-based query operations as well. AQS defines certain keywords {{which can be}} used to refine the search query, such as specifying boolean operations on searched terms (AND, OR, NOT) as well as to specify further filters based on file metadata or file type. It {{can also be used to}} limit results from specific information stores like regular files, offline files cache, or email stores. File type specific operators are available as well. WDS also supports wildcard prefix matching searches. It also includes several SQL-like operators like GROUP BY. AQS is locale dependent and uses different keywords in international versions of Windows 7.|$|E

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of what motivates humans to perform certain actions is relevant {{for a range of}} research challenges including generating action sequences that implement goals (planning). A first step in this direction is the task of acquiring knowledge about human goals. In this work, we investigate whether <b>Search</b> <b>Query</b> Logs are a viable source for extracting expressions of human goals. For this purpose, we devise an algorithm that automatically identifies queries containing explicit goals such as find home to rent in Florida. Evaluation results of our algorithm achieve useful precision/recall values. We apply the classification algorithm to two large <b>Search</b> <b>Query</b> Logs, recorded by AOL and Microsoft Research in 2006, and obtain a set of ∼ 110. 000 queries containing explicit goals. To study the nature of human goals in <b>Search</b> <b>Query</b> Logs, we conduct qualitative, quantitative and comparative analyses. Our findings suggest that <b>Search</b> <b>Query</b> Logs (i) represent a viable source for extracting human goals, (ii) contain a great variety of human goals and (iii) contain human goals that can be employed to complement existing commonsense knowledge bases. Finally, we illustrate the potential of goal knowledge for addressing following application scenario: to refine and extend commonsense knowledge with human goals from <b>Search</b> <b>Query</b> Logs. This work is relevant for (i) knowledge engineers interested in acquiring human goals from textual corpora and constructing knowledge bases of human goals (ii) researchers interested in studying characteristics of human goals in <b>Search</b> <b>Query</b> Logs...|$|R
2500|$|Companies {{are hired}} {{to watch what}} {{internet}} sites people visit, and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's browsing history.

Moreover, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, <b>search</b> <b>queries,</b> or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer potentially more intrusive details about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality. Further, even without any historical behavioural data, there are a large number of insights which can be generated solely by tracking onsite user interaction like post code, name and local address.|$|E
