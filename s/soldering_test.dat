40|$|Abstract. Fracture {{tests were}} {{performed}} on 20 notched bars fabricated from E 50 solder at low temperature (- 47 °C~- 43 °C). The effect of notch radius, r, and notch depth, d, on fracture mode of E 50 solder was studied. The experimental results demonstrate that cracks initiate {{at the center of}} notch section and the notched bars fracture at the notch section at low temperature. The fracture mode is cleavage fracture and the fracture sections are coarse. Specimens with a sharper notch radius (a smaller r) and a larger notch depth (a smaller d) show poor ductility, but high fracture strength.

In order to develop a direct <b>solder</b> joint-strength <b>testing</b> method that did not require customization for different solder types, bump sizes, specific equipment, or trial-and-error, a combination of two widely used and accepted standards was created. First, solder bumps were made from three types of lead free solder were generated on untreated copper PCB substrates using an in-house fabricated solder bump-on-demand generator, Following this, the newly developed method made use of a polymer epoxy to encapsulate the solder bumps that could then be tested under tension using a high precision universal vertical load machine. ^ The tests produced repeatable and predictable results {{for each of the}} three alloys tested that were in agreement with the relative behavior of the same alloys using other testing methods in the literature.

40|$|The rapid {{advancement}} of interconnect technology has stimulated {{the development of}} alternative printed wiring board (PWB) surface finishes to enhance the solderability of standard copper and solder-coated surfaces. These new finishes are based on either metallic or organic chemistries. As {{part of an ongoing}} solderability study, Sandia National Laboratories has investigated the solder flow behavior of two azole-based organic solderability preservations, immersion Au, immersion Ag, electroless Pd, and electroless Pd/Ni on fine line copper features. The coated substrates were <b>solder</b> <b>tested</b> in the as-fabricated and environmentally-stressed conditions. Samples were processed through an inerted reflow machine. The azole-based coatings generally provided the most effective protection after aging. Thin Pd over Cu yielded the best wetting results of the metallic coatings, with complete dissolution of the Pd overcoat and wetting of the underlying Cu by the flowing solder. Limited wetting was measured on the thicker Pd and Pd over Ni finishes, which were not completely dissolved by the molten solder. The immersion Au and Ag finishes yielded the lowest wetted lengths, respectively. These general differences in solderability were directly attributed to the type of surface finish which the solder came in contact with.

40|$|The {{reliability}} under {{impact loading}} {{is one of}} the major concerns for portable electronic products. With the development of Surface-mount Technology (SMT), the reliability of solder ball joints is a critical issue since the whole device may be losing functions or failed by disconnection of one single solder ball joint between a chip and a PCB. To mimic the real dropping, drop tests are usually used to study the dynamic response of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) as well as the reliability of the solder ball joints in laboratory. In the present thesis, the dynamic responses of the PCB and solder joints are studied by both experiments and Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations with various impact orientations. Although board level drop test {{is one of the}} most useful experiment methods to examine the reliability of solder joints for assembly quality, it is very time consuming. To accelerate the <b>test</b> time for <b>solder</b> joint reliability <b>test,</b> many technologies and tools such as the package level shear/pull tests machines were developed in design and process characterization area. Both the high speed ball shear and pull tests are simulated by ABAQUSTM in the present thesis. Noticed that the strain rates of solder joints in high speed <b>solder</b> ball shear/pull <b>tests</b> are very high, the dynamic properties of the lead free solder alloys (SAC 105 & LF 35) are tested by the mini Split Hopkinson Tensile Bar (mSHTB) technique.
