5000|$|Formed in 2004, {{the band}} first started playing through {{underground}} gigs and with much hard work. It wasn't {{until two years}} later that they first started gaining mainstream popularity when they performed in Baybeats '06. At the same time, they started selling their first self-titled EP album, which consisted of 5 tracks. They were featured on Mediacorp (2007 New Year's Eve Countdown @ Vivocity), Nokia (Flow! @ Ministry of Sound), The Esplanade (Baybeats 2006, Baybeats 2007, On the Waterfront shows), Midas Promotions (SingFest ‘08), National Library Board’s ‘Speak Good English’ campaign (School Invasion Tour 2007 & Timbre Bar shows), Lime Magazine (Lime <b>Sonic</b> <b>Bang</b> 2007) and National Youth Council's numerous 'Weekend Trip @ Youth Park' gigs & *scape @ The Lab gigs. In early 2009, they also performed in [...] "Live n Loaded" [...] on national TV. The band has so far shared stages with other groups such as As I Lay Dying, Story of The Year, Funeral For A Friend, Love Me Butch and many others.|$|E

The results show that bang produced amplitudes are not very much greater than the environmental vibration amplitudes. It is unlikely therefore that continued exposure of the Cathedral to <b>sonic</b> <b>bangs</b> would result in appreciably accelerate...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of the ear to short duration bursts of noise is discussed, and the information used {{in an attempt to}} predict human reaction to <b>sonic</b> <b>bangs</b> heard inside and outside a building. The pressure waveform heard by an observer on the ground is assumed to be {{in the form of a}} simple N-wave. Prom current theory the time interval between front and rear shocks is esttiated to be 0. 20 -o. 25 seconds for a slender delta airliner flying at 11 1. 8 at 60, 000 ft. For a range of values of bang duration, the transmission loss based on peak levels is estimated for typical window pane sizes and thicknesses, and is found to vary between- 12 and 40 dB, the higher values being for smaller, thicker window panes. Sound levels inside a building, neglecting reverberation effects, are estimated 9 assuming a peak pressure level for the shock wave of 1 lbift 2 (about 130 dB re 0. 0002 micro-bar), to be between 80 and I-IO $ 3 re 0, 0002 micro-bar. For a large room it is estimated that the reverberant effec...|$|R

By September that year, they had performed at festivals in South Africa, London and United States. The EP peaked at No. 18 on the ARIA Singles Chart in July of the following year. Its lead track, [...] "Let Me Down Easy", was nominated for Best Independent Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 2013. Its second track, [...] "Hold My Tongue", was issued as the group's debut single in August but it did not reach the top 50. All five tracks were produced by Stuart Stuart at Analog Heart Studios, and co-written by Amy, George & Bovino. Kat Hunter of The AU Review felt that the EP [...] "serves up a delicious helping of pop goodness filled with danceable melodies, catchy sing-along lyrics in addition to light and perfectly whipped harmonies and group vocals". The group played at the <b>Sonic</b> <b>Bang</b> Festival in Bangkok on 24 August 2013, sharing the roster with Placebo, Pitbull, Far East Movement, Jason Mraz, and Owl City. The band appeared at Sullivan Hall in New York City on 18 October for the 2013 CMJ Music Marathon. On 1 December 2013, they performed and presented an award at that year's ARIA Music Awards. By that time, the band had enlisted Dean Gordon to replace Tredly on drums.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn 1956 Whitham gave a {{nonlinear}} {{theory for}} computing {{the intensity of}} an acoustic pulse of an arbitrary shape. The theory has been used very successfully in computing {{the intensity of the}} <b>sonic</b> <b>bang</b> produced by a supersonic plane. Gubkin (1958) derived an approximate quasi-linear equation for the propagation of a short wave in a compressible medium. These two methods are essentially nonlinear approximations of the perturbation equations of the system of gas-dynamic equations in the neighborhood of a bicharacteristic curve (or rays) for weak unsteady disturbances superimposed on a given steady solution. In this paper we have derived an approximate quasi-linear equation which is an approximation of perturbation equations in the neighborhood of a bicharacteristic curve for a weak pulse governed by a general system of first order quasi-linear partial differential equations in m + 1 independent variables (t, x 1,…, xm) and derived Gubkin's result as a particular case when the system of equations consists of the equations of an unsteady motion of a compressible gas. We have also discussed the form of the approximate equation describing the waves propagating upsteam in an arbitrary multidimensional transonic flow...|$|E
5000|$|Randall Woolf (born August 23, 1959) is an American {{composer}} {{known for}} his diverse contemporary works for chamber orchestra, chamber ensembles, and solo players, often combined with digital audio, turntables and video.. He studied composition privately with David Del Tredici and Joseph Maneri, and at Harvard, where he earned a Ph.D. He {{is a member of}} the Common Sense Composers Collective. He is composer-mentor for the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In 1997 he composed a new ballet of “Where the Wild Things Are”, in collaboration with Maurice Sendak and Septime Webre. He has created 3 pieces for video and live instruments with directors Mary Harron (director of “American Psycho”) and John C. Walsh. He works frequently with John Cale, notably on his score to “American Psycho”. He re-created 4 songs of Nico for Cale’s tribute concert “On The Borderline”, sung by Peter Murphy, Lisa Gerrard, Sparklehorse, Stephin Merritt, Peaches, and Meshell Ndegeocello. He has arranged over 40 of Cale’s song for orchestra, including the entire [...] "Paris 1919" [...] album, performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in January, 2013, songs from [...] "The Velvet Underground And Nico", and [...] "Music For A New Society". His works have been performed by Kathleen Supové, Jennifer Choi, Timothy Fain, Mary Rowell, Todd Reynolds, Ethel, conductor and flutist Ransom Wilson, Tara O’Connor, Lindsey Goodman, the Brooklyn Philharmonic, Kronos Quartet, Turnmusic, Fulcrum Point, Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble, <b>Sonic</b> Generator, <b>Bang</b> On A Can/SPIT Orchestra, American Composers Orchestra, NakedEye Ensemble, and others.|$|R
500|$|Tom Moon of Rolling Stone {{felt that}} the song [...] "revealed new dimensions. The rhythm section {{displays}} a growing curiosity about studio texture and nuance". David Fricke of Rolling Stone said that [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is a [...] "stark and uncommonly pensive ballad", commenting that the song [...] "drop-kicked the band into the Top10". Philip Booth of The Tampa Tribune believed that the single was [...] "undulating [...] omnipresent" [...] {{not only in the}} alternative rock genre, but in pop music as a whole. Ben DiPietro of the Richmond Times-Dispatch praised the record as a whole, but was most impressed by the Chili Peppers' shift from exclusive hard rock to adding more moderately paced tracks: [...] "there's still plenty of <b>sonic</b> funk to <b>bang</b> heads to, but the best tracks are the slower ones such as 'Under the Bridge'". Nick Griffiths (Select) described the song as [...] "all mellow strumming and thoughtfully shallow vocals, though it's almost exonerated by a shrill unexpectedly choral middle eight." [...] Amy Hanson of Allmusic noted that the song has [...] "become {{an integral part of the}} 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the rough-hewn and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers' own oeuvre". She went on to praise [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] for being a [...] "poignant sentiment that is self evident among the simple guitar which cradles the introductory verse, and the sense of fragility that is only doubled by the still down-tempo choral crescendo".|$|R
