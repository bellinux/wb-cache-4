50|$|Nintendo Research and Development 2 (Nintendo Kaihatsu Dainibu) (R&D2) {{was a team}} within Nintendo that {{developed}} software and peripherals. R&D2 ported several of the Nintendo R&D1 and Nintendo R&D3 games over to the Famicom in the early 1980s. While usually occupied in <b>system</b> <b>operating</b> <b>software</b> and technical support, the team {{would come back to}} early development in the 1990s where several new designers got their start at game development, the most famous being Eiji Aonuma who developed Marvelous: Treasure Island.|$|E
50|$|This {{expectation}} seemed reasonable in {{the computer}} marketplace of the time. Until then Microsoft was based primarily on computer languages such as BASIC. The established small <b>system</b> <b>operating</b> <b>software</b> was CP/M from Digital Research which was in use both at the hobbyist level and by the more professional of those using microcomputers. To achieve such widespread use, and thus make the product viable economically, the OS had to operate {{across a range of}} machines from different vendors that had widely varying hardware. Those customers who needed other applications than the starter programs could reasonably expect publishers to offer their products for a variety of computers, on suitable media for each.|$|E
