5|$|After {{recognizing}} {{the harmful effects}} of <b>smoking</b> on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted. The later 1930s increasingly saw anti-tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis. In 1938, the Luftwaffe and the Reichspost imposed a ban on <b>smoking.</b> <b>Smoking</b> was also banned not only in health care institutions, but also in several public offices and in rest homes. Midwives were restricted from <b>smoking</b> while on duty. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed <b>smoking</b> in all of its offices premises, and Heinrich Himmler, the then chief of the Schutzstaffel (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers from <b>smoking</b> while they were on duty. <b>Smoking</b> was also outlawed in schools.|$|E
5|$|As of 1996 Bellaire prohibits <b>smoking</b> {{in public}} parks and dogs in all non-dog public parks; as {{of that year}} <b>smoking</b> in public parks brings a fine of $500. The {{ordinance}} was adopted around 1996 on a 4-3 vote.|$|E
5|$|Cigarette <b>smoking</b> is the best-established avoidable {{risk factor}} for {{pancreatic}} cancer, approximately doubling risk among long-term smokers, the risk increasing {{with the number of}} cigarettes smoked and the years of <b>smoking.</b> The risk declines slowly after <b>smoking</b> cessation, taking some 20 years to return to almost that of non-smokers.|$|E
5|$|However, {{much of the}} {{currently}} information regarding the <b>smoking</b> habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean defectors who now live in the South {{and may not be}} totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that <b>smoking</b> is even more common than anticipated, but nicotine dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting <b>smoking.</b>|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} numbing, numbing, numbing myself then {{sleeping}} it off, then getting on stage, killing it in pain, then getting off and <b>smoking,</b> <b>smoking,</b> <b>smoking,</b> {{not knowing what}} pain was. Fuck, if I know what hurts the most, you know? I would break the habit and it would sneak back in and I would break it and sneak back in.|$|E
5|$|In a {{large-scale}} study of programs where bupropion {{was used for}} <b>smoking</b> cessation or treatment of depression, no withdrawal symptoms were observed. As of 2002 there were two case reports of people experiencing withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing buproprion taken to aid <b>smoking</b> cessation; the prescribing information states that dose tapering is not required when discontinuing treatment for <b>smoking</b> cessation.|$|E
5|$|In {{reference}} to Obama's <b>smoking</b> habit, Michelle said in early 2010 {{that he had}} quit <b>smoking.</b>|$|E
5|$|Policy {{interventions}} to decrease passive <b>smoking</b> in public {{areas such as}} restaurants and workplaces have become more common in many Western countries. Bhutan has had a complete <b>smoking</b> ban since 2005 while India introduced a ban on <b>smoking</b> in public in October 2008. The World Health Organization has called for governments to institute a total ban on tobacco advertising to prevent young people from taking up <b>smoking.</b> They assess that such bans have reduced tobacco consumption by 16% where instituted.|$|E
5|$|Scully leaves The <b>Smoking</b> Man {{and gives}} the disc to The Lone Gunmen to analyze, {{but it turns out}} that The <b>Smoking</b> Man swapped the disc for a blank one. She goes back to his office but it has been emptied. Mulder informs her that this was a con and she was used to {{retrieve}} this information, but he does not understand why The <b>Smoking</b> Man left Scully alive. The final scene shows The <b>Smoking</b> Man throwing the real disc into a lake.|$|E
5|$|<b>Smoking</b> {{arrived in}} Korea {{in the early}} 1600s from Japan and until around 1880, {{both men and women}} smoked. Today, North Koreans {{consider}} <b>smoking</b> to be a normal activity for men, but female <b>smoking</b> has become a social taboo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Smoking</b> {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing <b>smoking</b> rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with <b>smoking</b> prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, <b>smoking</b> is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Smoking</b> {{prevention}} and <b>smoking</b> cessation are effective ways of preventing {{the development of}} lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|The health {{impacts of}} <b>smoking</b> are well {{documented}} and in North Korea the high prevalence of <b>smoking</b> {{has a significant}} impact on the health of the population. Some 34.3% of men and 22.3% of women are reported to die as a result of <b>smoking,</b> the highest <b>smoking</b> mortality figures in the world, and in total tobacco-caused illness kills 55,600 North Koreans annually.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco <b>smoking</b> {{is by far}} {{the main}} {{contributor}} to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known carcinogens, including benzopyrene, NNK, 1,3-butadiene and a radioactive isotope of polonium, polonium-210. Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to <b>smoking</b> (70% for women). <b>Smoking</b> accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases.|$|E
5|$|While in most {{countries}} industrial and domestic carcinogens have been identified and banned, tobacco <b>smoking</b> is still widespread. Eliminating tobacco <b>smoking</b> is a primary goal {{in the prevention of}} lung cancer, and <b>smoking</b> cessation is an important preventive tool in this process.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Smoking</b> Popes' breakup Josh and Eli Caterer and Mike Felumlee {{performed}} {{together in}} Duvall. Felumlee also founded Double Zero Records and released several albums of previously recorded <b>Smoking</b> Popes material: the compilation 1991â€“1998 appeared in 1999, followed by Live in 2000 and {{a release of}} the Capitol-rejected The Party's Over in 2001.|$|E
5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, {{studies have}} shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is <b>smoking,</b> and therefore to quit <b>smoking</b> should be considered.|$|E
5|$|Howard (Melissa Leo) quits <b>smoking,</b> and {{her partner}} Felton (Daniel Baldwin) fears her edginess will endanger his safety. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) also tries to quit <b>smoking,</b> but tries to live {{vicariously}} through his <b>smoking</b> partner Pembleton (Andre Braugher). Howard and Bayliss petition Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{to set up a}} non-smoking section for the squad room, but an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke. Howard, Felton, Bayliss and Pembleton find they share a common suspect in a Union Square murder, and plan a joint stakeout. Howard and Bayliss decide to ride together so Pembleton and Felton can smoke in the car. Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting <b>smoking.</b> Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but <b>smoking,</b> prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask for a cigarette. As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him.|$|E
5|$|In Australia and the UK <b>smoking</b> {{cessation}} is {{the only}} licensed use of bupropion.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Tunisia, Marita Covarrubias {{arranges}} for {{the release}} of Alex Krycek from a penal colony. Upon returning to the United States, the two meet with the wheelchair-bound <b>Smoking</b> Man, who tells them that an alien craft has crashed in Oregon. The <b>Smoking</b> Man sees the crash as a chance to rebuild the Project, but claims that finding it will be complicated.|$|E
5|$|Marijuana smoke {{contains}} {{many of the}} same carcinogens as those in tobacco smoke. However, the effect of <b>smoking</b> cannabis on lung cancer risk is not clear. A 2013 review did not find an increased risk from light to moderate use. A 2014 review found that <b>smoking</b> cannabis doubled the risk of lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} the Shooter again, who {{tells him that}} Gibson is a missing link. Mulder {{believes}} that Gibson has genes that are dormant in most humans. The <b>Smoking</b> Man dismisses the Well-Manicured Man's concerns about Mulder's actions. At the prison, the guard kills the Shooter. Diana Fowley, protecting Gibson in a hotel room, is shot shortly afterwards, and Gibson is captured by the <b>Smoking</b> Man's minions. Skinner tells Mulder of the Shooter's death, and that a flattened Morley cigarette box was found in his cell. Mulder confronts Spender, accusing him {{of working with the}} <b>Smoking</b> Man. The <b>Smoking</b> Man turns Gibson over to the Well-Manicured Man. Scully is informed by Skinner that the Justice Department is seeking to have the X-Files shut down. Mulder realizes that this was all part of a plan. The <b>Smoking</b> Man takes Samantha's X-File from Mulder's office, and lights the room on fire. As he leaves, he meets Jeffrey, and tells him that he's his father. By the time Mulder and Scully arrive, the X-Files are completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. MÃ¼ller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco <b>smoking</b> and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit <b>smoking,</b> including producing lectures and pamphlets. <b>Smoking</b> was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} {{is less of}} a concern when bupropion is prescribed for <b>smoking</b> cessation. According to a 2014 Cochrane review, while there is an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause. In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping <b>smoking.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Nazi anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning <b>smoking</b> in trams, {{buses and}} city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, {{and raising the}} tobacco tax. The National Socialists also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and <b>smoking</b> in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. The anti-tobacco movement {{did not have much}} effect {{in the early years of}} the Nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939, but <b>smoking</b> by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Smoking</b> Man {{contacts}} Mulder, arranging {{a meeting}} at a nearby diner. There Mulder meets his sister Samantha, who calls The <b>Smoking</b> Man her father. Samantha claims to not remember anything about her abduction and is reluctant to stay or tell Mulder where he can find her. The next day, The <b>Smoking</b> Man offers Mulder the truth if he quits the FBI and comes work for him; Mulder refuses. Mulder later meets with Blevins, who now has evidence Skinner was withholding information concerning Ostelhoff's death. Blevins tells Mulder he can help him if he names Skinner as the traitor in the FBI. Later, Mulder meets with Scully, telling her {{he was going to}} make the deal with The <b>Smoking</b> Man but now will not after his meeting with Blevins. Despite Scully's pleas, he refuses to name Skinner as the traitor in the FBI.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Smoking</b> Man, {{armed with}} a sniper rifle and {{surveillance}} equipment, spies on a meeting between Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, and the Lone Gunmen. Frohike claims to have discovered information about the <b>Smoking</b> Man's mysterious past, stating {{that his father was}} an executed communist spy and that his mother died of lung cancer, causing him to be raised in various Midwest orphanages.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the DC Graphic Novel Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography. Glen Morgan stated that he wanted the episode to show that The <b>Smoking</b> Man was the most dangerous human being alive. The episode was originally intended to end with The <b>Smoking</b> Man killing Melvin Frohike, but the show's executive staff vetoed the idea.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for <b>smoking</b> cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for <b>smoking</b> cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting <b>smoking</b> successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} rivalry on the undercard {{was for the}} WWF Tag Team Championship between the team of Owen Hart and Yokozuna and The <b>Smoking</b> Gunns (Billy and Bart). The <b>Smoking</b> Gunns dropped their WWF Tag Team Championship to Hart and Yokozuna at WrestleMania XI, the {{previous}} pay-per-view event. Their rivalry was reignited on the April 23 episode of Action Zone, when the Blu Brothers (Don and Ron Harris) faced the New Headshrinkers (Sionne and Fatu). Hart and Yokozuna interfered in the contest, attacking the New Headshrinkers, causing a disqualification. The <b>Smoking</b> Gunns ran to the ring, attacking Hart and Yokozuna. The Headshrinkers posed with Hart and Yokozuna's tag team belts and celebrated with the <b>Smoking</b> Gunns. The following night, on Raw, the <b>Smoking</b> Gunns were awarded a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the In Your House pay-per-view. They made their intentions of winning the title clear by quickly defeating Barry Horowitz and the Brooklyn Brawler. In their last encounter before the event, Bart defeated Hart via pinfall on the May 8 episode of Raw.|$|E
25|$|<b>Smoking</b> bans are {{generally}} acknowledged to reduce rates of smoking; smoke-free workplaces reduce <b>smoking</b> rates among workers, and restrictions upon <b>smoking</b> {{in public places}} reduce general <b>smoking</b> rates {{through a combination of}} stigmatisation and reduction in the social cues for <b>smoking.</b> However, reports in the popular press after <b>smoking</b> bans have been enacted often present conflicting accounts as regards perceptions of effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Children of <b>smoking</b> {{parents are}} more likely to smoke than {{children}} with non-smoking parents. Children of parents who smoke are less likely to quit <b>smoking.</b> One study found that parental <b>smoking</b> cessation was associated with less adolescent <b>smoking,</b> except when the other parent currently smoked. A current study tested the relation of adolescent <b>smoking</b> to rules regulating where adults are allowed to smoke in the home. Results showed that restrictive home <b>smoking</b> policies were associated with lower likelihood of trying <b>smoking</b> for both middle and high school students.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{successful}} cut-down on public <b>smoking,</b> the ban has also caused {{an increase in}} narghile delivery and at-home <b>smoking,</b> since this type of <b>smoking</b> is not prohibited by the ban.|$|E
25|$|In America, California's 1998 <b>smoking</b> ban {{encouraged}} {{other states}} such as New York to implement similar regulations. California's ban included a controversial restriction upon <b>smoking</b> in bars, extending the statewide ban enacted in 1994. As of April 2009 there were 37 states with some form of <b>smoking</b> ban. Some areas in California began banning <b>smoking</b> across whole cities, including every place except residential homes. More than 20 cities in California enacted park and beach <b>smoking</b> restrictions.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons given}} by some smokers for this {{activity}} have been categorized as addictive <b>smoking,</b> pleasure from <b>smoking,</b> tension reduction/relaxation, social <b>smoking,</b> stimulation, habit/automatism, and handling. There are {{gender differences in}} how much each of these reasons contribute, with females more likely than males to cite tension reduction/relaxation, stimulation and social <b>smoking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though <b>smoking</b> {{may help}} relieve {{symptoms}} of schizophrenia, <b>smoking</b> also counteracts {{the effects of}} antipsychotic medication. <b>Smoking</b> results in faster metabolism of antipsychotics, which results in smokers being prescribed higher doses. Studies are unclear as to whether changes in <b>smoking</b> are caused by changes in symptoms, side effects of medication, or primary effects of medication.|$|E
