40|$|The Clean Air Act of 1990 {{initiated}} a tradable permit program for emissions {{of sulfur dioxide}} from coal-fired power plants. The effect of this enlightened policy on the coal industry was a large increase in consumption of low-sulfur bituminous and subbituminous coals. Low-sulfur bituminous coal is most attractive to coal-fired power plants as they have higher heat content and require less alteration to the boiler to burn as effectively the coal previously in use. However, low-sulfur bituminous coal is also the ideal coal for coking. The analysis presented here will attempt {{to determine whether the}} increased consumption of low-sulfur bituminous coal for electricity generation caused a decrease in the quality and/or quantity of coking coal consumption. Most evidence suggests that the market for coking coal was unaffected, even as the consumption of low-sulfur bituminous coal for electricity generation increased substantially. Implications of potential greenhouse gas regulation on this market are also discussed. 1990 Clean Air Act, <b>coke,</b> <b>Input</b> substitution...|$|R
40|$|The {{extremely}} large {{energy requirements}} of blast-furnace iron {{production and the}} high levels of pollution in terms of carbon dioxide have resulted in systematic efforts aimed at decreasing the specific consumption of fuels and deoxidizing agents during this process. This paper deals with the injection of alternative fuels into a blast furnace and their effect on the blast furnace’s operation. In this case oil injection was replaced by coal-tar injection. A comparison analysis of the brown-coal generator tar injection and oil injection was applied to assess the effect of the injection on the reduction of CO 2 emissions. The daily parameters of the inputs and outputs were available. The statistical relations for the injection of brown-coal tar and the significant parameters of the aggregate are studied. Correlation coefficients indicating the tightness in the tar injection and other significant technological parameters, such as the <b>specific</b> <b>coke</b> consumption, theoretical combustion temperature and the emissions of the blast furnace are calculated.

40|$|Coal {{injection}} {{plays an}} important role to the economic success of ironmaking by substituting a portion of the <b>coke</b> <b>input</b> and improving the blast furnace productivity. Manufacturers are looking at opportunities to increase their coal selection options by using higher proportions of technically challenging lower volatile matter content coals; this paper investigates the kinetics, devolatilisation and burnout of these in granulated coal blends using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a drop tube furnace (DTF). The char residue from the semi-anthracitic low volatile coal selected for this blending investigation had a much reduced reactivity at higher conversions which affected the blends in different ways. Burnout of the blends with the low volatile bituminous coals was improved by fragmentation of the granulated particles, but at longer residence times the lower reactivity of the more structurally ordered carbon in the semi anthracitic coal dominated. In contrast, the higher volatile coals showed improvements at low residence times corresponding to rapid volatile loss, but also showed non-additive blend improvement at longer residence times which may be explained by the more obvious presence of included minerals and the higher K/Al ratios associated with illite mineral phases known to improve burnout...|$|R

40|$|A {{problem of}} {{industrial}} fluxed agglomerates self-destruction {{in the process}} of cooling after sintering has been examined. It has been revealed that the main reason of strength degradation is polymorphism of dicalcium silicate Ca 2 SiO 4 (or short designation С 2 S) : β-Ca 2 SiO 4 ® γ-Ca 2 SiO 4. Ways for increasing the  agglomerate  strength by physical and crystal-chemical stabilization of the high temperature modification of C 2 S have been proposed and tested. Physical stabilization of C 2 S agglomerate is increased with its structure reinforcement due to thickening of walls between large pores that is achieved by increasing height of the sintered layer through improvement of its gas permeability. The task is addressed by substituting the previously used import sintering ore with the  polydisperse ore from the Yakovlevo field, which improves the charge  pelletizing by 3 - 4 times and helps to bring the  height of the sintered layer and the strength of the domestic agglomerate up to the international best practice standards, while eliminating a need to purchase import high-vacuum   exhausters. In practice crystal-chemical stabilization of C 2 S within iron-ore  agglomerate is ensured by adding an  opti- mal multicomponent additive in the form of the    waste product  generated in production  of alumina  from bauxites, i. e. the red mud, to the initial sinter charge. Thus mechanical strength of agglomerates and pellets is increased by 5 - 10 % and their hot strength improves by 20 - 40 %. The productivity of sintering machines and blast furnaces improves by 5 - 10 %. <b>Specific</b> <b>coke</b> consumption reduces by 2 - 2. 5 %.

By applying method of Artificial Neural Networking (ANN) using back propagation (BP) algorithm, prediction model has been developed to predict CSR.

40|$|Micro-CT imaging {{of samples}} of {{metallurgical}} coke was achieved at high resolution (~ 10 μm), using the Imaging and Medical Beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. The coke samples were then stressed to breaking point and imaged again. The {{result is that}} we can examine, in fine detail in 3 D, the locations of the fracture surfaces in the coke, and their relationship to the different aspects of the microstructure. In addition, we have performed 3 D finite element linear elasticity analysis, using the microstructure of the <b>cokes</b> as <b>input</b> to the calculations. The result is a 3 D map of the von Mises stress in the structure, which provides information about the likely locations of fracture. Finally, we have performed a fractographic analysis of the fracture surfaces, in order to characterise the nature of the fracture mechanisms. The imaging and analysis has been performed for both compressive and mixed-mode loading of the coke samples. The work provides the opportunity to identify the key mechanisms for fracturing of coke due to the aspects of their microstructure, and has the potential to aid in the production of stronger metallurgical coke, by means of blending coals to produce coke with improved strength properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{reactivity}} of coke analogues doped with minerals {{to mimic the}} mineralogy of <b>specific</b> industrial <b>cokes</b> was compared with the {{reactivity of}} the industrial cokes. The reactivity was assessed in a pseudo-CRI type test. This involved reacting the carbonaceous materials (analogue and industrial coke) in CO 2 at 1 100 °C in a thermos-gravimetric system. In this comparison, the mineral matter added to the coke analogue was prepared from ashing of the industrial cokes. A distinct ranking of reactivity for the industrial cokes {{was determined to be}} coke A 3 ̆c coke B 3 ̆c coke C. The high reactivity of coke C was attributed to the high iron content in its ash. The higher reactivity of coke B over coke A was attributed to its higher porosity and lower rank (of the original coal carbon type) of the industrial cokes. The coke analogue replicated the increased reactivity of coke C over cokes A and B, indicating that the coke analogue is able to some extent to replicate the effect of coke mineralogy on coke reactivity in CO 2. The use of the coke analogue allowed assessment of the difference in the reactivities of cokes A and B. When porosity and carbon type were fixed by use of the analogue, the reactivities of the analogues of cokes A and B were found to be similar...|$|R
40|$|Coke is {{the fuel}} {{and the primary}} source of CO for the {{reduction}} of iron oxide in the blast furnace. It also gives the structure to the furnace to ensure high permeability for high productivity[1]. Coke is a complex heterogeneous composite material containing different forms of carbonaceous materials, mineral components and a pore structure primarily dependent on the volatile matter in the source coal and coking conditions. When exposed to high temperatures and reactive atmospheres, the heterogeneous compositional and structural features, inherent in a coke, make it difficult to isolate the effects of <b>specific</b> component on <b>coke</b> behavior. This limits the progress in coke studies in assessing the impact of minerals on reactivity and reaction kinetics[2, 3]. A coke analogue has been developed using laboratory grade materials (graphite, Bakelite, Novolac and minerals) to address these reactivity issues. Full details of how is produced are given elsewhere[2, 4]. Use of this coke analogue has several advantages. It can be doped with minerals required, while porosity, carbon structure and mineral dispersion can be controlled, reducing heterogeneity issues. This controlled and improved homogeneity offers new possibilities in isolation specific effects of minerals on coke reactivity and coke reactivity kinetics...|$|R

Coke reactivity and strength are closely related, as such, an improved understanding of the kinetics of blast furnace coke reactions {{can be used to}} enhance blast furnace performance. However, coke is a complex composite material, with an inherent heterogeneity with respect to oxide phase composition and phase dispersion. The complexity and heterogeneity of coke makes it difficult to isolate the effects of a <b>specific</b> component on <b>coke</b> reactivity. The coke analogue has been developed to address these issues and was used for controlled testing of specific mineral, and to some degree maceral, effects on reactivity. The reaction of coke analogue with CO 2 was studied using thermogravimetric analysis to measure the kinetics at temperatures from 850 to 1350 °C. The reaction rate behaviour of the analogue is similar to that reported for industrial coke. The gasification rate increased with increasing temperature and three reaction zones corresponding to different kinetic control regimes, as found in industrial coke, have been identified. These findings show that the coke analogue demonstrates similar reaction kinetics to industrial coke indicating its suitability for use in coke kinetic studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSintering is {{a process}} in sinter machine for {{agglomeration}} of iron ore and other raw material fines into a compact porous mass, i. e., sinter, used in Blast Furnaces as an iron bearing input charge material for hot metal production. ‘Permeability’ of sinter-bed on sinter machine i. e., the porosity in sinter-bed of charged materials, facilitates atmospheric air passes from the top to bottom across the depth of sinter-bed, when suction created {{from the bottom of}} the bed, for efficient heat carry over from top to bottom of the bed for complete burning of charged materials for effective sintering process controls the productivity of the sinter machine. The level of ‘permeability’ in sinter-bed is depending upon the effectiveness of ‘charging chute’ in size-wise ‘segregation’ of charge materials across the depth in sinter-bed, achieved due to differences in the sliding velocities of particles during charging into the moving sinter-bed. The permeability achieved by the earlier conventional ‘charging chute’ was limited due to its design and positional constraints in sinter machine. Improving the productivity of sinter machine, through increased permeability of sinter bed is successfully achieved through implementation of an innovatively designed and developed, “Magnetic Charging Chute” at Sinter Plant no. 2 of Rourkela Steel Plant. The induced magnetic force on the charged materials while the charge materials dropping down through the charge chute has improved the permeability of sinter bed through an unique method of segregating the para-magnetic materials and the finer materials of the charge materials to top layer of sinter bed along with improved size-wise segregation of charge materials. This has increased the productivity of the sinter machine by 3 % and also reduced the solid fuel consumption i. e., <b>coke</b> breeze in <b>input</b> charge materials by 1 kg/t of sinter...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is the three phase development of an Early Entrance Coproduction Plant (EECP) which produces at least one product from {{at least two of}} the following three categories: (1) electric power (or heat), (2) fuels, and (3) chemicals using ChevronTexaco's proprietary gasification technology. The objective of Phase I is to determine the feasibility and define the concept for the EECP located at a specific site; develop a Research, Development, and Testing (RD&T) Plan to mitigate technical risks and barriers; and prepare a Preliminary Project Financing Plan. The objective of Phase II is to implement the work as outlined in the Phase I RD&T Plan to enhance the development and commercial acceptance of coproduction technology. The objective of Phase III is to develop an engineering design package and a financing and testing plan for an EECP located at a specific site. The project's intended result is to provide the necessary technical, economic, and environmental information needed by industry to move the EECP forward to detailed design, construction, and operation. The partners in this project are TES (a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco), General Electric (GE), Praxair, and Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) in addition to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). TES is providing gasification technology and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) technology developed by Rentech, GE is providing combustion turbine technology, Praxair is providing air separation technology, and KBR is providing engineering. Each of the EECP subsystems were assessed for technical risks and barriers. A plan was identified to mitigate the identified risks (Phase II RD&T Plan, October 2000). The RD&T Plan identified petroleum coke characteristics as a potential technical risk. The composition of petroleum coke varies from one refinery to another. Petroleum coke characteristics are a function of the crude oil slate available at the refinery and the coker operating parameters. The <b>specific</b> petroleum <b>coke</b> characteristics at a refinery affect the design of the Gasification and Acid Gas Removal (AGR) subsystems. Knowing the petroleum coke composition provides the necessary data to proceed to the EECP Phase III engineering design of the gasification process. Based on ChevronTexaco's experience, the EECP team ranked the technical, economic, and overall risks of the petroleum coke composition related to the gasification subsystem as low. In Phase I of the EECP Project, the Motiva Port Arthur Refinery had been identified as the potential EECP site. As a result of the merger between Texaco and Chevron in October 2001, Texaco was required to sell its interest in the Motiva Enterprises LLC joint venture to Shell Oil Company and Saudi Refining Inc. To assess the possible impact of moving the proposed EECP host site to a ChevronTexaco refinery, samples of petroleum coke from two ChevronTexaco refineries were sent to MTC for bench-scale testing. The results of the analysis of these samples were compared to the Phase I EECP Gasification Design Basis developed for Motiva's Port Arthur Refinery. The analysis confirms that if the proposed EECP is moved to a new refinery site, the Phase I EECP Gasification Design Basis would have to be updated. The lower sulfur content of the two samples from the ChevronTexaco refineries indicates that if one of these sites were selected, the Sulfur Recovery Unit (SRU) might be sized smaller than the current EECP design. This would reduce the capital expense of the SRU. Additionally, both ChevronTexaco samples have a higher hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio than the Motiva Port Arthur petroleum coke. The higher hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio could give a slightly higher F-T products yield from the F-T Synthesis Reactor. However, the EECP Gasification Design Basis can not be updated until the site for the proposed EECP site is finalized. Until the site is finalized, the feedstock (petroleum coke) characteristics are a low risk to the EECP project...|$|R
