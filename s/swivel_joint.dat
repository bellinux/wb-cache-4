50|$|A <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> for a pipe {{is often}} a {{threaded}} connection in between which {{at least one of}} the pipes is curved, often at an angle of 45 or 90 degrees. The connection is tightened enough to be water- or air-tight and then tightened further so that it is in the correct position.|$|E
50|$|Caster flutter can be {{controlled}} by adding dampers or increasing the friction of the swivel joints. This {{can be accomplished by}} adding washers to the <b>swivel</b> <b>joint.</b> The friction increases as the weight {{on the front of the}} chair increases. Anytime the caster begins to flutter, it slows the chair and shifts weight to the front wheels. There are several online anti-flutter kits for retrofitting wheelchair casters in this manner. Other methods of reducing caster flutter include increasing swivel lead, using heavier grease, reducing the mass of the wheel, or increasing friction with the ground by changing materials.|$|E

50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two {{underwater}} torpedo tubes. These were cast-iron cylinders {{attached to a}} <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> in the hull, one on each bow. Inside the ship the opposite end was attached to a graduated scale for targeting. There was a watertight door {{at either end of}} the tube. The 14 in torpedoes were loaded inside a brass cylinder which slid into the iron casting. To fire the torpedo, the outer door was opened and a 10 ft guide was extended which helped the torpedo clear the currents around the ship. A piston in the brass cylinder forced out the torpedo when it was to be fired, and at the same time its own compressed air motor was started.|$|E
50|$|The neGcon {{worked by}} means of gears turning the shafts of potentiometers. This system greatly reduced the logic {{required}} in the controller (important at the time) compared to a quadrature encoder-based system by removing the need for self-calibration and converting relative position to absolute position. The center pivot of the neGcon utilized a ring-gear driving a pinion on the shaft of the potentiometer, while the 3 analogue buttons each employed a rack driving similar pinions. These systems were large, with two potentiometers in the left half of the controller for the L shoulder button and center pivot and two potentiometers in the right half of the controller for the Ⅰ and Ⅱ buttons. Lack of space inside the unit precluded an analogue R shoulder button. However, extended use caused the <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> to wear.|$|E

5000|$|Surface {{blowdown}} continuously bleeds off a low {{volume of}} water from within the boiler {{as a means of}} ridding the boiler of dissolved impurities. It is most effective to remove water with the highest level of impurities; and such water is found where steam separates in the steam drum {{at the top of the}} boiler. There are two types of surface blowdown fittings. The simpler is a pipe entering the steam drum at the normal water level. A more sophisticated skimmer arrangement attaches a <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> to the pipe for a short length of pipe suspended by a float. [...] The skimmer may be more effective at removing floating oil which might otherwise cause foaming. Surface blowdown is normally fed to a flash tank and heat exchanger for heat recovery. The flashed steam can be used in the feedwater heater. These energy economies are seldom practical with infrequent bottom blowdown. Surface blowdown offers the additional advantage of steady-state operating conditions.|$|E

40|$|During ATP {{hydrolysis}} by F 1 -ATPase subunit c rotates in a hydrophobic bearing, {{formed by}} the N-terminal ends of the stator subunits (ab) 3. If the penultimate residue at the a-helical C-terminal end of subunit c is artificially cross-linked (via an engineered disulfide bridge) with the bearing, the rotary function of F 1 persists. This observation has been tentatively interpreted by the unfolding of the a-helix and swiveling rotation in some dihedral angles between lower residues. Here, we screened the domain between rotor and bearing where an artificial disulfide bridge did not impair the rotary ATPase activity. We newly engineered three mutants with double cysteines {{farther away from the}} C-terminus of subunit c, while the results of three further mutants were published before. We found ATPase and rotary activity for mutants with cross-links in the single a-helical, C-terminal portion of subunit c (from c 285 to c 276 in E. coli), and virtually no activity when the cross-link was placed farther down, where the C-terminal a-helix meets its N-terminal counterpart to form a supposedly stable coiled coil. In conclusion, only the C-terminal singular a-helix is prone to unwinding and can form a <b>swivel</b> <b>joint,</b> whereas the coiled coil portion seems to resist the enzyme’s torque...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — One {{of the key}} {{research}} efforts associated with a redun-dant seven degree of freedom (7 -DOF) upper limb exoskeleton robot that is mechanically coupled to {{the human body is}} to develop high and low level control algorithms that enable the system to become a natural extension of the human body. Improving the synergistic relationship between the exoskeleton and the operator is manifested in part by decreasing the force exchange between the two entities. Such a reduction is accomplished in part by developing criteria for resolving the human arm redundancy. The redundancy may be represented by a swivel angle which is defined as the angular rotation of the elbow around an axis that passes through the shoulder and wrist joints. The proposed criteria for defining the swivel angle takes into account the dynamics of the human arm along with a viscoelastic muscle-like model with variable damping. The swivel angle is estimated using the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian with a secondary objective function that estimates the desired joint angles during human arm movement. The result is then fed to the muscle model to create a more realistic human motion. The estimated swivel angle is then compared with the actual swivel angle measured experimentally by a motion capture system. Results indicate that the average error between the estimated and measured <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> angle is 4. 4 degrees (in the range [3. 7 - 6] degrees), which are lower than the kinematically based redundant resolution criterion.

40|$|A {{concept of}} {{a nuclear power plant}} to be {{assembled}} on earth and operated on the moon is presented. The two principal design objectives are reliability and high specific power. Wherever there is an incompatibility between these two objectives, the decision favors reliability. The design is {{based on the premise that}} the power plant must be designed on the basis of current technology and with a minimum amount of research and development. The principal components consist of a fast reactor in a direct cycle with a mercury-vapor turbine. The high- frequency generator, hydrogen compressor for the generator cooling system, mercury-recirculating pump, and condensate pump are on an extension of the turbine shaft. Ths mercury vapor is condensed and the hydrogen cooled in wing radiators. The reactor is of a construction quite similar to EBR-I Mark IlI for which there is a large amount of operating experience. The radiator is a vertical tube-and-fin type built in concentric cylindrical sections of increseing diameter.

40|$|The Lightweight Rover Unit (LRU) is a four-wheeled {{planetary}} rover for rough terrain exploration. The {{front and the}} rear wheels are each mounted on a bogie axis, respectively. These bogies {{are attached to the}} body via actuated <b>swivel</b> <b>joints.</b> The aim of this thesis is to employ these actuators to control the vertical wheel force distribution. The control of the vertical wheel forces can be utilized to increase the tip-over stability of the rover and to reduce wheel slippage. In the beginning, a mathematical model of the rover was derived. This model allows an estimation of the wheel forces depending on the system state of the rover. Based on this model, a control law was developed that uses the bogie actuators to distribute the vertical wheel forces in a predefined way. The chosen approach employs a quadratic optimization problem to distribute the wheel forces according to variable optimality measures. The mathematical model contained unknown system parameters which had to be identified for a precise estimation of the wheel forces. These parameters were used in the successful verification of the rover model. The errors between the estimated and the real vertical wheel forces stayed below the tolerable limit. Finally, the proposed controller was successfully validated in experimental tests on the LRU...|$|R
