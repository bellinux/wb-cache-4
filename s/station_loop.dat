50|$|On December 2, 1895, the <b>Station</b> <b>Loop</b> {{was opened}} to {{eliminate}} using a wye to reverse streetcars. From Front Street, the loop went south on Simcoe Street, east on Station Street and north on York Street returning to Front Street east to Yonge Street.|$|E
5000|$|Loops have various shapes {{according}} to the space available. For example, the [...] "loop" [...] track may actually be mostly straight, using on-street trackage to complete the looping motion (as at Bingham Loop or Oakwood Loop), or {{there may be a}} single sharp curve through almost three-quarters of a circle (as at Union <b>Station</b> <b>Loop</b> or Wolseley Loop).|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} normal single line working, tokens would be {{exchanged}} at the signal boxes {{associated with each}} <b>station</b> <b>loop.</b> Initially there was one block from Stratford to Ettington, and another from Ettington to Kineton. In 1911 the facility was added to switch Ettington box out during the night, and work with one long block - a novel system at that time.|$|E

5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original <b>loop</b> <b>station.</b> The <b>loop</b> <b>station</b> could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of gap fillers because of the sharpness of the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the <b>loop</b> <b>station.</b> The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the <b>loop</b> <b>station.</b> This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|R

50|$|As {{the signal}} cabin for Archer Park was {{situated}} {{on the western side}} of the <b>station</b> <b>loop</b> lines, firemen looking back {{along the length of the}} train were unable to be given a proceed signal. To assist in the problem of observing passing trains on the main line in Denison Street, sheets of galvanised iron were removed to open up a view from the platform area.|$|E
50|$|On 13 May 1960, Newburgh (Glenburnie Junction) to Lindores closed completely, and Newburgh to Glenburnie Junction was singled, {{leaving a}} single line route between Ladybank and Perth. St Fort to Lindores {{remained}} open for freight until October 1964. Newburgh <b>station</b> <b>loop</b> remained intact, however, and in December 1971 was signalled for bi-directional working. This loop and the, by then, decaying Newburgh sidings were both removed in October 1980.|$|E
50|$|With {{construction}} of a substation able to supply the railway, tramway and trolley-buses was subsequently commenced and in November 1988, it was officially opened with trains hauled by EC 7 on the electrified section of the Railway. EC 7 is periodically operated at the Park, usually double-heading with EO 3. This {{is due to the}} lack of electrification on the Moorhouse <b>station</b> <b>loop,</b> which does not allow one locomotive to head the train on its own.|$|E
5000|$|Occasionally, the song(s) {{chosen for}} the loop signify both {{the end of an}} old format and the {{beginning}} of a new one. For example, WPHR-FM/Cleveland, OH continuously played [...] "It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" [...] by R.E.M. for a full day in May 1992 while changing from CHR to modern rock as WENZ, [...] "The End." [...] (The <b>station</b> <b>looped</b> that same song when flipping to mainstream urban in 1999.) ...|$|R

50|$|The Seaside and Brooklyn Bridge Elevated Railroad was {{organized}} on March 18, 1890 {{to extend the}} Fifth Avenue Elevated south to Fort Hamilton, to extend the Lexington Avenue Elevated from Van Siclen Avenue east to the city line, and to build in High Street at the Brooklyn Bridge (this {{became part of the}} Sands Street <b>station</b> <b>loop).</b> The extension of the Fifth Avenue Elevated, along Fifth Avenue, 38th Street, and Third Avenue, opened to 65th Street on October 1, 1893.|$|E
5000|$|... 63rd Street and Malvern Avenue station (also {{known as}} 63rd and Malvern Loop) is a SEPTA trolley station in Philadelphia. It is the western {{terminus}} of Route 10 of the SEPTA Subway-Surface Trolley Lines. The <b>station</b> <b>loop</b> {{is located at}} 63rd Street and Malvern Avenue in the Overbrook neighborhood of West Philadelphia, near Lancaster Avenue. It is also close to the border with Lower Merion Township. Trolleys run from here to Center City Philadelphia. The Overbrook station of the Paoli/Thorndale Line is {{within walking distance of}} the station.|$|E
50|$|In 1896, {{services}} {{on the line}} amounted to five in each direction with an additional down service (towards Pickering) on Thursdays. Sundays were left with no passenger workings. By 1906 the {{services on}} this line {{had been reduced to}} four each way with an additional Thursdays only working from Pickering. In 1934, three years after the passenger service on the T&M line had ceased, the services were back up to being five daily out and back runs between Pickering and York. In the war years, the service was reduced to two daily through trains that would be simple out and back workings, with crews changing over trains in the Coxwold <b>station</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{impact of}} ambient {{temperature}} was also evaluated. Special attention {{was given to}} the loop ranging between the reference stations and the gravity observatory of Strasbourg J 9   (see Fig. 2) which is inside a bunker. Fores et al. (2017) have demonstrated that ambient temperature can modify Scintrex CG 5 measurements by a factor close to −[*] 0.5  µGal/ °C. Indeed, closing a 5 <b>station</b> <b>loop</b> lasts around 2  h. The Scintrex CG 5 gravimeter records the relative atmospheric temperature simultaneously to the gravity measurement. The difference of temperature between the measurement at a station and the first measurement at the reference station in a same loop leads to gravity changes ranging between −[*] 2 and 2  µGal. Since the accuracy of Scintrex CG 5 gravimeter is 5  µGal, we did {{not take into account the}} induced variation.|$|E
50|$|When a loop {{within a}} cave is {{surveyed}} {{back to its}} starting point, the resulting line-plot should also form a closed loop. Any gap {{between the first and}} last stations is called a loop-closure error. If no single error is apparent, one may assume the loop-closure error is due to cumulative inaccuracies, and cave survey software can 'close the loop' by averaging possible errors throughout the <b>loop</b> <b>stations.</b> <b>Loops</b> to test survey accuracy may also be made by surveying across the surface between multiple entrances to the same cave.|$|R
