5|$|Bloodless heart <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{pioneered by}} American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also {{performed}} by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon {{spread around the}} world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless heart <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> cost-effective in India, as it did not require blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless heart <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E
5|$|Cardiac <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} at the university's Variety Club Hospital, where by 1957, more than 200 patients had survived open-heart operations, many of them children. Working with surgeon C. Walton Lillehei, Medtronic began to build portable and implantable cardiac pacemakers about this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office {{and told him}} that an {{otologist}} in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.|$|E

5|$|Open {{heart surgery}} in India {{was at a}} nascent stage in the 1970s and early 1980s. After Panday {{returned}} to India from Canada, he joined the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM), in which he performed hundreds of open heart surgeries. The hospital was run on a government grant and generally catered {{to the middle class}} and poor, as the <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> at the cost of the government. The hospital was {{one of the very few}} places in India where heart <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> performed. Panday was the chief of the second unit at KEM.|$|E
5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E

After <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> completed transgender people must go to psychiatry concultations for two years because transsexuality in Ukraine {{is classified}} as a psychiatric disorder. In August 2016, an Ukrainian court ordered changes requested by two trans persons to their passports and all other documents without requiring them to undergo surgery.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>surgery,</b> there <b>are</b> {{a large number of}} studies in {{progress}} for more minimally invasive surgery and cosmetic improvements. Among these studies, NOTES (natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery) and single-port laparoscopic <b>surgery</b> <b>are</b> the 2 studies attracting the most attention. Single-port laparoscopic <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> a procedure where laparoscopic <b>surgery</b> <b>is</b> performed through a single incision at the umbilicus or another region. Until now, many kinds of <b>surgeries</b> <b>were</b> performed by single-port laparoscopy.

5|$|Ebert {{underwent}} further {{surgery in}} January 2008 to hopefully restore {{his voice and}} address the complications from his previous surgeries. On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. A further <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> performed in April 2008 after Ebert fractured his hip in a fall.

5|$|In November 1908, {{returning}} from a meeting in Chicago, Beilhart fell ill with stomach pains. He was diagnosed with appendicitis, and a surgeon was brought in.

Beilhart developed peritonitis and died on November 24, 1908.|$|E

5|$|Shunt <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal shunts were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting. Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s {{led to a}} brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} he complained of heart trouble, {{collapsed}} shortly after lunch and {{was taken to the}} hospital.

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but <b>surgery</b> <b>was</b> eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
