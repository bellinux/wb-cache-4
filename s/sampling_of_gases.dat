40|$|AbstractA {{regional}} <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> from thermal springs {{near the}} LaBarge Field, Wyoming, USA {{to determine the}} extent of the total carbon dioxide system (TCDS) indicates that the system may extend up to 70 km to the northwest of the field. Geochemical evidence from noble gas isotopes, stable element isotopes, and gas composition provide the foundation for these conclusions. Samples from Soda Springs to the west and Grand Teton National Park to the north do not exhibit the potentially diagnostic LaBarge gas chemistry and represent an absolute maximum potential extent of the system. Additional sampling to the south and east as well as in-fill sampling in regions previously sampled are necessary to refine these preliminary TCDS boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Composting stockpiled {{cattle manure}} {{is a source}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Methane and N 2 O are {{greenhouse}} gases with a high warming potential and are considered a risk to the environment. However, accurate estimates of emission of these gases from stockpiled manure are sparse {{due to the lack of}} suitable measuring techniques. In this study, the backwards Lagrangian Stochastical (bLS) dispersion and the integrated horizontal flux (IHF) micrometeorological techniques were adapted to measure gas emissions (CH 4, N 2 O and CO 2) from a manure pile. The measurements were carried out by manual <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> with syringes and measuring CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O using gas chro-matography (GC), and continuously by measuring CO 2 and CH 4 with an infra-red (IR) gas analyser. The study proved that one may get reliable estimates of the gas emisssion from measuring gas concentration and wind speed at one height downwind of a composting stockpile. If the source of gas is heterogeneous as it was for CH 4 in this study, then a large number of measurements are needed to get reliable emission estimates...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} the most common engine {{technology}} used in transportation. Its widespread use comes from its inherent high efficiency and its relative low cost. It suffers from pollutant emission issues, however, that need detailed understanding of their origins to meet the strictest current and upcoming emission standards. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the study of the mechanism at the origin of soot particle emissions and gives indications on which parameters can effectively reduce them. There are two competing in-cylinder processes, soot formation and soot oxidation, governing soot emissions from conventional combustion in diesel engines. To this day, it is still often believed that inhibiting the formation of soot reduces its emissions, despite several studies showing poor relationship between soot formation and emission in most conditions encountered in diesel engines. The results presented in this thesis aims at highlighting the importance of soot oxidation in the late cycle over the soot formation process. An effort was realized to identify the parameters governing its oxidation and how it results in lower emission levels. The study of those parameters has been realised through the use of in-cylinder <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> and optical measurements. The optical measurements were realised in a heavy-duty diesel engine using a Bowditch design with a specifically designed three-valve cylinder head. This cylinder head had an optical access located {{at the top of the}} combustion chamber, allowing the study of processes occurring in the late cycle, when the piston is moving down into the cylinder. The diagnostic chosen for this study is called laser extinction, a line of sight technique based on the absorption of light by the soot particles present in the flame. The data collected gave information on the evolution of the soot concentration and could be used to characterise the soot oxidation rate in the late cycle. The in-cylinder sampling measurements were realized in order to gather information on the soot particle characteristics. The results showed a strong correlation between the soot oxidation rates and the emission levels, underlining the importance of improving the oxidation rate rather than the soot formation in order to reduce soot emissions. It was shown that increasing the mixing of gases in the cylinder by means of increased turbulences could lead to a negative impact on the soot oxidation rates that were passed on to the soot levels in the exhaust. A variation of temperature of gases showed little to no impact on the soot oxidation rates and did not seem to effectively impact the emission levels. An increase of the gas density in the cylinder of gases lead to improved oxidation rate that also reduced emission levels. Of the injection related parameters studied, the injection pressure and the injector hole size had a strong impact on the soot oxidation rates even long after the end of the injection process. The most important parameter identified that affected the soot oxidation rates was the oxygen concentration. This parameter was studied in detail and it showed that a reduction of oxygen concentration lead to a slower maturation of soot during the combustion. While this feature produced more reactive soot particles prone to be more easily oxidized, it was revealed to be concerning a limited amount of particles in the cylinder. Moreover, it was largely overruled by the reduction of OH produced in the flame. Using simulation tools, it was shown that lowering the oxygen concentration reduced the flame temperature, which in turn reduced the OH concentration. The reduction of OH correlated strongly with the reduction in oxidation rates observed in the optical measurements, to a greater extent than just the drop of oxygen concentration...|$|E

From these experiments Priestley {{is credited with}} discovering many new gases such as oxygen, hydrogen chloride, and ammonia. He also discovered a way to find the purity or “goodness” of air using “nitrous air test”. This test was conducted by mixing nitrous gas with a test <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> another <b>gas</b> and trapping it in the pneumatic trough, essentially the greater the decrease in volume, the more pure the <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> was (key principle in eudiometry).

For Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) {{to compete with}} natural gas, a cold <b>gas</b> efficiency <b>of</b> over 80 % related to the biomass dedicated for the gas production is required. Furthermore, as much “instant” methane as possible should be produced already during gasification. To optimize the gasification process towards a distinct product is a challenging task. The Chalmers gasifier provides unique possibilities to investigate the important parameters for this optimization by in-situ measurements in an industrial sized installation.
