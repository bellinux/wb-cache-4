50|$|The {{recorded}} {{samples of}} the original pipes are divided into 3 main sections - start(attack), middle(sustain) and end(release or echo). When a note is played the attack sample is played followed by a loop of the sustain section. Start, end and release loop points are stored in the recorded <b>sample</b> <b>file.</b> When the note is released, the release or echo section of the sample is used, or specific release sample files can be defined for a note, or range of notes. This latter feature is useful in making the organ more realistic, for example the echo of a pipe after a short period will be {{different from that of}} a pipe that has been sounding for longer. Hauptwerk can select from multiple release samples based on the duration of the note. Tremulant effects are possible using LFO sample files to dynamically modify the sound, avoiding the need to create individual tremulant note sample files.|$|E
5000|$|Volume Testing {{belongs to}} the group of {{non-functional}} tests, which are often misunderstood and/or used interchangeably. Volume testing refers to testing a software application {{with a certain amount of}} data. This amount can, in generic terms, be the database size or it could also be the size of an interface file that is the subject of volume testing. For example, if you want to volume test your application with a specific database size, you will expand your database to that size and then test the application's performance on it. Another example could be when there is a requirement for your application to interact with an interface file (could be any file such as [...]dat, [...]xml); this interaction could be reading and/or writing on to/from the file. You will create a <b>sample</b> <b>file</b> of the size you want and then test the application's functionality with that file in order to test the performance.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Dancing Baby" [...] {{phenomenon}} {{refers to}} a rendered animation of a baby performing a cha-cha type dance. It originated {{as a collection of}} experimental testing data and files, ultimately released in Autumn of 1996 as a product sample source file (sk_baby.max) with the 3D character animation software product [...] "Character Studio", used with 3D Studio Max (both products from Kinetix/Autodesk). The original sample source file was produced and prepared by the original Character Studio development team (Michael Girard, Susan Amkraut, John Chadwick, Paul Bloemink, John Hutchinson, Adam Felt) at Unreal Pictures and Kinetix/Autodesk, amongst several other sample files. The cha-cha animation was created using the [...] "Biped" [...] animation system of Character Studio by Robert Lurye and Michael Girard. The 3D model of a human baby was added later by the development team as one of the character [...] "skins" [...] for the rendered animation. The original [...] "Toddler with Diaper" [...] model #VP5653 was built by, and courtesy of, Viewpoint Datalabs, with the bulk of the skinning and rigging performed by John Chadwick using the [...] "Physique" [...] skin/deformation system in Character Studio, and final edits by John and members of the Autodesk development team. After the first pre-release application of the 3D baby model to the cha-cha animation (and from pre-release showings), Kinetix/Autodesk employees realized it was amusing to see a baby dance a cha-cha rather than just walk; this helped ensure the selection of the 'dancing baby' as a <b>sample</b> <b>file</b> for debut release of Character Studio and for demonstration videos in product promotion.|$|E
50|$|This {{universal}} file specification, {{along with}} the printed source code to a 68000 assembly language interrupt driven MIDI driver, were distributed through Macintosh MIDI interface manufacturer Assimilation, which manufactured the first MIDI interface for the Mac in 1985. Macintosh Editor/librarian software development pioneers and visionaries, Beaverton Digital Systems, provided a dial-up service called MacMusic starting in 1985 which used 2400-baud modems and 100 MB of disk, and used Red Ryder Host on a 1 MB Macintosh Plus, allowing users of Sound Designer to download and install the entire Emulator II sound library to other less expensive samplers. MacMusic allowed users worldwide to share sample libraries across different manufacturers platforms without copyright infringement. Beaverton Digital Systems President John Connolly already had several conversations with Evan Brooks in 1985, as he was listed as a contact for technical support for the Assimilation MIDI toolkit, and the current Apple operating system in 1985 did not have native MIDI communications drivers. One evening in 1986 at John Connolly's Beaverton, Oregon home, an alert was sent online from MacMusic requesting the system operator, and to Connolly's surprise it was Peter Gotcher, thanking him for providing such a revolutionary service and making Sound Designer a much more attractive program to buy, by leveraging both the universal file format and by developing the first online <b>sample</b> <b>file</b> download site in the world, many years before the World Wide Web use soared. In 1987, Gotcher and Brooks discussed with E-mu Systems the possibility of integrating their renamed 'Sound Tools' software into the Emulator III. E-mu rejected this offer and the pair started Digidesign, with Gotcher as president and Brooks as lead engineer.|$|E
