40|$|Abstract. A lot of {{practice}} had {{proved that the}} failure rate {{can be used as}} the reliability indicators of MCM (Multi-Chip Module). The lower the junction temperature of the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> in MCM, the lower the failure rate of components was, thus the higher the reliability of MCM. Therefore, in order to measure the junction temperature of the semiconductor components of MCM, computer simulation is needed in the stage of design，which was essential for improving the reliability of MCM’s encapsulation and even the whole electronic machine system. In this paper, we tried to thermal design the high-power heating devices-MCM of the multi-functional electronic devices. First, the cooling principles of MCM encapsulation were introduced. And then based on the design principles and precautions of MCM, we designed an MCM encapsulation for cooling analyses of ANSYS. The results of finite element analyses showed the reasonableness of the design of MCM, and combined with the different substrate materials and circuit board materials, further discusses about improved cooling capability of MCM were expressed in this paper. At last, we got the desired effect...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Printed {{circuit boards}} (PCBs) {{replaced}} conventional wiring in most electronic equipment after World War II, reducing {{the size and}} weight of electronic equipment while improving reliability, uniformity, precision and performance. PCBs are used {{in all kinds of}} electronic products because they can be mass-produced with very high circuit density and also enable easier trouble-shooting. As <b>semiconductor</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuit</b> (IC) <b>device</b> <b>circuit</b> densities increase, the role of Computer Aided Design (CAD) in advanced PCB design and manufacturing technology becomes more critical. Computer Aided Design (CAD) is very important for teaching engineering students in the field of PCB layout design. However, a PCB layout design for IC industry is still new to many college students and educators. The objective of the study is to examine trends of PCB design and technology in order to enhance technology curriculum development in the new millennium...|$|R

5000|$|Terahertz {{technology}} allows {{high resolution}} 3D imaging of <b>semiconductor</b> packages and <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>devices.</b> THz time-domain reflectometry (TDR) offers significant advantages in imaging resolution compared to existing fault isolation techniques and conventional millimetre wave systems. Working with Intel on the applications of THz {{technology for the}} semiconductor industry, TeraView developed a new technique which combines electro-optics and THz pulses in a non-destructive electro-optical terahertz pulsed reflectometry (EOTPR) which operates at up to 2 THz with resolution of 10 μm for improved fault isolation and failure analysis process-flow studies. [...] "The unique capabilities of terahartz TDR and its advantages over the conventional TDR have been recognized. With such revolutionary concept, innovative design and superior performance, EOTPR will become an essential tool for microelectronic package fault isolation and failure analysis."

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} composite oxides on the electrical property of the Si/SiO 2 interface using a high frequency capacitance-voltage (C-V) technique. The composite oxides are composed of inorganic spin-on-glass (SOG) and nondoped silicate glass (NSG) film deposited by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition with a high yield of water absorption. The density of SOG-related positive charge is enhanced about 1. 8 times higher by laying the NSG film under the SOG film, while no enhancement is observed by laying it on the SOG film. The enhancement is because the underlying NSG film absorbs water generated by the dehydration ofSi(OH) ~ during the SOG curing process. The water-absorbed NSG film seems {{to increase the amount}} of atomic hydrogen which generates the positive charge. Spin-on-glass (SOG) is widely used with silicon oxides deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in the fabri-cation of metal oxide <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (MOS IC) <b>devices</b> as an intermetal oxide (IMO) layer for its good planarity.

Below 450 ~ the conductivities were independent of temperature and are suggested to be governed by impurities. Above 450 ~ the total dc conductivities increased with increase in temperature. The acti-vation energies of conduction in the temperature ange 500 ~ 176 were estimated to be 1. 65 and 2. 10 eV for SiO 2 grown on p- and n-type silicon, respectively. DC polarization measurements carried out in this temperature ange suggest that conduction in SiO 2 is ionic as well as electronic. The ionic conduction is believed predominantly {{to be due to}} the trans-port of oxygen ions. AC conductivities were also measured in the temperature ange of 550 ~ 176 The activation ener-gies for the conduction in this temperature ange were estimated to be 1. 55 eV for SiO 2 on p-type silicon and 1. 86 eV for SiO 2 on n-type silicon.

40|$|An {{interferometric}} {{imaging technique}} can provide time-resolved diagnostics of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> The <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device</b> {{is placed in}} one arm of an interferometer and illuminated with a picosecond pulse from a sub-bandgap infrared laser. As the laser passes through the semiconductor, it samples local variations in the index of refraction. These variations are caused {{by a number of}} physical phenomena including dopants in the material such as those used to form device structures, heating due to the flow of electrical currents, and changes in carrier concentration due to injection. These variations have both static and dynamic components. The dynamic components are associated with the normal device operation and are the most interesting. To separate the components, the device is first imaged in a quiescent state, and then a second image is taken after the device enters a known voltage state. Differences between the two images determine where the local index of refraction has changed and by how much. A third image taken with the reference arm of the interferometer blocked, allows device structures to be associated with particular changes in the index of refraction. Activation of the voltage state is synchronized with the pulsed illumination source, and the time delay between the application of the voltage and the laser probe pulse allows us to take a series of images that map the time evolution of the interferogram. This technique offers an exciting new diagnostic for <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> The technique is noninvasive and compatible with high-speed operation of <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> The picosecond resolution enables us to either characterize specific logic states or watch an individual device turn on. This imaging technique is sensitive to all of the index of refraction changes that can be associated with IC`s.

40|$|Solidification {{processes}} can {{be observed}} in a variety of fields of fields of engineering and geophysical phenomena. In metallurgy, for instance, the solidifying conditions of the melt determine the mechanical propertiesof the solid products. In <b>semiconductor</b> industry, <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>devices</b> require the large single crystals by high perfection, containing a uniformly distributed dopant. Geophysical problems also involve solidification processes, such as freezing sea water in arctic region, lake freezing and formation of igneous intrusives. In the present research we particularly concern with a possible way to control the location of solid liquid interface and the speed of advancing solid front. In order to achieve this goal it is needed to adjust the cooling temperature with time. From a point of view of fluid mechanics and heat transfer, a liquid to solid phase change involves a coupling of heat conduction in the solid layer as well as convecting process in the liquid layer. In cha pters 1 and 2, we develop both one-dimensional and two-dimensional models for a solidifying problem when a liquid body is cooled from the top boundary. The cooling temperature is varied periodically with time, and the bottom temperature is kept constant. The one-dimensional and two-dimensional models are formulated and solved numerically in general. But, it is also shown that an analytical solution is possible for a special case, where the Stefan number is small and the solid-liquid boundary movement is slow enough in comparison with the thermal diffusion in the solid layer. In chapter 3 we carry out a corresponding experiment with an insulated box containing distilled water. Both analytical and numerical predictions agree well with the experimental results regarding the solidifying front movement. In chapter 4 the study has been extended to solidification in a liquid-saturated porous medium. In chapters 5 and 6 we conduct a fundamental study on porous media convection and mixed convection in a vertical channel. Both analyzes serve in order to under stand transport process in a mashy zone, and to control convective heat transfer at the solid front. 本研究の目的は、凝固過程の動的挙動に注目し、そのプロセス(特に固相領域の厚さ) を冷却面温度を非定常的に制御することにより達成しようとすものである。固相厚さや固相成長速度を制御するために必要な冷却面温度の非定常な設定値を、簡便で実用上十分な精度を有する方法で計算し、予測する可能性について検討した。このため、まず最初に非定常一次元の凝固解析モデルを提案し、当該モデルによる冷却面の温度変動に対する固相厚さの応答について解析した。さらに、この簡便な解析モデルの妥当性を検証する目的で、二次元数値モデルを開発した。また、矩形空間を満たした蒸留水を上方から冷却し、氷層を形成する実験を行った。その結果、提案した一次元、二次元モデルによる予測値が実験結果と良い一致を示すことがわかり、当該解析モデルの妥当性が証明された。解析と実験の比較は、主に冷却面温度を周期的に変動させて行われた。この時の固相厚さ変動の振幅と冷却面温度変動に対する位相遅れの二点について、理論予測値と実験値の比較を行っている。本研究における理論解析の特徴は液相領域での自然対流の存在を考慮している点である。特に水は 4 ℃で密度が最大となるため、複雑な自然対流が発生し、固液界面での対流熱伝達も一般的には複雑な様相を呈する。しかしながら、これまでの研究によると、空間的に平均化された固相厚さの時間変動は、一次元解析モデルにより実用上十分な精度で近似することが出来ることが証明された。これにより、対流の直接計算が不可能な高Ra数領域での乱流熱伝達が存在する場合でも、凝固プロセスを非定常的に制御するための冷却面温度を理論的に予測できることを示した。研究課題/領域番号: 11650214, 研究期間(年度) : 1999 - 2001, 平成 13 (2001) 年度 科学研究費補助金 基盤研究(C) 研究成果報告書の一部(概要) を掲...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} develops {{yield and}} reliability models for fault-tolerant <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> and develops optimization algorithms {{that can be}} directly applied to these models. Since defects cause failures in microelectronics systems, accurate yield and reliability models considering these defects as well as optimization techniques determining efficient defect-tolerant schemes are essential in semiconductor manufacturing and nanomanufacturing to ensure manufacturability and productivity. The defect-based yield model considers various types of failures, fault-tolerant schemes such as hierarchical redundancy and error correcting code, and burn-in effects, simultaneously. The reliability model counts on carry-over single-cell failures accompanied by the failure rate of the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> under the assumption of an error correcting code policy. The redundancy allocation problem, which seeks to &# 64257;nd an optimal allocation of redundancy that maximizes system reliability, {{is one of the}} representative problems in reliability optimization. The problem is typically formulated as a nonconvex integer nonlinear programming problem that is nonseparable and coherent. Two iterative heuristics, tree and scanning heuristics, and variants are studied to obtain local optima and a branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed to &# 64257;nd the global optimum for redundancy allocation problems. The proposed algorithms engage a multiple-search paths strategy to accelerate efficiency. Experimental results of these algorithms indicate that they are superior to the existing algorithms in terms of computation time and solution quality. An example of memory <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> is presented to show the applicability of both the yield and reliability models and the optimization algorithms to fault-tolerant <b>semiconductor</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R
