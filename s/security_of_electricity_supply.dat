40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} 'Security <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supplies</b> in the EU' is to verify {{validity}} of the argument that three objective of EU energy policy which the European Council officially agreed upon in 2007 might be conflicting in their practical implementation. Those objectives involve: increasing the competitiveness of European economies {{and the availability of}} affordable energy, combating climate change and increasing <b>security</b> <b>of</b> supply.

40|$|The European Union and its Member States {{are seeking}} to decarbonize their energy systems, {{including}} the electricity sector and, at the same time, pursue market integration. However, renewable energy (RE) deployment and the liberalization of the energy-only market have raised concerns {{at the national level}} about the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supplies</b> in the future. Some actors consider the lack of sufficient investments in generation capacities a threat to supply security. As a consequence, it was proposed that capacity markets solve these problems. The underlying assumption is that the market design is the only determining factor for investments in <b>security</b> <b>of</b> supply options. In this article, we question this narrow view and identify further determinants of the investment decisions <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> market participants. Based on the insights of institutional sociology and economics, we understand the market to be a social institution that structures the behavioural expectations of market participants. Derived from the theoretical conceptualization and based on qualitative literature review and own work, we find four determinants for investment behaviour beyond the formal market design: Material opportunities, strategic actor behavior and identity, focusing events and discursive expectations about the future. With this perspective, we discuss the introduction of a European Energy Union as a possible tool that might have a great impact on the more informal determinants such as expectations about the future and the construction of a European energy narrative...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> {{generation}} <b>supply</b> problem, the {{electric power system}} firmness {{has been defined as}} the ability of already installed facilities to <b>supply</b> <b>electricity</b> efficiently in the medium term. In other words, the firmness represents the ability of the system to <b>supply</b> <b>electricity</b> efficiently within a time term in which the system cannot count on new investments to solve the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> supply problem, e. g. one or two years. This ability depends to a large extent on how generators carry out their medium-term resource planning (implying among others fuel provision, water reservoir management or maintenance scheduling). In this paper, {{on the basis of a}} stylized mathematical model developed specifically for this purpose, we contribute from the regulator s point of view to the theoretical analysis and discussion of the firmness dimension in a market environment. We focus on how generators risk aversion coupled with generators' inability to efficiently hedge long-term positions (due to market incompleteness) may lead the system towards an inefficient (from the social perspective) outcome. In this context, we evaluate whether some kind of regulator s intervention could be recommended in order to lead the market towards a more efficient/adequate solution. This intervention, as already implemented in certain electric power systems, could (and in some power markets does) take the form of administratively setting minimum hydro reservoir levels or compulsory long-term contracting. info:eu-repo/semantics/draf...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problems associated}} with <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the UK. The British <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry has experienced a significant structural change. Competition has been brought into the electricity industry and a single wholesale <b>electricity</b> market <b>of</b> Great Britain has been established. The evolution <b>of</b> the British <b>electricity</b> market raises new challenges, such as improving the liquidity of wholesale markets and developing clean energy. The wholesale electricity prices are less transparent and trading arrangements are very complex in the British electricity market. In this thesis a fundamental model, called a stack model, has been developed in order to forecast wholesale electricity prices. The objective of the stack model is to identify the marginal cost of power output based on the fuel prices, carbon prices, and availability of power plants. The stack model provides a reasonable marginal cost curve for the industry which can be used as an indicator for the wholesale electricity price. In addition, the government's targets for climate change and renewable energy bring new opportunities for wind energy. Under the large wind energy penetration scenario the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the energy supply will be essential. We have modelled the correlations between wind speed data for a set of wind farms. The correlation can be used to measure the portfolio risk of the wind farms. Electricity companies should build their portfolio of wind farms with low or negative correlations in order to hedge the risk from the intermittency of wind. We found that the VAR(1) model is superior to other statistic models for modelling correlations between wind speeds of a wind farm portfolio...|$|R

Transpower submitted its initial investment proposal for the project in May 2005. The regulatory process for investment approval for the project created significant tension between Transpower and the Electricity Commission, and led to political pressure for progress, to ensure the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> to Auckland.

40|$|This {{research}} report seeks {{to estimate the}} value of the UK subsea cables industry, considering its value to 1) the digital economy, and 2) the electricity industry. An initial estimate of the economic value of the UK telecommunications subsea cables industry to the digital economy values it at £ 62. 8 billion per annum. The impact <b>of</b> the UK <b>electricity</b> subsea cables industry is smaller but still significant at £ 2. 8 billion per annum. The economic value of the UK subsea cables industry both for the telecommunications and energy sectors is then measured in more detail using the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling approach that has increasingly overtaken the more traditional Cost Benefit Analysis approach to computing economic values. This analysis also provides estimates of the impact of changes in the industry on various sectors of the economy, {{as well as on the}} macro economy. Yet first a qualitative research methodology, namely a Comprehensive Impact Evaluation Framework is applied to identify benefits of the UK subsea cables industry to multiple stakeholders in the telecommunications and energy sectors. By identifying the relevant direct and indirect stakeholders, this ensures that the CGE models developed are as accurate as possible. The stakeholder analysis also allows us to going beyond a monetary analysis of the potential benefits of the subsea cables industry, by identifying the range of stakeholders positively impacted by the presence of the UK subsea cables industry. In the telecommunications sector there are benefits to businesses and households from better quality and speed of digital communication, as well as improved reliability of Internet connectivity. These benefits translate into improved business efficiency, improved ability to manage people and processes, as well as improved opportunities for the international communication of product and process innovations. In the electricity sector, the use of subsea cables is vital for the import and export <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> as well as to connect offshore electricity production to the mainland electricity grid system. Hence, subsea cables ensure improved reliability and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supplies,</b> as well as access to international markets. Given that offshore electricity production is a vital part <b>of</b> renewables <b>electricity</b> production in the UK, this production has environmental benefits and contributes to reduced pollution and the UK’s better ability to meet pollution reduction targets. The qualitative and quantitative analyses combine to highlight the positive value of the UK subsea cables industry both on the telecommunications and electricity market sectors. The impact on the telecommunications sector is larger as was to be expected given the importance of this sector on the UK economy as a whole, while subsea cables are of importance in the electricity market predominantly in terms <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> imports and exports, and the production <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from off-shore wind farms. Not only is the UK subsea cables market important in terms of its impact on the telecommunications and electricity sectors, but the quantitative analysis has highlighted the benefits of future growth in the UK subsea cables industry on UK macroeconomic variables including GDP; consumer income; capital formation; exports and imports and government revenues. Growth in the UK telecommunications subsea cables industry is likely positively to impact the UK financial and insurance sector the most, while growth in the UK electricity subsea cables industry is expected to have its greatest positive impact on the UK manufacturing industry...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} and models {{the vulnerability of}} the electricity power supply under extreme weather conditions. The system under study is the electric supply system that includes major power plants to main load centers. Extreme weather conditions can cause common mode contingencies (CMCs) of overhead power lines, which endanger the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> Planning and operation of transmission systems are subject to N- 1 criterion, which requires that all single failures of network elements do not cause a breach of safety limits.

The objective of this research is to identify critical and plausible CMCs, taking into account space-time correlations of extreme weather conditions and possible states of the network. The most vulnerable zones are focused on to determine appropriate countermeasures for reducing vulnerability. In the past, extreme weather events have caused major disruptions.

The EU plans to have 12 CCS plants operating by 2015. In February 2009, the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change stated an aspiration for the UK to have more than one demonstration project in operation enabled by government funding. However, these targets cannot be delivered without the underpinning knowledge from studies such as this. Commitment to large-scale investment in CO 2 capture plant will require proven storage capability. This study • presents the first high-level screening of CO 2 storage sites available to Scotland • evaluates the means by which CO 2 can be transported from power plants and other industrial activities to storage sites, and • investigates the costs and business constraints. This is the most comprehensive and fully integrated study performed in the UK, and was achieved by a collaborative partnership of Scottish Government, research universities and institutes, and a broad base of support from industry and business. The conclusions show that Scotland has an extremely large CO 2 storage resource. This is overwhelmingly in offshore saline aquifers (deeply buried porous sandstones filled with salt water) together with a few specific depleted hydrocarbon fields.

40|$|The present chapter aims at {{positioning}} storage technologies {{with respect}} to the current market designs and regulatory schemes, thus investigating ways and means to ease a cost effective, market-based deployment and operations, with a special attention paid with operations in Europe. This approach should help avoiding any a priori opinion to favor long term investments in storage systems. Indeed, future electricity systems will face challenges such as significant increases in variability and intermittency of generation, the rapid growth of distributed energy/power resources including distributed generation, the penetration of electric vehicles and controllable demand, deployment of smart appliances enabling active demand response. A growing interplay between transmission and distribution levels will then be given rise. Future power systems will therefore need a properly designed, market-based system architecture allowing for decarbonisation while ensuring system reliability and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> <b>Electricity</b> storage is one amongst several options to provide system services such as capacity firming, back-up capacity, voltage and frequency regulation.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{capacity of}} distributed electrical generators brings new challenges in maintaining a high <b>security</b> and quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> New techniques {{are required for}} grid support and power balance. The highest potential for these techniques {{is to be found}} on the part <b>of</b> the <b>electricity</b> distribution grid. This article addresses this issue and presents the EEPOS project’s approach to automated management of flexible electrical loads in neighbourhoods. The management goals are (i) maximum utilisation of distributed generation in the local grid, (ii) peak load shaving/congestion management, and (iii) reduction <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> distribution losses. Contribution to the power balance is considered by applying two-tariff pricing for electricity. The presented approach to energy management is tested in a hypothetical sensitivity analysis of a distribution feeder with ten households and ten photovoltaic (PV) plants with an average daily consumption <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>of</b> 4. 54 kWh per household and a peak PV panel output of 0. 38 kW per plant.

40|$|This study investigates how demand-side changes, as {{a result}} of a {{large-scale}} transition to electric vehicles (EVs), is likely to affect the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in Norway. The study is based on a survey that asked 398 EV-users when they charge their EV during the day and night. By looking at two scenarios for EV market penetration, consumption curves was estimated and analyzed based on power consumption data from 2012. The study finds that the prospected EV-transition is likely to worsen the security of supply, in that the variability in the consumption curve is likely to increase and the frequency balance will therefore be more difficult to maintain, all other factors held constant. The peak demand hours during the winter stand a higher chance of surpassing available installed capacity under the scenarios of EV penetration compared to the power consumption in 2012. The existing plans to improve the Norwegian power grid, increase installed capacity and expand power connections abroad, will likely be sufficient to tackle a large scale transition to EVs and to maintain the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> The study also finds that the power demand from a large EV fleet can potentially improve the security of supply, if EV-users charge their EVs during the hours that are more convenient for the power system, during the night. nhhma...|$|E

40|$|The {{continued}} {{drive to}} reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions {{in order to}} mitigate climate change {{has led to an}} increase in demand for low-carbon energy sources, and the development of new technologies to harness the available energy in the wind, waves and tides. Many controversies surround these technologies, however, particularly with regards to their economic cost, environmental impacts and the implications of the variability of their output for <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> In order to make informed policy decisions on future developments <b>of</b> the <b>electricity</b> system, it is necessary to address these controversies and confirm the environmental, economic and social sustainability of these new renewable generators. This thesis specifically examines two key issues: whether new variable-output renewable energy generators actually deliver a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetimes, and whether they produce a viable energy return on energy investment. Although renewable energy sources are themselves ‘carbon free’, GHG emissions (and energy consumption) occur during the construction, maintenance and decommissioning of the generator infrastructure required to convert this energy into electricity. Furthermore, the variability of the output power from such generators has implications for the operation of the grid - there may be a requirement for additional reserve capacity and the increased part-loading of conventional plant is likely to reduce its operating efficiency. Carbon and energy paybacks are measures of the time required for a new renewable installation to offset these life cycle impacts. The work presented in this thesis examines both the life cycle impacts and the GHG emissions displacement of variable renewable generation, using Great Britain as a case study, in order to provide a basis for significantly more robust and reliable estimates of carbon and energy paybacks. The extensive literature survey concentrates on two key areas: current calculation methodologies and estimates for life cycle carbon and energy consumption of power generators; and the marginal emissions displacement of variable renewable generation. A detailed life cycle assessment of the Pelamis wave energy converter is presented, which sets the embodied carbon and energy {{in the context of the}} wider environmental impacts and includes an examination of the effect of different assumptions on the analysis results. In order to investigate the true emissions displacement of renewable generation, a historical analysis of real data from the National Grid was carried out, identifying the marginal displacement factor of wind power and taking into account the effect of the efficiency penalties of conventional plant. The findings of the analyses presented in this thesis are combined with information from the literature to examine the actual carbon and energy payback of existing renewable generation infrastructure on the British grid, and to provide detailed recommendations for future carbon and energy payback calculations...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{electricity demand}} and environmental concerns, utilities {{are looking for}} improved network operations and efficient energy consumption. Telecom sites with their flexible energy storage and controllable power flows have significant potential to improve reliability, efficiency, <b>security</b> and quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the AC distribution system. Power quality events such as voltage sags, flickers and energization of power devices cause disturbances in the operational grid. Moreover, extensive use of power electronics devices requires additional reactive power from the grid and cause distortion in the source current waveforms. These power quality problems were identified both from the literature studies and measurements obtained from Sintef Energy, a research organization in Norway. Line rectifiers are being used as grid/utility interfaces for the telecom sites. In this master thesis, an idea is proposed to replace rectifiers with bi-directional AC/DC converters. Operational control schemes for up-to three converters have been developed {{with the help of}} vector control technique. These converters with the battery banks on DC side; are not only capable of supplying power for telecommunication services but also of providing the possibility of voltage support, harmonics and reactive power compensation. Basic distribution network models were developed in the software package MATLAB/SIMULINK&# 174; to analyse the impact of connected telecom converters both for the voltage support and ancillary services. Simulations were performed and it was observed that the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) was reduced to maximum 3. 4 %, reactive power drawn from the grid became zero and voltage dip in case of wind distributed generation rises from 83. 5 % to 97. 5 % when three Telecom sites started supporting the grid. It was also seen that with proper energy management system, Telecom sites can also support utilities by supplying active power during peak hours load demand and for islanding operation. THD level within the IEEE, IEC, EN power quality standards, compensation of reactive power and provision of voltage support prove that the efficiency of a network can be improved by properly implementing Smart Grid together with the support from distributed telecom sites.

This paper seeks to calculate a robust measure of national power system resilience by analysing each {{step in the process}} of transformation from raw energy to consumed electricity. Countries with sizeable deposits of mineral resources are used for comparison because of the need for electricity-intensive metals processing. We find that shifts in electricity-intensive industry can be predicted based on countries 2 ̆ 7 power system resilience. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependency}} <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> {{is constantly}} increasing in today’s society. It is therefore {{important that the}} <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> is reliable. The reliability <b>of</b> the <b>electricity</b> {{can be defined as}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> In order to ensure that the quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> is good, it is regulated with for example guaranteed standards that are defined by regulatory authorities. Electricity customers that are sensitive to disturbances in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> might, however, be interested in a customized quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> A regulatory tool used to meet individual customers quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> needs, is a premium quality contract. A premium quality contract is an agreement between a network operator and a customer that requests customized quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> The customer pays the network operator for the contract, and the network operator compensates the customer in case the quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> that is specified in the contract is not supplied. This master thesis aims to investigate the applicability of premium quality contracts in Sweden. Studying the use of premium quality contracts internationally, and Swedish energy market actors’ views <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> and implementing premium quality contracts in Sweden will investigate this purpose. The participating actors in Sweden are DSOs, industries and the regulatory authority. The conclusions of the study are that premium quality contracts are applicable in Sweden. This, since higher quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply,</b> than the guaranteed standards, is requested by the participating industries. The DSOs are also, in principal, willing to enter a contract and discuss the quality <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> problems with its customers. However, the DSOs are not sure if the standards that are requested by the customers can be guaranteed. It is also concluded that regulations would facilitate the implementing of premium quality contracts, and {{that it is possible to}} introduce such regulations in the Swedish regulatory system. Other alternatives of changes in the quality regulation that possibly could satisfy the customers and the DSOs are also discussed. The alternatives discussed are, defining good quality for different kind of customers, include power quality specifications in the connection agreement or keep the regulations as they are today without any further operations. If premium quality contracts or any of the other alternatives is most suitable in Sweden, has to be studied further. ...|$|R
40|$|Reliability <b>of</b> <b>Electricity</b> <b>Supply</b> is {{the report}} of CAE's third major project, which {{was carried out in}} 1992 / 93. In New Zealand, {{electricity}} has a 48 percent share of the non-transport energy market, making it the single most important energy source in the country. Supply reliability is an important issue, as electricity consumers have come to expect a constant <b>supply.</b> Furthermore, <b>electricity</b> deregulation has introduced competitive energy trading, which may influence relative reliability levels offered by electricity retailers. The Reliability <b>of</b> <b>Electricity</b> <b>Supply</b> project provides a set of guidelines to simplify the complexities <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> reliability for customers who wish to make informed decisions regarding the most cost-effective power supply for their needs. The project provides information that will assist customers to make a proper assessment of the available investment options. Project work included a survey of domestic and commercial customers as to the degree <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> reliability they expect...|$|R
25|$|Several {{different}} companies and municipalities operated London's electric tramways. The largest was the LCC, with lines {{equipped with an}} unusual form <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> via an underground conduit located between the running rails. Other operators mainly used the more conventional overhead electric wires. Many of London's trams had to be equipped with both systems <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply,</b> with routes being equipped with change points.|$|R
