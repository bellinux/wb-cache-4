In the saturated zone, an un-converged false transient method is used in order to replace the elliptic equation by a parabolic one. To allow physical discontinuities between different types of soils, we make use of a modified jump term in the DG formulation for the variable θ. The diffusive wave approximation is applied to the shallow water equation for surface flows including runoff, lakes and small rivers.

However, accurate representation of the mollified color function assumes that it is varies smoothly across the interface by convolving f with an interpolation function (smooth kernel) K. The properties (compactness, monotonic decreasing, symmetry, differentiation, normality, limit behavior) of K and some examples of its choosing are presented in [1]. In particular, the simple form a new eight-order polynomial kernel results in a trivial and computationally efficient implementation. In [2] it was successfully applied to modeling a spherical drop in static equilibrium and was proven to be workable for circular and spherical interfaces in the infinite region.

This paper presents a residence time model for stream transport of solutes, Solute Transport in Rivers (STIR), that accounts for {{the effect of the}} stream-subsurface interactions on river mixing. A stochastic approach is used to derive a relation between the in-stream solute concentration and the residence time distributions (RTDs) in different retention domains. Particular forms of the RTD are suggested for the temporary storage within surface dead zones and for bed form–induced hyporheic exchange. This approach is advantageous for at least two reasons. The first advantage is that exchange parameters can generally be expressed as functions of physical quantities that can be reasonably estimated or directly measured. This gives the model predictive capabilities, and the results can be generalized to conditions different from those directly observed in field experiments. The second reason is that individual exchange processes are represented separately by appropriate residence time distributions, making the model flexible and modular, capable of incorporating the effects of a variety of exchange processes and chemical reactions in a detailed way. The capability of the model is illustrated with an example and with an application to a field case. Analogies and differences with other established models are also discussed...|$|E

In the PEO-block-PDMS/water system, the surface elastic modulus deduced from the SLLS spectrum exhibits a maximum at a certain concentration. In the PVP/water system, the PVP shows an additional adsorption at the concentration over the C*; during the whole concentration range we have studied, no evidence of the capillary to elastic wave evolution has been observed.

40|$|The {{transport}} of organisms across oceans is an anthropogenic agent of global change that has profoundly affected the natural distribution of littoral biota and altered {{the makeup of}} biogeographic regions. The homogenization of marine biotas is a phenomenon especially affecting coastal regions and is spearheaded by a suite of opportunistic species {{at the expense of}} native species. Climate change may exacerbate the trend: sea <b>surface</b> temperatures, <b>hydrodynamics,</b> pH and carbonate cycles, already show marked fluctuations compared to the past. Alien invasive species are impacted by the change of marine climate in a variety of ways, which are we have just begun to notice, observe and interpret. A conceptual framework has yet to be conceived that links theories on biological introductions and invasions with the physical aspects of global change. Therefore predicting the scale of invasions or their impact on biodiversity is a daunting task. Integration of biological and environmental information systems, niche models, and climate projections would improve management of aquatic ecosystems under the dual threats of biotic invasions and climate change. The recorded spread of alien species and analysis of patterns of invasions may serve as the starting point for searching connections with climate change descriptors. The Mediterranean Sea is home to an exceptionally large number of alien species, resulting from its exceptional history and multiple vectors. For much of the twentieth century alien thermophilic species, which had entered the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal, have been confined to the Levantine Basin.

40|$|Solute {{transport}} in rivers {{is controlled}} by <b>surface</b> <b>hydrodynamics</b> and by mass exchanges with distinct retention zones. Surface and hyporheic retention processes can be accounted for separately in solute transport models with multiple storage compartments. In the simplest two component model, short term storage can be associated to in-channel transient retention, e. g. produced by riparian vegetation or surface dead zones, and the long-term storage can be associated to hyporheic exchange. The STIR (Solute Transport In Rivers) multiple domain transport model is applied here to tracer test data from three very different Mediterranean streams with distinctive characteristics in terms of flow discharge, vegetation and substrate material. The model is used with an exponential residence time distribution (RTD) to represent surface storage processes and two distinct modeling closures are tested to simulate hyporheic retention: a second exponential RTD and a power-law distribution approximating a known solution for bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. Each stream shows distinct retention patterns characterized by different timescales of the storage time distribution. Both modeling closures lead to very good approximations of the observed breakthrough curves in the two rivers with permeable bed exposed to the flow, where hyporheic flows are expected to occur. In the one case where the occurrence of hyporheic flows is inhibited by bottom vegetation, only the two exponential RTD model is acceptable and the time scales of the two components are of the same magnitude. The significant finding of this work is the recognition of a strong signature of the river properties on tracer data and {{the evidence of the}} ability of multiple-component models to describe individual stream responses. This evidence may open a new perspective in river contamination studies, where rivers could possibly be classified based on their ability to trap and release pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Singularity {{formation}} is an inherent feature of equations in nonlinear physics, {{in many situations}} such as in self-focusing of light nonlinearity is {{essential part of the}} model and physical events cannot be captured by linearized equations. There are nonlinear systems, such as 1 D NLSE where singularities in analytic continuation would follow a soliton solution at fixed distances and {{while it is true that}} soliton determines the position of all the singularities, it is also true that evolution of singularities determines the solution on the real axis. Before we go further to discuss 2 D problems, we want to be more specific about analytic continuation in a 2 D problem: it is well-known that collapse in 2 D NLSE is radially symmetric and introducing radial variable r = √(x^ 2 + y^ 2) the problem becomes effectively one-dimensional. If we expand the interval spanned by r from [0,+∞) to (-∞,+∞) and continue all the functions evenly across the origin, it starts to make sense to further expand r to complex plane C and talk about analytic continuation of functions in r∈C. In 2 D nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) it is common to think that a singularity appears in finite time, but one can also say that a singularity already exists in the analytic continuation of initial data and at critical time t_c, the singularity touches the real axis and solution reaches its maximal interval of existence. The latter point of view captures evolution in more detail, in particular it allows to ask many questions that would seem quite meaningless if you follow the "philosophy" of a singularity just appearing at a finite time. In particular, one can ask question what is the trajectory of singularity in complex plane and how does the type of singularity change as t→ t_c. For 2 D focusing NLSE and Keller-Segel model (KSE) of chemotactic bacteria, the singularities evolve towards the real axis if sufficient conditions are met by initial distribution of laser intensity (NLSE) and bacteria density (KSE) respectively. Well-established conditions are included in the text and are cited upon in corresponding sections. The central subject of this work is the study of onset of singularity towards the real axis in radially symmetric 2 D NLSE and 2 D reduced KSE models (RKSE) combining two approaches: direct numerical simulations of collapse and asymptotic analysis in the limit t→ t_c. The benefit of this two-sided approach is evident when comparing results of classic theory of critical collapse in 2 D NLSE to numerical simulations: the collapse exhibits dependence on initial data even when intensity reaches enormous magnitudes and as a result is inconsistent with classical theory (e. g loglog law). An intervention of numeric approach allowed us to perform sanity checks of many assumptions and estimate regions of applicability of approximations that were used in asymptotic approach and resulted in a new corrected theory that is able to consistently describe the onset of singularity even for moderate-amplitude, developed collapse while still recovering classic theory in the limit t→ t_c. The problem of 2 D potential flow of ideal fluid in free <b>surface</b> <b>hydrodynamics</b> is another example of nonlinear system containing solutions with singularities. The focus of our investigation lies in fully nonlinear travelling waves on the surface of fluid also known as Stokes waves and in particular we are interested in singularities that are present in the analytic continuation of Stokes waves.

40|$|The fate of {{contaminants}} after a dispersal event {{is a major}} concern, and waterways may be particularly sensitive to such an incident. Contaminants could be introduced directly into a water system (municipal or general) or indirectly (Radiological Dispersal Device) from aerial dispersion, precipitation, or improper clean-up techniques that may wash contamination into storm water drains, sewer systems, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Most radiological, chemical, and biological contaminants have an affinity for sediments and organic matter in the water system. If contaminated soils enter waterways, a plume of contaminated sediments could be left behind, subject to remobilization during the next storm event. Or, contaminants could remain in place, thus damaging local ecosystems. Suitable planning and deployment of resources to manage such a scenario could considerably mitigate {{the severity of the}} event. First responses must be prearranged so that clean-up efforts do not increase dispersal and exacerbate the problem. Interactions between the sediment, contaminant, and water cycle are exceedingly complex and poorly understood.

40|$|The {{effect of}} random <b>surface</b> {{roughness}} on <b>hydrodynamics</b> of viscous incompressible liquid is discussed. Roughness-driven contributions to hydrodynamic flows, energy dissipation, and friction force are calculated {{in a wide}} range of parameters. When the hydrodynamic decay length (the viscous wave penetration depth) is larger than the size of random surface inhomogeneities, it is possible to replace a random rough surface by effective stick-slip boundary conditions on a flat surface with two constants: the stick-slip length and the renormalization of viscosity near the boundary. The stick-slip length and the renormalization coefficient are expressed explicitly via the correlation function of random surface inhomogeneities. The effective stick-slip length is always negative signifying the effective slow-down of the hydrodynamic flows by the rough surface (stick rather than slip motion). A simple hydrodynamic model is presented as an illustration of these general hydrodynamic results. The effective boundary parameters are analyzed numerically for Gaussian, power-law and exponentially decaying correlators with various indices. The maximum on the frequency dependence of the dissipation allows one to extract the correlation radius (characteristic size) of the surface inhomogeneities directly from, for example, experiments with torsional quartz oscillators.

40|$|Abstract—Animals {{display a}} variety of control {{surfaces}} {{that can be used}} for propulsion and maneuvering devises. For nonpiscine vertebrates, these control surfaces are primarily evolutionary modifications of the paired appendages (i. e., legs). The diversity of control surfaces can be classified with regard to the forces used for stability and maneuverability. For animals, the pertinent forces are pressure drag, acceleration reaction, and lift. These forces can be generated actively by motion of the control surfaces or passively from flows produced by movements of the body or external flow fields. Drag-based control surfaces are associated with paddling and rowing movements, where the limbs are oriented either in the vertical parasagittal plane or horizontal plane, respectively. The paddle is unstreamlined and has a triangular design with a broad distal end, thereby affecting a large mass of water. Appendages, which are used to generate lift-based forces, are relatively stiff hydrofoils. To maximize lift, the hydrofoil should have a crescent wing-like design with high aspect ratio. This shape provides the hydrofoil with a high lift-to-drag ratio and high propulsive efficiency. The tail flukes of cetaceans are streamlined control surfaces with a wing-like design. The flukes of cetaceans function in the hydrodynamic generation of forces for thrust, stability, and maneuverability. The three-dimensional geometry of flukes is associated with the production of lift and drag. Previous studies of fluke geometry have been limited in the number of species examined and the resolution of measurements.

40|$|The {{roughness}} and {{the contact}} angle of a surface will affect both the impinging droplet hydrodynamics and the drag force between the droplet and the surface. They will also affect the heat transfer rate because of the droplet contact area and boundary layer disruption. One method of surface modification {{is to use a}} superhydrophobic surface coating that combines nano-scale roughness with hydrophobicity to give contact angles greater than 150 o. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of nano-structured <b>surfaces</b> on droplet <b>hydrodynamics</b> and heat transfer. The investigations used three different surfaces: two coated with superhydrophobic and hydrophilic materials and one uncoated surface. Results are obtained through a combination of experiments with high speed visual and IR imaging cameras and simulation using computational fluid dynamics. Both the experiment and the simulation results of water droplet impingement on a superhydrophobic surface show a full cycle of droplet phases (spreading, retracting, bouncing and oscillating) compared to the two other surfaces. The temperature distribution of the experiment result shows that the heat transfer to a hydrophilic surface is higher than that to a superhydrophobic surface, because of the larger contact area. The maximum spreading diameter of droplet impingement on a hydrophilic surface at an impact height of 89 mm was 5. 5 mm. On the other hand on superhydrophobic and uncoated surfaces the droplet reached 4. 5 mm and 5. 1 mm...|$|R
