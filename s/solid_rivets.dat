50|$|There {{are several}} methods for {{installing}} <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>rivets</b> {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. <b>Solid</b> <b>rivets</b> consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or rivet gun. A rivet compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of rivet. This tool is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A rivet compression tool does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b>|$|E
50|$|Internally and {{externally}} locked structural {{blind rivets}} {{can be used}} in aircraft applications because, unlike other types of blind rivets, the locked mandrels cannot fall out and are watertight. Since the mandrel is locked into place, they have the same or greater load-carrying capacity as <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> and may be used to replace <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> on all but the most critical stressed aircraft structures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{simulation}} {{and experiment}} of self-piercing <b>riveting</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> joining multi-layer aluminum sheets {{are carried out}} in this paper. The forming process of the riveting {{and the distribution of}} stress are analyzed, the results show that the simulation is consistent with the experiment. The results of experiment prove that the transition point of the cone-shaped head of the <b>solid</b> <b>rivet,</b> the size and position of groove affect directly the quality of riveting. The fillet at the transition point of the cone-shaped head of the <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> can decline the maximum stress of the rivet. When the distance between the center of groove and bottom of rivet is about three quarters of the bottom sheet thickness, the bottom sheet of self-piercing does not fall off. The self-piercing <b>riveting</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> joining multi-layer aluminum sheets is feasible...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>rivets</b> {{are used}} in {{applications}} where reliability and safety count. A typical application for <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> can be found within the structural parts of aircraft. Hundreds of thousands of <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> are used to assemble the frame of a modern aircraft. Such rivets come with rounded (universal) or 100Â° countersunk heads. Typical materials for aircraft rivets are aluminium alloys (2017, 2024, 2117, 7050, 5056, 55000, V-65), titanium, and nickel-based alloys (e.g., Monel). Some aluminum alloy rivets are too hard to buck and must be softened by solution treating (precipitation hardening) prior to being bucked. [...] "Ice box" [...] aluminum alloy rivets harden with age, and must likewise be annealed and then kept at sub-freezing temperatures (hence the name [...] "ice box") to slow the age-hardening process. Steel rivets {{can be found in}} static structures such as bridges, cranes, and building frames.|$|E
5000|$|The {{setting of}} these {{fasteners}} requires access {{to both sides}} of a structure. <b>Solid</b> <b>rivets</b> are driven using a hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically driven squeezing tool or even a handheld hammer. Applications where only one side is accessible require [...] "blind" [...] rivets.|$|E
50|$|A friction-lock rivet cannot {{replace a}} <b>solid</b> shank <b>rivet,</b> size for size. When a friction-lock {{is used to}} replace a <b>solid</b> shank <b>rivet,</b> it {{must be at least}} one size larger in {{diameter}} because the friction-lock rivet loses considerable strength if its center stem falls out due to vibrations or damage.|$|R
50|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was an iron girder bridge built in 1857. Purchased from the British {{government}} {{at the end of}} the Crimean War, this bridge had a 210 ft span with side trusses being <b>solid</b> <b>riveted</b> iron 10 ft high, designed to prevent Russian snipers from killing British troops. The bridge was dismantled and reconstructed with stone buttresses {{on the site}}.|$|R
50|$|A {{small amount}} of noise is {{generated}} by an internal cooling fan. Audible noise (a hum or buzz) may be produced by cookware exposed to high magnetic fields, especially at high power if the cookware has loose parts; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and <b>solid</b> <b>riveting</b> {{is less likely to}} produce this type of noise. Some users may detect a whistling or whining sound from the cookware or from the powered electronic devices.|$|R
50|$|Hubley {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of airplanes, often reproducing actual military aircraft with good detail. Like the automobiles, Hubley aircraft were manufactured from multiple pieces which were usually put together with <b>Solid</b> <b>Rivets.</b> They had moving wheels and guns, and sometimes retractable landing gear. The wheels were often manufactured of rubber.|$|E
5000|$|Blind rivets, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of blind rivets have non-locking mandrels and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a hollow rivet that has a lower load-carrying capability than <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b> Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration. Unlike <b>solid</b> <b>rivets,</b> blind rivets can be inserted and fully installed in a joint from only one side of a part or structure, [...] "blind" [...] to the opposite side.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of blind rivets, installation of a solid rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer {{on one side and a}} bucking bar on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an [...] "improved means of closing tubular rivets" [...] (granted May 1917). In 1922 Wylie joined the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong-Whitworth Ltd to advise on metal construction techniques; here he continued to develop his rivet design with a further 1927 patent that incorporated the pull-through mandrel, and allowed the rivet to be used blind. By 1928, the George Tucker Eyelet company produced a [...] "cup" [...] rivet based on the design. It required a separate GKN mandrel and the rivet body to be hand assembled prior to use for the building of the Siskin III aircraft. Together with Armstrong-Whitworth, the Geo. Tucker Co. further modified the rivet design to produce a one-piece unit incorporating mandrel and rivet. This product was later developed in aluminium and trademarked as the [...] "POP" [...] rivet. The United Shoe Machinery Co. produced the design in the U.S. as inventors such as Carl Cherry and Lou Huck experimented with other techniques for expanding <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b>|$|E

Self-piercing <b>solid</b> <b>riveting</b> (SPSR) can be used for this combination of materials. In order to produce a joint which allows the fully utilizing of the materials, it is usually necessary to use structural high-strength adhesives in addition to a punctual joint (hybrid joining). The high joining forces during the SPSR process have a negative influence on the formation of the adhesive layer. This paper shows how to reduce negative effects on the adhesive area...|$|R
40|$|The {{riveting}} process with a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> {{is one of}} the most applied joining processes in the aeronautic industry. New materials and new design requirements constitute challenges that drive the users to a better understanding of the installation process of riveted joints. Therefore, this study aims with the aid of FEM simulation to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and afterwards to predict the mechanical properties of the riveted joint depending on the installation parameters and characteristics of the adherends. The experimental installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude and continuous collection of process data. This paper deals with the simulation of the installation process. The simulation model consists of a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> with universal head described by the standard EN 6081 and aluminum (2024 T 351) ad herends. The rivet material model has been obtained by a compression test performed on specimens prepared from fasteners. The effect of friction was studied and a suitable friction coefficient identified. The developed installati onprocess model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with different experiments regarding the geometrical characteristics of the formed rivet head, the force-displacement curves and the surface residual strain of one adherend. Afterwards, the clearance fit between the rivet shank and the borehole, the rivet grip, and the squeeze force have been numerically studied in order to determine their effect on the joint. The effect of these parameters on the riveted joint is evaluated considering the residual stress and the residual contact force. The simulation of plastic deformation and residual stress state caused by the installation process provides a basis for the prediction of the mechanical properties of the riveted joint under external forces which is subject to ongoing research...|$|R

In the present work, the authors recalled some results on the riveting process and the strength of one kind of riveted joints obtained by simulation and experimental investigations in a previous paper. The numerical results were in very good agreement with the experimental results, allowing us to validate our simulation approach and its use for further studies. We selected several engineering parameters for the riveted joint: initial assembly, friction coefficient, rivet's geometry and sheets' geometry, in order to carry out a parametric study and determine their relative importance. These were conducted in FEA software. The results showed the impact on riveting process and the strength of the riveted joint by varying each parameter which was interesting for the industry...|$|R
50|$|Semi-tubular rivets (also {{known as}} tubular rivets) {{are similar to}} <b>solid</b> <b>rivets,</b> except they have a partial hole (opposite the head) at the tip. The purpose of this hole {{is to reduce the}} amount of force needed for {{application}} by rolling the tubular portion outward. The force needed to apply a semitubular rivet is about 1/4 of the amount needed to apply a solid rivet. Tubular rivets are sometimes preferred for pivot points (a joint where movement is desired) since the swelling of the rivet is only at the tail. The type of equipment used to apply semi-tubular rivets range from prototyping tools to fully automated systems. Typical installation tools (from lowest to highest price) are hand set, manual squeezer, pneumatic squeezer, kick press, impact riveter, and finally PLC-controlled robotics. The most common machine is the impact riveter and the most common use of semitubular rivets is in lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, HVAC duct work, mechanical products, and electronics. They are offered from 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) in diameter (other sizes are considered highly special) and can be up to 8 inches (203 mm) long. A wide variety of materials and platings are available, most common base metals are steel, brass, copper, stainless, aluminum and most common platings are zinc, nickel, brass, tin. Tubular rivets are normally waxed to facilitate proper assembly. An installed tubular rivet has a head on one side, with a rolled over and exposed shallow blind hole on the other.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the project}} was to show the {{capability}} of increased tool velocities in riveting with selfpiercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b> The focus was on joints of high-strength steels with aluminum sheets. Also the combination of adhesive bonding with the high-speed riveting process was investigated. At some of the investigated sheet combinations a better joint quality, in terms of shaft groove filling, could be achieved by the high-speed joining process, whereby significant improvements in the connection strength properties could be reached. In addition, some investigations showed the ability to reduce the required width of the die forming ring by the usage of an elevated tool speed to reach a sufficient connection quality. Resulting benefits such as reduced deformation in the zone surrounding the joining point could also be demonstrated. By application of high-speed joining with self-piercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> as a hybrid joining technique (mechanical joining and adhesive bonding), an improved connectivity between the adhesive and the component was determined. A detailed process analysis showed that the different cutting behavior of the steel sheets at the high speed process is responsible for the advantages of the process in the first place, while the problem of early indentation of the forming ring in the die-sided sheet can also occur in the high-speed joining process. The impact of the early die indentation on the joint quality is less detrimental at the high speed process than at the conventional joining with self-piercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b> The sound emission of high speed process may represent a barrier to the use, as it comes due to sudden introduction of strong excitation energy of tools and components during the setting process. An implementation of the process in an industrial area requires further, more detailed studies about robust methods for the process control. Moreover, the test equipment developed for use in laboratory is relatively large, which limits the flexibility {{in the use of the}} investigated process. A high potential of high-speed joining as one solution for joining tasks could be revealed, where modern high and ultra-high strength steels are to be joined with significantly softer aluminum materials by self-piercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets...</b>|$|E

40|$|Accepted: 18 August 2012 Many light metals, such as {{aluminum}} and magnesium alloys, are promised to provide sig-nificant weight reduction for automobiles. However, {{the difficulties in}} welding these metals seriously hinder their large-scale applications. A new, hybrid mechanical joining process is proposed to avoid the inherited metallurgical complications in welding. By spinning and pressing a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> into the metals, a joint is formed with the locking from the rivet, a stirred/mixed zone around the <b>rivet,</b> and <b>solid</b> bonding at the faying interface. This rivet-ing process combines the actions of friction-stir welding in which metals of different sheets are mechanically mixed, and self-piercing riveting process which embeds a rivet in the sheets. Experiments have shown that such a friction-stir riveting process can produce joints of compa-rable strength to those created by other joining means, and {{can be applied to}} difficult-to-weld metals and dissimilar metals, such as aluminum-to-aluminum, magnesium-to-magnesium, and aluminum-to-magnesium...|$|R

Process variables are selected to investigate the effect of variables on the successful rivet setting and servicing in any structure as force transmitting member. Major variables in riveting process are material variables such as material properties and geometrical variables, which are dimensions of head, shank, and blank diameters. Analysis in this study is concentrated on the influence of variety of materials and of shank dimensions on the contact area after rivet setting, i. e. after forming process of rivet head. Soft and hard materials are selected as mother materials to investigate how the selection of material influences on the riveting process in quantitative manner.

Proper and reliable joining of these material combinations is a major challenge for mechanical joining techniques.

40|$|Riveting is a {{commonly}} used (especially in aircraft structures) method of joining metal and composite components. The methods of forming <b>solid</b> shank <b>rivets</b> {{can be classified}} in two types: static and dynamic. The static method is the most efficient one. Regrettably, its application is limited. A popular upsetting tool used in an aircraft is a pneumatic riveter. The rivet driving requires a few hammer strokes. The total stress in a riveted joint depends on the residual and applied stress. Residual post-riveting stress fields are widely accepted to have a beneficial influence on the fatigue life of aircraft structures. The analysis is carried out for a <b>solid</b> mushroom <b>rivet</b> (made of PA 25 alloy) joining two sheets (made of 2024 T 3 alloy). Nonlinear dynamic simulations of the upsetting process are carried out. Simulation of the riveting process is significantly influenced by a material model. The numerical calculations are performed for three different cases of upsetting described by the formed rivet head diameters 1. 4 d, 1. 5 d and 1. 6 d, respectively. The rivet head diameter and, consequently, the residual stress state depend on hammer stroke energy.

40|$|Hybrid (bolted/bonded) joining is {{becoming}} one of the innovative joining processes for light weight structures in the transport industry, especially in the aerospace industry where weight reduction and high joining requirements are permanent challenges. Combining the adhesive bonding with the mechanical joining -riveting for instance- can lead to an enhancement of the properties of the joint compared to the wide established riveting, {{as a result of a}} synergistic load bearing interaction between the fastener and the adhesive bondline. The influence of the rivet installation process on a hybrid joint regarding the joint stress state, the change of the bondline thickness as well as its effects on the joint performance and load transfer are some of the factors that drive the users to a better understanding of the hybrid joining process. This paper deals therefore on one hand with the numerical simulation of the rivet installation process in an adhesively bonded joint to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and on the other hand with the investigation of the load transfer depending on the joint parameters. In order to simulate the rivet installation in adhesively bonded aluminium (2024 -T 351) adherends, two models have been developed. One for a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> specified by the European standard EN 6081 another for a Lockbolt specified by the standards ASNA 2041 /ASNA 2045. The developed simulation model for the rivet installation process has been validated by comparing the simulation results with experiments regarding the qualitative change of the bondline thickness depending on the adhesive's Young's modulus and on the rivet type. The experimental rivet installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude. A generic numerical study to determine the effects of the adhesive's Young's modulus on the joint stress state and the effect of the rivet installation on the adhesive bondline has been carried out. In order to determine the load transfer behaviour in a hybrid joint, a single lap joint model for the above mentioned and aluminium (2024 -T 351) adherends has been developed. A generic study to investigate the effect of the rivet installation and the adhesive Young's modulus on the load transfer has been carried out. To validate the simulation model for the single lap shear test, the simulation results have been compared with the experiments regarding the force displacement curves...|$|R

This causes {{the disadvantage of}} dimensioning {{the width of the}} coining ring separately for every single joining task to avoid a prematurely coining during the stamping stage. The starting point for improvement respectively for the removal of these negative properties is the two-parted design of the anvil. Thus there can be realized a plane surface of coining ring and anvil ring during the stamping process. So an equal coining ring can be used for all joining tasks. The analyses show the advantages of the partitioned anvils especially in joining of different materials with distinct differences in strength. The use of two-parted anvils effects essential convenient technological conditions and an extended range of application of solid punch riveting...|$|E

The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the impact of the rivet hole sizing process on the fatigue life based on the example of the {{structural}} connections characteristic for riveted joints used in aviation industry. Test specimens reflected the structural connection consisting in a riveted lap joint of an airplane plating stiffened with a T-bar.

During fatigue tests, individual specimens with non-sized holes and with sized holes were subjected to uniaxial, one-sided, fixed-amplitude loading (R = 0). It can be concluded from the fatigue life comparison that introduction of an additional operation in the riveting process, i. e. the hole sizing, results in significant, about two-fold increase of the fatigue life of the riveted structural connection, even at slight sizing degree. The difference of the specimen damage nature was observed between specimens with sized and non-sized holes...|$|E
