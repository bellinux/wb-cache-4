5|$|Writer Howard Weinstein {{had been}} a fan of space {{exploration}} following the flight of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard on Mercury-Redstone 3. He recalled that his first experience of Star Trek was in middle school, where he mixed elements of the <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Lost in Space. He began watching the show and was inspired to write for television after reading The Making of Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry and Stephen E. Whitfield. While in the 11th grade, he had a Star Trek short story published in the fanzine Probe, which was a yearly publication in East Meadow High School. Weinstein also wrote a script for , but the script was turned down as it was not submitted via an agent. It was returned with a list of suggested agents, and his father recognised Bill Cooper's name on the list from their school years together.|$|E

25|$|Every {{single year}} Feyenoord fans {{look forward to}} the club's first {{training}} of the new season. They <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> thousands together and temporary stands are placed around the training pitch. Players signed during the summer will be seen by the fans in public {{for the first time and}} the players take some time to sign autographs after the training. Around the training pitch there are several other activities held before the first and in between the first and second training of the day. No other club in the Netherlands attracts as much supporters towards the first training and the new players are positively surprised every year. Despite finishing 9th in the Eredivisie in the 2006–07 season for instance the first training of the 2007–08 season broke all records when 20,000 fans showed up to support the team and to erase the previous season out of their minds.|$|E

25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, and the hope was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said {{that it was a good}} idea to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not many people would attend.|$|E
25|$|Zelena and Arthur are in {{the woods}} and come upon the witch’s home and is met by a giant wolf, only to have Zelena throws some {{sleeping}} powder on it to make it sleepy. The witch appears and says she won’t be as easy to subdue. Arthur asks for the magic helm and the witch says she already sent someone to look for it. Zelena holds her head near the cauldron and threatens her and the witch says Merida has it. Arthur is shocked that Merida escaped and Zelena promises to make her pay. They then <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Zelena demanding it while Merida asks why everyone wants it. Arthur says it has the power to make other men fight your battle and says he needs it but Merida says her father wouldn’t use magic to fight his battles. Mulan says they need the helm to protect their people but they don’t have it. Zelena takes Merida's bow to use as a tracking device, and tells her she can console herself with the memories of what a terrible ruler {{he turned out to be}} then tells Arthur they can use it to track the helm and they disappear.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy {{manages to}} swerve and drives off while the Viperox chase after them. Helicopters fly over head and fire at flying Viperox. Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where they see that it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, or it will completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS and grabs a cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him if the Doctor detonates it. The Doctor says he isn't going to set it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess. As the TARDIS departs, Cassie and Jimmy hold hands.|$|E

I was picturing one of his movies, {{and one of the}} female characters. I have a whole thing worked out. All Quentin has to do is <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a camera. I can't afford a director's fee." [...] However, when asked about the video, Tarantino said, [...] "I don't know. I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials. If it's not to make movies, I don't want to be on set." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} Tarwater boarded {{a plane and}} headed home. Later that day, Phelps, facing the {{prospect}} of competing in eight events at the Olympics, elected to drop the 200-meter freestyle from his program. Phelps' decision allowed Tarwater to move up into the sixth spot in the 200-meter freestyle and {{be added to the}} relay team. Tarwater said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the news and called it a [...] "storybook ending" [...] to his career. [...] "I was really content in walking away last night. [...] I was in peace and left with my faith intact. [...] To have this extra bout of joy is... surreal", he said. He immediately boarded another plane and flew back to Omaha, where the Trials were held, for a team meeting and practice. He told Olympic swim coach Gregg Troy, [...] "you won't see anyone <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> more focus and fire.... I will do everything I can to bolster the U.S. team." ...|$|E
500|$|Muntz {{continued}} with his [...] "Madman" [...] persona {{in many of}} his advertisements. In one TV commercial that normally aired after The Ed Sullivan Show, Muntz, dressed in red long johns and a Napoleon hat, promoted his new [...] televisions by saying, [...] "I wanna give 'em away, but Mrs. Muntz won't let me. She's crazy!" [...] Another TV commercial presented a marching-band song with lyrics about Muntz TVs and incorporated animations by Oskar Fischinger. His radio commercials, which Muntz ran up to 170times a day, initially followed a classical music theme built around the spelling of Muntz's name. However, he soon convinced radio stations to run ads {{more in line with}} his persona. In one spot, Muntz screamed [...] "Stop staring at your radio!" [...] He followed up his radio ads with a direct mail campaign, collecting thousands of TV knobs and mailing them to prospective customers with a note saying, [...] "Call us and we'll <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the set!" ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman of Allmusic called [...] "Carry Out" [...] the dirtiest {{track on}} the album and noted that the two artists aimed for a {{contemporary}} form of The Lonely Island's [...] "Dick in a Box" [...] (Incredibad, 2009), on which Timberlake was featured. Brian Linder of IGN commented that the production on the song is tight, but panned the single for its food-sex metaphors, calling it [...] "unforgivably stupid" [...] and [...] " [...] such a joke that we half expected Andy Samberg to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his dick in a happy meal box," [...] making reference to [...] "Dick in a Box", which premiered on Saturday Night Live in 2006. Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine called the collaboration and [...] "Say Something" [...] "admirable turns" [...] {{on the album}}, but commented that they are [...] "forced to operate with unenviably tepid production." [...] Cataldo concludes, writing, [...] "The overall laziness of that facet is even more inexcusable coming {{from one of the}} most renowned producers of the last decade." [...] Hugh Montgomery of The Observer noted it as one of the album's best tracks but called it [...] "merely passable" [...] and said it was [...] " [...] weighed down by [...] own leaden rapping and with nothing new to add to the familiar, futurist R formula." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008 Ohio {{experienced}} an unintended {{consequence of a}} new statute {{that resulted in a}} brief period of overlap voting, when absentee voting has started and before the close of voter registration. [...] This period ran from September 30 until October 6, due to the newly instituted early voting policy. On August 13, 2008, Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an absentee ballot. [...] Because a voter could <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> only a cell phone bill, give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity, the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party officials and Republican voters argued in separate lawsuits that Ohio law requires voters to be registered for 30 days before they cast an absentee ballot. On September 29, 2008 (a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same-day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan. [...] United States district court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio also ruled against the Republicans and issued a restraining order to enforce Brunner's plan. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. District Judge George Smith declined to rule on another statewide challenge, deferring to the state Supreme Court's decision. The rulings, which opened a window to register and vote on the same day until the absentee ballot deadline on October 6, 2008, was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in which two Republican jurists who were on the November 2008 ballot recused themselves and were replaced by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer. [...] The normal roster of Ohio Supreme Court jurists is all Republican and the lone Democrat replacement, William H. Wolff, Jr., cast the tie-breaking vote. [...] The dissenters noted that Ohio's Constitution requires that a person register to vote 30 days in before voting. Brunner ordered segregation of same-day-registration ballots and verification of them before counting them on Election Day, November 4, 2008. [...] In related proceedings on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus had granted an Ohio Republican Party request for a restraining order that would mandate election observers during early voting. [...] Brunner prevailed in the appellate court which ruled that the district court “abused its discretion” in granting the restraining order.|$|E

2500|$|On August 11, 1973, Clive Campbell aka DJ Kool Herc {{spun the}} {{turntables}} at a back-to-school, {{birthday party for}} his sister Cindy Campbell held in the recreation center at 1520 Sedgwick. He was assisted by Theodore Puccio who has been credited as the first MC but many insiders attribute that honor to Coke La Rock. After spending months perfecting a new technique involving [...] "playing the frantic grooves at the beginning or {{in the middle of}} the song" [...] with two turntables, a mixer, and two copies of the same record, Campbell unveiled the technique at his sister's party. [...] After renting the recreation room for 25 dollars, Cindy charged 25 cents for females and 50 cents for males to attend. [...] "I wrote out the invites on index cards, so all Herc had to do was <b>show</b> <b>up.</b> <b>With</b> the party set from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., our mom served snacks and dad picked up the sodas and beer from a local beverage warehouse." [...] With the exhibition of his new style, Campbell's friend Coke La Rock demonstrated another innovation called rapping. Attendees, or people who later claimed to be there, include Grandmaster Caz, leader of The Cold Crush Brothers, Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Afrika Bambaataa, Sheri Sher, Mean Gene, Kool DJ Red Alert, and KRS-One.|$|E
