5|$|Maximian's campaigns {{were not}} {{proceeding}} as smoothly.

Maximian issued a death-warrant for his larcenous subordinate.

5|$|On 18 February 2016, the INR in Warsaw {{announced}} it had seized {{a package of}} original documents that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Communist informant.

The documents' authenticity was confirmed by an archival expert, but the prosecutors demanded a handwriting examination. Eventually, the requested examination concluded that the documents were authentic and, hence, Wałęsa had collaborated with the communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|Pope Innocent, who had proclaimed a new crusade in 1213, {{wanted to}} persuade Leo {{to assist the}} crusaders.

5|$|The Nazis <b>seized</b> <b>from</b> the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel.

Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas <b>seized</b> <b>from</b> the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the 25 {{personnel}} of the Comité {{joined the}} CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side {{entrance to the}} building in which the operations took place, {{in order to maintain}} the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents <b>seized</b> <b>from</b> the PGT.|$|E

5|$|In 1191 Leo {{captured}} and rebuilt Bagras, a strategically important fortress that Saladin had <b>seized</b> <b>from</b> the Knights Templar and then destroyed before abandoning it. Bohemond ordered Leo {{to return it}} to the Templars, but Leo refused, stating that his right of recent conquest was stronger that the claim of the Templars who had lost their property. After Bohemond failed include Cilicia in his truce with Saladin in 1192, Leo invited him to Bagras to start negotiations. Bohemond accepted the offer, but Leo had him captured, forcing him to surrender Antioch. Although the noblemen (who were closely related to Armenian nobles) were willing to accept Leo's rule, the mainly Greek and Latin townspeople formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from occupying Antioch.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Eichmann {{was posted}} to Vienna to help organise Jewish {{emigration}} from Austria, which {{had just been}} integrated into the Reich through the Anschluss. Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish emigration. Funding came from money <b>seized</b> <b>from</b> other Jewish people and organisations, as well as donations from overseas, which were placed under SD control. Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant) in July 1938, and appointed to the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, created in August. By {{the time he left}} Vienna in May 1939, nearly 100,000 Jews had left Austria legally, and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms <b>seized</b> <b>from</b> college students in British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} the variability of psilocybin content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E
