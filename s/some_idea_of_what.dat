Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions {{from early}} explorers and {{settlers}} give <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Pine Creek Gorge was like {{before it was}} clearcut. The forest was up to 85percent hemlock and white pine, with the rest hardwoods. Many animal species that are now vanished inhabited the area. A herd of 12,000American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, foxes and bobcats, all save the last three now locally extinct. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks {{that they had to}} sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.|$|E

On 28 August, the Yorkshire Evening Post printed the comment, attributed to Lloyd George, [...] "If the exhibition of this Picture all over the world does not end War, God help civilisation". The film was shown to British troops in France from 5 September; Lieutenant-Colonel Rowland Feilding, an officer who saw the film in a muddy field near Morlancourt, described it as [...] "a wonderful and most realistic production" [...] but criticised the film for failing to record the sound of rifles and machine-guns, although there was an artillery accompaniment from guns firing nearby. Feilding suggested that the film could reassure new recruits, by giving them <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to expect in battle; the intertitles were forthright, describing images of injury and death.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{information}} and the increasing amount and availability of its basis, data, is changing scholarship to {{a more or less}} dramatic extent. New areas of research and knowledge have been created by the availability of machine-produced data, calculations, and simulations in various academic disciplines. In academic teaching, too, digitized sources and forms of learning are about to convert studying and lecturing to a considerable amount. However, no adequate infrastructure for digital information has emerged yet. Whereas in the field of scientific information providers (libraries, document centers, publishers etc.) new services, arrangements and business models are being experimented with, the scholarly disciplines are, by and large, lagging behind these developments, as are most scientific work practices and teaching in general. To sum up: An information infrastructure of scholarly information has been developed, but not one for scholarly information, yet.

40|$|The {{challenge}} of transboundary water management is geographically widespread throughout the world, but the responses towards it, and policies {{to address it}} can be quite different. There are few {{places in the world}} where the current approach can be said to be comprehensive, and we examine a number of prominent case studies {{from around the world to}} consider the various options currently available to manage international water courses. In so doing, we highlight both positive and negative issues which are frequently recurring, and suggest what issues can be considered as generic and definitive. In the second part of our paper, we present a summary of opinions collected from a number of water experts, with a view to identifying generic issues underlying the {{challenge of}} transboundary water issues. <b>Some</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> can be done to develop a best practice approach are presented, taking account of the wide diversity of issues which need to be addressed.
