5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

5|$|Both sides cite <b>strong</b> <b>evidence,</b> and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|Cassini has {{provided}} <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> that Enceladus has an ocean with an energy source, nutrients and organic molecules, making Enceladus {{one of the}} best places for the study of potentially habitable environments for extraterrestrial life. By contrast, the water thought to be on Jupiter's moon Europa is located under a much thicker layer of ice.|$|E
5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light.

On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.|$|E
5|$|Poe was {{increasingly}} unstable after his wife's death. He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman {{who lived in}} Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. There is also <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship. Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.|$|E
5|$|Some of his chansons were doubtless {{designed}} to be performed instrumentally. That Petrucci published many of them without text is <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> of this; additionally, some of the pieces (for example, the fanfare-like Vive le roy) contain writing more idiomatic for instruments than voices.|$|E

40|$|The authors review {{evidence}} {{regarding the}} biological processes that may link religiosity/spirituality to health. A {{growing body of}} observational evidence supports the hypothesis that links religiosity/spirituality to physiological processes. Although much of the earliest evidence came from cross-sectional studies with questionable generalizability and potential confounding, more recent research, with more representative samples and multivariate analysis, provides <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> linking Judeo-Christian religious practices to blood pressure and immune function. The <b>strongest</b> <b>evidence</b> comes from randomized interventional trials reporting the beneficial physiological impact of meditation (primarily transcendental meditation). Overall, available evidence is generally consistent with the hypothesis that religiosity/spirituality is linked to healthrelate...|$|R
50|$|The RTB model {{predicts that}} future anthropological and genetic {{research}} will increasingly confirm {{that humans are}} biologically distinct rather than descended from a hominid species. It predicts <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> for humanity's genetic, anatomical, and behavioral uniqueness. It places the earliest hominids at 6.5 million years ago and the first humans at around fifty thousand years ago. Naturalistic models predict <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> against humanity's uniqueness. Young-earth models predict that advancing research will prove that present-day humans are anatomically, genetically, and behaviorally identical to modern humans, and that all hominid species came into existence in the past 10,000 years.|$|R
5|$|Marcus went {{to great}} lengths to {{sanitize}} her own and Wyatt's history. For example, she worked hard to keep both her name and the name of Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, , and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> to the contrary exists.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory {{announced}} {{evidence that}} the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> for water absorption in the planet's atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet's star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E

5|$|There is <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{circumcision}} {{reduces the}} risk of men acquiring HIV infection in areas of the world with high rates of HIV. Evidence among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa shows an absolute decrease in risk of 1.8% which is a relative decrease of between 38percent and 66percent over twoyears, and in this population studies rate it cost effective. Whether it is of benefit in developed countries is undetermined.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given <b>strong</b> <b>evidence</b> that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|Darwin then {{presented}} the <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> that human races {{are all the}} same species, noting that when races mixed together, they intercrossed beyond the [...] "usual test of specific distinctness" [...] and that characteristics identifying races were highly variable. He put great weight on the point that races graduate into each other, writing [...] "But the most weighty of all the arguments against treating the races of man as distinct species, is that they graduate into each other, independently in many cases, {{as far as we can}} judge, of their having intercrossed", and concluded that the <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> was that they were not different species.|$|R

IV-based tests for contemporaneous causality provide <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> of price impact. We find even <b>stronger</b> <b>evidence</b> that changes in index positions can help predict future changes in aggregate commodity price indices.
