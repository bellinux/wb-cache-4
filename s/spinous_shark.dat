He named it Squalus brucus, from the Greek brux or bruchios meaning [...] "from {{the depths of the}} sea". The type specimen has since been lost. In 1816, Henri de Blainville created the genus Echinorhinus for this species. Until the 1960s, specimens of the prickly shark (E. cookei) caught in the Pacific Ocean were misidentified as bramble sharks. Other common names for this species are <b>spinous</b> <b>shark</b> and spiny shark.|$|E

Pietschmann named the shark in honor of C. Montague Cooke Jr., a conchologist at the Bishop Museum. However, prickly sharks were continually misidentified as bramble sharks (E. brucus) and referred to as such in scientific literature until 1960, when Jack Garrick redescribed the species. Since the original holotype from Kauai, Hawaii had been lost, Garrick designated a [...] long male from Palliser Bay, New Zealand as a new type specimen. Other common names for this species include Cook's bramble shark and <b>spinous</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
