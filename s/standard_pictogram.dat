40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{association}} of obesity and physical activity at young ages with subsequent risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients and methods: Between 2003 and 2007, we conducted a case-control study in a high-risk population in northeastern Iran. Three hundred ESCC cases and 571 matched controls were recruited. Each individual was shown a <b>standard</b> <b>pictogram,</b> to report body size at ages 15 and 30. Demographic and health-related information, including physical activity at these ages was also collected. Results: In the fully adjusted models, very obese body size (last two pictograms) at age 15 odds ratio (OR) 3. 2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 3 - 7. 7 and age 30 (OR 3. 1; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 8. 5) were associated with ESCC in women, but not in men. Sedentary work at age 15 (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 8. 3) and 30 (OR 18. 2, 95 % CI 3. 9 - 86. 2) were also associated with ESCC risk in women only. The increased risk in women at age 15 remained high after later reduction in body size, while women who became very obese only at age 30 did not show a significantly increased risk. Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of early lifestyle modifications in the context of cancer prevention, particularly in women.

50|$|A laundry symbol, {{also called}} a care symbol, is a {{pictogram}} which represents {{a method of}} washing, for example drying, dry-cleaning and ironing clothing. Such symbols are written on labels, known as care labels or care tags, attached to clothing to indicate how a particular item should best be cleaned. Standard symbols for these care labels differ by region. In some <b>standards,</b> <b>pictograms</b> coexist with or are complemented by written instructions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Every activity, {{whether in}} {{manufacturing}} or {{the service sector}} has just three stages. They are the inputs, {{the process and the}} outputs. The inputs include money, materials, manpower, machine and energy. The outputs include perfect products or services, with supporting activities like marketing and inventory management. Total Quality Management (TQM) improves the Quality of a product by improving the process. It also reduces costs by minimizing the waste because if management doesn’t make mistakes, it all saves {{a lot of time and}} money. Having worked out what its processes are, the company can analyze (or 'map') them in more detail. There are two benefits from mapping the processes. Mapping helps to understand how the business works and also helps to improve the existing process. <b>Standard</b> <b>pictograms</b> can be used to show what happens in a process. Using symbols gives a mor...|$|R
