5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of {{optical fiber cable}} connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E

25|$|The JSAT {{constellation}} is {{a communication}} and broadcasting satellite constellation formerly operated by JSAT Corporation and currently by SKY Perfect JSAT Group.

25|$|When {{satellites}} {{reach the}} end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch), <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit. Historically, due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite Vanguard 1. Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1, the 4th manmade satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of August 2009.|$|E
2500|$|SKY Perfect JSAT Group {{has gone}} through some {{significant}} mergers and acquisition and the JSAT constellation [...] has grown accordingly. It has practically amalgamated all private <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> in Japan, with only B-SAT left as a competitor. Since these mergers {{were the result of}} the opening of the communication markets in Japan, that growth does not meant that it has monopolized the segment, but rather is the go-to company for space segment operation.|$|E
2500|$|Also, it is {{very easy}} to {{transmit}} a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder. It is common for Earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. <b>Satellite</b> <b>operators</b> now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, SpaceX had won nine {{contracts}} out of 20 {{that were}} openly competed worldwide in 2014 at commercial launch service providers. Space media reported that SpaceX had [...] "already {{begun to take}} market share" [...] from Arianespace. Arianespace has requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX. European <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> are pushing the ESA to reduce Ariane 5 and the future Ariane 6 rocket launch prices {{as a result of}} competition from SpaceX. According to one Arianespace managing director in 2015, it was clear that [...] "a very significant challenge [...] coming from SpaceX ... Therefore things have to change ... and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined." [...] Jean Botti, Director of innovation for Airbus (which makes the Ariane 5) warned that [...] "those who don't take Elon Musk seriously will have a lot to worry about." [...] In 2014, no commercial launches were booked to fly on the Russian Proton rocket.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of MacDougall's jamming, and ambiguity about the federal misdemeanor charge made against him under 47 U.S.C. § 301, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. [...] ) which made satellite hijacking a felony. The FCC subsequently implemented strict requirements that all radio and television transmitters must have an electronic name tag for tracking purposes. The Automatic Transmitter Identification System (ATIS) was developed {{in response to the}} Captain Midnight jamming incident. It allows <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> to quickly identify unauthorized uplink transmissions. In 2009, HBO and Elmer Musser were awarded a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for ATIS. Although HBO has not been targeted since the channel's signal power was increased to {{make it more difficult for}} hijackers to intrude, there have been multiple instances of uplink video piracy across the United States. One such incident happened in November 1987, when WGN-TV in Chicago had its transmission briefly interrupted by a man in a Max Headroom mask, and that same evening, the signal of PBS affiliate WTTW was overridden for one-and-a-half minutes, where the same person mooned the viewing audience and had his buttocks struck with a fly swatter. The jamming did not appear to affect HBO's pricing policies in the long-term.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC World Service {{encompasses}} an English 24-hour global {{radio network}} and separate services in 27 other languages. News and {{information is available}} in these languages on the BBC website, with many having RSS feeds and specific versions for use on mobile devices, and some also offer email notification of stories. In addition to the English service, 18 of the language services broadcast a radio service using the short wave, AM or FM bands. These are also available to listen live or can be listened to later (usually for seven days) over the Internet and, {{in the case of}} seven language services, can be downloaded as podcasts. News is also available from the BBC News 'app', which is available from both iTunes and the Google Play Store. In recent years, video content has also been used by the World Service: 16 language services show video reports on the website, and the Arabic and Persian services have their own television channels. [...] TV is also used to broadcast the radio service, with local cable and <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> providing the English network (and occasionally some local language services) free to air. The English service is also available on digital radio in the UK and Europe.|$|E

The study was done for Hellas-Sat (the Greek <b>satellite</b> <b>operator)</b> and addresses a real situation. Data concerning demands of several customers were collected using those available in particular organizations and corresponding to the area that Hellas-Sat covers. These data was first classified and statistically treated. Second a decision tree has been created where the statistical characteristics taken from {{the first part of the}} study, were used in order to derive optimal leasing policies/scenarios and characterize them in terms of both profit and risk. The final outcome is a decision making tool which can be used by a <b>Satellite</b> <b>Operator</b> in order to evaluate possible states, profits and associated risks. © ECMS, 2006...|$|R
