50|$|The {{stability}} of the emulsion can depend on the molecular weight of the accompanying polyelectrolyte. Polyelectrolytes of a high molecular weight are the most effective at stabilization.

50|$|Cryogenic gas {{molecules}} {{are used}} as scaffolds for nanocluster synthesis in solid state. In aqueous medium there are two common methods for stabilizing nanoclusters: electrostatic (charge, or inorganic) stabilization and steric (organic) stabilization. Electrostatic stabilization occurs by the adsorption of ions to the often-electrophilic metal surface, which creates an electrical double layer. Thus, this Coulomb repulsion force between individual particles will {{not allow them to}} flow freely without agglomeration. Whereas on the other hand in steric stabilization,the metal center is surrounded by layers of sterically bulk material. These large adsorbates provide a <b>steric</b> <b>barrier</b> which prevents close contact of the metal particle centers.|$|E

This is especially prevalent in sterically constrained systems, where the WH-product has an added <b>steric</b> <b>barrier</b> to overcome.

50|$|Dispersions {{may become}} stable through two {{different}} phenomena: charge repulsion and steric or entropic repulsion. In charge repulsion, particles that possess the same like electrostatic charges repel each other. Alternatively, steric or entropic repulsion {{is a phenomenon}} {{used to describe the}} repelling effect when adsorbed layers of material (e.g. polymer molecules swollen with solvent) are present {{on the surface of the}} pigment particles in dispersion. Only certain portions (i.e. anchors) of the polymer molecules are adsorbed, with their corresponding loops and tails extending out into the solution. As the particles approach each other their adsorbed layers become crowded; this provides an effective <b>steric</b> <b>barrier</b> that prevents flocculation. This crowding effect is accompanied by a decrease in entropy, whereby the number of conformations possible for the polymer molecules is reduced in the adsorbed layer. As a result, energy is increased and often gives rise to repulsive forces that aid in keeping the particles separated from each other.|$|E

30|$|At the {{chemical}} level, the environmental conditions during the linker-building process, {{as well as}} the probe attachment process, must be carefully selected to ensure mean equilibrium spacings that are small in comparison with the device geometry.

However, care must be taken as a very dense DNA layer can severely hinder hybridization due to the <b>steric</b> <b>barriers</b> involved. Additionally, a very dense linker layer will transform the layer into the “brush” regime [20], possibly with serious conformation and DNA immobilization consequences. Thus, the exposure time for immobilization must be long enough such that statistical biases are not amplified but must not be too long to render the layer impermeable to targets. The unused linker molecules should be deactivated so that they only act as ionic barriers but not as energy wells for adsorption.|$|R

The inter-acting forces between two lipid bilayers bearing the anchored NIPAM copolymer were measured with a surface force apparatus. The pH-triggered content release was evalu-ated in buffer before and after incubation in human serum. The pharmacokinetics was determined in rats following the intravenous injection of 67 Ga-loaded liposomes with or without the polymer coating. The force measurements between lipid bilayers showed that NIPAM copolymers provide a <b>steric</b> <b>barrier</b> that was dependent on pH. The pH-sensitive liposomes maintained their pH sensitivity after incubation in serum. In vivo, the polymer-coated liposomes exhibited a prolonged circulation time in rats, with an area under the blood concentration–time curve that is 1. 6 -fold higher than the control formulation.

Several trajectories are generated, starting from random coil configurations {{and going to the}} native state, that are a few angstroms root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the native structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{provide insight}} into the first stages of a kinetic {{mechanism}} of lateral drug expulsion from the active site of HIV- 1 protease, by conducting all atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent over a time scale of 25 ns for saquinavir bound to the wildtype, G 48 V, L 90 M and G 48 V/ L 90 M mutant proteases. We find a consistent escape mechanism associated with the G 48 V mutation. First, increased hydrophilic and hydrophobic flap coupling and water mediated disruption of catalytic dyad hydrogen bonding induce drug motion away from the dyad and promote protease flap transition to the semi-open form. Conversely flap-inhibitor motion is decoupled in the wildtype. Second, the decrease of total interactions causes unidirectional lateral inhibitor translation by up to 4 Å toward the P 3 subsite exit of the active site, increased P 3 subsite exposure to solvent and a complete loss of hydrophobic interactions with {{the opposite end of the}} active site. The P 1 subsite moves beyond the hydrophobic active site side pocket, the only remaining <b>steric</b> <b>barrier</b> to complete expulsion being the “breathable ” residue, P 81. Significant inhibitor deviation is reported over 25 ns, and subsequent complete expulsion, implemented using steered molecular dynamics simulations, is shown to occur most easily for the G 48 V-containing mutants. Our simulations thus provide compelling support for lateral drug escape from a protease in a semi-open flap conformation. It is likely that some mutations take advantage of this escape mechanism to increase the rate of inhibitor dissociation from the protease. Finally, unidirectional translation may be countered by designing inhibitors with terminal subsites that provide sufficient anchoring to the flaps, thus increasing the <b>steric</b> <b>barrier</b> for translation in either direction. 25 2...|$|E

In the null Drosophila mutant for the trehalose receptor (∆EP 19), the response to glycerol showed no change, in sharp contrast with a characteristic drastic decrease in the response to trehalose. The glycerol concentration–response curves for I-type and L-type labellar hairs were statistically indistinguishable, while those for sucrose, D-glucose, D-fructose and trehalose were clearly different. These all indicate the presence of a specific receptor site for glycerol. The glycerol site was characterized by comparing the effectiveness of various derivatives of glycerol.

The physicochemical characterization of the NC included an investigation of their properties, such as surface charge, size, hydrophilicity, morphology and homogeneity. This is the "rst time that such properties have been correlated with biological interactions for NC, a novel carrier system with a structure more complex than nanospheres. C 3 crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed the reduced activation for NC with longer PEG chain and higher density, although all formulations induced C 3 cleavage to a lesser or greater extent. NC bearing PEG covalently bound to the surface were weaker activators of complement than plain PLA [poly(D,L-lactide) ] NC or nanospheres (NS). Furthermore, the #uorescent/confocal microscopy of J 774 A 1 cells in contact with NC reveal a dramatically reduced interaction with PEG-bearing NC. However, the way in which PEG was attached (covalent or adsorbed) seemed to a!ect the mechanism of uptake. Taken together, these results suggest that the low level of protein binding to NC covered with a high density of 20 kDa PEG chains is likely to be due to the <b>steric</b> <b>barriers</b> surrounding these particles, which prevents protein adsorption and reduces their interaction with macrophages. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The spectrokinetics of photodissociated CO complexes of human hemoglobin and its isolated α and β chains were analyzed for the effect of heme hydration on ligand rebinding. A strong coupling was observed between heme hydration and quaternary state.

An initial 150 ns hydration phase increased the R-state distal pocket water occupancy, nw(R), to a level similar to that of the isolated α (∼ 60 %) and β (∼ 10 %) chains, resulting in a modest barrier to ligand binding. A subsequent phase, concurrent with the first step of the R → T transition, further increased the level of heme hydration, increasing the barrier. The final phase, concurrent with the final step of the allosteric transition, brought the water occupancy of the T-state tetramer, nw(T), even higher and close to full occupancy in both the α and β subunits (∼ 90 %).
