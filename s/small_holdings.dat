5|$|The {{result of}} these changes were the Lowland Clearances, by which {{hundreds}} of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled, their occupants forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn of Ormiston to house the displaced cottars {{on the outskirts of the}} new ranch-style farms, or to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, or northern England. Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada or the United States, finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land.|$|E
25|$|The {{land reform}} that was {{ultimately}} carried out did however reflect {{the influence of}} some ideas supported by Mihalache, and was itself favorable to <b>small</b> <b>holdings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The British Raj {{extended}} over almost all present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, except for <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> by other European {{nations such as}} Goa and Pondicherry.|$|E
50|$|Helen Springs was {{acquired}} by the Vestey Group in 1944 {{as well as some}} other <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> in the area as part of extending their operations in the Northern Territory.|$|R
50|$|The Clarke Family {{were the}} local landlords {{who came to}} Farran in 1840. They lived there until 1937 when the estate was sold to the Land Commission, who divided it into <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings.</b>|$|R
50|$|When Thisted {{county was}} organized, the priory {{buildings}} were {{converted into a}} manor house for the local magistrate. Over time the manor estate was broken into <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings.</b> By 1901 only the west range of the former priory was preserved with some of its Gothic arched windows intact.|$|R
25|$|Valpolicella is a viticultural {{zone of the}} {{province}} of Verona, Italy, east of Lake Garda. The hilly agricultural and marble-quarrying region of <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> north of the Adige is famous for wine production. Valpolicella ranks just after Chianti in total Italian Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine production.|$|E
25|$|The {{north and}} western {{parts of the}} {{territory}} relied on a pastoral farming economy; the south-east enjoyed warmer weather and conducted mixed-arable and pastoral farming, based around <b>small</b> <b>holdings.</b> The region enjoyed a strong and diverse maritime economy including active ports of trade and fishing. Over {{the time of the}} Duchy, many currencies were present, and the Dukes of Brittany sometimes minted their own coins. Gold and silver were also used for trade.|$|E
25|$|Xalapa {{is often}} called the “Flower Garden of Mexico” and flowers play an {{important}} role in the economy. Xalapa is one of the most important places for coffee production in Mexico due to its ideal climate, and coffee beans are grown on both <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> and large estates in the surrounding mountains. The tobacco industry also forms a part of the local economy with the process of producing cigarettes, and the growing of tropical fruits. Processed foods and beverages are also produced in Xalapa.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{explored}} by Breal Bennett in 1817 and Thomas Mitchell in 1836. The 'Condoublin' run {{was established by}} 1844. There had been squatters in the district since Mitchell's 1836 exploration. Closer settlement of the area began in 1880 when the large runs were broken up into <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Much of Dewa Province was {{controlled}} by the powerful Mogami clan during the Sengoku period. However, the Mogami were dispossessed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1622, {{with the majority of}} their holdings going to the Satake clan, who were transferred from Hitachi Province, to their new (and much <b>smaller)</b> <b>holdings</b> at Kubota Domain.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} {{his role as a}} land campaigner, in the early 1900s Hayden was himself the target for hostile {{agitation}} headed by Laurence Ginnell, who saw him as symbolising the Irish Party’s hypocritical tolerance of ‘grazing’, the operation of large tracts of land for cattle-rearing rather than as <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> for poorer farmers.|$|R
25|$|This is {{a variety}} of ridge plough notable in that the blade points towards the operator. It is used solely by human effort rather than with animal or machine assistance, and is pulled {{backwards}} by the operator, requiring great physical effort. It is particularly used for second breaking of ground, and for potato planting. It is found in Shetland, some western crofts and more rarely Central Scotland. The tool is typically found on <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> too small or poor to merit use of animals.|$|E
25|$|In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4–2hectares (1–5acres) in size, while 40% were of 2–6hectares (5–15acres). Holdings were {{so small}} that no crop other than {{potatoes}} would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> could not support their families after paying their rent, except by earnings of seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland. Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.|$|E
25|$|At the {{entrance}} to the Otago Harbour the peninsula rises to Taiaroa Head, home to a breeding colony of northern royal albatross, the only colony of albatross to be found on an inhabited mainland. The viewing centre for the albatross colony is one of the peninsula's main ecotourism attractions, along with other wildlife such as seals and yellow-eyed penguins. Most of the Otago Peninsula is freehold farming land, with increasing numbers of <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> or lifestyle blocks. Some biodiversity sites such as Taiaroa Head are managed as sanctuaries for wildlife. Many species of seabirds and waders in particular may be found around the tidal inlets, including spoonbills, plovers, and herons.|$|E
50|$|Other land, in particular, tenements {{belonged to}} early Lord Beauchamps, early 15th century co-heirs, Elizabeth Beauchamp (married Urias Seymour) and Cicely Beauchamp (married Sir Roger Seymour), with these <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> thus {{owned by the}} Seymour family, devolving to {{combined}} heir Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset before the 1573 purchase of the manor outright.|$|R
50|$|In 1763, St. Vincent {{was taken}} over by the British and the lands in Layou were bought by them to {{cultivate}} sugar. Layou was still a small area formed around Jackson Bay. The cultivation of sugar cane started growing and larger estates were needed, so that the <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> of the French were consolidated into larger estates.|$|R
50|$|The early 1970s land boom, {{which saw}} much land redeveloped into <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings,</b> {{was the end}} of any serious {{potential}} for farming as a means of supporting a family in Ourimbah. Land use once again changed, with pockets of urban development amongst the acreages, themselves now valuable for the leisure opportunities they offered rather than as agricultural holdings.|$|R
25|$|The Babenberg Margraves {{controlled}} {{very little}} of modern Austria. Salzburg, historically part of Bavaria became an ecclesiastical territory, while Styria {{was part of the}} Carinthian Duchy. The Babenbergs had relatively <b>small</b> <b>holdings,</b> with not only Salzburg but the lands of the Diocese of Passau lying {{in the hands of the}} church, and the nobility controlling much of the rest. However they embarked on a programme of consolidating their power base. One such method was to employ indentures servants such as the Kuenringern family as Ministeriales and given considerable military and administrative duties. They survived as a dynasty through good fortune and skill at power politics, in that era dominated by the continual struggle between emperor and papacy.|$|E
25|$|Although some estate holders {{improved}} {{the quality of}} life of their displaced workers, the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly becoming known as the Lowland Clearances, when hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled, their occupants forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn's Ormiston or Archibald Grant's Monymusk on the outskirts of the new ranch-style farms, to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, or northern England. Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada or the United States, finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Pétion {{broke up}} the former colonial estates and parceled out the land into <b>small</b> <b>holdings.</b> In Pétion's south, the gens de couleur {{minority}} led the government and feared losing popular support, and thus, sought to assuage class tensions with land redistribution. Because of the weak international position and its labor policies (most peasants lived through a subsistence economy), Pétion's government was perpetually {{on the brink of}} bankruptcy. Yet, for most of its time, it produced one of the most liberal and tolerant Haitian governments ever. In 1815, at a key period of Bolívar's fight for Venezuelan independence, he gave the Venezuelan leader asylum and provided him soldiers and substantial material support. It also had the least of internal military skirmishes, despite its continuous conflicts with Christophe's northern kingdom. In 1816, however, after finding the burden of the Senate intolerable, he suspended the legislature and turned his post into President for Life. Not long after, he died of yellow fever, and his assistant Jean-Pierre Boyer replaced him.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1890s, the {{forestry}} industry was gaining momentum and importance in British Columbia and Charles began to invest in timber lands. In 1903, he founded Pretty's Timber Exchange. The corporation acted as brokers for timber limits scattered throughout the province, accumulating large acreages for sale by buying up numbers of <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings.</b> This was a huge success.|$|R
50|$|Philip {{was born}} about 1070 to 1073, {{the son of}} William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber (d. circa 1093/96) by his wife Eve de Boissey or Agnes de St. Clare. William de Braose {{had participated in the}} Norman conquest of England. He had been rewarded with the feudal barony of Bramber in Sussex and <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> in Dorset, Wiltshire, Berkshire and Surrey.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 December 1919, Small {{disappeared}} {{and his body}} was never recovered. He was 56 years old. It was alleged {{at the time that}} Small's wife and her lover killed Small and cremated his body in the London Ontario Grand Opera theater furnace (one of <b>Small's</b> <b>holdings).</b> It was further alleged that a police inspector was involved in a [...] "cover-up" [...] of Small's disappearance.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other wine {{regions of}} France (such as Bordeaux), {{winemaking}} in the Cote de Nuits exist {{on a very}} small scale. The typical domaine estate produces from 50 to 1,000 cases of wine a year, {{in contrast to a}} Bordeaux chateau which often makes more than 20,000 cases annually. Vineyards in the area are highly fragmented, with multiple owners each owning pieces of a family. A producer may own only 2 to 3 rows of vines in a vineyard which they could either produce as a separate wine or blend with the production of other similarly <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> in other vineyards in the region. These blended wines will generally take on a larger scale designation of a village or district-level wines. Those producers who keep the production separate and unblended (such as for a Grand cru or Premier cru level wine) will make several batches of very small quantities of wine that can fetch high prices due to demand for their limited supply. A third option is to sell the grapes or wine to a negociant who may be able to purchase similar lots from the same vineyard to produce more cases of that Grand cru or Premier cru level wine.|$|E
25|$|Abruzzo's {{industrial}} sector expanded rapidly, especially in mechanical engineering, transportation equipment and telecommunications. The structure of {{production in the}} region reflects {{the transformation of the}} economy from agriculture to industry and services. Although industry has developed strongly, it retains weak points due to the existence of only a few large businesses alongside a huge fabric of small and medium-sized businesses. Both pure and applied research are carried out in the region, where there are major institutes and factories involved in research in the fields of pharmaceutics, biomedicine, electronics, aerospace and nuclear physics. The industrial infrastructure is spread throughout the region in industrial zones which have already been mentioned, the most important of which are Val Pescara, Val Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino. A further activity worthy of note is seaside and mountain tourism, which is of considerable importance to the economy of the region. Agriculture, involving <b>small</b> <b>holdings,</b> has succeeded in modernising and offering high-quality products. The mostly small, agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, sugar beet, potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Traditional products are saffron and liquorice. Most famous in the world is Abruzzo's wine Montepulciano d'Abruzzo; in the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as being {{one of the most widely}} exported DOC classed wine in Italy.|$|E
500|$|The {{purchase}} {{was part}} of the corporation's ultimately unsuccessful plan to retain the pail closet system (now superseded by the water closet), and followed a public scandal created by the daily dumping of 30–60tons of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers, at Holt Town sewage works. [...] It paid about £38,000 (£ as of [...] ), for the site, but the bog's depth, between [...] deep pushed the total development cost to almost £94,000 (£ as of [...] ). [...] The [...] estate included [...] of wild mossland, [...] of partly cultivated mossland, [...] of mossland under cultivation and [...] of incomplete roads. [...] A number of brick buildings were included, along with Asphodel Farm and Ash Farm, both with wooden farmhouses. [...] The corporation rented [...] of land in <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> to local farmers and kept [...] for itself.|$|E
5000|$|Werribee at {{this time}} was very popular for development. Thomas Chirnside, a person famous in this area even today, was {{attracted}} to the open plain's suitability for agricultural uses. By 1863 he controlled more than 280 square kilometres around Werribee. Chirnside bought other <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> of land {{at this time}}. The town grew steadily, helped by a railway line from Melbourne to Geelong, with a station at Werribee in 1857.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a few <b>small</b> agricultural <b>holdings,</b> {{as well as one}} area of densely populated alone standing housing.|$|R
50|$|The {{plantation}} system declined {{following the}} Civil War, {{and the land}} was broken up into <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings.</b> No residents were paid the going rate for the land {{that was used to}} build the submarine base. One land owner was paid four thousand dollars for 62 acres of deep water land. Such residents harvested shrimp, fish and other seafood, and trapped and hunted to supplement small-scale farming of corn, sugar and other vegetables.|$|R
500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century there was a {{conscious}} attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun, and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. Hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled. Of those that remained many were now crofters: poor families living on [...] "crofts"—very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals, with kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service as important sources of revenue. Many lived in blackhouses with double thickness walls about [...] high, made of local stone and packed with rubble and earth and thatched with reeds. They were unfaced inside and were usually warmed by a peat fire on a slab floor, the smoke from which gave them their name. Others were forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn at Ormiston and Archibald Grant's Monymusk, to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, northern England, or to Canada or the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Horthy {{appointed}} Count Pál Teleki {{as prime}} minister in July 1920. His government issued a numerus clausus law that limited the admission of [...] "political insecure elements" [...] (these were often Jews) to universities and took initial steps towards fulfilling a promise of major land reform by dividing about 3,850km2 from the largest estates into <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> in order to quiet rural discontent. Teleki's government resigned, however, after Charles, the former emperor of Austria and king of Hungary, attempted unsuccessfully to retake Hungary's throne in March 1921.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{approximately}} 250,000 coffee growers in India; 98% {{of them are}} small growers. Over 90 {{percent of them are}} small farms consisting of [...] or fewer. According to published statistics for 2001–2002, the total area under coffee in India was [...] with <b>small</b> <b>holdings</b> of 175,475 accounting for 71.2%. The area under large holding of more than [...] was [...] (only 9.1% of all holdings) only under 167 holdings.

50|$|The gallery has an {{extensive}} collection of British Victorian art, including major works by Lord Frederic Leighton and Sir Edward John Poynter. It has <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> of Dutch, French and Italian painters of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, such as Peter Paul Rubens, Canaletto, Bronzino, Domenico Beccafumi and Niccolò dell'Abbate.

5000|$|Much of Dewa Province was {{controlled}} by the powerful Mogami clan during the Sengoku period. The Mogami established a subsidiary holding centered on Sakanobe Castle {{in what is now}} Mamurogawa, Yamagata based on the Sengoku period foundations of a structure erected by the Onodera clan. However, the Mogami were dispossessed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1622, with the majority of their holdings going to the Satake clan, who were transferred from Hitachi Province to their new (and much <b>smaller)</b> <b>holdings</b> at Kubota Domain.|$|R
50|$|The bulk of {{the land}} {{acquisition}} for the Patagonia National Park project occurred in 2004 with {{the purchase of the}} 173,000-acre Estancia Valle Chacabuco, formerly one of Chile’s largest sheep ranches, and a long-time conservation priority for the Chilean parks service due to its unique array of native ecosystems. Since 2004, the organization has been purchasing <b>smaller</b> <b>holdings</b> from willing sellers in the Chacabuco Valley, with the goal of creating a continuous reserve to meet the edges of the nearbyJeinimeni and Tamango National Reserves.|$|R
