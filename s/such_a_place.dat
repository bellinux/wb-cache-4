5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, a low-lying country, dams {{were often}} applied to block rivers {{in order to}} {{regulate}} the water level and to prevent the sea from entering the marsh lands. Such dams often {{marked the beginning of}} a town or city because it was easy to cross the river at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place,</b> and often gave rise to the respective place's names in Dutch.|$|E

50|$|According to Hinkelmann (1970), {{the village}} of Ruppertsweiler, {{although}} it likely lay within Dennweiler-Frohnbach’s current limits, might instead have lain in the so-called Baumholder Loch, that is to say, within Körborn’s current limits. Likewise in the Baumholder Loch once supposedly lay <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Höfchen (“Little Estate”).

25|$|Following a {{visit to}} Disneyland in Anaheim, California, shortly after its opening, wealthy real estate {{developer}} Angus G.

The agreement was confirmed by the Crown, and the traders were granted the necessary license, although the store was not built until 1786.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there were many}} {{uncertainties}} about moving to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> as America. Stories had come back from there about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, {{that there would be}} no source of food or water, that exposure to unknown diseases was possible, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation that was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in what came to be known as the Eighty Years' War, and there was fear over what the attitudes of Spain might be toward them.|$|E
25|$|A {{special case}} of {{geographical}} names were those {{derived from a}} building or landmark, e.g. a Busch (bush) or Springborn (spring/well). Before the advent of street names and numbers, even for long times afterwards, many important buildings like inns, mills and farmsteads were given names (see also Der Lachs zu Danzig). <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> was often better known than {{the people living in}} it; the people would get their 'family' name from the building. This name could be combined with a profession: Rosenbauer (rose-farmer, from a farmstead called 'the rose'); Kindlmüller (child's miller, from a mill named 'the Christmas child', 'the prodigal child' or 'the king's child'). The name of the building could also be used as is: Bär (Bear); Engels (from Engel, angel).|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Morrison {{released}} The Healing Game. The album received mixed reviews, {{with the}} lyrics being described as [...] "tired" [...] and [...] "dull", though critic Greil Marcus praised the musical {{complexity of the}} album by saying: [...] "It carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete {{he or she might}} have forgotten that music could call up <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place,</b> and then populate it with people, acts, wishes, fears." [...] The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone. His next release, 1999's Back on Top, achieved a modest success, being his highest charting album in the US since 1978's Wavelength.|$|E

Mitch Conner reminds Cartman that he is [...] "half-Bronco" [...] as well and tells him that makes him [...] "pretty cool" [...] and departs. The boys find Cruise crying for a place in which he can live without fear of mockery. Stan, Kenny and Kyle promise to help Cruise get to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place.</b> The episode's closing shot is of Cruise's corpse lying on the Moon's surface alongside the corpse of the orca featured in [...] "Free Willzyx".|$|E
500|$|Robbins himself {{believes}} {{that the concept of}} Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever [...] "jail" [...] someone finds themselves, from a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or unfree, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money laundering scam.|$|E

It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, ultimately saying the episode began the Simpsons fourth season in an amazing way. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, had mixed views about the episode. They said that it is [...] "A bit baffling to non-Americans unfamiliar with the summer camp system. But top grade stuff nonetheless.

[...] The episode's reference to Ben-Hur was named the 31st greatest film reference {{in the history of the}} show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{finds an}} Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency {{operative}} named Skip (Vince Colosimo) {{and that he}} is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by those who remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running [...] "side operations" [...] which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people.|$|E
500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{and a great}} number of amateurs.

Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I could have done a karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from my living room, and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making fun of her. He explained, [...] "There have been a few folks who have misinterpreted what I was doing and thought that I was somehow making fun of her, which really isn’t the case.
