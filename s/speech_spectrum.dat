40|$|Abstract—Unseen noise {{estimation}} {{is a key}} yet challenging step to make {{a speech}} enhancement algorithm work in adverse environments. At worst, the only prior knowledge {{we know about the}} encountered noise is that it is different from the involved speech. Therefore, by subtracting the components which cannot be adequately represented by a well defined speech model, the noises can be estimated and removed. Given the good performance of deep learning in signal representation, a deep auto encoder (DAE) is employed in this work for accurately modeling the clean <b>speech</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In the subsequent stage of speech enhancement, an extra DAE is introduced to represent the residual part obtained by subtracting the estimated clean <b>speech</b> <b>spectrum</b> (by using the pre-trained DAE) from the noisy <b>speech</b> <b>spectrum.</b> By adjusting the estimated clean <b>speech</b> <b>spectrum</b> and the unknown parameters of the noise DAE, one can reach a stationary point to minimize the total reconstruction error of the noisy <b>speech</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The enhanced speech signal is thus obtained by transforming the esti-mated clean <b>speech</b> <b>spectrum</b> back into time domain. The above proposed technique is called separable deep auto encoder (SDAE). Given the under-determined nature of the above optimization problem, the clean speech reconstruction is confined in the convex hull spanned by a pre-trained speech dictionary. New learning algorithms are investigated to respect the non-negativity of the parameters in the SDAE. Experimental results on TIMIT with 20 noise types at various noise levels demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional baselines.

These parts are evaluated during training time using an iterative algorithm known as expectation maximization (EM) [23]. During the test, the common parameters related to the test utterance are evaluated using EM and then used, along with the trained differentia part to obtain the converted spectra. Both training and conversion stages include iterative training (EM). Conversion results reported by the authors were obtained using several hundreds of parallel training sentences. Although our method and Xu et al.’s method [17] both use state space for representing the temporal evolution of the <b>speech</b> <b>spectra,</b> in our method, the source and the target spectra are linked through a state space dynamics, while in Xu et al.’s approach, the parallel source and target spectra are each modeled as the observed signals of a shared underlined unobserved Markov process.|$|R
