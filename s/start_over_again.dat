5|$|The TGS with Tracy Jordan crew have {{finished}} taping their fiftieth episode {{and decide to}} celebrate. Their boss, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), goes to the writers' room and tells the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), about how the whole company is undergoing cutbacks. After an unsuccessful presentation about TGS, Brad Halster (Roger Bart)—one of the consultants {{in charge of the}} cutbacks—informs Liz that she needs to cut her annual budget by 25 percent. Liz, anxious about her employees losing their jobs, decides to use sexual bartering to solve the problem and asks Brad on a date, which he accepts. Liz dresses in the trashiest outfit she can find, and goes on her date. The next day, she discovers that cutbacks are still taking place at TGS, and confronts Brad. Realizing that he was being used, Brad charges Liz with sexual harassment and she is suspended from work for two weeks. Jack tells Liz that the budget review process will <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> this time under his supervision.|$|E
500|$|When all the {{necessary}} numbers are found, Mondo then uses Catherine to solve the puzzle and complete the request. Catherine can be connected to anything from inanimate objects to living people {{through the use of}} jacks: when the correct jack has been connected, the player then imputs the number sequence. If correct, the player gains a [...] "Hit" [...] and the puzzle is completed, but a [...] "Blank" [...] means that the player has the incorrect answer. If the player fails at a puzzle, they can <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> once a countdown timer has elapsed. At the beginning of the game, Mondo is given a guidebook to the island, which acts as a means for the player to document environmental and dialogue clues.|$|E
500|$|Like many 1980s-era platformers, {{the player}} can {{accumulate}} points by defeating enemies and collecting items, {{with an extra}} life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby's Dream Land lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses {{to return to the}} title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. Once the game has been completed, a code is offered to play an optional Extra Game, in which the difficulty is significantly increased. [...] Completing the extra game offered a second code that lets the player adjust lives and vitality settings to play an even easier or harder game, and listen to music and sound effects freely. Since there is no save function, these codes are allowed to be entered even on a new session where the game has not been beaten yet.|$|E

500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 {{music video}} by Chase & Status for their song Let You Go`` centres around a Kyle-esque chat show called [...] "The Patrick Chase Show" [...] where the eponymous host, dressed in similar sartorial manner to Kyle (grey suit with no tie and undone top button), is {{recording}} a show where {{he points out}} the flaws of guests. After the show, the host leaves the studio and embarks on a night of drugs, alcohol, sex and criminal activity, before arriving back in the studio {{in the morning to}} be cleaned up and <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was put on my back {{on the floor with}} my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again...</b> I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{earlier and}} European marches recapitulate {{back to the}} {{beginning}} of the march. These marches typically did not use the Military March Form, but rather a shorter form such as the one directly above or the regimental march form. In other words, after either the final trio, or 'D' section, the march would <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> Once it has done that, repeats are ignored, and ends after the second strain. Codas are rare, but sometimes used as well, for example in [...] "Riders for the Flag" [...] by Sousa and [...] "Children of the Shrine" [...] by James Swearingen. The tradition of recapitulating marches ended at the start of the march music era. For example, John Philip Sousa abandoned this technique with all of his marches, except for [...] "On Parade," [...] one of Sousa's few circus marches. In fact, only Victor Herbert was one of the last American composers who still used recapitulation during the march music era. Examples of these marches include [...] "Under the Double Eagle" [...] by Wagner and [...] "The Serenade" [...] by Victor Herbert.|$|E
2500|$|... "Skip the Charades" [...] {{was based}} on the idea of {{relationships}} using charades and the theatricality of it all. [...] "Sensitive Kid" [...] is about a son dealing with the separation of his parents by throwing a party in his empty house and being admonished for it when told, [...] "Sensitive kid, start acting like a grown-up." [...] Willett explained that in high school, he would have parties at his house because it was empty and that his mother was out dating other people. The overall sound of the track utilizes [...] "fractured stabs of piano, electronic percussion, and obtuse grooves" [...] reminiscent of Spoon. [...] "Bulldozer" [...] is about [...] "plowing over a relationship to <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> on fresh soil." [...] Willett said that the inspiration for the song came from the marital problems that some of his college friends had gone through in their relationships, but with more of a happy ending from the aftermath of it all. [...] "Cold Toes on the Cold Floor" [...] was described by critics as a return to the band's debut record Robbers & Cowards, specifically the track [...] "Hang Me Up to Dry". Willett called the track one of his favorites off the album because of its similarity to their previous efforts and its playability live that allow for a lot of improvisation.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Robert Alter of the University of California, Berkeley, noted {{ambiguity}} {{about the}} scope of the noun [...] "congregation" [...] ( [...] , edah) in [...] If it means Korah's faction, then in [...] Moses and Aaron pleaded that only the ringleaders be punished, not all 250 rebels. But subsequent occurrences of [...] "community" [...] seem to point to the whole Israelite people, so Alter suggested that Moses and Aaron may have feared that God was exhibiting another impulse to destroy the entire Israelite population and <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with the two brothers. Professor Nili Fox of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and Terence Fretheim, Professor Emeritus at Luther Seminary, shared the latter view. Fox wrote that God was apparently ready to annihilate Israel, but Moses and Aaron appealed to God as Creator of humanity in [...] and appealed to God's sense of justice in [...] arguing that sin must be punished individually rather than communally. Similarly, Fretheim reported that Moses and Aaron interceded arguing that not all should bear the consequences for one person. And Fretheim also saw the phrase [...] "the God of the spirits of all flesh" [...] in [...] (which also appears in [...] ) to appeal to God as Creator, the One who gives breath to all. In Fretheim's view, God responded positively, separating the congregation from the rebels and their families.|$|E

Father Barry felt for a little blank book, and drew from his breast pocket Mrs. Doan's note and the enclosed check. Once more accident controlled his movements. Everything rushed back. Even in the midst of plans for his mother's Mass he thought of the letter he would write to Isabel. She must know the truth. Why had he not told her? Was he yet unable to confess himself a hypocrite to this woman whom he had once hoped to marry?

60|$|There {{seemed to}} be one small hope, however: {{if we could get}} through the {{intricate}} and dangerous Hat Island crossing before night, we could venture the rest, for we would have plainer sailing and better water. But it would be insanity to attempt Hat Island at night. So there was a deal of looking at watches {{all the rest of the}} day, and a constant ciphering upon the speed we were making; Hat Island was the eternal subject; sometimes hope was high and sometimes we were delayed in a bad crossing, and down it went again. For hours all hands lay under the burden of this suppressed excitement; it was even communicated to me, and I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island, and under such an awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished I might have five minutes on shore to draw a good, full, relieving breath, and <b>start</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> We were standing no regular watches.
