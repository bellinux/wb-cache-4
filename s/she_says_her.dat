500|$|The {{design for}} Marceline {{was created by}} Ward, with small changes and {{additions}} added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time. Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps. Marceline, unlike {{many of the other}} characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. According to Ward, her clothing changes from episode to episode because [...] "girls own more than one outfit". Olson was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, [...] "she has really cool style [...] I love what they come up with [...] every episode." [...] Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is [...] "totally surprised" [...] by the costuming for Marceline. While <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>her</b> lines, she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs. Marceline's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is drawing her. Rynda later called this [...] "one of the coolest parts" [...] about the character's animation {{due to the fact that}} [...] "every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw." ...|$|E
