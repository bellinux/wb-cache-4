40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{lane keeping}} {{control of a}} vehicle at the limit of handling. The control approach allows <b>steering</b> <b>share</b> between the controller and the driver. Handling limits are mainly due to tire forces saturation which are modelled using sector nonlinearity procedure. Forward speed variation is also taken into account through polytopic modeling. Driver activity, namely the torque, is considered during the design procedure {{in order to provide}} progressive assistance intrusion. All these aspects put together lead to a Takagi-Sugeno model. A controller is finally synthesized under a static output feedback gain with constrained structure. The obtained controller is tested under lane keeping maneuvers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intelligent electronic steering program (IESP), which combines <b>steering</b> <b>shared</b> control with electronic road departure mitigation control via individual wheel braking. It {{is based on}} a recently published control allocation and moderation method designed to improve the vehicle's cornering performance in friction-limiting conditions. Here we develop the concept further in terms of driver-vehicle cooperative control; the potential benefits of electronic power assistance steering system (EPAS) are modified to guide the driver's steering behavior. A number of experiments are conducted with different drivers, using a driving simulator. The results show how the proposed IESP provides a positive control influence. The work presents a new approach to vehicle active safety involving driver-vehicle interaction control for partially automated vehicles. Â© 2016 IEEE...|$|R

The Toyota A platform was now exclusive to the Toyota Supra. The coupe bodystyle in Japan was used only for the Corona coupe, sold only at Japanese Toyota dealerships Toyopet Store without the retractable headlights. An optional feature only offered on the Corona coupe was four-wheel <b>steering,</b> not <b>shared</b> with the Celica during this generation, however, the turbocharged engine on the Celica was not installed in the Corona coupe.|$|R

Along with the massive weight reduction, the 1980 Thunderbird was the first to be fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, greatly improving <b>steering</b> precision; <b>sharing</b> the underpinnings of the Fairmont meant the use of MacPherson struts for the front suspension. Further in contrast to its personal-luxury background, a specially-tuned suspension package was designed to make use of Michelin TRX tires; Recaro bucket seats were an option.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} human-machine cooperation when driving with {{different degrees of}} a shared control system. By means of a direct intervention on the <b>steering</b> wheel, <b>shared</b> control systems partially correct the vehicle's trajectory and, at the same time, provide continuous haptic guidance to the driver. A crucial point {{is to determine the}} optimal level of steering assistance for effective cooperation between the two agents. Five system settings were compared with a condition in which no assistance was present. In addition, road visibility was manipulated by means of additional fog or self-controlled visual occlusions. Several performance indicators and subjective assessments were analyzed. The results show that the best repartition of control in terms of cooperation between human and machine can be identified through an analysis of the steering wheel reversal rate, the steering effort and the mean lateral position of the vehicle. The best cooperation was achieved with systems of relatively low-level haptic authority, although more intervention may be preferable in poor visibility conditions. Increasing haptic authority did not yield higher benefits in terms of steering behavior, visual demand or subjective feeling...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to infer navigational intent of the user of a walker, based on measuring forces and moments applied to the walker's handles. While there are many types of "intent" that could be inferred for a given user action, the experiments conducted here focused on the determining user's navigational intent, i. e. their desired heading. Our experiments used two 6 -DOF force/moment sensors on the walker's handles and a digital motion capture system to correlate applied force with actual motion. Results revealed that the intent to turn, represented by changes in the heading angle, highly correlates with the overall turning moment around the vertical axis {{as well as the}} side forces applied by the user. Other force/moment components reveal additional information, such as support needs.

50|$|Although still {{produced}} in Japan by Subaru, Saab appointed Michael Mauer to commission the redesign of the front- and rear styling to better integrate the contrived Saab with the brand's own design language. This totally restyled front fascia included new fenders and hood, with the rear gaining a redesigned tailgate and bumper. The interior received extra acoustic insulation over the Subaru, with particular {{attention paid to}} the firewall, carpeting, roof, and rear window seals. The majority of {{the interior of the}} 9-2x is identical to the Impreza wagon with just a few changes. Saab opted to offer a 2-tone seat design based on the earlier second gen Impreza wagon, as well as use the less flashy instrument cluster from the earlier second gen Impreza. Saab also specified their own front seats incorporate active head restraints, unlike the fixed headrest seats in the equivalent Impreza WRX. The rear suspension arms are in aluminum, with further reduction of unsprung weight achieved by using plastic in place of heavier components, bushings unique to the Saab, and the dampers recalibrated. The steering had been made more responsive and exact in the Aero by using the <b>steering</b> rack <b>shared</b> by the STI version of the WRX, which features a faster 15.0:1 steering ratio, more rigidly mounted steering hardware and stiffer chassis bushings. The 9-2X is not particularly popular with Saab brand loyalists {{for the fact that the}} changes from the Subaru are mostly cosmetic. The 9-2X also won the highest IIHS safety awards.|$|R
40|$|Through {{an eclectic}} {{theoretical}} approach drawing on theory on regime complexes and transnational climate governance, orchestration {{theory and the}} schools of new institutionalism, this research paper presents a qualitative assessment on how non-state actors engagement in transnational climate governance is steered by the initiative of the UN Secretary General, the UNFCCC Secretariat and the COP presidents of Peru and France, Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA).

40|$|Although laser ranging and {{scanning}} sensors {{are widely}} used {{in a variety of}} industries, a sensor designed for spacecraft operations, including autonomous rendezvous, inspection and servicing remains a challenge. This is primarily due to critical requirements, including the need to have simultaneous high sampling speed, and good range and lateral resolution at both short range of a few meters and at long range of a few hundred meters. A typical LIDAR sensor is not suitable for tracking at the close-in distance, just before rendezvous, or during a critical close-up inspection, since its range resolution is in the tens of millimeters and can only be improved by averaging at the expense of speed. A laser triangulation sensor is capable of simultaneously having both high range resolution (~ 1 mm) and high speed (~ 10 kHz) at short distance. But the range resolution of a triangulation sensor reduces rapidly as range increases, its performance is inferior compared to a LIDAR based sensor at long range. NEPTEC TriDAR (triangulation + LIDAR) is a hybrid sensor that combines a triangulation sensor and a TOF sensor for spacecraft autonomous rendezvous and inspection. It has been developed in part from technology used in NEPTEC’s OBSS (Orbiter Boom Sensor System) 3 D laser camera. The OBSS LCS was used for inspection of the Shuttle tiles on STS- 114. In this paper, the TriDAR design that combines triangulation and LIDAR to produce high speed and high resolution for both short and long range is described. To successfully produce this sensor for space, an athermalized optical <b>steering</b> system <b>shared</b> by the two sensors has been developed. Results from performance testing of a prototype, designed for autonomous rendezvous, are given...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an {{advanced driver assistance system}} (ADAS) for lane keeping, {{together with an}} analysis of its performance and stability with respect to variations in driver be-havior. The automotive ADAS proposed is designed to share con-trol of the steering wheel with the driver in the best possible way. Its development was derived from an H 2 -Preview optimization control problem, which is based on a global driver–vehicle–road (DVR) system. The DVR model makes use of a cybernetic driver model to take into account any driver–vehicle interactions. Such a formulation allows 1) considering driver assistance cooperation criteria in the control synthesis, 2) improving the performance of the assistance as a cooperative copilot, and 3) analyzing the stability of the whole system in the presence of driver model uncertainty. The results have been experimentally validated with one participant using a fixed-base driving simulator. The devel-oped assistance system improved lane-keeping performance and reduced the risk of a lane departure accident. Good results were obtained using several criteria for human–machine cooperation. Poor stability situations were successfully avoided due to the robustness of the whole system, in spite of a large range of driver model uncertainty.

40|$|The {{development}} of infrastructure facilities can negatively impact critical habitat and essential ecosystems. There {{are a variety}} of techniques available to avoid, minimize, and mitigate negative impacts of existing infrastructure as well as future infrastructure development. However, such techniques may not always provide the greatest environmental benefit or may do very little to promote ecosystem sustainability. Concern for ecosystem protection, along with legislation and policy initiatives aimed at fostering an ecosystem-based approach, led an Interagency Steering Team to collaborate over a three-year period to write Eco-Logical: An Ecosystem Approach to Developing Infrastructure Projects. The <b>Steering</b> Team <b>shared</b> a vision of an enhanced and sustainable natural environment combined with the view that necessary infrastructure can be developed in ways that are more sensitive to terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Eco-Logical encourages all partners involved in infrastructure planning, design, review, and construction to use existing flexibility in regulatory processes. The Eco-Logical publication puts forth a conceptual framework for integrating plans across agency boundaries and endorses ecosystem-based mitigation – an innovative method of mitigating infrastructure impacts in today’s changing environment. To test the concepts presented in Eco-Logical, the Federal Highway Administration‟s (FHWA) Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty initiated a grant program in 2007. Of the 40 applications from across the country, FHWA funded 14 cooperative agreements and 1 interagency agreement, totaling approximately $ 1. 4 million. The number and diversity of applications indicate a changing climate in the field of transportation with a shift to more ecologically sensitive planning. The selected grant projects incorporate tools and techniques ranging from the integration of environmental considerations in the transportation planning process to the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and public involvement to integrate infrastructure and conservation plans. For example, one project tests and demonstrates how interagency partnerships and a willingness to adapt existing processes can enhance cultural and environmental stewardship in the long-range transportation planning process. The grant recipients represent state and local departments of transportation, federal and state resource agencies, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), local governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and one university. Initial findings from the grant program indicate a successful integration of ecologically sensitive principles into infrastructure planning and project development. By creating and using data-driven tools and processes, the Eco- Logical grant projects show that partnering with resource agencies and stakeholders early in the planning and project development processes enhances the preservation of high-functioning ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} driving and prevent accidents due to lane departure, this thesis focuses {{on the development of}} an assistance device for lane keeping of a passenger vehicle. The review of the literature on this subject has highlighted the need for {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between the driver and the vehicle-road system. The goal is to develop a shared control mode based on the anticipation of risk and the prediction of the most probable actions of the driver. The thesis was mainly articulated around two axes: the cybernetic modeling of the driver in his task of lateral control of the vehicle, and the design of a <b>shared</b> <b>steering</b> control using a Driver-Vehicle-Road model (DVR). The proposed driver model is consistent with what is known about sensorimotor and cognitive control in humans. It represents the anticipatory and compensatory visual control of steering, as well as the execution of steering actions by the neuromuscular system. It has been identified from experimental data collected on a fixed-base driving Simulator SCANeRTM. The model showed a good fit to the driver behavior, supporting later the development of the global model DVR. Concerning the shared control, two experimental studies were performed. The first (socalled CoLat 1) is similar to already existing LKS systems. CoLat 1 is primarily designed as an "electronic pilot" that has to drive alone the vehicle. Without using a driver model, it results from applying the H 2 -preview control synthesis to a vehicle-road model. <b>Shared</b> <b>steering</b> is performed only in the implementation phase: the control that it provides is partially applied to the steering wheel leaving the complementary control part to be applied by the driver. The second (so-called CoLat 2) addresses a shared control resulting from applying the H 2 -preview control synthesis to the global model (DVR). The H 2 /LQ-Preview control law has been used in the both cases (CoLat 1 & 2) because it allows to include knowledge of the future road curvature and to consider relevant performance criterions. A generalization of the H 2 -Preview solution was accomplished in the case where the disturbance signal is predicted beyond the preview horizon on the basis of a generator model. Innovative criterions were proposed for assessing the risk of lane departure, the sharing level between the driver and the lateral assistance, as well as its cooperative or conflicting behavior. They have been formalized through the criteria supporting the synthesis of CoLat 2, enabling therefore a precise management of trade-off between the quality of lane keeping and the quality of driver-assistance interaction. CoLat 2 has shown better performance compared to CoLat 1 in terms of driver-assistance cooperation thanks to "online" feedback of the estimated driver state. The μ-Analysis of the overall system robustness with respect to the driver model uncertainties has shown that the stability is guaranteed for a wide range of parametric variations. Afin de faciliter la conduite et prévenir les accidents par sortie de voie, ce travail porte sur le développement d'un dispositif d'assistance au contrôle latéral de la trajectoire d'un véhicule automobile. L'état de l'art des travaux portant sur ce thème a mis en évidence la nécessité de mieux prendre en compte l'interaction du conducteur avec l'ensemble véhicule-route. Ceci nous a conduit à développer un mode de contrôle partagé basé sur l'anticipation du risque et sur la prédiction des actions les plus probables du conducteur. Le travail de la thèse a été articulé principalement autour de deux axes : la modélisation cybernétique du conducteur dans sa tâche de contrôle latéral, et la conception du contrôle partagé de la direction sur la base du modèle global CVR (conducteur-véhicule-route). Un modèle du conducteur a été développé en cohérence avec les connaissances actuelles sur la sensorimotricité humaine. Ses paramètres ont été identifiés en utilisant des données expérimentales issues d'un simulateur de conduite SCANeRTM. Ensuite, Deux stratégies du contrôle partagé ont été conçues et évaluées expérimentalement. La première (nommée CoLat 1) se repose sur un principe similaire à celui des assistances LKS commercialisées à ce jour. Sa conception repose sur l'utilisation d'un modèle véhicule-route, et ne fait appel à aucun modèle du conducteur. Le partage n'est fait que de la mise en œuvre en appliquant partiellement la commande qu'il produit. La deuxième (nommée CoLat 2) repose sur une conception tenant compte des modalités du partage de la conduite avec le conducteur. Sa conception repose sur l'utilisation d'un modèle global (CVR). La commande H 2 /LQ anticipative (with preview) a été choisie dans les deux cas (CoLat 1 & 2) pour ce qu'elle permet la prise en compte de la connaissance anticipée de la courbure de la route et la définition de critères de performance pertinents. Elle a été revisitée pour tenir compte de modèles prédicteur des signaux perturbateurs...|$|R
