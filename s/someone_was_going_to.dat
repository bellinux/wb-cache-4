500|$|Gibbard {{took the}} band {{name from the}} song [...] "Death Cab for Cutie" [...] written by Neil Innes and Vivian Stanshall and {{performed}} by their group the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. The song was performed by the Bonzos in the Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour. The song's name was in turn taken from an invented pulp fiction crime magazine, devised by the English academic Richard Hoggart in his 1957 study of working class culture, The Uses of Literacy. In a 2011 interview, Gibbard stated, [...] "The name was never supposed {{to be something that}} <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reference 15 years on. So yeah, I would absolutely go back and give it a more obvious name." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitepages.com {{underwent}} a re-design in 2009. According to VentureBeat reporter Matt Marshall, the redesign made the advertising [...] "cleaner" [...] {{and made it}} more obvious when <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a third-party website like US Search. Marshall had previously criticized Whitepages, because website users that clicked on US Search ads and purchased data from US Search were sent through perpetual advertisements for other services that {{made it difficult to}} access the information they paid for. A local business lookup feature called [...] "Store Finder" [...] was added in June 2010. The following month, Whitepages.com launched a deal site, Dealpop.com, which differed from Groupon by offering short-term deals on nationally available products. Dealpop was sold to Tippr the following year.|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. [...] But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did." [...] At the end of the conversation, he reportedly told her [...] "he felt that <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to kill him {{to get a hold of}} his catalog and his estate" [...] and named some names she didn't want to say in the interview.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the {{hospital}} was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters. Teri Hatcher commented: [...] "It was a heavy scene. There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all four of us {{together as a team}} appreciated the ride we'd had this season and were grateful that we'd survived it together." [...] An extension of the scene, in which the women discuss Susan's discovery of Martha Huber's journal, was cut for time, though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23, 2005, one day after the episode's broadcast, and was included on the first season DVD set. The death of one housewife's husband was confirmed prior to the episode's broadcast. Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off, stating [...] "I had a sneaking suspicion <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter. Gabrielle would learn to function without Carlos, Susan and Mike would build their relationship, Lynette would go back to work, and Bree would become a single woman. We either had to have Rex divorce her or die." [...] Cherry named the {{scene in which}} Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season, stating: [...] "It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was so true to her character. She had to finish the cleaning she started, and she comes in and everything’s perfect." [...] A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time.|$|E

Despite {{the fact that}} the Air Force effort was as large as the CIA and Naval intelligence units in Korea, the relatively junior Nichols remained entrusted with command. However, throughout the war, agent casualties had steadily climbed as the communists increased their security measures. From the end of 1952 onwards, insertions into the north had become virtual suicide missions. Nichols was haunted by the situation: [...] "I hate to call myself a man.

They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting pretty low. As I told Admiral Burke, {{it was just a}} matter of time before <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> slug him. You can't operate like that.

Schwartz and Fedak both attended the University of Southern California. Fedak pitched the idea to Schwartz, who agreed to develop the project with him. Joseph McGinty Nichol, Schwartz's fellow executive producer on The O.C., directed the first hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his production company, Wonderland Sound and Vision. Fedak, Peter Johnson, Scott Rosenbaum, Matthew Miller, and Allison Adler also serve as co-executive producers. NBC gave the series an early pick-up and a thirteen-episode order on May 10, 2007.
