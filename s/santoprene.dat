500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from <b>Santoprene</b> rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E

After his retirement from Monsanto, he took a position with the Institute of Polymer Engineering at the University of Akron, managing the EPIC-M.A. Hanna Polymer Blending and Compounding Center. In the mid-1990s, A.N. Gent wrote that Goodyear had [...] "played the leading role in the remarkable progress made rubber vulcanization since about 1960." ...|$|E
50|$|The tubing {{needs to}} be {{elastomeric}} to maintain the circular cross section after millions of cycles of squeezing in the pump. This requirement eliminates a variety of non-elastomeric polymers that have compatibility {{with a wide range}} of chemicals, such as PTFE, polyolefins, PVDF, etc. from consideration as material for pump tubing. The popular elastomers for pump tubing are nitrile (NBR), Hypalon, Viton, silicone, PVC, EPDM, EPDM+polypropylene (as in <b>Santoprene),</b> polyurethane and natural rubber. Of these materials, natural rubber has the best fatigue resistance, and EPDM and Hypalon have the best chemical compatibility. Silicone is popular with water-based fluids, such as in bio-pharma industry, but have limited range of chemical compatibility in other industries.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} design manufactured in polypropylene used sticks with pairs of jaws on each end and rings, the jaws connect onto {{the body of}} the sticks or rings, The jaws also connected the sticks end to end. The resulting toy was best suited to young children; with these few components a wide range of models could be assembled. Squares, triangles, rectangles and hexagon shapes were later added to allow the toy to be used for sorting into sets; the toy could now be used in primary education. Technical shapes were added to increase the complexity of the toy and appeal to older children. The most recent additions utilise the new patented design manufactured in Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) including wheels with tyres manufactured in <b>Santoprene,</b> a synthetic rubber.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanical}} components in typical speaker drivers may change over time. Paper, a popular material in cone fabrication, absorbs moisture easily and unless treated may lose some structural rigidity over time. This {{may be reduced}} by coating with water-impregnable material such as various plastic resins. Cracks compromise structural rigidity and if large enough are generally non-repairable. Temperature has a strong, generally reversible effect; typical suspension materials become stiffer at lower temperatures. The suspension experiences fatigue, and also undergoes changes from chemical and environmental effects associated with aging such as exposure to ultraviolet light, and oxidation which affect foam and natural rubber components badly, though butyl, nitrile, SBR rubber, and rubber-plastic alloys (such as <b>Santoprene)</b> are more stable. The polyester type of polyurethane foam is highly prone to disintegration after 10 to 15 years. The changes in behavior from aging may often be positive, though since the environment that they are used in {{is a major factor}} the effects are not easily predicted. Gilbert Briggs, founder of Wharfedale Loudspeakers in the UK, undertook several studies of aging effects in speaker drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, publishing some of the data in his books, notably Loudspeakers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Laboratory {{synthesized}} polystyrene-modified {{natural rubber}} (SNR) {{was used in}} polypropylene (PP) based as modifier. PP volume was reduced while natural rubber (NR) and SNR volume were increased. The range of ratios evaluated are 70 / 30; 55 / 45, 50 / 50 and 45 / 55 by volume. PP/SNR blends resulted in better tensile properties, flexural properties, impact strength, elastic energy and reprocessing retention properties but similar tear strength in comparison with PP/NR blends at the similar blend ratios. Those mechanical properties are in agreement with morphological analysis.

Nevertheless, it's not polar and does not contain any functional group that limit it's application in mixing with polar engineering plastics and bounding with metal. Therefore, this research is focus on developing the Santoprene/ nanoscale silica nanocomposites containing better adhesion on the interface of glass and metal. The nanoscale silica modified by surfactant can be mixed with <b>Santoprene</b> through the melt process to form the nanocomposite. In order to improve the compatibility and surface adhesion, the mPP and EVA rubber have been added into the system. FTIR analysis on nanocomposite shows the characteristic peak at 2925 cm- 1 corresponding to the absorption peak of C-H of CTAB and at 1461, 1567, 1656 cm- 1 corresponding to the absorption peak of C=C of PS. This result indicates the treatment of silica is complete. From TGA and DMA results, the addition of 3 wt% modified silica into <b>Santoprene</b> can increase the 50 % thermal degradation and mechanical properties 14. 8 ℃ and 141 % compared to pure <b>Santoprene.</b> The addition of 1 wt% modified silica and mPP into <b>Santoprene</b> improves the adhesion between sample and stainless by 60 % in toughness and 39 % in maximum tensile strength. Further adding EVA into system can improve their adhesion. Additionally, the surface treatment of nanocomposite by plasma has been applied and discussed in this thesis. 中文摘要…………………………………………………………… [...] …Ⅰ 目錄…………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅲ 表目錄………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅴ 圖目錄………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅶ 一、 緒論……………………………………………………………… [...] 1 1 - 1 前言……………………………………………………………… 1 1 - 2 研究動機與目的………………………………………………… 5 1 - 3 研究方向………………………………………………………… 6 二、 文獻回顧………………………………………………………… [...] 7 2 - 1 熱塑性彈性體概論…………………………………………… [...] . 7 2 - 1 - 1 、熱塑性彈性體的發展緣由……………………………… [...] 7 2 - 1 - 2 ‧TPE的基本性質………………………………………… [...] 8 2 - 1 - 3 TPE的分類及特性…………………………………………. 9 2 - 1 - 4 聚烯系熱塑性彈性體(Thermoplastic Polyolefin，TPO) … 12 2 - 1 - 5 TPV與TPO的差異性……………………………………. 17 2 - 2 無機物表面處理……………………………………………… [...] 18 2 - 2 - 1 無機補強材……………………………………………… [...] . 18 2 - 2 - 2 無機填料之表面處理方法……………………………… [...] . 19 2 - 2 - 3 無機物表面聚合………………………………………… [...] . 20 2 - 3 二氧化矽之特性與製備方式………………………………… [...] 21 2 - 4 奈米複合材料的概述及特性………………………………… [...] 23 2 - 4 - 1 奈米複合材料的形成與定義…………………………… [...] . 23 2 - 4 - 2 高分子奈米複合材料之特性…………………………… [...] 24 2 - 4 - 3 高分子奈米複材製備方法……………………………… [...] 25 2 - 5 熱塑性彈性體/無機填充材複合材料……………………… [...] . 27 2 - 6 高分子複合材料表面處理……………………………………. 33 2 - 6 - 1 高分子表面處理方法……………………………………. 33 2 - 6 - 2 電漿表面處理……………………………………………. 35 2 - 7 黏著機制(Adhesion mechanism) ………………………………. 37 2 - 7 - 1 黏著理論(Adhesion theories) …………………………… [...] . 38 2 - 7 - 2 黏著測試方法…………………………………………… [...] 40 三、實驗方法與實驗流程…………………………………………… [...] . 41 3 - 1 實驗材料………………………………………………………. 41 3 - 2 實驗分析儀器…………………………………………………. 43 3 - 3 二氧化矽改質流程圖………………………………………… [...] 45 3 - 4 奈米複合材料製備及分析之實驗流程圖………. ……………. 46 3 - 5 實驗步驟………………………………………………………. 47 四、結果與討論……………………………………………………… [...] 50 4 - 1 二氧化矽表面改質……………………………………………. 50 4 - 1 - 1 二氧化矽吸附陽離子界面活性劑……………… [...] . ……… 50 4 - 1 - 2 二氧化矽表面聚合……………………………………… [...] 51 4 - 2 Santoprene/二氧化矽奈米複合材料之製備………………… [...] . 55 4 - 3 Santoprene/二氧化矽奈米複合材料之物性分析…………… [...] . 62 4 - 4 拉伸剝離試驗分析(Peeling Test) …………………………… [...] 91 4 - 4 - 1 奈米複合材料與不鏽鋼基板之黏著性分析…………… [...] 91 4 - 4 - 2 奈米複合材料與鋁基板之黏著性分析………………… 109 4 - 5 奈米複合材料電漿表面處理………………………… [...] . …… 122 五、結論……………………………………………………………. … 128 參考文獻…………………………………………… [...] . ………………. 13...|$|E
40|$|Surfaces of {{materials}} strongly affect functional properties such as mechanical, biological, optical, acoustic and electronic properties {{of materials}}, {{particularly at the}} micro/nano scale. Surface effects stem from the interplay of surface morphology and surface chemical properties. This dissertation focuses on (1) modeling the effect of surface roughness parameters on solid-solid contact and solid-liquid interaction as well as; (2) developing a surface engineering method that can generate random surfaces with desired amplitude and spatial roughness parameters for tribological and biomimetic applications.;Autocorrelation length (ACL) is a surface roughness parameter that provides spatial information of surface topography that {{is not included in}} amplitude parameters such as root-mean-square roughness. A relationship between ACL and the friction behavior of a rough surface was developed. The probability density function of peaks and the mean peak height of a profile were given as functions of its ACL. These results were used to estimate the number of contact points when a rough surface comes into contact with a flat surface, and it was shown that the larger the ACL of the rough surface, the less the number of contact points. Based on Hertzian contact mechanics, it was shown that the real area of contact increases with increasing of number of contact points. Results from microscale friction experiments (where friction force is proportional to real area of contact) on polished and etched silicon surfaces are presented to verify the analysis.;A versatile surface processing method based on electrostatic deposition of particles and subsequent dry etching was shown to be able to independently tailor the amplitude and spatial roughness parameters of the resulting surfaces. Statistical models were developed to connect process variables to the amplitude roughness parameters center line average, root mean square and the spatial parameter, autocorrelation length of the final surfaces. Process variables include particle coverage, which affected both amplitude and spatial roughness parameters, particle size, which affected only spatial parameters and etch depth, which affects only amplitude parameters. The autocorrelation length of the final surface closely followed a power law decay with particle coverage, the most significant processing parameter. Center line average, root mean square followed a nonlinear relation with particle coverage and particle size. Experimental results on silicon substrates agreed reasonably well with model predictions.;This same hybrid surface engineering process was used to demonstrate adhesion and friction reduction. Microscale adhesion and friction tests were conducted on flat (smooth) and processed silicon surfaces with a low elastic modulus thermoplastic rubber (<b>Santoprene)</b> probe that allowed a large enough contact area to observe the feature size effect. Both adhesion and friction force of the processed surfaces were reduced comparing to that of the flat surfaces.;The process is also used to generate superhydrophobic engineering surfaces by mimicking the structure of lotus leaves. Tunable bimodal roughness (in both micro and nano scale) and a thin hydrophobic fluorocarbon film were generated on an engineering material surface by the hybrid process. These surfaces exhibit contact angles with water of more than 160 °. A geometric model was developed to related air-trapping ability of hydrophobic surfaces with hillock features to process variables (hillock diameter, etching depth and coverage) and contact angle. The model is shown to be able to predict minimum coverage of hillocks required for air-trapping on hydrophobic rough surfaces. The model predictions agree with experimental observations reasonably well. This model can particularly be extended to utilizing statistical roughness parameters to predict air-trapping for rough hydrophobic surfaces...|$|E
