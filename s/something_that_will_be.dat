25|$|In the Livre d'Artus, Merlin enters Rome in {{the form}} of a huge stag with a white fore-foot. He bursts into the {{presence}} of Julius Caesar and tells the emperor that only the wild man of the woods can interpret the dream that has been troubling him. Later, he returns {{in the form}} of a black, shaggy man, barefoot, with a torn coat. In another episode, he decides to do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> spoken of forever. Going into the forest of Brocéliande, he transforms himself into a herdsman carrying a club and wearing a wolf-skin and leggings. He is large, bent, black, lean, hairy and old, and his ears hang down to his waist. His head is as big as a buffalo's, his hair is down to his waist, he has a hump on his back, his feet and hands are backwards, he is hideous, and is over 18 feet tall. By his arts, he calls a herd of deer to come and graze around him.|$|E
500|$|In April 1998, {{three years}} after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under {{criticism}} for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the [...] "increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down {{in front of a computer}} screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E

During a 1999 interview with MTV's Kurt Loder, Rose announced {{the title of}} the upcoming album to be Chinese Democracy, stating [...] "there's a lot of Chinese democracy movements, and it's something that there's a lot of talk about, and it's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> nice to see. It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just like the sound of it." [...] Rose also mentioned the album would feature [...] "lot of different sounds.

2500|$|Discussing other {{specific}} {{songs on}} the album, Skiba mentioned that the title track uses heroin and methadone addiction {{as a metaphor for}} love, stating that [...] "It's a human condition that I think we all, in one way or another, fall victim to. It's not to say that people can't be happy or find bliss in a relationship. It's just amazing to me how unhappy most people are and they can't shake it and can't fix it, much like an addiction." [...] He also discussed the politically themed [...] "The American Scream", a song inspired by the suicide of a United States Army soldier after his return from the War in Afghanistan: [...] "For a long time we were afraid to write overtly political songs but I read this article about a US soldier that came back from a tour of duty in Afghanistan and blew his head off on his mother's grave and I wrote a song about that." [...] He has described the lyrical style of This Addiction as [...] "thinking-man's punk": [...] "We wanted to do something that's fun but also interesting and lyrically, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fun for people to read along to and hopefully understand." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 28, 2014, Kendrick Lamar first {{revealed}} the plans {{to release a}} follow-up to his second studio album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), during an interview with Billboard. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he was quoted as saying, [...] "Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'... It's a trip. That's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses—I truly believe that." [...] In an interview with MTV, Lamar said: [...] "To Pimp a Caterpillar was the original name and they caught it because the abbreviation was Tupac, Tu-P-A-C. Me changing it to Butterfly, I just really wanted to show the brightness {{of life and the}} word 'pimp' has so much aggression and that represents several things. For me, it represents using my celebrity for good. Another reason is, not being pimped by the industry through my celebrity." [...] The album was at one point believed by many to be called Return of Enoch. Between the releases of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and To Pimp a Butterfly, Lamar traveled to South Africa. Touring the country — visiting historic sites such as Nelson Mandela's jail cell on Robben Island, heavily influenced the direction of the record.|$|E

The idea's there, such a beautiful and vague idea, so familiar to one, but so utterly unrealisable on any known instrument--a sort of musical Ariel, flitting before one and tantalising one for ever, but never allowing one to come up with it and see its real features. I'm always dissatisfied with what I've actually written, and longing to crystallise into a score the imaginary airs I can never catch.

60|$|While she thus {{awaited the}} midnight knell {{that was to}} summon her to the innumerable sisterhood of {{departed}} years, there came a young maiden treading lightsomely on tip-toe along {{the street from the}} direction of the railroad dépôt. She was evidently a stranger, and perhaps had come to town by the evening train of cars. There was a smiling cheerfulness in this fair maiden's face which bespoke her fully confident of a kind reception from the multitude of people with whom she was soon to form acquaintance. Her dress was rather too airy for the season, and was bedizened with fluttering ribbons and other vanities which were likely soon to be rent away by the fierce storms or to fade in the hot sunshine amid which she was to pursue her changeful course. But still she was a wonderfully pleasant-looking figure, and had so much promise and such an indescribable hopefulness in her aspect that hardly anybody could meet her without anticipating some very desirable thing--the consummation of some long-sought good--from her kind offices. A few dismal characters there may be here and there about the world who have so often been trifled with by young maidens as promising as she that they have now ceased to pin any faith upon the skirts of the New Year. But, for my own part, I have great faith in her, and, should I live to see fifty more such, still from each of those successive sisters I shall reckon upon receiving <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> worth living for.|$|E
