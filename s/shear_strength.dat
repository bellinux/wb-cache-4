5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E

The dimension of cross section of the specimen was varied in order to investigate the influence of the shape of cross section on <b>shearing</b> <b>strength.</b> The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) When the displacement of Z-axis direction was restrained, <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> obtained was larger than in the case of no restraint. 2) In Hinoki specimen, <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of L-T plane was littte different from that of L-R plane. 3) In Kaba specimen, <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of L-R plane was considerably larger in comparison with that of L-T plane. Accordingly, in order to measure <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of L-R plane, a specimen was used, having a large ratio between width and height. 4) <b>Shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of the torsion test was about twice as large as that of JIS shear test. Accordingly, it is considered that the torsion test is superior to JIS shear test in the case of {{the measurement}} of <b>shearing</b> <b>strength.</b> 5) The torsion test of specimens with rectangular cross section is adequate to messure <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of wood...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} the difference between recycled concrete and ordinary concrete on shearing property under the circumstance of equal strength, nine recycled concrete beams, which have equal altitude and varying width, have been produced by using different replacement rates of 0 %, 50 % and 100 % respectively to test their shear performance. The differences between recycled concrete and ordinary concrete on <b>shearing</b> <b>strength,</b> <b>shearing</b> strain and constitutive relation were analyzed in this paper. The study indicates that with the same compressive strength, {{there is only a}} slight difference between recycled concrete and ordinary concrete on <b>shearing</b> <b>strength.</b> The <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of the recycled concrete is similar to the tensile strength of the ordinary concrete. Recycled concrete’s peak value increases as <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> increases. The stress-strain curve of recycled concrete {{is similar to that of}} the ordinary concrete.

40|$|The size {{effects in}} <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> were {{investigated}} {{by means of}} the torsional test in two species of Western hemlock and Red lauan. The torsional tests were carried out by using four kinds of specimens whose size were two times, four times and eight times as long as the smallest specimens respectively. The <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of these specimens was measured. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) It was observed that there was a high negative correlation between logarithms of the shearing strentgh (log γmax) and logarithms of the volume of the specimens (log V). Preticularly, the regression line in three kinds of specimens, except the smallest one (Type I specimen), was very nearly identical. Accordingly, it was considered that the shearing fracture coincided with the weakest link theory. 2) The constants of the size effect of Western hemlock specimens were 10. 8 (<b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> in radial section) and 10. 7 (<b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> in tangential section). The constants of Red lauan specimens were 10. 0 (<b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> in radial section) and 9. 26 (<b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> in tagential section) ...|$|R

40|$|Direct shear {{tests have}} been {{performed}} to determine the peak and residual <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> of fractures in sandstone, granite and limestone under cyclic shear loading. The fractures are artificially made in the laboratory by tension inducing and saw-cut methods. Results indicate that the cyclic shear load can significantly reduce the fracture <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> and stiffness. The peak <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> rapidly decrease after the first cycle and tend to remain unchanged close to the residual strengths through the tenth cycle. Degradation of the first order asperities largely occurs after the first cycle. The fracture dilation rates gradually decrease from the first through the tenth cycles suggesting that the second order asperities continuously degrade after the first load cycle. The residual <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> are lower than the peak <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> and {{higher than those of}} the smooth fractures.

40|$|Since the chair-type {{specimen}} in use as JIS shearing specimen has a sharp right-angled notch, the shearing {{plane of}} this specimen undergoes an influence of stress concentration and couple of forces. Consequently, <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of this specimen {{is very small}} in comparison with true <b>shearing</b> <b>strength.</b> Accordingly, taking note of the bending test that gives pure horizontal shearing stress, the experiment of the measurement ofshearing strength {{was carried out by}} the bending test by means of the reinforced Hinoki specimen with soft steel plates in ordcr to prevent bending fracture. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The test for the measurement of <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of eleven kinds of specimens with various beam height and span length was carried out by the bending test. The specimen with beam height of 29 mm and span-height ratio of 6 was most suitable for the measurement of <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of Hinoki. 2. As a result of measurement of <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of the reinforced specimens with soft steel plate, JIS specimens and RADCLIFFE'S specimens, <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> of the reinforced specimen was larger than that of JIS specimen and was smaller than that of RADCLIFFE'S specimen. 3.

The feasibility of electromagnetic impact welding {{of aluminum}} sheets has been established, but the effect of process parameters on the weld strength has not been reported. The present study investigates the effect of parameters such as energy, standoff distance and coil geometry on the <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> and {{the width of the}} weld achieved by electromagnetic impact welding of aluminum sheets. A study has been carried out to characterize the effectiveness of the process of welding two aluminum sheets of same chemical composition and of 1 mm thickness. The results of the microstructure and <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> tests are reported in this paper. The <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> and the width of the weld are found to increase with an increase in discharge energy. Further, when the geometry of the coil is changed from rectangular shape to tapered shape, it gives higher <b>shearing</b> <b>strength.</b> The standoff distance has an optimum value that gives maximum <b>shearing</b> <b>strength</b> and width of the weld.

25|$|Slope {{stability}} {{is the potential}} of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement. Stability {{is determined by the}} balance of shear stress and <b>shear</b> <b>strength.</b> A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a slope failure can be climatic events which can then make a slope unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increase in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces. Alternatively, <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> may be decreased by weathering, changes in pore water pressure, and organic material.|$|E

Additionally, the calculation results are compared with the ones analyzed by displacement-based analysis. The analysis results confirm that the conventional force-based analysis method, which introduces the maximum horizontal seismic acceleration to the seismic analysis, overestimates the <b>shear</b> <b>strengths.</b> An appropriate factor to “discount ” the acceleration or the defining slope safety factor is required in the force-based analysis to obtain accurate <b>shear</b> <b>strengths.</b> On the other hand, the displacement-based analysis, such as Newmark sliding model, provides an alternative way to pursue accurate <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> if a seismic-slope failure regression formula is also available.
