40|$|High-intensity cycle ergometry of 30 seconds {{duration}} {{has been}} widely employed to assess indices of muscle performance during maximal exercise. Traditionally, the <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> established for such a test is deter-mined from total body mass (TBM) for a friction-loaded Monark cycle ergometer, i. e. 75 g·kg– 1. More {{recent studies have shown}} that traditional forces may be too light to elicit maximal performances and that opti-mization protocols can produce higher peak power outputs. Conceptually, selecting the optimal <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> according to TBM {{may not be the best}} approach. Fat-free mass or active muscle tissue may be a more preferable alternative. Because body mass, and not composition, is the most commonly used index to deter-mine cycle ergometer <b>resistive</b> <b>force,</b> over- or underestimations in power calculations may occur. The aim of this paper is to outline friction-loaded cycle ergometer performance using <b>resistive</b> <b>forces</b> derived from TBM and fat-free mass, to quantify the upper body contribution to high-intensity cycle ergometry.

40|$|A constant-force {{resistive}} exercise unit (CFREU) has been invented {{for use in}} both normal gravitational and microgravitational environments. In comparison with a typical conventional exercise machine, this CFREU weighs less and is less bulky: Whereas weight plates and associated bulky supporting structures are used to generate <b>resistive</b> <b>forces</b> in typical conventional exercise machines, they are not used in this CFREU.

During a stroke of {{resistive exercise}}, the cable is withdrawn from the cable drum against the torque exerted by the resistance pack. The CFREU includes a housing, within which can be mounted one or more resistive pack(s).

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1979 - 05 - 25 This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a project conducted to determine the magnitude of and the parameters affecting the magnitude of the cable tensions generated during lateral yarding operations in a cable thinning. Specific emphasis was placed on measuring mainline tensions as a function of turn weight, turn length, mainline vertical angle, mainline to log lead angle, ground slope, distance from carriage, number of logs per turn and thinning intensity. The results show that the force resisting initial movement, exclusive of the gravitational component, is independent of the variables studied except number of logs per turn and thinning intensity. The average <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> for two log turns was twice the magnitude of the <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> for one log turns. The <b>resistive</b> <b>forces</b> encountered in heavier thinnings were higher than those encountered in lighter thinnings. An upper limit of the magnitude of the mainline tensions necessary to cause initial log movement can be predicted by determining the <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> such that an arbitrary percentage of the turns will result in a <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> that will be less. The mathematical expression is: P=R+Wcosθ/cos(α-θ) where P = tension necessary to cause initial movement R = <b>resistive</b> <b>force,</b> W = turn weight, α = mainline angle, θ = ground slope. The tensions developed during lateral inhaul, that is, after the turn has broken loose, can be predicted by the equation: T=W(µcosθ + sinθ) /cos(α-θ) + µsin(α-θ) where T = tension developed during lateral inhaul, µ = frictional coefficient.

Male international karate practitioners volunteered as participants (n = 11). Body density was calculated using hydrostatic weighing procedures with fat mass ascertained from body density values. Participants were required to pedal maximally on a cycle ergometer (Monark 864) against randomly assigned loads ranging from 70 g·kg- 1 - 95 g·kg- 1 (using a TBM or FFM protocol) for 8 seconds.

40|$|Artificial gravity (AG) {{created by}} short-radius {{centrifugation}} is a promising countermeasure to the physiological de-conditioning {{that results from}} long-duration spaceflight. However, as on Earth, gravity alone does not ensure fitness. We will need to supplement passive exposure to AG with physical exercise to achieve a comprehensive countermeasure. Before AG exercise can be deemed safe and effective, we must understand how Coriolis accelerations and a gravity gradient affect our biomechanics and how centrifuge-based exercises differ from Earth-upright ones. Two experiments were designed to investigate the squat biomechanics while upright in the laboratory and while lying supine on a horizontal, clockwise-rotating short-radius centrifuge at speeds up to 30 revolutions per minute. Constant <b>force</b> <b>springs</b> provided additional <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> up to 25 % of body weight. Dependent measure included the three-dimensional position of {{the left and right}} knee, left and right foot reaction forces, and muscle activity. We investigated the Coriolis-induced mediolateral knee perturbations and the sensory-motor after-effects from a multiple repetition protocol. The upright and centrifuge biomechanics were compared for similarities and differences between them. In addition, a two-dimensional kinematic model was developed to predict foot reaction forces, Coriolis accelerations, and joint torques. (cont.) Our results show that mediolateral knee travel during the AG squats was 1. 0 to 2. 0 centimeters greater than Earth-upright squats. Increasing the rotation rate or adding <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> did not affect the results. The peak foot forces increased with rotation rate, but rarely exceeded 200 % body weight. The ratio of left-to-right foot force during centrifugation was non-constant and approximately sinusoidal, suggesting a postural correction for the Coriolis accelerations. There was a qualitative difference in the foot force vs. knee angle profile between upright and centrifuge-supine because of the centripetal acceleration. Muscle activity, however, was qualitatively similar between the conditions. The kinematic model was used to evaluate the exercise safety and extend the results to larger-radius centrifuges. We conclude that centrifugation provides a unique and challenging environment for exercise and that a brief artificial gravity squat can be carried out safely. The results are extended to cycle ergometry, when possible, and recommendations are made for future AG squat protocols.

40|$|Autonomous micro-swimming robots can be {{utilized}} to perform specialized procedures {{such as in}} vitro or in vivo medical tasks as well as chemical surveillance or micro manipulation. Maneuverability of the robot {{is one of the}} requirements that ensure successful completion of its task. In micro fluidic environments, dynamic trajectories of active micro-swimming robots must be predicted reliably and the response of control inputs must be well-understood. In this work, a reduced-order model, which is based on the <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> theory, is used to predict the transient, coupled rigid body dynamics and hydrodynamic behavior of bio-inspired artificial micro-swimmers. Conceptual design of the micro-swimmer is biologically inspired: it is composed of a body that carries a payload, control and actuation mechanisms, and a long flagellum either such as an inextensible whip like tail-actuator that deforms and propagates sinusoidal planar waves similar to spermatozoa, or of a rotating rigid helix similar to many bacteria, such as E. Coli. In the reduced-order model of the microswimmer, fluid’s resistance to the motion of the body and the tail are computed from <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> theory, which breaks up the resistance coefficients to local normal and tangential components. Using rotational transformations between a fixed world frame, body frame and the local Frenet-Serret coordinates on the helical tail we obtain the full 6 degrees-of-freedom relationship between the <b>resistive</b> <b>forces</b> and torques and the linear and rotational motions of the swimmer. In the model, only the tail’s frequency (angular velocity for helical tail) is used as a control input in the dynamic equations of the micro-swimming robot. The reduced-order model is validated by means of direct observations of natural micro swimmers presented earlier in the literature and against; results show very good agreement. Three-dimensional, transient CFD simulations of a single degree of freedom swimmer is used to predict <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> coefficients of a micro-swimmer with a spherical body and flexible tail actuator that uses traveling plane wave deformations for propulsion.
