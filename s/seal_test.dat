40|$|A {{case study}} of a {{high-speed}} <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> rotor shows how rotor dynamic analysis {{can be used to}} diagnose the source of high vibrations and evaluate a proposed remedy. Experimental results are compared with the synchronous and non-synchronous whirl response analysis of a double overhung, high-speed <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> rotor with ball bearings supported in 5. 84 - and 12. 7 -mm-long, un-centered squeeze-film oil dampers. Test performance with the original damper of length 5. 84 mm was marginal. Non-synchronous whirling occurred at the overhung <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> disk and there was a high amplitude synchronous response near the drive spline above 32, 000 rpm. Nonlinear synchronous unbalance and time transient whirl studies were conducted on the <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> rotor with the original and extended damper lengths. With the original damper design, the nonlinear synchronous response showed that unbalance could cause damper lockup at 33, 000 rpm. Alford cross-coupling forces were also included at the overhung <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> disk for the whirl analysis. Sub-synchronous whirling at the <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> disk was observed in the nonlinear time transient analysis.

40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} growth {{behavior}} of Grainex Mar-M 247 is evaluated for NASA s Turbine <b>Seal</b> <b>Test</b> Facility. The facility {{is used to}} test air-to-air seals primarily for use in advanced jet engine applications. Because of extreme <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> conditions of temperature, pressure, and surface speeds, surface cracks may develop over time in the disk bolt holes. An inspection interval is developed to preclude catastrophic disk failure by using experimental fatigue crack growth data. By combining current fatigue crack growth results with previous fatigue strain-life experimental work, an inspection interval is determined for the test disk. The fatigue crack growth life of the NASA disk bolt holes {{is found to be}} 367 cycles at a crack depth of 0. 501 mm using a factor of 2 on life at maximum operating conditions. Combining this result with previous fatigue strain-life experimental work gives a total fatigue life of 1032 cycles at a crack depth of 0. 501 mm. Eddy-current inspections are suggested starting at 665 cycles since eddy current detection thresholds are currently at 0. 381 mm.
