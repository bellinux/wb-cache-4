5|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} aboard is in <b>some</b> <b>doubt,</b> but {{an estimate of}} 638 was published in The Times. It is generally thought that the survivors comprised 113 soldiers (all ranks), 6 Royal Marines, 54seamen (all ranks), 7women, 13children {{and at least one}} male civilian, but these numbers cannot be substantiated, as muster rolls and books were lost with the ship.|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck. The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh {{said that he would}} make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> as to whether he subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E

5|$|The best attested sibling of Heraclius the Younger {{was arguably}} Theodore. Maria, sister of Heraclius the Younger, is {{mentioned}} by Nikephoros I and identified as mother of Martina, whom Heraclius the Younger {{would go on}} to marry. It should be noted, however, that both Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian consider Martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of Heraclius the Younger, thus casting <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> on the precise relation. Finally, Theophanes briefly mentions another Gregoras as a brother of Heraclius the Younger {{on the occasion of the}} former's death at Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) circa 652/653. This is the only mention of this sibling. Theophanes, however, might have misunderstood the relation between Gregoras and the emperor.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chemical}} {{experiments on}} copernicium were conducted using the 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn reaction. Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half-life of 5minutes. Analysis {{of the data}} indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties. However, the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium-283 has cast <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> on these experimental results. Given this uncertainty, between April–May 2006 at the JINR, a FLNR–PSI team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl. In this experiment, two atoms of copernicium-283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties indicated that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury, due to formation of a weak metal-metal bond with gold, placing it firmly in group 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} both archbishops {{travelled}} to Rome for their palliums, where Thomas {{took advantage of}} the opportunity to ask Pope AlexanderII to decree that the sees of Canterbury and York were equal. Thomas also sought to have the pope declare that the midland sees of Worcester, Dorchester on Thames, and Lichfieldall south of the River Humberwere part of the Archdiocese of York rather than Canterbury. The 12th-century chronicler Eadmer, a monk at Canterbury, wrote much later that Thomas had resigned and surrendered his archiepiscopal symbols, but they were promptly returned to him by Lanfranc on the pope's orders. The story's partisan source casts <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> on its accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Usually {{reports were}} issued on any {{incident}} with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s {{but the report}} pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed carburettor. However, there is <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near-vertical turn.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly orchid and bee orchid are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E

5|$|In 1888 the Havana Chess Club {{offered to}} sponsor a match between Steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent. Steinitz {{nominated}} the Russian Mikhail Chigorin, {{on the condition}} that the invitation should not be presented as a challenge from him. There is <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> about whether this was intended to be a match for the world championship: both Steinitz's letters and the publicity material just before the match conspicuously avoided the phrase. The proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games, and Steinitz had said that fixed-length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because the first player to take the lead could then play for draws; and Steinitz was at the same time supporting the American Chess Congress' world championship project. Whatever the status of the match, it was played in Havana in January to February 1889, and won by Steinitz (ten wins, one draw, six losses).|$|E
5|$|Learning from {{a runner}} that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a council of war at dawn. According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the Greeks. Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas {{resolved}} {{to stay at}} the pass with the Spartans. Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, the Greeks marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> about which actually happened). The contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight. Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans.|$|E
5|$|S. g. ashbyi, (critically endangered), {{the western}} Victorian pied currawong, was {{described}} by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1913. It is threatened by hybridization with the neighbouring subspecies nebulosa whose range is expanding westwards. A 2000 estimate placed the number of breeding birds at around 250. It resembles subspecies nebulosa, with sooty plumage, a long tail and a short bill. There is <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> over whether ashbyi, which is little known, is a distinct subspecies or a colour morph of nebulosa. It {{is thought to have}} evolved after the two populations became separated by basalt plains in western Victoria, with the return of trees after the abandonment of regular Aboriginal burning in the late 18th century contributing to the remixing of populations. Hybrid forms have been identified in the Grampians and Yarra Valley.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>doubt</b> {{exists as}} to whether the current {{classification}} accurately represents relationships within the Banksia spinulosa complex. B.spinulosa var.collina is a form of inland gorges and tablelands in central Queensland, but is a coastal plant on the New South Wales central and north coast. B.spinulosa var.spinulosa, on the other hand, is coastal in central Queensland and in New South Wales south of Sydney. Similarly, B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii is widely separated between New South Wales and Victorian forms (where the longer leaved form was originally called B.prionophylla by Meissner). Notably both B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.collina in northern Queensland have old spikes bare as opposed to them having persistent old flower parts in New South Wales and Victoria. Mast listed B.spinulosa var.collina and B.spinulosa var.neoanglica as sister clades in 1998, with B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii flanking these. Alex George also reports that the taxon should be reviewed. A molecular study with specimens of each subspecies from the three mainland eastern states they occur would shed light on this matter.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast <b>some</b> <b>doubt</b> on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
