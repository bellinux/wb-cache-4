40|$|There is {{some concern}} that turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> remains to be ascertained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies have}} applied {{nonlinear}} analysis methods for heart sounds to diagnose {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD). Coronary artery occlusion may cause diastolic heart murmurs, so analysis of diastolic heart murmurs has important significance to noninvasive diagnosis of CAD. Heart <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> is typical nonlinear and non-stationary time series, nonlinear analysis method- correlation dimension can effectively describe the nonlinear characteristics of heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals,</b> but {{the analysis of the}} correlation dimension shows that trend terms in the heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> may lead to erroneous results. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is adaptive to remove trend for non-stationary signal, so a method combining EMD and correlation dimension was proposed for nonlinear analysis of diastolic heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> The EMD method was applied to reconstruct heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> after removing trend, and the correlation dimension for reconstructed heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> was used as characteristics to distinguish between normal heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> and CAD heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> The diastolic heart sounds of 15 normal people and 15 patients with CAD were analyzed in the experiment, and the results showed that the proposed method can effectively distinguish between normal people and patients wit...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent study}} by Huey, Dekker, and Lyons (1994) {{concluded}} that a difference between two <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> intensities of less than 25 % cannot be detected reliably by most drivers. Consequently, Huey et al. recommended that an intensity difference of 25 % {{be used as a}} criterion for inconsequential noncompliance with federal regulations for <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The present study was designed to evaluate just noticeable differences for glare intensities of oncoming low-beam headlamps. The results of this study indicate that, under controlled conditions, just noticeable differences in the low-beam headlighting context are between 11 % and 19 %. In real-world conditions, just noticeable differences would probably be somewhat larger. Therefore, the recommendation by Huey et al. of using 25 % as a criterion for inconsequential noncompliance of <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is also about right for low-beam headlamps, at least with respect to how headlamps themselves are perceived by other drivers (such as discomfort glare). The 25 % value may also apply with respect to how headlamps affect the ability of drivers to see illuminated objects, but further research on that issue would be desirable...|$|R

40|$|Auditory system detects <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> {{and uses}} the temporal-frequency {{information}} of the <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> to conduct <b>sound</b> identification, sound localization, and sound source separation. Thanks to the past studies, {{we know that the}} hair cells at cochlea show frequency-dependent responses against input <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> But, little is known about how the sound information is conducted to and processed within the auditory cortex. Recently, B. A. Pearlmutter and A. M. Zador proposed an algorithm for monaural source separation under the assumption that the precise head-related transfer function (HRTF) and all the sound dictionary elements are known (ref. [1]). To apply this algorithm to the real <b>sound</b> <b>signals,</b> here I propose that non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) applied to the spectrograms of <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> would successfully give a set of sound dictionary elements. When NMF was applied to solo-music signals with an appropriate value for the rank of factorization, it could extract instrument-specific patterns of basis spectrograms, each of which has a peak frequency for different notes. Interestingly, the <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> converted back from the obtained basis spectrograms sounded more or less like the corresponding instrument, which suggests that the obtained basis spectrograms, or basis sound elements, would be a good candidate for the sound dictionary. When NMF was applied to <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> played with several different instruments, the obtained basis sound elements can be categorized into each instrument-specific pattern by hand. In addition, using the categorized elements, <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> can be reconstructed corresponding to each instrument part of the original music. The fact that source separation can be done using the basis sound elements obtained by NMF suggests that NMF would be a possible way to learn sound dictionaries from <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> ...|$|R
