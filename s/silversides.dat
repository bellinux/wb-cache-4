5|$|Anchovies, {{herrings}} and <b>silversides</b> are classic {{examples of}} schooling fish.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the nervous}} shark {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes (including <b>silversides,</b> smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including prawns, crabs, and mantis shrimps) and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark is also known to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite {{of the nervous}} shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are <b>silversides,</b> herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E
50|$|The hardyhead <b>silverside</b> (Atherinomorus lacunosus), {{also known}} as the broad-banded hardyhead, broad-banded <b>silverside,</b> Capricorn hardyhead, pitted hardyhead, robust hardyhead, robust <b>silverside,</b> slender hardyhead and wide-banded hardyhead <b>silverside,</b> is a <b>silverside</b> of the family Atherinidae. It occurs in the Indo-Pacific near the surfaceas well as in the Mediterranean, having invaded as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal.|$|R
50|$|Labidesthes sicculus, {{also known}} as the Brook <b>silverside</b> is a North American species of Neotropical <b>silverside.</b> The brook <b>silverside</b> lives in slow moving rivers and lakes from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi Basin and Gulf Coastal Plains. The brook <b>silverside</b> survives best in clear water with aquatic vegetation. L. sicculus feeds on a diet of copepods, insect larvae, and winged insects. The {{spawning}} season of the brook <b>silverside</b> occurs during the spring and early summer. The survival of freshwater fishes such as the brook <b>silverside</b> is increasingly threatened. In order to ensure survival of the brook <b>silverside,</b> turbidity of natural habitats should be monitored.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silverside</b> is an unincorporated {{community}} in New Castle County, Delaware, United States. <b>Silverside</b> is located where <b>Silverside</b> Road crosses under CSX Transportation's Philadelphia Subdivision and Interstate 95 northeast of Wilmington.|$|R
5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, <b>silversides,</b> needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|E
25|$|USS <b>Silversides</b> (SS/AGSS-236) is a Gato-class submarine, {{the first}} ship of the United States Navy {{to be named}} for the <b>silversides,</b> a small fish marked with a silvery stripe along each side of its body.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November 1962, <b>Silversides</b> was {{reclassified}} as {{an auxiliary}} submarine with hull classification symbol AGSS-236, and on 30 June 1969 {{her name was}} struck from the Naval Vessel Register. The South Chicago Chamber of Commerce promptly applied to the United States Department of the Navy for custody of <b>Silversides</b> to preserve her as a memorial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silversides</b> {{was used}} for {{exterior}} scenes in the 2002 film Below to depict the fictional USS Tiger Shark. She was towed in Lake Michigan for filming.|$|E
25|$|The {{last time}} the <b>Silversides</b> was dry-docked was after the war, in 1949, when the {{submarine}} went into the reserve fleet and her solid brass propellers were removed.|$|E

50|$|The brook <b>silverside</b> is on {{the lower}} end of the food chain, and is preyed on by many larger fish. The diet of the brook <b>silverside</b> {{consists}} mostly of zooplankton. They are highly specialized feeders with cladocerans comprising 80% of their diet, (40%) small flying insects, and (20%) midge larvae. Their diet varies with life stages and seasons. At a younger age, the brook <b>silverside</b> preys mostly on smaller fish. Their diet shifts to immature insects later. During winter, the brook <b>silverside</b> eats mostly planktonic crustaceans. Because of both intentional and unintentional species introduction, the brook <b>silverside</b> must compete for food sources. Specifically, the brook <b>silverside</b> has been forced to compete with the non-native Menidia audens, which was introduced by waterway construction. This forced competition of resources has led to a decrease in brook <b>silverside</b> populations.|$|R
25|$|<b>Silversides</b> {{departed}} Brisbane on 17 December 1942 and set {{course for}} New Ireland for her fourth war patrol. While far {{out at sea}} {{on the night of}} 22 December, the submarine's pharmacist's mate, PM1 Thomas Moore, performed a successful emergency appendectomy on FM2 George Platter, using ether as anaesthesia and using rudimentary tools primarily fashioned from kitchen utensils. With the operation over at 3:00 on 23 December, the submarine surfaced only to be immediately forced down by a Japanese destroyer and compelled to endure a severe depth charge attack. Thinking herself safe, <b>Silversides</b> surfaced only to find the destroyer still there. Additionally, a Japanese airplane had arrived on the scene, and proceeded to drop three bombs on the submarine, severely damaging her bow planes and causing them to lock on full dive. <b>Silversides</b> managed to level off just short of crush depth and eventually evaded the enemy ship before surfacing to recharge her batteries and effect emergency repairs.|$|E
25|$|Balao joined <b>Silversides</b> in {{a coordinated}} {{attack on a}} seven-ship convoy on 23 October, firing 10torpedoes at three ships that {{presented}} an overlapping target. She scored six hits. One ship was seen down by the bow, with her stern in the air; another listed heavily; and a third was riding low in the water. While Balao was maneuvering into position for a second attack, the convoy's escorts fired on her, forcing the submarine to dive. Balao lost contact with the convoy and failed in her attempts to reach <b>Silversides</b> to exchange information. She later learned, however, that her consort sank three of the seven ships.|$|E
25|$|Originally opened as the Great Lakes Naval Memorial & Museum, {{the museum}} {{is now known as}} the USS <b>Silversides</b> Submarine Museum, which also {{includes}} USCGC McLane (WSC-146) (a United States Coast Guard cutter) and a museum building.|$|E

50|$|The maar lakes, or axalpazcos, of the Oriental Basin {{are home}} to a closely knit set of endemic species, one at each crater lake. Some of these include the Atherinopsid fishes Alchichica <b>silverside</b> (Poblana alchichica), La Preciosa <b>silverside</b> (P. letholepis), Chignahuapan <b>silverside</b> (P. ferdebueni), and Quechulac <b>silverside</b> (P. squamata). Three species of dace (Evarra bustamantei, E. eigenmanni, and E. tlahuacensis) {{formerly}} native to the basin are presumed extinct since about 1970.|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{variation}} in prey consumption and food resource overlap {{was evident in}} an inland water body for mature male, mature female and immature inland <b>silverside</b> (Menidia beryllina). During the first growth phase marked by intensive somatic growth by immature inland <b>silverside,</b> few adults {{were present in the}} population (28 % of total catch), thus minimizing intraspecific competition for food resources between juvenile and adult inland <b>silverside.</b> During the second growth phase by adults, few juvenile inland <b>silverside</b> were present (0 % of total catch) in the population, again minimizing intraspecific competition for food resources between juvenile and adult inland <b>silverside.</b> A divergence in food resource overlap was observed when mature male, mature female and immature inland <b>silverside</b> were present in the population. These population-level demographic responses to energy acquisition are likely necessary to maximize individual growth of mature male, mature female and immature inland <b>silverside</b> resources unless there is differentiation in food resources. For the purpose of this study, the focus was on intraspecific partitioning of food resources by inland <b>silverside</b> because M. beryllina is the main obligate planktivore in the inland water body studied. Other studies have focused on interspecific competition of inland <b>silverside</b> with its congener Atlantic <b>silverside</b> (Menidia menidia) (Bengtson, 1982, 1984, 1985). In order to meet the energy demand of the two coinciding growth periods (first stage juvenile growth and second stage adult growth), partitioning of food resources is expected so that suitable energy is available to meet demands of the mature male, mature female, and immature inland <b>silverside.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the food habits and measure the degree of food-resource overlap between mature male, mature female, and immature inland <b>silverside</b> throughout the breeding and growing seasons in an inland water body...|$|R
