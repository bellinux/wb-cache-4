Musicality is explored through Making Music, {{with an emphasis on}} pitch, rhythm, beat, melody, and using a variety of real and pretend instruments. The presenter of Body Move encourages children to participate in movement and dance, developing physical coordination and motor development. Linguistics and aural skills are at the centre of the Word Play segment, featuring a puppet named Chatterbox who assists in the exploration of language through stories and rhymes. Puzzles and Patterns has a focus on logical thinking and mathematics, with a puppet named Jup Jup used as a tool for the presenter to complete puzzles or solve problems.|$|E
25|$|The <b>space</b> <b>segment</b> {{consists}} of multiple communication satellites which broadcast the correction messages {{generated by the}} WAAS Master Stations for reception by the user segment. The satellites also broadcast {{the same type of}} range information as normal GPS satellites, effectively increasing the number of satellites available for a position fix. The <b>space</b> <b>segment</b> {{consists of}} three commercial satellites: Inmarsat-4 F3, Telesat's Anik F1R, and Intelsat's Galaxy 15. A fourth satellite, Eutelsat 117 West B, is currently in testing and is scheduled to go live in 2018.|$|E

500|$|... "Put Yourself in My Place" [...] {{has been}} {{performed}} {{on some of}} Minogue's concert tours, and has appeared on several compilation albums. It was first performed live on Minogue's 1998 Intimate and Live concert tour in the opening segment. An unreleased acoustic version that was performed during the rehearsals of the tour was added on her extended play Live and Other B-Sides, which was released in Australia as a free gift with her sixth studio album Impossible Princess (1997). This version was sung {{as one of the}} opening tracks of her 2001 On a Night Like This Tour, and was included on the live DVD of the show. On her KylieFever2002 concert tour, the single was included on Minogue's [...] "The Crying Game" [...] medley which also featured the titular track, [...] "Confide in Me", [...] "Finer Feelings", and [...] "Dangerous Game". The single's most recent appearance was on her 2005 [...] in London, United Kingdom, where it appeared on her Minx In <b>Space</b> <b>segment</b> and served as one of the encore tracks. Since its release, it has appeared on four of Minogue's greatest hits albums: Hits+ (2000), Confide in Me (2001), Ultimate Kylie (2004), and [...] (2007). The Driza-Bon remix was included on her 2010 remix album Essential Mixes. In 2012, British recording artist and producer MNEK covered the song and released it on his official Soundcloud page.|$|E

30|$|Many {{factors are}} {{influencing}} {{the acceptability of}} energy technology. The transformation of the energy sector is looking for clean energy technology that is also suitable for baseload power generation. Terrestrial solar energy has many obstructions, so solar power from space without any hindrance has higher priority for adoption, and it is suitable for future energy continuous demand supply. As technology is advancing, the possibility of satellite solar-based power station {{is more than a}} science fiction now and is possible in the coming future. Microwave transmission with high beam efficiency is the key issue to be improved for the feasibility of satellite solar power station. Besides others, research should focus on the reduction of <b>space</b> <b>segment’s</b> components dimension and space vehicle dispatch cost. Concerning <b>space</b> <b>segments,</b> applying an optimized value of fractional power unit modules and assembling it for constant baseload power supply have economic advantages, as well as that the antenna size is also reduced. This work deals with system components size estimation and optimization for a selected 10 -GW baseload power supply. Four case studies have been conducted considering the different unit sizes, and the system model is analyzed for suitable power unit selection.|$|R

To date, machines {{have been unable to}} match human performance. One profound difference between biological and engineering systems comes at the input stage. In machines, an acoustic signal is typically chopped into short equally <b>spaced</b> <b>segments</b> in time. In biological systems, the cochlea outputs asynchronous spikes that respond in real-time to acoustic inputs.
