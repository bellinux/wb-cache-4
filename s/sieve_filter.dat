40|$|Greenhouse {{detection}} using {{remote sensing}} technologies {{is an important}} research area for yield estimation, sustainable development, urban and rural planning and management. An approach was developed in this study for the detection and delineation of greenhouse areas from high resolution satellite imagery. Initially, the candidate greenhouse patches were detected using supervised classification techniques. For this purpose, Maximum Likelihood (ML), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification techniques were applied and compared. Then, <b>sieve</b> <b>filter</b> and morphological operations were performed for improving the classification results. Finally, the obtained candidate plastic and glass greenhouse areas were delineated using boundary tracing and Douglas Peucker line simplification algorithms. The proposed approach was implemented in the Kumluca district of Antalya, Turkey utilizing pan-sharpened WorldView- 2 satellite imageries. Kumluca is the prominent district of Antalya with greenhouse cultivation and includes both plastic and glass greenhouses intensively. When the greenhouse classification results were analysed, it can be stated that the SVM classification provides most accurate results and RF classification follows this. The SVM classification overall accuracy was obtained as 90. 28...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a microfiltration filter for separation of biological microparticles from body fluids, including peripheral blood. The model used a single membrane filter with a homogeneous 2 D transmission structure. In the model, the individual sieve with a uniform transmission structure in 2 D space was applied. Because of the required survival of biological particles, the presented model was limited to the narrow filtration conditions that guarantee biological activity of these particles. In this model, the filtration process proceeds in the gravitational field without the involvement of external forces forcing or inhibiting the filtration process. Based on this model there were given basic dependencies describing the required filtration process conditions, such as filtration time and internal forces for particle migration in the filtered body fluid. The basic relationships between the height of the filtered column, duration of the process, and average fluid expenditure of the filtration process for different shapes of the channels molecular drainage lines filter have been determined. Based on this data, the directions of further works on improving the presented model of molecular filtration of biological particles for enriching selected biological fractions have been described.

40|$|Abstract — We present Sieve – an {{infrastructure}} for fast content-based data distribution to interested users. The ability of <b>Sieve</b> to <b>filter</b> and forward high-bandwidth data streams stems from its distributed pipelined architecture. The complex message filtering task is broken-up into {{a sequence of}} light-weight filtering components resulting in high end-to-end throughput. Furthermore, since each component is assigned to a node based on its resource constraints, the queue buildup inside the nodes is minimal resulting in low end-to-end latency. Our experimental results based on real system implementation show that Sieve can sustain a throughput of more than 5000 messages per second for 100000 subscriptions with predicates of 10 attributes.
