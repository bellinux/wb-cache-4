40|$|Agriculture {{is being}} {{displaced}} by development throughout the United States. Because agricultural activities vary among crop types and farm operations, and because agricultural competes for space with urban land uses at the urban-rural fringe, {{it is important}} that we understand the spatial dynamics of agriculture in this area, where conversion to development is most acute. In particular <b>specialized</b> <b>crops,</b> such as fruits and vegetables, are important because they promote biodiversity and provide more diverse food products than commodity crops. I developed a model to test the idea, from the von Thünen model of agricultural land rents, that specialty crops are more likely to be located lost the process of urbanization than commodity crops. Because historical data on the locations of farms by crop type do not exist at a resolution finer than counties, I used dasymetric mapping to estimate locations of <b>specialized</b> <b>crops</b> in 1992 and then analyze their loss by 2001. The study area for this analysis was the ten-county region of Southeast Michigan. A regression analysis showed that <b>specialized</b> <b>crops</b> were significantly more likely to be located where there was less development and more agriculture in an area, higher population density and nearer distance to water. These relationships were then used to create a suitability surface for specialty agriculture in 1992. Specialized and Commodity designations, for which land areas were available at the county level, were then allocated to agricultural areas identified in a land-cover data product, and those that were lost between 1992 and 2001 were identified. The tabulated results showed that the entire region experienced a higher rate of loss <b>specialized</b> <b>crops</b> compared with commodity crops, with the loss happening more rapidly in the urban-rural fringe than in exurban areas. This application of dasymetric mapping could be used as a model to investigate agricultural dynamics of other urban areas. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{vicinity}} of a city, farmers are confronted with increasing agricultural land prices and rents along the rural-urban gradient, but they concurrently enjoy the advantages associated with proximity to a larger and wealthier consumer base. We hypothesize that farmers transition from low-value, land-intensive " crops to high-value, labor-intensive " crops on parcels located closer to urban centers. Once returns to development of a parcel exceed the profits associated with farming, exurban farmers may sell their land for conversion to urban use. Urban pressure in the rural-urban fringe intensifies as cities expand. We differentiate between a gradual process of urban growth (or urbanization) and urban sprawl. Utilizing farmland fragmentation measures as indicators of sprawl, we hypothesize that urban sprawl burdens " farms {{to the extent that}} they accelerate the transition to <b>specialized</b> <b>crops</b> or convert farmland to urban use.

Three methodological steps are considered: i) the environmental impacts of farms are assessed using terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, soil and freshwater ecotoxicity as well as natural land transformation; ii) the most relevant indicators of agriculture damages on ecosystems quality are aggregated into an index; iii) the farms' index scores are integrated with farm assets, land and labor, into the Sustainable Value approach (SVA), as indicator of natural resources used by farms. As a case study, the methodology was applied to arable farms with and without animal husbandry of the "Alta Murgia" National Park.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for evaluating the impact of specialization in agriculture on soil carbon balance. The main aims {{of the study were}} (1) to model the impact of long-term changes in agriculture on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at regional level using the Rothamsted C model (RothC), (2) validate these results by conventional SOC analysis, and (3) to compare impacts of “as was” and “mixed farming system” scenarios on SOC trends. The study area covered 1800 km 2 of Dolnoslaskie province, Poland. The significant changes have occurred in this area since 60 's. The production system has changed from the mixed crop-animal farming to highly <b>specialized</b> <b>crop</b> production. We evaluated two scenarios. The starting point for both scenarios was the situation in 1960 (co-existing low intensity crop and animal production). The scenario S- 1 reflected recorded changes in agriculture, namely slow transition into specialized and more intensive production with progressive simplification of crop rotation and decline in livestock density. Scenario S- 2 constituted hypothetical continuation of the starting situation (i. e. low intensity crop and animal production). In the period 1960 – 2014 SOC accumulation was observed in “as was” scenario (S- 1) in almost all locations of the area characterized by low initial SOC content. The model outputs were then validated using SOC measurements in samples collected in two periods: 1960 – 1970 and 2010 – 2014. The modelled SOC stock explained 56 % of variability of the measured SOC stock. Comparison of S- 1 and S- 2 scenarios revealed that re-introduction of mixed farming with current intensity of agricultural production has capacity for further increasing SOC stocks in the region. </p...|$|E

The results generally support the Boserupian model of population-induced agricultural intensification, but {{do not support the}} "more people-less erosion" hypothesis, with population pressure found to contribute to erosion in the densely populated highlands. Agricultural technical assistance programs have location-specific impacts on agricultural production and land degradation, contributing to higher value of crop production in the lowlands, but to soil erosion in the highlands. By contrast, NGO programs focusing on agriculture and environment are helping to reduce erosion, but have mixed impacts on production. We find little evidence of impact of access to markets, roads and credit, land tenure or title on agricultural intensification and crop production, though road access appears to contribute to land degradation in the highlands. Education increases household incomes, but also reduces crop production in the lowlands. We do not find evidence of a poverty-land degradation trap, while poverty has mixed impacts on agricultural production: smaller farms obtain higher crop production per hectare, while households with fewer livestock have crop production. These findings suggest that development of factor markets can improve agricultural efficiency. Several other factors that contribute to increased value of crop production, without significant impacts on land degradation, include <b>specialized</b> <b>crop</b> production, livestock and nonfarm income strategies, and irrigation. In general, the results imply that the strategies to increase agricultural production and reduce land degradation must be location-specific, and that there are few "win-win" opportunities to simultaneously increase production and reduce land degradation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of adaptation strategies {{of agriculture and}} forestry to climate change is conditioned by {{the knowledge of the}} impacts of climate change on the vegetation cycle and of the associated uncertainties. Using the same generic Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate the response of various vegetation types is more straightforward than using several <b>specialized</b> <b>crop</b> and forestry models, as model implementation differences are difficult to assess. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the potential of a LSM to address this issue. Using the SURFEX (“Surface Externalisée”) modeling platform, we produced and analyzed 150 -yr (1950 – 2100) simulations of the biomass of four vegetation types (rainfed straw cereals, rainfed grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests) and of the soil water content associated to each of these vegetation types over France. Statistical methods were used to quantify the impact of climate change on simulated phenological dates. The duration of soil moisture stress periods increases everywhere in France, especially for grasslands with, on average, an increase of 9 days per year in near-future (NF) conditions and 36 days per year in distant-future (DF) conditions. For all the vegetation types, leaf onset and the annual maximum LAI occur earlier. For straw cereals in the Languedoc-Provence-Corsica area, NF leaf onset occurs 18 days earlier and 37 days earlier in DF conditions, on average. On the other hand, local discrepancies are simulated for the senescence period (e. g. earlier in western and southern France for broadleaf forests, slightly later in mountainous areas of eastern France) for both NF and DF. Changes in phenological dates are more uncertain in DF than in NF conditions in relation to differences in climate models, especially for forests. Finally, it is shown that while changes in leaf onset are mainly driven by air temperature, longer soil moisture stress periods trigger earlier leaf senescence over most of France. This shows that developing in situ soil moisture networks could help monitoring the long-term impacts of climate change...|$|E

40|$|Globe {{artichoke}} and cardoon, {{belonging to}} the Asteraceae (Compositae) family, are herbaceous perennial plants native to the Mediterranean area, which are traditionally grown as vegetables for the heads and the fleshy petiole leaves, respectively. Italy is the richest reserve of globe artichoke autochthonous germplasm, which is vegetatively propagated and well adapted to the different pedoclimatic conditions of the Country. In Central Italian environments, the Romanesco type is widespread. In the last years, the development of in vitro technologies allowed the propagation of Romanesco globe artichoke type and its rapid expansion. As a result, the micropropagated Romanesco clone C 3 has replaced many landraces traditionally grown in the Latium Region and has led either to a significant erosion of local genetic resources. As regards Italian cultivated cardoon germplasm, there are few studies on its genetic characterization and identification {{and there is a}} lack of information about the genetic variability existing within and among accessions. For the wild cardoon, no <b>specialized</b> <b>crop</b> is present and it represents mainly a weed in Italian environments. The great variability existing in Cynara spp. has not been described, the nomenclature of Italian germplasm is not always very clear since there are many cases of homonyms. In addition, Italian globe artichoke sector is facing a crisis due principally to the appearance on the market of foreign products and to the high labor cost required for crop cultivation and harvesting. In order to overcome this crisis several possible industrial uses were considered for the species. Considering these preliminary remarks, a strategy for valorizing Italian germplasm using biomass and biocompound production has been carried out during the three years of PhD program. The first objective of PhD work consisted in (i) characterizing agro-morphologically Italian germplasm using UPOV descriptors, (ii) assessing the genetic variability existing within and among landraces/clones and (iii) identifying and preserving genetic resources for the development of future plant breeding programs. As a result of this characterization, three genotypes have been selected and registered under the names of Michelangelo, Donatello and Raffaello. In order to analyze Italian Cynara spp. germplasm also from a biomass point of view, different traits explaining plant vigor and dry matter production have been considered. The aerial biomass yield resulted very high underlining the possibility of using this crop as raw industrial material. A focal point of PhD program was to set up biocompound extraction methods and analysis techniques to optimize polyphenol recovery from biomass of Cynara spp at a laboratory scale. In particular, ASE was found as the best extraction technique which allows to reduce extraction time and solvent consumption, increase nutraceutical yield and improvement of extract quality. Moreover, the kinetics of biomass and bio-compound production has been evaluated and the optimal physiological stage to collect plant material grown in open field has been identified. Biochemical characterization has been performed using the methods set up and collecting plant material in the optimal physiological stage identified in order to distinguish which genotypes were more suitable for bio-compound production purpose. The last focal point of PhD program was the development of an alternative technique for biomass and biocompound production in greenhouse grown conditions. Results obtained in the three PhD years, highlighted the possibility of using successfully some Cynara spp. genotypes for biomass and bio-compound production, in particular in open field condition. Also the real prospect of using some globe artichoke genotypes for food and non-food dual-production (biomass for biocompound extraction and heads for human food) has been underlined...|$|E
40|$|The average net {{farm income}} was $ 113, 462 for the 46 farms {{included}} in the 2004 annual report of the Southeastern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. This was an increase of 32 % from 2003. In constant dollars, 2004 was the most profitable year for association members in over twenty years of the association records. Higher crop prices, higher corn yields, and high profits for dairy operations were among factors that combined to make 2004 a very profitable year for the average association farm. As in previous years, the income levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average. When the net farm incomes for the 46 farms in the report were ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary. A number of very profitable farms had {{a major impact on}} the average for all farms. Thirty-nine percent (39 %) earned net farm incomes over $ 100, 000; 15 % of the farms experienced negative net farm incomes. The median or middle income was $ 88, 307, considerably lower than the association average. The high 20 % of these farms had an average net farm income of $ 327, 847; farms in the low 20 % averaged $- 20, 547. Average gross cash farm income in 2004 was $ 509, 817 for these 46 farms. This was an 8 % increase from 2003. Milk sales were 41 % of gross income, up 28 % from 2003. Corn and soybean sales accounted for another 36 % of income. Total crop sales accounted for 38 % while livestock sales accounted for 49 % of total cash receipts. Government payments (of all types) averaged $ 33, 294 in 2004, a 4 % increase from the previous year. Government payments increased primarily due to the receipt of LDP payments in the fall of 2004 as prices decreased at harvest and not because of increased direct payments. Government payments were $ 31, 195 in 2003, $ 19, 375 in 2002, $ 40, 227 in 2001, and $ 50, 496 in 2000. As a percent of gross income, they were 7 % in 2004, compared to 7 % in 2003, 5 % in 2002, 11 % in 2001, and 14 % in 2000. Average total cash expenses were $ 383, 908 in 2004. This was an increase of 5 % from the 2003 average. Feed expense was 15 % of the total, an increase of 14 % from 2003. Seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals were 17 % of the total, up 12 % from 2003 levels. Land rent was 9 % of the total, while labor and repairs each accounted for 7 %. Average rate of return on assets (ROA) was 8 % in 2004 with assets valued at cost basis, up from 7 % in 2003. Rate of return on equity (ROE) averaged 9 %, also an increase from 7 % in 2003. The fact that ROE exceeded ROA indicates that debt capital earned more than its interest cost. Average total equity (of the 33 sole proprietors) was $ 836, 502 at the end of 2004, an increase of $ 87, 659 during the year for these farms (assets valued at cost basis). Except for a decline during 1993, average equity has improved steadily since 1986. The average debt to asset ratio decreased slightly, from 34 % to 33 %. Average corn and soybean yields were substantially higher than 2003 levels. The average corn yield was 169 bushels per acre, up from 158 in 2003; the soybean yield was 43 bushels per acre, up from 37 in 2003. Results by Type of Farm The 46 farms in the report were classified as a certain type (e. g., dairy) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this criteria, there were 13 crop farms, 13 dairy farms, and 6 crop/dairy farms. There were 8 farms which did not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %. Dairy farms were most profitable in 2004 with average net farm income of $ 158, 170. <b>Specialized</b> <b>crop</b> farms and crop/dairy farms also had net farm incomes higher than the Association average.

40|$|Globe {{artichoke}} and cardoon, {{belonging to}} the Asteraceae (Compositae) family, are herbaceous perennial plants native to the Mediterranean area, which are traditionally grown as vegetables for the heads and the fleshy petiole leaves, respectively. Italy is the richest reserve of globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L.) autochthonous germplasm, which is vegetatively propagated and well adapted to the different pedoclimatic conditions of the Country. On the basis of head harvest time, these traditionally grown genetic resources are classified as early or late distinct clonal varietal groups. Other distinct varietal groups are also identified, according to the morphological traits of the head, into four main typologies such as Violetto di Sicilia, Spinoso Sardo, Catanese and Romanesco. In Central Italian environments, the Romanesco type, characterized by a spherical or sub-spherical and non-spiny green-violet heads, is widespread. In the last years, the development of in vitro technologies allowed the propagation of Romanesco globe artichoke type and its rapid expansion. As a result, the Romanesco clone C 3 has been in vitro micropropagated and widely distributed to the farmers. This clone has replaced many Romanesco landraces traditionally grown in the Latium Region and has led either to a significant erosion of local genetic resources or a loss of diversity. Moreover, introduction of new seed-propagated F 1 hybrids such as Madrigal, Concerto, Opal, Tema, and Romolo, well suited to market demands, represents a further factor increasing the risk of genetic erosion for autochthonous germplasm. As regards Italian cultivated cardoon (Cynara cardunculus var. altilis DC) germplasm, there are few studies on its genetic characterization and identification {{and there is a}} lack of information about the genetic variability existing within and among accessions. For the wild cardoon (Cynara cardunculus var. sylvestris Lam.), no <b>specialized</b> <b>crop</b> is present and it represents mainly a weed in Italian environments. The great variability existing in Cynara spp. has not been described, the nomenclature of Italian germplasm is not always very clear since there are many cases of homonyms. In addition to this risk of genetic erosion, in the last years, Italian globe artichoke sector is facing a crisis due principally to the appearance on the market of foreign products and to the high labor cost required for crop cultivation and harvesting. In order to overcome this crisis several possible uses of Cynara spp. were considered such as i) seeds for oil, ii) roots for inulin, iii) biomass for energy, iv) fiber for pulp and paper and as potential reinforcement in polymer composites v) green forage for ruminant feeding, vi) proteins as natural rennet for traditional cheese making, and vii) entire plant for metalaccumulation. These new possible applications of the crop are linked principally to the European Union research support on new agricultural by-products (industrial raw materials) and led to an increasing interest also in aboveground globe artichoke biomass. Considering these preliminary remarks, a strategy for valorizing Italian germplasm using biomass and biocompound production has been carried out during the three years of PhD program. In particular, nine Italian spring landraces (Ascolano, Campagnano, Castellammare, Jesino, Montelupone A, Montelupone B, Bianco di Pertosa, Pisa and Tondo Rosso di Paestum), ten ‘Romanesco’ clones (S 2, S 3, S 5, S 11, S 17, S 18, S 22,S 23, Grato 1 and Campagnano), seven cultivated cardoon accessions (AFB, AFFG, AFGR, AFGI, AFM, AFM 2, AFN) and AFS wild cardoon {{belonging to the}} joint germplasm collection of Tuscia University and ENEA have been considered in our PhD study. Open field trials were conducted at the Experimental Field Station of ARSIAL (Latium Regional Agency for the Development and the Innovation of Agriculture) in Cerveteri, Rome and in Tarquinia, Viterbo while greenhouse experiments were carried out at the Experimental Station of Tuscia University in Viterbo (Italy). The first objective of PhD work consisted in (i) characterizing agro-morphologically Italian germplasm using UPOV descriptors, (ii) assessing the genetic variability existing within and among landraces/clones and (iii) identifying and preserving genetic resources for the development of future plant breeding programs. As a result of this characterization, three genotypes have been selected and registered under the names of Michelangelo, Donatello and Raffaello. In order to analyze Italian Cynara spp. germplasm also from a biomass point of view, different traits explaining plant vigor and dry matter production have been considered. The aerial biomass yield resulted very high underlining the possibility of using this crop as raw industrial material. In particular, some genotypes, such as Ascolano, Campagnano, Pisa, Bianco di Pertosa for globe artichoke and AFFG and AFM for cardoon showed the highest biomass yield. A focal point of PhD program was to set up biocompound extraction methods and analysis techniques to optimize polyphenol recovery from biomass of Cynara spp at a laboratory scale. In particular, conventional (i. e. Soxhlet and maceration) and modern extraction techniques (such as Microwave-Assisted Extraction MAE, and Accelerated Solvent Extraction ASE) have been compared and, using a full two-level factorial experimental design, ASE was found as the best extraction technique which allows to reduce extraction time and solvent consumption, increase nutraceutical yield and improvement of extract quality. Moreover, the kinetics of biomass and biocompound production has been evaluated and the optimal physiological stage to collect plant material grown in open field has been identified. Biochemical characterization has been performed using the methods set up and collecting plant material in the optimal physiological stage identified in order to distinguish which genotypes were more suitable for bio-compound production purpose. As a result of morphological and biochemical characterization, genotypes were well distinguished from each other and were identified those which are the most suitable for food use, for biomass production and/or for dual-production (food and non-food). The last focal point of PhD program was the development of an alternative technique for biomass and biocompound production in greenhouse grown conditions. The adaptation of globe artichoke and cardoon genotypes to floating system has been evaluated and the biochemical and molecular responses of the plant to the salinity stress have been also investigated. Results obtained in the three PhD years, highlighted the possibility of using successfully some Cynara spp. genotypes for biomass and bio-compound production, in particular in open field condition. Also the real prospect of using some globe artichoke genotypes for food and non-food dual-production (biomass for biocompound extraction and heads for human food) has been underlined. Il carciofo e il cardo, appartenenti alla famiglia delle Asteraceae (Compositae), sono delle piante erbacee, perenni, originarie del bacino del Mediterraneo e tradizionalmente coltivate a scopo alimentare rispettivamente per i capolini e le foglie carnose. L’Italia rappresenta una delle più ricche riserve di germoplasma autoctono di carciofo (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L.), il quale è propagato vegetativamente e ben adattato alle differenti condizioni pedoclimatiche del nostro Paese. Sulla base dell’epoca di maturazione commerciale dei capolini, i genotipi di carciofo vengono classificati in tipologie precoci e autunnali. Un altro criterio di classificazione, basato sulle caratteristiche morfologiche dei capolini, suddivide i suddetti genotipi in quattro gruppi varietali: ‘Violetto di Sicilia’, dello ‘Spinoso Sardo’, del ‘Catanese’ e del ‘Romanesco’. La tipologia ‘Romanesco’, caratterizzata da capolini inermi di forma rotonda o ellittica e di colore verde-viola, è molto diffusa negli ambienti di coltivazione cinaricola dell’Italia centrale. Negli ultimi anni, la messa a punto della tecnica di propagazione in vitro per il carciofo, ha portato ad una rapida diffusione di cloni della tipologia ‘Romanesco’. In particolare, il clone C 3 propagato in vitro ha conosciuto una grande diffusione nelle aree di coltivazione cinaricola, sostituendo molte varietà afferenti alla tipologia ‘Romanesco’ tradizionalmente coltivate nel Lazio e determinando rischi di erosione genetica per queste risorse genetiche. Inoltre, l’introduzione sul mercato di nuovi ibridi F 1 come Madrigal, Concerto, Opal, Tema, and Romolo, meglio rispondenti alle richieste dei consumatori, rappresenta un ulteriore fattore di rischio per la perdita del germoplasma autoctono. Per quanto riguarda il cardo coltivato (Cynara cardunculus var. altilis DC), esistono pochi studi sulla caratterizzazione genetica e sull’identificazione del germoplasma autoctono e mancano dati riguardanti la variabilità genetica esistente tra ed entro accessioni diverse. Per il cardo selvatico (Cynara cardunculus var. sylvestris Lam.), non sono presenti coltivazioni specializzate ed esso rappresenta un’infestante negli ambienti di coltivazione cinaricola italiani. L’ampia variabilità esistente nel germoplasma di Cynara spp. non è stata descritta; la nomenclatura delle risorse genetiche non è spesso chiara e spesso si trovano casi di omonimia. Oltre a questo rischio di erosione genetica, negli ultimi anni assistiamo anche ad una forte crisi del settore cinaricolo dovuta alla comparsa sul mercato di prodotti stranieri e all’alto costo di produzione e di raccolta previsti dalla coltura. Negli ultimi decenni, per far fronte a questa crisi, sono stati considerati diversi possibili usi per la specie quali, ad esempio, i) la produzione di olio dai semi; ii) l’estrazione di inulina dalle radici; iii) la produzione di energia dalla biomassa; iv) l’estrazione della fibra per l’industria cartaria; v) la produzione di foraggio da destinare all’alimentazione animale; vi) la produzione di formaggi come caglio vegetale mediante impiego di estratti fiorali; vii) l’accumulo di metalli pesanti nella pianta. Lo studio di questi nuovi possibili utilizzi è stato reso possibile grazie ai finanziamenti della Comunità Europea che ha incentivato e supportato la ricerca nel settore delle agrorisorse e ha portato anche ad un forte interesse nell’uso della biomassa di carciofo. Nel corso dei tre anni di dottorato è stata portata avanti una strategia di ricerca volta alla valorizzazione del germoplasma italiano di carciofo e cardo basata sull’uso della biomassa per l’estrazione di biomolecole. In particolare, sono stati considerati nove genotipi autoctoni primaverili (Ascolano, Campagnano, Castellammare, Jesino, Montelupone A, Montelupone B, Bianco di Pertosa, Pisa and Tondo Rosso di Paestum), dieci cloni della tipologia ‘Romanesco’ (S 2, S 3, S 5, S 11, S 17, S 18, S 22, S 23, Grato 1 and Campagnano), sette genotipi di cardo coltivato (AFB, AFFG, AFGR, AFGI, AFM, AFM 2, AFN) e un genotipo di cardo selvatico (AFS), tutti appartenenti alla collezione di germoplasma dell’Università della Tuscia e dell’ENEA. Le prove sperimentali di campo sono state svolte presso l’Azienda sperimentale ARSIAL (Agenzia Regionale per lo Sviluppo e l’Innovazione in Agricoltura) di Cerveteri (Roma) e di Tarquinia (Viterbo), mentre le prove di serra sono state condotte nella Azienda Sperimentale dell’Università della Tuscia, a Viterbo (Italia). Il primo obiettivo del dottorato ha riguardato i) la caratterizzazione agro-morfologica del germoplasma italiano per mezzo dei descrittori UPOV, ii) la valutazione della variabilità genetica esistente tra ed entro i genotipi, e iii) l’identificazione e la conservazione delle risorse genetiche in collezione per lo sviluppo futuro di programmi di miglioramento genetico. La caratterizzazione del germoplasma ha portato alla selezione di tre genotipi validi per la produzione edule che sono stati validati e proposti per l’iscrizione al Registro Nazionale delle Varietà con i nomi di Michelangelo, Donatello e Raffaello. Al fine di caratterizzare il germoplasma anche da un punto di vista della biomassa, sono stati anche considerati diversi caratteri morfologici atti a descrivere il vigore della pianta e a quantificare la produzione di sostanza secca. La produzione di biomassa è risultata davvero molto interessante nel nostro lavoro e si è sottolineato il grande potenziale di utilizzo della coltura nel settore industriale. Alcuni genotipi come Ascolano, Campagnano, Pisa e Bianco di Pertosa, per il carciofo, e AFFG e AFM, per il cardo, sono risultati davvero interessanti dal punto di vista della produzione di biomassa. Un altro importante obiettivo del dottorato è stato quello di mettere a punto un metodo per l’estrazione di polifenoli al fine di ottimizzare le rese. Sono state messe a confronto tecniche convenzionali (ad esempio metodo Soxhlet e macerazione) ed altre più innovative (ad esempio Microwave Assisted Extraction - MAE e Accelerated Solvent Extraction - ASE). La tecnica ASE ha fornito i migliori risultati, consentendo anche di ridurre i tempi d’estrazione e il consumo di solvente, fornendo al tempo stesso alte rese e elevata qualità degli estratti. E’ stato anche condotto lo studio della cinetica di accumulo della biomassa e delle biomolecole in campo al fine di individuare il momento migliore per la raccolta del materiale in campo ed ottimizzare le rese. Una volta messo a punto il metodo d’estrazione e individuata l’epoca ottimale per il prelievo delle biomasse in campo, si è andati ad effettuate le estrazioni al fine di caratterizzare biochimicamente i genotipi in prova e di selezionere quelli più rispondenti a tale attitudine. La caratterizzazione morfologica e biochimica hanno permesso di ben identificare i genotipi e di selezionare quelli più adatti per la produzione di capolini (‘food production’), di biomassa o per la duplice attitudine (food and non-food). Nel corso del dottorato si è anche valutato un sistema alternativo per la produzione di biomassa e di biomolecole in serra. E’ stata valutata l’adattabilità del carciofo e del cardo al sistema di coltivazione fuori suolo (floating system), soprattutto per evidenziare risposta biochimica e molecolare delle piante sottoposte allo stress salino in termini di aumento nella produzione di sostanze fenoliche. I risultati ottenuti nel corso del dottorato hanno messo in luce la reale possibilità di usare alcuni genotipi di carciofo e di cardo per la produzione edule, altri per quella di biomassa e di biomolecole, soprattutto in condizioni di pieno campo. Si è inoltre delineata una reale prospettiva per l’impiego di alcuni genotipi di carciofo in una duplice destinazione commerciale (biomassa per l’estrazione di biomolecole e capolini per la destinazione alimentare).
