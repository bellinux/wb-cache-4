5|$|The ancient chronicles mention {{two tests}} that Dutthagamani planned {{to find out}} these warriors' skill before the battle. For the first test, Dutthagamani asked the warriors to drink a large {{cauldron}} of toddy, intending to test their strength. When all others refused, Suranimala <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> drank the entire cauldron without any effort. The second test was to test Nandimithra, {{the commander of the}} army. Dutthagamani had his royal elephant, Kandula, infuriated and set on Nandimithra. However, the warrior stood his ground and taking the elephant by its tusks, pushed it to the ground. Thus clearing all doubts as to the abilities and skill of his warriors, Dutthagamani sounded the war drums and raising his flags, started the assault to take Vijithapura.|$|E

25|$|During {{the treaty}} {{negotiation}} with South Korea, the Japanese government proposed that it pay monetary compensation to individual Korean victims, {{in line with}} the payments to Western POWs. The Korean government instead insisted that Japan pay money collectively to the Korean government, and that is what occurred. The South Korean government then used the funds for economic development. The content of the negotiations was not released by the Korean government until 2004, although it was public knowledge in Japan. Due to the release of the information by the Korean government, a number of claimants have <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> are attempting to sue the government for individual compensation of victims.|$|E
25|$|In July 1910, {{striking}} miners {{secured a}} march permit {{from the town}} of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd—killing a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release.|$|E

25|$|On June 29 and June 30, 1941, {{there were}} random shootings of Jews in Liepāja by German soldiers. About 99 Jews (plus or minus 30) {{were killed in}} these shootings. Shootings began almost immediately. For example, at 5:00p.m. on June 29, {{arriving}} German soldiers seized 7 Jews and 22 Latvians and shot them at a bomb crater {{in the middle of}} Ulicha street. At 9:00p.m. the same day German soldiers came to Hika street, where they assembled all the residents and asked if any were refugees from Germany. One man, Walter (or Victor) Hahn, a conductor who had fled Vienna in 1938, <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> was immediately shot. (Another source says that Hahn was killed by a mob of Latvians fomented by Nazis.) The next day, June 30, soldiers went to the City Hospital, arrested several Jewish physicians and patients, disregarded the protests of the Latvians on the hospital staff, and shot them. Among the victims was 10-year-old Masha Blumenau.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} made {{available}} for download on April 20, 2005, the sixth anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Ledonne sought to remain anonymous at the game's debut to avoid any possible controversy, which he would later regret as it created the impression {{he had something to}} hide. Under the alias [...] "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend of one of the Columbine victims, Rachel Scott. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via Paypal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> was greeted with requests for interviews. [...] "That's when I decided that I had to grow a backbone and stand up for my creation," [...] Ledonne said.|$|E
500|$|Two sliding {{sports were}} contested at the 1948 Winter Games, {{the first was}} bobsled. [...] A {{controversy}} erupted when it was alleged that the sleds of the United States team had been sabotaged. [...] It was discovered that the steering wheels had been damaged. [...] After news broke of the apparent improprieties a truck driver <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> admitted to having accidentally backed into the shed housing the bobsleds. [...] The accident however did not hinder the United States teams who won a bronze in the two-man event and a gold and a bronze in the four-man event. [...] The Swiss two-man teams placed first and second, {{which is the best}} possible results for the event since only two teams were allowed to enter.

500|$|At 00:45, {{lifeboat}} No. 7 was rowed {{away from}} Titanic with 28passengers on board (despite {{a capacity of}} 65). Lifeboat No. 6, on the port side, was the next to be lowered at 00:55. It also had 28 people on board, among them the [...] "unsinkable" [...] Margaret [...] "Molly" [...] Brown.

Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> climbed down a rope into the lifeboat; he was the only male passenger whom Lightoller allowed to board during the port side evacuation. Peuchen's role highlighted a key problem during the evacuation: there were hardly any seamen to man the boats. Some had been sent below to open gangway doors to allow more passengers to be evacuated, but they never returned. They were presumably trapped and drowned by the rising water below decks.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} {{that the first}} assassination attempt had been unsuccessful, Princip thought about a position to assassinate the Archduke on his return journey, and {{decided to move to}} a position in front of a nearby food shop (Schiller's delicatessen), near the Latin Bridge. At this point the Archdukes' motorcade turned off the Appel Quay, mistakenly following the original route which would have taken them to the National Museum. Governor Potiorek, who was sharing the second vehicle with the Imperial couple, called out to the driver to reverse and take the Quay to the hospital. Driver Lojka stopped the car close to where Princip was standing, prior to backing up. The latter <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> fired two shots from a distance of about one and a half metres (5 feet) using a Belgian-made 9×17mm (.380 ACP) Fabrique Nationale model 1910 semi-automatic pistol. Pistol serial numbers 19074, 19075, 19120 and 19126 were supplied to the assassins; Princip used #19074. According to Albertini, [...] "the first bullet wounded the Archduke in the jugular vein, the second inflicted an abdominal wound on the Duchess." [...] Princip was immediately arrested. [...] At his sentencing, Princip stated that his intention had been to kill Governor Potiorek, rather than Sophie.|$|E
500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier <b>stepped</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
500|$|The {{prisoners were}} taken to the Gudovac {{municipal}} building and held there for a time. They were told that they would be taken to Bjelovar for interrogation. Instead, they were ordered to march in the opposite direction, towards a field beside the river Plavnica where an open-air market was held each week. The prisoners left Gudovac just before sunset, supervised by as many as 70 armed guards. Many of the prisoners sensed the fate that awaited them but were unable to escape. According to one post-war testimony, Čikoš was [...] "upset, uneasy... and in no mood to talk". As the prisoners were being marched out of Gudovac, he pulled one of his Serb neighbours from the group and told him to [...] "get lost" [...] before ordering the remaining 200 detainees to line up against a wall. Kvaternik appeared before the group and asked if it contained any Croats. Four <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> offered their identification papers; three were permitted {{to return to their homes}} upon having their identities verified but the fourth was sent back among the Serbs because he was a communist. Kvaternik, Čikoš and several newly appointed Ustaše officers supervised the march.

500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} for the Society for Psychical Research, Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo {{described}} a letter by Dr. Barthez, a physician {{in the court of}} Empress Eugenie, which claimed a sitter Morio de l'lle caught Home using his foot to fake supposed spirit effects during a séance in Biarritz in 1857. Home wore thin shoes, easy to take off and draw on, and also cut socks that left the toes free. [...] "At the appropriate moment he takes off one of his shoes and with his foot pulls a dress here, a dress there, rings a bell, knocks one way and another, and, the thing done, quickly puts his shoe on again." [...] Home positioned himself between the empress and Napoleon III. One of the séance sitters known as General Fleury also suspected that Home was utilizing trickery and asked to leave but returned unobserved to watch from another door behind Home. He saw Home slip his foot from his shoe and touch the arm of the Empress, who believed it to be one of her dead children. The observer <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> revealed the fraud, and Home was conducted out of the country: [...] "The order was to keep the incident secret." [...] The allegations described by Dr. Barthez and General Fleury are second hand and have caused dispute between psychical researchers and skeptics.|$|E
