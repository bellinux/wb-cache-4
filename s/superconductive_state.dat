5000|$|In an {{electromagnetic}} dual theory {{the roles}} of electric and magnetic fields are interchanged. The BCS theory of superconductivity explains superconductivity {{as the result of}} the condensation of electric charges to Cooper pairs. In a dual superconductor an analogous effect occurs through the condensation of magnetic charges (also called magnetic monopoles). In ordinary electromagnetic theory, no monopoles have been shown to exist. However, in quantum chromodynamics — the theory of colour charge which explains the strong interaction between quarks — the colour charges can be viewed as (non-abelian) analogues of electric charges and corresponding magnetic monopoles are known to exist.

We find that the parent compund is a multi-orbital Mott insulator. Surprisingly, and somewhat reminiscent of the doped high-T_{c} cuprates, carrier localization is found to persist upon weak hole doping because the chemical potential lies in a gap structure wit almost vanishing density-of-states (DOS). On the other hand, in remarkable contrast, electron doping drives an orbital-selective metallic phase (OSMP) with co-existing pseudogapped (Mott localized) and itinerant carriers. These remarkably contrasting behaviors in a single system thus stem from drastic electronic reconstruction caused by large-scale transfe of dynamical spectral weightinvolving states with distinct orbital character at low energies, putting the Fe oxychalcogenidesneatly into the increasingly visible tendency of Fe-baed systems as ones in orbital-selective Mott phases.
