In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume his pursuit {{of information on the}} fate of Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as a writer for the Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. <b>Satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E

A young cavalry colonel, charged in defiance of orders. A fresh engagement opened, and at the last moment, Waller snatched a victory out of defeat. Worse than this was the news from Yorkshire and Scotland. Charles had at last assented to Montrose's plan and promised him a marquessate. The first attempt to raise the Royalist standard in Scotland, however, gave no omen of its later triumphs.|$|E

25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature.

Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes {{are tied to the}} society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E

A {{number of studies have}} described the psychological, attitudinal, and behavioral effects of mergers on survivors which revealed {{that it was important to}} take care of the remaining employee’s emotions and feelings and most importantly to ensure that they <b>satisfy</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the firms done for them. This study investigates the relationship between survivor syndromes and job satisfaction and employees’ performance during mergers. The aim for present study is firstly, to examine the level of survivors syndromes which consist of six important emotions; fear job loss and insecurity, reduced risk taking and motivation, thirst for information loss of trust and confidence on employer, unfairness and depression, anxiety and fatigue; secondly, to examine the level of job satisfaction and employee performance during mergers; thirdly, to identify the relationship between survivor syndromes and job satisfaction and employee performance in the context of merger. Using quantitative design research, data was collected through survey questionnaires from a sample of 132 employees/bankers from RHB Asset Management Johor Bahru branch. The analysis we carried out using descriptive and inferential statistic. The findings of the study indicate that, three of the variables; survivor syndromes, job satisfaction and employees’ performance were moderate level during mergers in RHBAM. However, the correlation results between these three variables were no significantly correlated each other’s. Due to the post-merger period over time, the result suggested no influence between survivors’ emotions and job satisfaction and employee performance in RHBAM, which mean survivors’ job satisfaction and performance no longer impact or recover from the merger event. This has contributed new finding in future towards the body of literature especially in terms of determining the level of survivor syndromes towards job satisfaction and employees performance between pre-merger and post-merger perio...|$|R
