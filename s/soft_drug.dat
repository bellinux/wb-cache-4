25|$|The {{drug policy}} of the Netherlands is marked by its {{distinguishing}} between so called soft and hard drugs. An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug, is legal and a <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, {{and as a result}} the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.|$|E

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} a new {{approach}} to the development of drugs, namely on prodrugs and <b>soft</b> <b>drugs.</b> Nowadays, we try to design drugs that heal sick people having the best acceptance of patients. They must be efficient and selective on their site of action and must be metabolized to non-toxic derivatives. Both, prodrugs and <b>soft</b> <b>drugs</b> should have good distributive properties to enhance their quality. They are designed to maximize the amount of an active drug that reaches its target, through changing the physicochemical, biopharmaceutical or pharmacokinetic properties of drugs. Prodrugs are changed into the active drug within the body through enzymatic or non-enzymatic reactions. <b>Soft</b> <b>drugs</b> are novel and active analogues of already known therapeutic agents. It is expected that continued studies will improve drug properties so as to achieve the best drug delivery system.

25|$|One {{controversial}} issue which has dominated Maastricht politics {{for many years}} and which has also affected national and international politics, is the city's approach to soft drugs. Under the pragmatic Dutch <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> policy, a policy of non-enforcement, individuals may buy and use cannabis from 'coffeeshops' (cannabis bars) under certain conditions. Maastricht, like many other border towns, has seen a growing influx of 'drug tourists', mainly young people from Belgium, France and Germany, who provide a large amount of revenue for the coffeeshops (around 13) in the city centre. The city government, most notably ex-mayor Leers, have been actively promoting drug policy reform {{in order to deal with}} its negative side effects.|$|E
25|$|Notably {{absent from}} toleration of drugs is its production, {{particularly}} {{the cultivation of}} weed. This {{has led to a}} seemingly paradoxical system where coffee shops are allowed to buy and sell soft drugs but where production is nearly always punished. Because coffee shops have to get their goods from somewhere, criticism has been raised over the years against continued prosecution of <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> producers. It was first challenged in court in 2014 when a judge found two people guilty of producing weed in large quantities but refused to punish them. A breakthrough occurred in early 2017, when a slight majority in the House of Representatives allowed for a law to pass that would partly legalize production of weed. In late 2017, the newly formed coalition announced that they would seek to implement an experimental new system in certain cities where coffee shops could legally acquire weed from a state-appointed producer.|$|E
25|$|By 2009, 27 coffeeshops selling {{cannabis}} in Rotterdam, {{all within}} 200 metres from schools, must close down. This is {{nearly half of}} the coffeeshops that currently operate within its municipality. This is due to the new policy of city mayor Ivo Opstelten and the town council. The higher levels of the active ingredient in cannabis in Netherlands create a growing opposition to the traditional Dutch view of cannabis as a relatively innocent <b>soft</b> <b>drug.</b> Supporters of coffeeshops state that such claims are often exaggerated and ignore the fact that higher content means a user needs to use less of the plant to get the desired effects, making it in effect safer. Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content. Closing of coffeeshops is not unique for Rotterdam. Many other towns have done the same in the last 10 years.|$|E

25|$|Legal distinctions {{are made}} in the Opium Law between drugs with a low risk of harm and/or addiction, called soft drugs, and drugs with a high risk of harm and/or addiction, called hard drugs. Soft drugs include hash, marijuana, {{sleeping}} pills and sedatives, while hard drugs include heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD and ecstasy. Policy has been to largely tolerate the sale of soft drugs while strongly suppressing the sale, circulation and use of hard drugs, effectively separating it into two markets. Establishments that have been permitted to sell soft drugs under certain circumstances are called coffee shops. Laws established in January 2013 required visitors of coffee shops to be Dutch residents, but these laws were only applied in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg after much local criticism. Possession of a <b>soft</b> <b>drug</b> for personal use in quantities below a certain threshold (5 grams of cannabis or 5 cannabis plants) is tolerated, but larger quantities or posession of hard drugs may lead to prosecution. Prosecution for possession, trade and (in some rare cases) use are typically handled by the muncipal government except where large-scale criminal activity is suspected.|$|E
