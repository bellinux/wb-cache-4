40|$|Abstract—An {{asynchronous}} pipeline {{style is}} introduced for highspeed applications, called MOUSETRAP. The pipeline uses standard transparent latches and static logic in its datapath, and <b>small</b> <b>latch</b> controllers consisting {{of only a}} single gate per pipeline stage. This simple structure is combined with an efficient and highly-concurrent event-driven protocol between adjacent stages. Post-layout SPICE simulations of a ten-stage pipeline with a 4 -bit wide datapath indicate throughputs of 2. 1 – 2. 4 GHz in a 0. 18 - m TSMC CMOS process. Similar results were obtained when the datapath width was extended to 16 bits. This performance is competitive even with that of wave pipelines [40], [19], without the accompanying problems of complex timing and much design effort. Additionally, the new pipeline gracefully and robustly adapts to variable speed environments. The pipeline stages are extended to fork and join structures, to handle more complex system architectures. Index Terms—Asynchronous, clocked CMOS, gate-level pipelines, latch controllers, micropipelines, pipeline processing, transition signaling, wave pipelining. I...|$|E

The {{head of the}} hook is lightly-colored and curved with a <b>small</b> <b>latch</b> on the side. The remaining body of the hook is darkly-colored, and it is composed of a small cylindrical arm with the letters "NSCO" etched upon it and a large body with the word "IDEAL" at its top. Various bolts and other attachments {{can be seen on}} the device. To the right of the hook block, a man wearing a shirt, tie, and slacks can be seen staring up at the device. Two cables extend above the hook block, and they are connected to another crane arm. To the left of the crane arm, the operator of the crane can be seen seated within a small cubicle. A small light and ladder are seen adjacent to his panel. To the right of the crane, a long building lined with rectangular windows can be seen. In the extreme background, several automobiles can be seen near various pieces of equipment. To the left, a large crane arm can be seen near a truck.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} scaling down the size and scaling up the number of modules of self-reconfigurable systems {{by focusing on the}} actuation mechanism. Rather than developing smaller actuators, the main actuator is removed entirely. Energy instead comes from the environment to provide motion in prescribed synchronous ways. Prescribed synchronous motions allow much faster assembly times than random Brownian motion which has been used before. An instantiation of this idea is presented using a motion platform to induce motions based on the inertial properties of the modules and the timed actuation of <b>small</b> <b>latching</b> mechanisms.

40|$|The {{continuous}} miniaturization of {{semiconductor devices}} imposes serious threats to design robustness against process variations and environmental fluctuations. Modern circuit designs may suffer from uncertain delays, not predictable {{in the design}} phase or even after manufacturing. This paper presents an optimization technique to make sequential circuits robust against delay variations and thus maximize timing yield. By trading larger flip-flops for <b>smaller</b> <b>latches,</b> the proposed approach {{can be used as}} a post-synthesis or post-layout optimization tool, allowing accurate timing information to be available. Experimental results show an average of 26 % timing yield improvement, and suggest that our method is promising for high speed designs tolerating clock variations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{technology}} mapping algorithm that takes existing structural tech-nology-mapping algorithms based on dynam-ic programming [1, 3, 4] and extends them to retime pipelined circuits. If the circuit to be mapped has a tree structure, our algorithm generates an optimal solution compatible with that structure. The algorithm {{takes into account}} gate delays and capacitive loads as latches are moved across the logic. It also supports latches with embedded logic: i. e., cells that combine a D latch with a combin-ational gate at little extra cost in latch delay. simple transparent latch and a gate (denoted f(x 1,x 2, [...] .,xn)) for only little more delay and area than the latch itself. These cell libraries are often incomplete; e. g., a typical cell lib-rary based on tristate latches may embed only D, AND 2, AND 3, and OR 2 gates in latches, disallowing larger gates and inverting gates. For such asymmetric libraries, a simple change of latch polarity (i. e., retiming across an inverter) may enable or disable the embed-ding of a gate within the latch. Such effects are not modeled by previous work. Furthermore, the application of existing re-timing algorithms [5, 6, 7] after technology mapping is suboptimal. The <b>smallest</b> possible <b>latch</b> movement is a movement across a single mapped gate. But this ignores the pos-sibility of breaking a large gate into smaller pieces and placing the latch between them to meet a delay constraint. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|R
40|$|Comunicación presentada al " 27 th Conference on Design of Circuits and Integrated Systems (DCIS 2012) " celebrada del 28 al 30 de Noviembre del 2012 en Avignon (Francia), organizada por el LIRMM {{laboratory}} of Montpellier: [URL] this paper, a 200 MHz 6 -bit Flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is presented. The principal {{objective is to}} obtain a digital-friendly converter. Hence, <b>small</b> and simple <b>latched</b> comparators are used and redundancy allows reducing the offset down to an acceptable level. This obviously requires calibration but reduces power consumption, since small size transistors can be used and the unused comparators are powered down. The proposed ADC is designed in UMC 0 : 18 m CMOS technology. Full electrical simulations show that the ADC reaches an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 5. 3 associated to a signal-to-noise-anddistortion ratio (SNDR) is 33 dB. The converter consumes only 1. 56 mW and has figure-of-merit (FoM) of 0. 2 pJ / conversion step.
