6000|$|Mrs. Lavington is Mrs. Lavington no longer. She has married, to the astonishment of {{the world}} in general, that 'excellent man,' Mr. O'Blareaway, who has been {{discovered}} not to be quite as young as he appeared, his graces being principally owing to a Brutus wig, which he has now wisely discarded. Mrs. Lavington now sits in state under her husband's ministry, {{as the leader of the}} religious world in the fashionable watering-place of Steamingbath, and derives her notions of the past, present, and future state of the universe principally from those two meek and unbiased periodicals, the Protestant Hue- and-Cry and the Christian Satirist, to both of which O'Blareaway is a constant contributor. She has taken such an aversion to Whitford since Argemone's death, that she has ceased to have any connection with that unhealthy locality, beyond the popular and easy one of rent-receiving. O'Blareaway has never entered the parish to his knowledge since Mr. Lavington's funeral; and was much pleased, the last time I rode with him, at my informing him that a certain picturesque moorland which he had been greatly admiring, was his own possession. [...] . After all, he is 'an excellent man;' and when I met a large party at his house the other day, and beheld dory and <b>surmullet,</b> champagne and lachryma Christi, amid all the glory of the Whitford plate [...] . (some of it said to have belonged to the altar of the Priory Church four hundred years ago), I was deeply moved by the impressive tone in which, at the end of a long grace, he prayed 'that the daily bread of our less favoured brethren might be mercifully vouchsafed to them.' [...] . My dear readers, would you have me, even if I could, extricate him from such an Elysium by any denouement whatsoever? ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{family name}} and the English common name [...] "mullet" [...] name are derived from Latin mullus, the red mullet; but other than the red mullet and the striped red mullet or <b>surmullet,</b> the English word mullet {{generally}} refers to a different family of fish, the Mugilidae or grey mullets.|$|E
50|$|The striped {{red mullet}} or <b>surmullet</b> (Mullus surmuletus) is a species of {{goatfish}} found in the Mediterranean Sea, eastern North Atlantic Ocean, and the Black Sea. They {{can be found in}} water as shallow as 5 m or as deep as 409 m depending upon the portion of their range that they are in. This species can reach a length of 40 cm SL though most are only around 25 cm. The greatest recorded weight for this species is 1 kg. This is a commercially important species and is also sought after as a game fish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{red mullets}} or <b>surmullets</b> are {{two species of}} goatfish, Mullus {{barbatus}} and Mullus surmuletus, found in the Mediterranean Sea, east North Atlantic Ocean, and the Black Sea. Both [...] "red mullet" [...] and [...] "surmullet" [...] can also refer to the Mullidae in general.|$|R
40|$|Marine litter greatly affects {{marine species}} and {{ecosystems}} (1), however {{there is little}} evidence of physiological responses of vertebrates to plastic exposure. In this study, wild mullets Mullus surmuletus were obtained from fishing vessels operating in Mallorca Island (W Mediterranean). Stomach content analyses and identification under microscope determined that 28 % of the samples had ingested microplastics. Liver samples of <b>surmullets</b> with and without microplastic ingestion were analysed to determine physiological effects. Results suggest an induction of the detoxification system in M. surmuletus Linnaeus, 1758 but no oxidative stress or cellular damage...|$|R
40|$|The Tunisian ichthyofauna {{comprises}} at present, four mullid species: two are autochthonous, both {{regularly and}} abundantly captured in Tunisian marine waters, the red mullet, Mullus barbatus and the <b>surmullet</b> (striped red mullet), Mullus surmuletus {{while the two}} other was alien species: Por's goatfish, Upeneus pori and a West African goatfish, Pseudupeneus prayensis...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three experimental chapters and it {{is focused on the}} evaluation of qualitative characteristics and somatic indices of some major commercial fish and on the monitoring of purse seine fishing activity in the North West Sardinian Sea. In the first chapter the population consistency of the target specie (S. pilchardus) has been evaluated during the year 2010 purse seine fishing season in the NW Sardinian Sea. The results have been compared with those published in 2005 (year 2003 fishing season) and 2008 (year 2007 fishing season) and the variations of some characteristic chemical-nutritional factors of fish sampled in the Sardinian Sea have been evaluated during the fishing season. In the second chapter a comparison (chemical and morphometric) have been made between two different species of Mediterranean mullet of high commercial interest, the <b>surmullet</b> (Mullus surmuletus) and the red mullet (Mullus barbatus) with the West African goatfish (Pseudupeneus prayensis). The third chapter is centered on the determination of Selenium content and toxicity in several species of mugilides. At the beginning the Selenium level in wild mugilidae species, caught in costal lagoon of Sardinia, has been determined. Subsequently, one trial has been carried out to test the Selenium tendency to accumulate in flesh and organs and its influence on growing performances of small mugilidae (Liza aurata) reared in tank and fed with scalar amount of Selenium in the diet...|$|E
40|$|The {{demersal}} trawl fishery of {{the north}} Tunisian coast primarily targets the deep-water rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, and secondarily a variety of demersal fish species. These fishes include hake (Merluccius merluccius), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), <b>surmullet</b> (Mullus surmuletus), Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), bogue (Boops boops), picarel (Spicara smaris) and spotted flounder (Citharus linguatula). A bioeconomic model {{was used to test}} management measures through scenarios that ran over eleven years to estimate the viability of the fishery according to biological and economic results. The most beneficial scenario was the combination of several management measures including a temporal closure of two months, the replacement of the 40 mm diamond mesh codend with 40 mm square mesh, the removal of both the biological recovery tax and of fuel subsidies, and an 83 % reduction in fishing capacity. This results in an annual private profit higher by 9. 3 M TND (Tunisian Dinar) (6. 9 M USD) that of 2008, and an economic rent that was higher by 13. 3 M TND (9. 9 M USD) than {{by the end of the}} projected period. Shrimp and fish biomasses have doubled compared with 2008, and trawling damages would be reduced to the equivalent of a five- fold reduction in fishing effort. This study shows that the objectives of improving demersal ecosystems and improving individual and collective wealth can be achieved through the synergistic effects of various regulatory measures...|$|E
