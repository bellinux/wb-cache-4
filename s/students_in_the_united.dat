5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, {{the result}} of an 18-month-long study of {{secondary}} students was published as A Nation at Risk, and claimed that <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States were no longer receiving superior education, and in fact, could not compete with students from other developed countries in many academic exercises. One of the recommendations the book made was to increase services to gifted education programs, citing curriculum enrichment or acceleration specifically.

25|$|One {{unforeseen}} {{result of}} the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union was the immediate emphasis on education for bright <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and this settled the question whether {{the federal government should}} get involved in public education at all. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed by Congress in 1958 with $1 billion US to bolster science, math, and technology in public education. Educators immediately pushed to identify gifted students and serve them in schools. Students chosen for gifted services were given intelligence tests with a strict cutoff, usually at 130, which meant that students who scored below the 130 were not identified.|$|E

25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior high school <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The girls {{were less likely to}} state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
