50|$|The jockey shifter is a gear <b>shifting</b> <b>device</b> used on {{motorcycles}} {{before the}} use of a foot-operated shift lever. A jockey shifter gets its name from the location of the motorcycle rider's hand when shifting gears. It is under his seat like the position of a jockey's hand while using his riding crop on his horse. This hand shifter lever is directly mounted to the transmission and is just long enough to clear the primary drive cover or belt drive. A motorcycle equipped with this type of shifter requires {{the use of}} a foot clutch. The foot clutch comes in one of two configurations; either a rocker foot clutch, which was stock on many early motorcycles, or a suicide foot clutch, which was never available on production motorcycles but was manufactured by daring motorcycle enthusiasts. The suicide foot clutch was usually a very simple lever, more or less a mirror image of the rear brake lever {{on the other side of}} the motorcycle; like a standard shift car's clutch lever. The rocker foot clutch is easier to use than the suicide foot clutch because it can be rocked into a position where the clutch is either engaged or disengaged - leaving the rider's foot free to be put down, at a stop, to steady the motorcycle. Sometimes a tank shifter is referred to as a jockey shifter, but this is incorrect due to the rider's hand position being in front of him, not behind him like for a horse jockey. A tank shifter is also connected to the transmission with linkage, which jockey shifters do not use. The earliest known use of a foot clutch and hand shifter, on motorcycles, was with the first multi-geared transmission on the 1915 Harley Davidson. It is a mechanical linkage that is typically mounted to the left side of the motorbike's fuel tank and is held in place by a slotted piece of metal welded to the frame or the tank. Through a series of linkages, it is connected to the transmission shift selection lever. In terms comparable to a motorcycle of current construction, it is simply a way to relocate the shift lever from the front foot controls to the side of the gas tank. Early motorcycle customizers who were trying to reduce their motorcycle's weight so as to increase its power-to-weight ratio would sometimes replace their stock rocker foot clutch with a hand fabricated suicide foot clutch, and remove the tank shifter's linkage and instead attach a shifter arm directly to the transmission (jockey shifter). This reduced weight not only made the bike accelerate better, but also gave the rider bragging rights of riding a motorcycle which required more skill to operate.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to further {{investigate}} the possibility to complement the rotary converters with a phase <b>shifting</b> <b>device</b> as {{a continuation of the}} work done in the master thesis; Load flow control and optimization of Banverkets 132 kV 16 2 / 3 Hz high voltage grid. With this modification, rotating converters can be used almost as flexible as static converters. The earlier thesis has {{come to the conclusion that}} the best way of compensating the phase displacement is with a series inductance. In this thesis the possibility to use capacitors instead of or in combination with inductors was investigated. To investigate this three different models were built: One for the railway between H�ggvik (Stockholm) and Boden; the same model that was used in the earlier thesis; it was used to confirm the results, one for the railway between Boden and Haparanda and one model that was the same as for the Haparanda track but half the distance. The models were built in the simulation program SIMPOW. The results from the simulations performed for the railway between Boden and H�ggvik confirmed the results from the earlier thesis, with a series inductance as phase shifter. For the railway between Boden and Haparanda one phase <b>shifting</b> <b>device</b> consisting of reactors and one consisting of a combination of reactors and capacitors were dimensioned. The railway with half the length compared to the Haparanda track was used to see if the length of the track in a low impedance transmission system has a large influence of the size of the reactances needed. From the simulation the conclusion can be drawn that the track length does not have a large influence when suitable reactances are chosen. It is the size of the load and the phase angle that matter when choosing reactances. For the Haparanda track it is possible to save power. With a phase shifter that consists of reactors that is placed in the converter station in Kalix, power savings of 340 MWh/year were achieved. With a combination of reactors and capacitors with the capacitors in the converter station in Boden and reactors in the converter station in Kalix power savings of 750 MWh/year were achieved...|$|E

40|$|On {{devices for}} polarization-sensitive spectroscopy, in {{particular}} a strongly scattering sample, {{the fact that}} the scattered light is uncorrelated in its face and polarization direction with relation to the input light is exploited. In a device, a mixed beam (17, 26) whose frequency is shifted by a frequency <b>shifting</b> <b>device</b> (12) and which is depolarized by a depolarization device (14) is superimposed on a sample beam (9, 24) and a reference beam (6).

In another device, the sample is applied to a waveguide in the form a sample layer. In an area of the sample layer adjacent to the waveguide, a modal conversion of the input light takes place, whereby the generated mode is re-injected into the waveguide, whereas scattered light propagates in all spatial directions, and thus does not produce any negative influence on the intensity of the output light of the waveguide. The two devices can be combined together to achieve particularly high scattered light suppression...|$|E

Sign languages, like spoken languages, mark referential shift grammatically with a shift in deictic perspective. In addition, sign languages can mark the shift with a point or a movement {{of the body to}} a specified spatial location in the three-dimensional space in front of the signer, capitalizing on the spatial affordances of the manual modality. We asked whether the use of space to mark referential shift emerges early in a new sign language by comparing the first two age cohorts of deaf signers of NSL. Eight first-cohort signers and ten second-cohort signers watched video vignettes and described them in NSL. Narratives were coded for lexical (use of words) and spatial (use of signing space) devices. Although the cohorts did not differ significantly in the number of perspectives represented, second-cohort signers used referential <b>shift</b> <b>devices</b> to explicitly mark a shift in perspective in more of their narratives. Furthermore, while {{there was no significant difference}} between cohorts in the use of non-spatial, lexical devices, there was a difference in spatial devices, with second-cohort signers using them in significantly more of their narratives. This suggests that spatial devices have only recently increased as systematic markers of referential shift. Spatial referential <b>shift</b> <b>devices</b> may have emerged more slowly because they depend on the establishment of fundamental spatial conventions in the language. While the modality of sign languages can ultimately engender the syntactic use of three-dimensional space, we propose that a language must first develop systematic spatial distinctions before harnessing space for grammatical functions...|$|R

40|$|Single stage cryocoolers {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to reach temperatures as low as ~ 20 K without a load. To reach even lower temperatures or to have cooling at more than one temperature, multistage cryocoolers (MSCs) are often used. There are various types of MSCs, e. g., multistage Stirling, pulse tubes, Gifford-McMahon and reverse Brayton cryocoolers, etc. One of the disadvantages of multistage cryocoolers is known as load-shifting. For example, a two-stage cryocooler {{that is designed to}} operate between two temperatures has very little capability to shift the cooling load from one stage to another if the operating condition is {{different from that of the}} design point.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a method for}} {{digitally}} recording four quarter-reference-wave-holograms (by CCD) in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer setup, and reconstructing the object wave-front by numerical method is presented. The terms of direct transmission, auto-correlation and conjugate wave in the four wave reconstruction are cancelled out and only one original object wave is left after overlapping. Reconstructed digital holograms are obtained by computing the Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral. Since the phase distribution of the wave field can be computed from the digital hologram, one can measure micrometric displacements and deformations of the reflecting object as well as small changes in refractive index field of the transmission object. In order to calibrate a specially designed device necessary for phase shifting purpose, we introduce a second Mach-Zehnder interferometer inside the main imaging interferometer.

The propagation of stress within a granular material has been studied for many years, but only recently have models and theories focused on the micromechanical (single grain) level. Experiments at this level are still rather limited in number. For this reason, a system using optical techniques has been developed. The substrate on which the granular bed is assembled is a double layer elastic substrate with high modulus epoxy constituting the top layer and silicone rubber as the bottom layer. In between the two layers, gold is coated which acts as a reflective film. To design the substrate, a Finite Element Analysis package called LUSAS was used. By performing a non-linear contact analysis, {{the design of the}} substrate was optimised so as to give a linear response, high stiffness, deflection in the measurable range, and negligible cross-talk between neighbouring grains. Fabrication and inspection techniques were developed to enable samples to be manufactured to this design. The deformation of the gold interface layer is measured using interferometry. The interferometer utilised a frequency tunable laser which acts both as the light source and the phase <b>shifting</b> <b>device.</b> The optical arrangement is based on the Fizeau set-up. This has removed several problems such as multiple reflections and sensitivity to vibration that occurred when using a Mach-Zehnder configuration. A fifteen-frame phase shifting algorithm, was developed based on a Hanning window, which allows the phase difference map to be obtained. This is then unwrapped in order to obtain the indentation profile. The deflection profile is then converted to a single indentation depth value by fitting a Lorentzian curve to the measured data. Calibration of the substrate is carried out by loading at 9 different locations simultaneously. Spatial and temporal variations of the calibration constants are found to be of order 10 - 15...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a simple beam steered phased array antenna was undertaken to demonstrate the operational principles behind such devices. The antenna {{can be used as}} a receiver or transmitter, however power requirements dictated that the antenna be tested as a receiver. The design is modular to allow for redevelopment without complete reconstruction. The array is made up of the control module, voltage controlled attenuators and a phase shifting unit. The antenna consists of 16 quarter wave monopoles arranged in a 4 X 4 square array on an aluminium ground plane. Practical considerations lead to a carrier frequency of 200 MHz. The heart of a phased array antenna is the phase <b>shifting</b> <b>device.</b> This device controls the direction in which the main radiation lobe propagates. Several phase shifting principles were investigated but time did not allow for an exhaustive investigation of every kind of phase shifter. Initially, a relatively new and novel approach was attempted. When this proved to be unachievable a more traditional (but far less elegant) method was used. During the phase shifting process, the signal necessarily suffers attenuation as well as the designed phase shift, consequently it is necessary to tailor the signal amplitudes of each array element. The required amplitude control is achieved through the use of 16 voltage controlled attenuators. A computer package is used to control the phase shifter and attenuators. The design of this package depends on only three factors. The first is the interface between the hardware and the computer (via a serial port in this case). The second factor is the type of control signal the phase shifter and attenuators respond to (in this case a dc voltage). The third factor is the range of voltage required for the phase shifter and attenuators so that their full range can be utilised. This is realised through the use of a microprocessor, a "sample and hold" circuit and several D/A converters. The antenna and computer control package are essentially independent of each other. If an 8 bit digital phase shifter were to be employed later, the hardware could be used to control this with minimal alteration. In this case the advantage of a modular design is apparent. Various parts of the device can be incrementally improved without alteration to the remaining system. Radical change can be accommodated with minimal adjustments...|$|E

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are lubricated {{machine components}} which utilize friction to transfer torque and thus establish connection between shafts rotating at different speeds. They {{are used in}} automatic transmission as <b>shifting</b> <b>device</b> or lockup clutch. As well as cooling the contacting surfaces, the lubrication provides controlled friction, smooth performance and long life. Because of this advantage, wet clutches are applicable for heavy duty vehicles (e. g. construction equipment, tractors) to handle high power. However, like any other tribological system, wet clutch performance is dependent on several factors concerning operating conditions, system design etc. As a friction generating machine component, the degradation of the lubricant and the contacting clutch surfaces are continuous process and the friction behavior also changes consequently with the progression of the system deterioration and that directly influences the clutch performance. So, to investigate the clutch influencing factors and fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism is of great interest. Though wet clutches were immensely studied earlier to investigate different issues, there was lack of clear understanding and knowledge concerning water contamination problem and the system design parameters. The main aim of this thesis is to experimentally evaluate and explain the impact of water contamination and to verify different system design parameters’ influence on wet clutch tribological performance. The study focused on the wet clutches in automatic transmissions. Initially the thesis reviews {{the state of the}} art in wet clutch research, discusses the motivation for the current research aim and clarifies the goals of the investigation. Later the details of the experimental method and findings are discussed in this thesis. Since evaluating the friction behaviour in desired environment is the key requirement, an automated wet clutch test rig was utilized to carry out the friction test where operating conditions (slip time, oil temperature, contact pressure/load, sliding speed) can be controlled and the output torque, contact temperature etc. can monitored. This suitable test equipment was designed for standard paper based friction plate and steel separator plate lubricated with automatic transmission fluid. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. In the first part of the thesis the effect of water contamination on wet clutch tribological performances is experimentally investigated. The study reveals that both the friction reliability and the friction-velocity relation are influenced by the change in the friction behaviour for a water contaminated lubricant. It is shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water is influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. Then the study is continued for longer test to evaluate the ageing of the friction interfaces and the lubricant. Though water does not show any long term effect on water contaminated ATF as it is seen in case of friction interfaces, the short term effect in the surface active additives is observed in the current research. This finding also supported the investigation on the water contaminated friction interface degradation and the effect of water on additive adsorption of the contacting surfaces. It was found that the addition of water in ATF intensifies the mean friction coefficient, but in the long run the loss of friction much faster and high, which can in fact degrade the clutch life faster as well. Two simplified ATF was also analysed along with the commercial fully formulated ATF for investigating the water impact to get a simple and comprehensive overview of the consequence. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the change in the clutch frictional behaviour with time and degradation can largely influence by the choice of these design factors. This can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

Firstly, the parsing expressions of electromagnetic field in the incident medium, the coating medium, and the substrate medium are derived from the Maxwell equations; Subsequently, by operating Fourier expanding to the dielectric constant and electromagnetic field of the grating region, and applying the boundary conditions of electromagnetic fields for different boundaries, a series of infinite dimension couple-wave differential equations are obtained; Finally, eigenvalue methods are used to solve the equations, and numerical solutions to the diffraction efficiency of each diffractive wave, η [...]...|$|R
