There were, on average, 13.5 <b>cutting</b> <b>stumps</b> per hectare in the study area. 46 % of the grid cells (and studied area) had no <b>cutting</b> <b>stumps</b> and 91 % had ≤ 1 stump. The spatial distribution of stumps was very uneven and concentrated in two parts of the study area (data not shown).|$|R
5000|$|The 27th Service Group {{would have}} the mission of {{training}} new Service Groups prior to their deployment to the overseas combat Air Forces. The advance element of the 27th, the 37th Service Squadron arrived at the station in July 1942 to perform guard duty and to prepare the base for an official opening. The Air Force opened the station, initially named the Service Group Training Center officially on 7 July, and it was placed {{under the jurisdiction of}} Air Service Command. Over the next several weeks, additional personnel were assigned (the Hq. & Hq. Sq. and the 826th QM Company. Later, the 1063rd Signal Co., the 90th Service Sq., and the 1728th, 1729th, 2064th and 2065th QM Companies) Although open, the station was far from ready to perform its mission. Early life at the Service Group Training Center is officially described as [...] "rugged". Necessity demanded that the skilled specialists of the 27th be put to work pulling <b>stumps,</b> <b>cutting</b> weeds and doing general clean-up jobs. No furloughs were given, and the men lived in tents.|$|R
50|$|True hickories sprout prolifically from <b>stumps</b> after <b>cutting</b> and fire. As the stumps {{increase}} in size, {{the number of}} stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting. Coppice management is a possibility with true hickories. True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood. Reed indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (Carya aquatica).|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 43 {{patients}} with symptomatic ACL tear {{were enrolled in}} the study, of whom 38 met our inclusion criteria. Three patients had scarred stumps from which adequate sampling could not be done, one patient was diagnosed as a case of ankylosing spondylitis, and one patient had posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tear on diagnostic arthroscopy. Intraoperatively, residual ACL tissue was harvested by <b>cutting</b> <b>stumps</b> from as near to the attachment site as possible using arthroscopic scissors. When ACL was adhered to PCL, it was carefully dissected off the PCL then resected.|$|R

40|$|O rejuvenescimento de árvores que alcançaram a maturidade de acácia-negra (Acacia mearnsii De Wild.) torna-se necessário devido à dificuldade do enraizamento de ramos adultos. Desse modo, o objetivo do presente trabalho foi estudar a influência da altura de cepa no desenvolvimento de brotações e o melhor período para o corte das árvores. Os ensaios foram instalados em um plantio {{comercial}} de acácia-negra aos cinco anos de idade, desenvolvendo-se em espaçamentos de 1, 0 x 1, 30 m. Utilizou-se o delineamento em blocos ao acaso com seis repetições e seis plantas por parcela. Os tratamentos foram constituídos de diferentes alturas de cepa com corte à altura de: (a) 15 cm, (b) 30 cm, (c) 45 cm e (d) 60 cm. Os ensaios foram instalados no outono (março) e na primavera (setembro). Foram feitas avaliações aos 45, 90 e 150 dias, através da contagem de cepas com brotações e número de brotações por cepa. O corte das árvores na altura de 60 cm promoveu elevado índice de rebrota, com aproximadamente 90 % das cepas apresentando brotações novas. Na primavera, obteve-se melhor rebrota de árvores adultas de acácia-negra, em comparação com o ensaio do outono. Esses resultados indicaram a influência da altura de cepa e do período do ano na capacidade de rebrota de indivíduos adultos de Acacia mearnsii. Rejuvenation {{of mature}} black wattle (Acacia mearnsii De Wild.) trees is necessary {{as it is}} difficult to root from mature branches. Thus the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of stump height on promoting regrowth and the best period for cutting black wattle trees. The assays were installed in a 5 year-old, 1, 0 x 1, 3 m spacing black wattle plantation. A randomized block design with 6 replications and 6 plants per plot was used. Treatments constituted of various <b>stump</b> heights with <b>cuttings</b> at (a) 15 cm, (b) 30 cm, (c) 45 cm, and (d) 60 cm. The assays were installed in the autumn (March) and spring (September). The assessments were carried out in 45, 90 and 150 days, by counting stumps with sprouts and number of sprouts per <b>stump.</b> Tree <b>cutting</b> at 60 cm promoted a high regrowth rate, with approximately 90 % of the stumps presenting new sprouts. Regrowth of mature black wattle obtained in the spring was better than in the autumn. These results indicated the influence of stump height and the time of the year on the regrowth ability of mature Acacia mearnsii individuals...|$|R
40|$|Cotoneaster horizontalis DECAISNE, a Rosaceae {{coming from}} Asia, was {{introduced}} in Belgium as an ornamental species. Different sides of the invasion were studied, from {{the distribution of the}} species and the invasion status, the impacts, to management methods. To describe the invasion status, information was gathered about the occurrence and the distribution of the species in Belgium by compiling various databases. The naturalization status in calcareous grasslands, high-value habitats recognized as biodiversity hotspots, was assessed. Occurrence, population status, preferred habitats, invaded communities, growth rate and fruiting capacity were characterized. Once naturalization established, we investigated its impacts on calcareous grasslands communities, individual species and pollinators. C. horizontalis occurred in seven of the nine studied calcareous grasslands, with densities from 0. 34 to 10 individuals/ha. In the most invaded sites, an ongoing colonization process was suggested by a high proportion of small individuals. Moreover, 3 -year-old individuals already showed fruiting capacities. Germination rate reached about 30 %. Significant impacts on habitat structure and vegetation were showed. Community structure and composition changes were demonstrated in invaded sites by decreasing species richness and diversity. As calcareous grasslands are priority Natura 2000 habitats, measures must be taken to control the spread of C. horizontalis. For this purpose, we performed management tests to identify the most efficient techniques that would help the restoration of calcareous grasslands. Both mechanical and chemical management techniques were tested. Methods choice was driven by the environmental constraints of calcareous grasslands, which require highly selective techniques, and by species characteristics. Tested methods were <b>cuttings,</b> <b>stump</b> burning, spraying, <b>cutting</b> plus glyphosate application on stump and glyphosate application on stem basis. Efficiency, cost, feasibility and side-effects on ecosystems were estimated. Management tests are still ongoing but some results have already been drawn: spraying and single cutting are not efficient, the last one generating production of numerous sprouts. Finding the best management method will not be sufficient to stop the invasion. C. horizontalis is still present in 53 % of the sale catalogs of horticulturists in Southern Belgium. As long as the species is used in the vicinity of calcareous grasslands, propagules are continuously provided, jeoparding management actions...|$|R
30|$|Density and {{canopy cover}} of {{herbaceous}} species were measured inside 0.2 m 2 (0.4 m × 0.5 m) frames in May 2006 and June 2007 to 2011. Herbaceous canopy cover and density were estimated spatially by zone: intercanopy, stump (litter mats beneath formerly standing trees), and debris (beneath cut trees). Stump zones were {{measured in the}} cardinal directions around eight randomly selected tree stumps in each plot. Frames {{were placed on the}} inside edge of the litter area or drip line (1 m to 2.5 m from stump). For the debris zone, frames were arbitrarily placed under eight randomly selected cut juniper trees (four frames per tree). Debris zones were former interspaces covered by felled trees and identical to interspaces in herbaceous cover and density prior to <b>cutting.</b> <b>Stumps</b> and debris zone trees were marked with metal tags for re-measurement. Intercanopy zones were randomly sampled in areas between cut trees and litter mats within each plot (32 frames). Shrub and tree cover were measured by line intercept on three 40 m transects in 2006 and 2011. Transects were spaced 10 m apart and parallel to one another in east-west or north-south directions. Densities of shrubs and small juniper (< 1.5 m height) were measured in 2 m × 40 m belt transects. Juniper (> 1.5 m height) density was estimated in 6 m × 40 m belt transects.|$|R
40|$|Aquilaria spp {{produced}} agarwood as nonwood forest production, and {{has high}} economic value. A. malaccensis {{is susceptible to}} white rot diseases and termites. On the other hand most of the community plantations are a mixed culture with rubber trees, oil palms and with high risk of con-tamination causing white root diseases. Besides that, vegetative propagation by <b>cuttings,</b> <b>stumping</b> or air layering are still very diffi cult with low percentage of growth. h e objectives of this research were to analyze the best suitable micrograft type, changes of SDS-PAGE protein band patterns of compatible and incompatible micrografts with several combinations of gaharu planlets in in vitro condition, and histology of union area between rootstocks and scion. h e results showed that wedge or V type {{was the best of}} the micrografs. MS medium with the addition of 3 mg/L IBA was the best medium for gaharu planlet growth after micrografting. Acclimatization was conducted in husk chacoal and top soil (1 : 1) medium and grown under plastic house of 70 % shading with paranet. Compatible combination (Ac/Am) of micrografting showed that anatomy structure of union area is the same as anatomy structure of non micrograftd planlet. While incompatible (Gv/Am) mi-crografting produced necrotic layer growth from pith and parenchymateous tissues of the wood in union area along the middle of radial shoot. Recovery period of union area between stocks and scion is initiated by callus formation from the pith and parenchymatous tissues of the wood. Callus will diff erentiate into mature cells or tissue and become combined phloem and xylem vessels be-tween rootstocks and scion. SDS-PAGE protein band pattern on compatible combination was the same as plants originated from seedlings. While, incompatible combination produced new protein bands with molecular weight around 21 and 30 kD...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} dead wood in Swedish {{production}} forests is {{low compared to}} natural forests. This {{has resulted in a}} high proportion of red-listed and threatened wood living beetle species. Different actions are taken {{to increase the amount of}} dead wood and one such action is to artificially create high-stumps (snags), i. e. living trees cut between 3 and 5 meters height. This thesis focuses on whether high-stumps on clearcuts in southern Sweden increase beetle diversity. One study focus on whether a high-stump offers a different substrate compared to ordinary low-stumps. Another study investigates if beetle species are affected if the high-stumps are pre-rotten or not. Finally, the beetle species number and composition between high-stumps of spruce and birch in biodiversity hotspots and production forest (matrix), respectively. High-stumps have a somewhat different beetle species composition compared to low-stumps (normal <b>cutting</b> <b>stumps),</b> and several species were primarily associated with high-stumps. This justifies the making of high-stumps even though the amount of dead wood they add to a clearcut is low. The pre-rotten spruce high-stumps (infected by Heterobasidion spp.) had a negative effect on some beetle species and none of the analyzed species showed positive associations with Heterobasidion spp. This suggests that increasing the proportion of rotten spruce high-stumps could have a small but negative effect on beetle diversity. The number of beetle species did not differ between high-stumps on hotspot and matrix clearcuts, suggesting that concentrating high-stumps to hotspot areas will not benefit more beetle species. However, the amount of broadleaved forest in the surroundings of clearcuts was important for explaining species composition on high-stumps. The amount of coniferous forest only explained a small part of the beetle species composition, possibly because coniferous forests are dominating the entire forested landscape in southern Sweden. The high-stumps in these studies were four years old at most. This means that, as the wood decay progress, the properties of high-stumps change and potentially they become even more important...|$|R
30|$|A {{study on}} effects of bush {{encroachment}} control techniques on rangeland productivity and tick population dynamics {{was conducted in}} Arero district of Borana zone, southern Ethiopia, for three consecutive years. The study targeted two main and dominant encroaching bush species in Borana rangeland, Acacia drepanolobium and Acacia mellifera, and their effects on some vegetation attributes and tick population dynamics. A hectare of rangeland encroached by these two acacia species was replicated/divided into three plots, and each plot was subdivided into five sub-plots to receive five treatments: cutting at 0.5 m above ground and pouring kerosene on <b>stumps</b> (T 1), <b>cutting</b> at 0.5 m above ground and debarking the stumps down into the soil surface (T 2), cutting at 0.5 m above ground alone (T 3), cutting at 0.5 m above ground and dissecting the stumps (T 4) and control (T 5). Data on basal and litter covers, soil erosion and compaction, dead and re-sprouted encroaching tree/shrub species and nymph- and adult-stage tick populations were collected before and after treatment applications. The applied treatments significantly influenced (p < 0.05) basal cover, nymph- and adult-stage tick population and the two encroaching tree species. The {{results of this study}} showed that T 3 and T 2 were good in controlling A. drepanolobium in that order. T 4 and T 2 had a significant effect in controlling A. mellifera in their order. Controlling bush encroachment had also a positive effect in eradicating the tick population. The most dominant grass and non-grass species observed after the control actions were Cenchrus ciliaris, Chrysopogon aucheri, Abutilon hirtum, Pennisetum mezianum, Dyschoriste hildebrandtii, Zaleya pentandra and Eragrostis papposa. Therefore, controlling encroaching tree/shrub species had created a conducive grazing area with palatable herbaceous species for the livestock and unequivocally reduced tick population which play a role in reducing cattle milk production through closing off teats. The management of bush encroachment, if sustained, will contribute in stabilizing rangelands and help minimize the negative effects of feed and food crises in the future.|$|R
40|$|Food-borne {{diseases}} {{are a major}} concern of developing countries. Among the drivers, rapidly increasing pork consumption deserves increased attention. Yet there is little documentation in Uganda on {{the context in which}} pork is produced, marketed and consumed and the implications this may have on public health. This study attempts to assess the current knowledge, attitudes and practices and looks more into butchers’ beliefs about customer preferences. Sixty pork butcheries out of 179 mapped in Kampala were randomly selected. In July 2014 on-site observations were undertaken and butchers were interviewed what they think is the most and the least important attributes to their clients when buying pork meat. Best-worst method with a set of previously identified thirteen attributes was used. Half of the pork purchased by the butchers came from pigs slaughtered in backyards or non-gazetted abattoirs. Raw pork accounted for half of the total pork sold by pork butcheries. The other half was served as cooked pork and usually consumed on-site accompanied by raw vegetables. The majority of butchers use a wooden <b>stump</b> as a <b>cutting</b> surface. Pest animals are present in most butcheries including rodents, birds and flies. Best-worst scores showed that among the attributes butchers revealed as the most important for their customers were: “Meat from the same day”, “Cleanliness in the butchery” and “Trust in butcher“ while “Presence of flies in butchery”, “Age of the animal”, “Pest animals in butchery” and “Fat layer of meat“ were the least significant qualities. Others varied in-between such as “Price”, “Colour of meat”, “Bony meat”, “Butcher wearing coat”, “Type of building structure” and “Butchery close to main road”. The results indicate the need to improve food hygiene in order to mitigate food contamination risks but they also show sellers’ believes which need {{to be taken into account}} and addressed. Bringing this research into use will allow targeted interventions and empower butchers to improve the conditions in their shops, strengthen their businesses, and therefore contribute to healthier clients and public health. The research was carried out with the financial support of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), Germany, and the CGIAR Research Programs on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health, and on Policies, Institutions and Markets led by the International Food Policy Research Institute, through the Safe Food, Fair Food project at ILRI...|$|R
