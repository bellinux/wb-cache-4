50|$|The {{photographic}} reproduction of natural colour {{by means of}} a black-and-white photograph taken and viewed through a mosaic of tiny colour filters was an idea first patented and published by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 1860s, but the incomplete colour sensitivity of contemporary photographic materials made it impractical at that time. John Joly independently reinvented the concept in 1894 and attempted to commercialise it, but the first successful product based on this idea, the Autochrome plate, did not reach the market until 1907. Several competing mosaic colour <b>screen</b> <b>plate</b> products soon appeared, including Louis Dufay's Dioptichrome plate, but the Autochrome plate remained by far the most popular. A film-based version of Autochrome was introduced in 1931, shortly before the first Dufaycolor product appeared.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} variations {{for constructing}} {{and the design}} of main components of centrifuge such as the <b>screen</b> <b>plate,</b> helical screw and basket could actually improve the longer life term of the machine.

Different basket size and angle between basket and helical screw can vary the angular speed; as a result, {{the quality of the}} product is affected. Moreover, the shape of the helical screw is also important since it optimizes the transportation of cake. A selection of typical screen scroll centrifuge with different basket sizes found in the market is presented in the following Table 1.

5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} color process, the Lumière Autochrome, {{invented by}} the French Lumière brothers, reached {{the market in}} 1907. It {{was based on an}} irregular <b>screen</b> <b>plate</b> filter made of dyed grains of potato starch which were too small to be individually visible. The light-sensitive emulsion was coated directly onto the screen, eliminating problems due to imperfect contact between the screen and image. Reversal processing was used to convert the negative image which was initially produced into a positive image, so no printing or screen registration was required. The shortcomings of the Autochrome process were the expense (one plate cost about as much as a dozen black-and-white plates of the same size), the relatively long exposure times which made hand-held [...] "snapshots" [...] and photographs of moving subjects impractical, and the density of the finished image due to the presence of the light-absorbing color screen.|$|E
5000|$|Making {{altitude}} (elevation) {{measurements of}} the Sun being simple and direct, requiring the user to aligning {{the image of the}} Sun through the front pinhole (aperture), centered onto the rear back plate which operates more like a mask and not a viewing pass hole for sighting the Sun with the naked eye. Much {{in the same manner as}} performing eyepiece projection with a telescope, one fashioned with a front and rear aperture (font lens and rear eyepiece) along with a projection screen behind the eyepiece, or more rudimentary, the projecting of the Sun’s image upon a small <b>screen</b> <b>plate</b> such as that done with a mariner’s back staff. The rear, or second aperture (pass hole) having the function of working as a blacken attenuator so that any reflecting, annulus shaped sunlight off the metal aperture is not too bright, the Sun’s image (light) passing through the second hole and similar in task though void of a fixed image plane, to that of an iris (diaphragm) in a camera lens to reduce the light intensity. For relative to human physiology, focusing on a bright spot of light such as a pin point image of the Sun for any extended period or repetitively over a short duration of time adversely effects momentarily, a person’s visual acuity, thus making it more challenging to focus one’s eyes to read the angular scale. It being typical to orientate the instrument such that the operator faces looking slightly down upon the scale, the Sun at the users left, with right hand placed in such a way that the rays of sunlight pass through the two, perforated sighting plates, forming a bright illuminated spot on the observer’s finger (see photo), the finger functioning as a projection screen. At the moment an optical alignment with the Sun is established, the angular value of the device is read by the operator at the point where the graduated scale is bisected by the hanging plumb line.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on pressure screen and hydrocyclone performance. The general contradictory interrelationships between capacity and selectivity in pressure screening and cleaning are commonly recognized, but deep understanding of the effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the state of operation is missing. As separation selectivity is closely dependent on thickening and pulp passage, an operation curve for separation was applied and its application further developed to examine the parameters affecting pressure screen and hydrocyclone separation. New information was found on the geometry of the <b>screen</b> <b>plate,</b> furnish quality parameters in pressure screen fibre fractionation, and the hydrocyclone separation of fibres, sand and gases. The capacity increases achieved by changes in the wire <b>screen</b> <b>plate</b> geometry were found to be achieved at the cost of separation selectivity in probability screening. The capacity of the <b>screen</b> <b>plate</b> was affected by the flow on the <b>screen</b> <b>plate</b> and through it. The hydraulic resistance both in the forward and reverse flow directions was found to be of great importance for the capacity of the <b>screen</b> <b>plate.</b> Previously unreported knowledge was found regarding the effects of wire width, height and shape. Pressure screening capacity was found to decrease with increasing fibre length, fibre network strength and flocculation. Pressure screen fibre fractionation selectivity was increased by broadening of the fibre length distribution of the feed furnish. The furnish properties also affected the separation selectivity of fibres, sand and gases in the hydrocyclone. An increase in fibre network strength reduced the separation selectivity of the hydrocyclone separation of fibres and sand. Any increase in the specific surface area, and especially in the amount of fines, was found to make gas removal more challenging. It was concluded that a broader range of the specific surface distribution can increase the selectivity of fibre fractionation in the hydrocyclone. Knowledge of the general effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the performance of pressure screen and hydrocyclone separation was deepened as a result of this work, which provides a framework for studying these effects further in pursuit of the general {{objective of}} maximizing capacity and selectivity while minimizing energy and investment costs...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} accuracy, cost-effectiveness {{and ease}} to perform different phenotypic methods i. e. Cefoxitin 30 microg disc, Oxacillin 1 microg disc and Oxacillin agar <b>screening</b> <b>plate</b> (6 microg/ml) for early and accurate identification of MRSA by comparing with {{the detection of}} mec-A gene in our clinical isolates. DESIGN: A comparative study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Clinical samples submitted in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from 1 st August to 31 st October 2006. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Out of 200 clinical samples, conventional Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done on 62 pure biochemically identified S. aureus isolates for mec-A gene detection. Phenotypic methods for detecting methicillin sensitivity (Cefoxitin 30 microg disc, Oxacillin 1 microg disc and Oxacillin agar <b>screening</b> <b>plate)</b> were also used according to the recommended incubation time, duration and temperature on the same isolates. RESULTS: Out of 62 isolates of S. aureus, mec-A gene were detected (MRSA) in 32, whereas 30 were mec-A gene negative (MSSA). Cefoxitin disc and agar <b>screening</b> <b>plate</b> correctly identify all MRSA isolates with the sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. Single isolate was false, positively detected as sensitive with Oxacillin 1 microg disc, due to which, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of this method were reduced to 96. 9 % and 96. 8 % respectively, while positive predictive value and specificity remained 100 %. CONCLUSION: Comparing different phenotypic methods for MRSA screening in routine microbiology laboratory, Cefoxitin disc and Oxacillin agar screening has better sensitivity and specificity comparative to Oxacillin disc. However, Cefoxitin disc can be preferred especially for small laboratories because {{it is easy to}} perform, do not require special technique and media preparation is consequently more cost-effective...|$|R
