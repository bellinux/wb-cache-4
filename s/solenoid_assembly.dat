50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} <b>solenoid</b> <b>assembly</b> pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|E

40|$|Several of the {{structural}} components in the superconducting magnet system for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) experience pulsed, multiaxial loading during operation. For components, such as the conductor conduits, with a large population of initial flaws, fatigue crack growth analysis (FCGR) is used to evaluate failure. For other, simpler, unwelded components, such as pins and bolts in the Central <b>Solenoid</b> <b>assembly,</b> in which flaw crack initiation is a dominant factor, S/N data can be used. However, since S/N data is available only for uniaxial load conditions, a reliable design code for multiaxial fatigue is necessary. The problem {{is that none of}} the existing design codes gives a complete definition for the equivalent mean stress in multiaxial fatigue. This paper reviews the existing theories and design codes in multiaxial fatigue, and proposes a general definition of equivalent mean stress for multiaxial fatigue for the design of ITER and other pulsed structures with multiaxial loads...|$|E

50|$|The bars {{were formed}} by {{electroplating}} a 97% iron/3% nickel plate onto beryllium-copper wire 10 thousandth {{of an inch}} in diameter (10 mils), coating it in polyurethane, and curing it in an oven. The long length of coated wire is then wound with thin copper ribbon, 10 mil wide and 2.5 mil thick, coated in urethane again, and then cut into 6-inch long bars. Separately, another machine is fed copper wire and periodically creates small coils of ten windings forming a <b>solenoid.</b> The <b>assembly</b> machinery then left a short section of the wire unbent, before winding another solenoid into the wire, and so on. The result is a string of coils on the wire, which from a distance looked {{like a series of}} knots evenly spaced along a rope. A number of these ropes were then laid parallel to each other and a second set of straight wires run parallel to the ropes so they lay under one end of the <b>solenoids.</b> The <b>assembly</b> is then completed by inserting one of the rods though a series of the solenoids and the potting the entire assembly. The result is a single plane of memory, which is then assembled into a larger frame to form a complete memory with multiple bit planes.|$|R
50|$|A {{multi-point}} {{system is}} the most powerful type of nitrous system, due to the placement of the nozzle in each runner, as well as the ability to use more and higher capacity solenoid valves. Wet multi-point kits can go as high as 3,000 horsepower (2,400 kW) with only one stage, but most produce less than half that amount with two, three or even four stages. These systems are also the most complex and expensive systems, requiring significant modification to the engine, including adding distribution blocks and <b>solenoid</b> <b>assemblies,</b> as well as drilling, tapping and constructing plumbing for each cylinder runner. These systems are most often used on racing vehicles specially built to take the strain of such high power levels. Many high-horsepower race applications will use more than one nozzle per cylinder, plumbed in stages to allow greater control of how much power is delivered with each stage. A two-stage system will actually allow three different levels of additional horsepower; for example, a small first stage can be used in first gear to prevent excessive wheelspin, then turned off in favor of a larger second stage once the car is moving. In top gear, both stages can be activated at the same time for maximum horsepower. A more recent improvement on the staged concept from WON is the progressive delivery system, which allows a simpler single stage system to act even better than multiple stages, delivering a smoothly progressive increase in power which is adjustable to suit the user requirements.|$|R
40|$|Novel {{configurations}} of superconducting magnet system for Muon Beam Cooling Experiment is under design at Fermilab. The magnet {{system has to}} generate longitudinal and transverse dipole and quadrupole helical magnetic fields providing a muon beam motion along helical orbit. It was found that such complicated field configuration can be formed {{by a set of}} circular coils shifted in transverse directions {{in such a way that}} their centers lay on the center of the helical beam orbit. Closed beam orbit configurations were also proposed and investigated. This paper describes the magnetic and mechanical designs and parameters of such magnetic system based on a NbTi Rutherford type cable.

40|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} brake {{has been}} designed as a more energy-efficient alternative to a magnetic fail-safe brake in a robot. (In the specific application, failsafe signifies that the brake is normally engaged; that is, power must be supplied to allow free rotation.) The magnetic failsafe brake must be supplied with about 8 W of electric power to initiate and maintain disengagement. In contrast, the magnetostrictive brake, which would have about the same dimensions and the same torque rating {{as those of the}} magnetic fail-safe brake, would demand only about 2 W of power for disengagement. The brake (see figure) would include a stationary base plate and a hub mounted on the base plate. Two <b>solenoid</b> <b>assemblies</b> would be mounted in diametrically opposed recesses in the hub. The cores of the solenoids would be made of the magnetostrictive alloy Terfenol-D or equivalent. The rotating part of the brake would be a ring-and spring- disk subassembly. By means of leaf springs not shown in the figure, this subassembly would be coupled with the shaft that the brake is meant to restrain. With no power supplied to the solenoids, a permanent magnet would pull axially on a stepped disk and on a shelf in the hub, causing the ring to be squeezed axially between the stepped disk and the hub. The friction associated with this axial squeeze would effect the braking action. Supplying electric power to the solenoids would cause the magnetostrictive cylinders to push radially inward against a set of wedges that would be in axial contact with the stepped disk. The wedges would convert the radial magnetostrictive strain to a multiplied axial displacement of the stepped disk. This axial displacement would be just large enough to lift the stepped disk, against the permanent magnetic force, out of contact with the ring. The ring would then be free to turn because it would no longer be squeezed axially between the stepped disk and the hub...|$|R
40|$|The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator (CEBA) uses {{mechanical}} tuners at 2 K {{driven by}} room temperature stepping motors in a feedback loop to maintain cavity frequency at 1497 MHz. Modification {{of the system}} was designed, replacing a passive section of the mechanical tuner with a magnetostrictive tuning element consisting of a Ni rod and an industrially supplied 0. 25 T superconducting <b>solenoid.</b> This <b>assembly</b> was tested with several magnetic shield configurations designed to keep the stray flux at the Nb cavity below 1 {mu}T when the cavity was normal, to maintain cavity Q. Results of the tests, including change in cavity performance when the cavity was locally quenched {{near the end of}} the solenoid, showed that the a multi-layer shield of 6 mm steel, with sheets of mu metal, niobium and my metal spaced appropriately outside the thick steel, was effective in containing the flux, both remanent and current-driven, preventing any change in cavity Q upon cooldown or quench with an external heater near the solenoid end. Hysteresis attributed to the Ni magnetostrictive element was observed...|$|R
40|$|The Pegasus Toroidal Experiment [1] is a mid-sized, {{extremely}} low aspect ratio spherical torus. Access to near-unity aspect ratio is achieved {{through use of}} a novel high-stress reinforced <b>solenoid</b> magnet <b>assembly.</b> It has the dual roles of exploring the limits of spherical torus plasma behavior as the aspect ratio, A, approaches 1 and examining alternate confinement concepts in the tokamak-spheromak overlap regime. Unique MHD properties arise with possibilities of strong mode coupling at very high toroidicity. Operation with ohmic heating has started to demonstrate the high- stability capabilities of operation at near-unity aspect ratio. Major parameters are R = 0. 25 - 0. 45 m, A = 1. 1 – 1. 4, = 1 - 3. 5, Ip ~ 0. 15 MA, Bt < 0. 07 T, and Paux(HHFW) = 1 MW. Global magnetic parameters are obtained through equilibrium reconstruction using {{a wide array of}} magnetics diagnostics. The vacuum vessel is continuous and has a skin time on the order of the plasma formation time. Induced currents in the wall are generally greater than the plasma current, and are estimated with a coupled current-filament model.

50|$|In 2004, the {{electronics}} side was improved greatly with the introductions of Electronic Throttle Control, electronically controlled transmissions, and transient engine and transmission controls. In addition, computing power was vastly increased. A <b>solenoid</b> control valve <b>assembly</b> {{integrated into the}} engine valley cover contains solenoid valves that provide a pressurized oil signal to specially designed hydraulic roller lifters provided by Eaton Corp. and Delphi. These lifters disable and re-enable exhaust and intake valve operation to deactivate and reactivate engine cylinders https://web.archive.org/web/20061029082032/http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fuel/engine.html. Unlike the first generation system, {{only half of the}} cylinders can be deactivated. It is notable that the second generation system uses engine oil to hydraulically modulate engine valve function. As a result, the system is dependent upon the quality of the oil in the engine. As anti-foaming agents in engine oil are depleted, air may become entrained or dissolve in the oil, delaying the timing of hydraulic control signals. Similarly engine oil viscosity and cleanliness is a factor. Use of the incorrect oil type, i.e. SAE 20W40 instead of SAE 20W50, or the failure to change engine oil at factory recommended intervals can also significantly impair system performance.|$|R
