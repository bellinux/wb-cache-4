The initial idea of what is today known as the Belgrade Inner City <b>Semi-Ring</b> Road, to which the bridge is an important part, were created at that time. This road was part of several plans under different names such as the Main Ring Road, Transverse Road, Eastern Tangent Road, each with slightly different routes. All the plans had one thing in common: the Ada Ciganlija Bridge. In early plans the bridge was placed closer to the Lake while the final project placed the bridge on the very tip of the island due to ecological concerns over the lake.|$|E

Due {{to the fact that}} many <b>semi-rings</b> or pre-semi-rings are not additive groups, such concepts as the determinant of a matrix cannot be used any more, and the statement of the result itself has to be significantly different.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{observed}} that the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) transformation based on min-plus algebra (or called Tropical <b>Semi-Rings)</b> leads to a very good characteristic in zero underestimating the reconstructed matrix. This paper introduces a novel distributed control framework for shared protection in optical networks with reduced routing information based on the Tropical <b>Semi-Rings</b> technique, called Sharing with Reduced Information with Tropical <b>Semi-Rings</b> (SRI-TROP). The design of the proposed framework aims to initiate a compromise {{between the amount of}} link-state dissemination and the performance impairment due to the incompleteness of routing information, such that the precision in the link-state matrix reconstruction can efficiently map to the reduction in blocking probability. Based on the framework, a series of novel schemes are proposed, which are verified and compared with the reported counterparts in a simulation. The simulation results show that the performance in terms of the precision in the reconstructed link-state and the resultant blocking probability can be significantly improved. ...|$|R

40|$|Little-Parks {{oscillations}} {{are observed}} {{in a system of}} 110 series-connected aluminum rings 2000 nm in diameter with the use of measuring currents from 10 nA to 1000 nA. The measurements show that the amplitude and character of the oscillations are independent of the relation between the measuring current and the amplitude of the persistent current. By using asymmetric rings, it is demonstrated that the persistent current has clockwise or contra-clockwise direction. This means that the total current in one of the <b>semi-rings</b> may be directed against the electric field at measurement of the Little-Parks oscillations. The measurements at zero and low measuring current have revealed that the persistent current, like the conventional circulating current, causes a potential difference on the <b>semi-rings</b> with different cross sections in spite of the absence of the Faraday's voltage.

40|$|We discuss, {{compare and}} relate some old {{and some new}} models for {{incomplete}} and probabilistic databases. We characterize the expressive power of c-tables over infinite domains and we introduce {{a new kind of}} result, algebraic completion, for studying less expressive models. By viewing probabilistic models as incompleteness models with additional probability information, we define completeness and closure under query languages of general probabilistic database models and we introduce a new such model, probabilistic c-tables, that is shown to be complete and closed under the relational algebra. We also identify fundamental connections between query answering with incomplete and probabilistic databases and data provenance. We show that the calculations for incomplete databases, probabilistic databases, bag semantics, lineage, and why-provenance are particular cases of the same general algorithms involving <b>semi-rings.</b> This further suggests a comprehensive provenance representation that uses <b>semi-rings</b> of polynomials. Finally, we show that for positive Boolean c-tables, containment of positive relational queries is the same as for standard set semantics. ...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly, {{access to}} {{resources}} needs to be regulated or informed by considerations such as risk, cost, and reputation. We therefore propose a framework for policy languages, based on <b>semi-rings,</b> that aggregate quantitative evidence to support decision-making in access control systems. As aggregation operators “addition”, “worst case”, and “best case ” over non-negative reals are both relevant in practice and amenable to analysis, we study an instance, Peal, of our framework in that setting. Peal is a stand-alone policy language but can also be integrated with existing policy languages. Peal policies can be synthesized into logical formulae that no longer make reference to quantities but capture all policy behavior. Satisfiability checking of such formulae {{can be used to}} validate and analyze policies in this new evidence-based approach. We discuss a number of applications, including vacuity, redundancy, change-impact and safety analysis. The synthesis algorithm requires a form of subset enumeration, for which we develop bespoke algorithms and demonstrate experimentally that our algorithms work better than generic state exploration methods. We also sketch how our approach extends from non-negative reals to other <b>semi-rings</b> and even to rings such as the real numbers...|$|R

Simple semirings, where the closure operation for elements is trivial are defined and it is shown that the closure of an n x n matrix over a simple semiring is the sum of its powers of degree less than n.

At present {{a great number of}} compounds and alloys with a shape memory effect has been known. These are alloys based on titanium nickelide (TiNi), copper-based alloys (Cu-Al, Cu-Sn, Cu-Al-Ni, Cu-Zn-Si, etc.), gold and silver (Ag-Cd, Au-Ag-Cd, Au-Cd-Cu, Au-Zn-Cu, etc.), manganese (Mn-Cr, Fe-Cu, Mn-Cu-Ni, Mn-Cu-Zr, Mn-Ni, etc.), iron (Fe-Mn, Fe-Ni, Fe-Al, etc.), and other compounds. The alloys based on titanium nickelide (nitinol) are the most widely used. Alloys with shape memory effect find various applications in engineering and medicine, namely connecting devices, actuators, transformable design, multipurpose medical implants, etc. There is a task of breaking fuel conduit during separating the spacecraft from the rocket in space technology.

We consider a powerful unit-cost computational model over the ring of integers allowing for several addi-tional operations and generation of large integers. We show the following dichotomy for such a powerful model: while almost all arithmetic semi-disjoint bilinear forms have the same asymptotic time complexity as that yielded by naive algorithms, matrix multiplication, the so called distance matrix product, and vector convolution can be solved in a linear number of steps. It follows in particular that in order to obtain a non-trivial lower bounds for these three basic problems one has to assume restrictions on the set of allowed operations and/or the size of used integers...|$|R
