2500|$|He was {{interrupted}} by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wanted him to address the government's argument that the ongoing nature of the fraud made the odometer readings on the title applications essential to the scheme. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> in a single instance the mailing of the title documents doesn't suffice to make it mail fraud, the multiplication of the instances doesn't change anything," [...] Steinberg responded. [...] "The repetition of odometer tampering doesn't create a mail fraud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Mrs. Bowen, humouring {{the joke}} in her turn. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had {{consulted}} {{us a little}} earlier, {{he might have done}} better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{so would}} I, Patsy Cooper. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{we can save}} these poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up here and talk for them till--" ...|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, {{but it does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a miracle had happened. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{can be done}} worth doing, without trouble, Your Majesty," [...] Desmond said sturdily. [...] "It almost <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> {{everything}} {{could be}} had without trouble, {{it would not be}} worth having." ...|$|E
6000|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{there be}} not reasons of {{conscience}} obliging a [...] good man to speak out, {{there are always}} reasons of prudence which [...] should make a wise man hold his tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "`What {{shall we}} do, Maximus?' said I; `it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{we go on}} we may wander out of our course and lose much time ere we find it again. Shall we turn back?' ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> young Bingo {{must have}} boosted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> some purpose.|$|R
60|$|And it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{had heard}} those words from him before.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the man's iron repose was shaken.|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} {{answered}} that telegram, either; I couldn't. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> any man has just merciful and kindly instincts {{he would be}} a gentleman, for he would need nothing else in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. When I am {{on horseback}} I {{never think of}} danger. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I broke my bones I should not feel it. I should go at {{anything}} that came in my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{companion}} laughed. [...] "That," [...] she said, [...] "is {{a subject}} I'm not well posted on, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> other folks only adopted Harry Wyllard's simple plan, {{there would be}} considerably less need for organised charity." ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Grooten {{was taking}} {{a great deal for}} granted.|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I am {{a little}} in the way here.|$|R
60|$|It almost <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had, but Tedham {{came to my}} rescue most unexpectedly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now tell me, Coningsby, {{exactly what}} you {{conceive}} to be the state of parties in this country; for it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we penetrate the surface, the classification must be more simple than their many names would intimate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Hastings {{shook her}} head. [...] "That," [...] she said, [...] "is a subject I'm not well posted on, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> other folks only adopted Harry Wyllard's simple plan, {{there would be}} {{considerably}} less need for organized charity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't understand," [...] said Benham with {{a gesture}} of resignation. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{a man and woman}} love each other--well, they insist upon each other. What is to happen to her if you leave her in Moscow?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> online {{copyright}} infringement is {{a legitimate}} problem, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when {{what you really need}} is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet." ...|$|R
60|$|The Baron hesitated. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was {{peering into}} the shadows beyond the hedge.|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. We'd {{have been}} somewhere, at all events. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> now I am nowhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyway, I {{want the}} calico," [...] said he. [...] "Please {{put it aside}} for me, and I'll come in to-morrow and settle for it. And now it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we want any supper we had better be {{getting back to the}} inn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mrs. Brinkley, do {{you still}} feel that way?" [...] asked Miss Cotton, with a certain distress. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> ever two young people had the promise of happiness, they have. Just see what their love has done for them already!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} hard, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Vernon were with me now, {{the last thing}} that would please him would be to see the two women suffer; he was a big man in every way. There's another thing--he left no relations to consider." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} an ugly cloud {{gathering}} on the political horizon in Natal.|$|R
25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Berlin {{would not}} be at all {{suitable}} for me while M.Euler is there.|$|R
60|$|I {{was utterly}} stunned; {{it had not}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> any wound could be mortal to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> {{it could}} {{possibly}} be managed, our safest plan would be to lie quiet in the town {{for a week or}} so, after we got out; then it would be comparatively safe to get hold of a boat and make off in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” he said, “it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> one is dreaming {{something}} very nice {{it would be}} better to let him sleep as long as possible, and a blunder to waken him to unpleasant realities. There’s another point, too. You seem to have overlooked the person who did the wrong.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Jordan {{flashed a}} warning glance at Jimmy. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you will wait the week, {{you are going}} to get your freight.

60|$|Lady Delahaye {{raised her}} eyebrows. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{in a quiet}} way she was {{becoming}} angry.|$|R
60|$|Lestrade {{shook his}} head, though it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his manner was less {{absolutely}} assured than before.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Duke was {{watching}} me with peculiar intentness.|$|R
