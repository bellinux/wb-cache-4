40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, blade carrier bearings and crank disk. In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. <b>spindle</b> <b>arm,</b> 2) geometry gap between blade flange and blade carrier bearings and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and blade carrier bearings, crank disk and blade carrier bearings. Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same <b>spindle</b> <b>arm</b> close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, blade carrier bearings and crank disk, the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|E

500|$|NWMP Commissioner Acheson G. Irvine ordered 200 Mark IIs in 1882, {{priced at}} C$15.75 each, which were shipped by London's Montgomery and Workman in November that year, {{arriving}} in December. They replaced the Adams. Irvine liked {{them so much}} that, {{in one of his}} final acts as Commissioner, he ordered another 600, which were delivered in September 1885. His replacement, Lawrence W. Herchmer, reported the force was entirely outfitted with Enfields (in all 1,079 were provided) and was pleased with them, but concerned about the [...]476 round being too potent. The first batch was stamped NWMP-CANADA (issue number between) after delivery; later purchases were not. They were top-break single- or double-action, and fitted with lanyard rings. Worn <b>spindle</b> <b>arms</b> would fail to hold empty cases on ejection, and worn pivot pins could cause barrels to become loose, resulting in inaccuracy. Its deep rifling would allow firing of slugs of between [...] diameter. Complaints began arising as early as 1887, influenced in part by the British switching to Webleys, and by 1896, hinge wear and barrel loosening were a real issue.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the realization of}} a two-degrees of freedom induction motor prototype with rotor helical motion, suitable for several industrial applications as grinders, augers, drilling and milling <b>spindles,</b> robotic <b>arms</b> and drives for medical tools and prostheses. This prototype was realized by combining a three-phase tubular linear induction motor (TLIM) with the stator of a three-phase rotary induction motor, resulting in a THMIM (Tubular Helical Motion Induction Motor). Moreover, a possible simple electrical drive, capable to control the helical motion, is proposed, simulated and analyzed. In particular, the mathematical model of the THMIM has been initially developed and, then, the complete drive has been simulated in MATLAB-Simulink. The simulation results demonstrate that, by acting separately on the control of rotary and tubular machine components, a very accurate controlled helical motion can be achieve...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not until}} the Scottish {{engineer}} James Watt introduced the rotative steam engine, for driving factory machinery, that a constant operating speed became necessary.

50|$|A post-war {{development}} was the lever shock absorber. This {{had a large}} cast body containing a cylinder and pistons attached to a similar <b>spindle</b> and lever <b>arm.</b> Some used a pair of pistons for bump and rebound, others used a single double-acting piston. Flow of hydraulic oil around the piston took place through valves mounted in the body. Separate valves were provided for each direction, giving the useful feature of a different resistance to bump and rebound. These valves were sometimes easily adjustable from outside the damper body.|$|R

30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of single-axle bogie of {{straddle-type}} monorail vehicle is designed. The tumbler structures are adopted in the vertical suspension system. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. In addition, the lateral suspension utilizes the suspender way, with longitudinal force transmitted via single pull rods. Guide wheels and steady wheels are connected to the end support arms of the framework through spindles around the horizontal direction. Rubber springs, the pre-compressed magnitudes of which could be adjusted, are set between the <b>spindles</b> and support <b>arms.</b> The multi-body dynamics software UM is adopted to construct a dynamic model and simulate related dynamic performance. The results of the simulation indicate that this new kind of bogie has a favorable performance when passing through curves and has a greater riding stability. The flexibility factor equation of this new monorail vehicle is deduced, with its flexibility factor obtained.|$|R
50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle <b>spindle.</b> This <b>arm</b> has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|R
40|$|When blindfolded {{subjects}} {{match the}} position of their forearms in the vertical plane they rely on signals coming from the periphery {{as well as from}} the central motor command. The command signal provides a positional cue from the accompanying effort sensation required to hold the arm against gravity. Here we have asked, does a centrally generated effort signal contribute to position sense in the horizontal plane, where gravity cannot play a role? Blindfolded subjects were required to match forearm position for the unloaded arm and when flexors or extensors were bearing 10 %, 25 % or 40 % of maximum loads. Before each match the reference arm was conditioned by contracting elbow muscles while the arm was held flexed or extended. For the unloaded arm conditioning led to a consistent pattern of errors which was attributed to signals from flexor and extensor muscle spindles. When elbow muscles were loaded the errors from conditioning converged, presumably because the spindles had become coactivated through the fusimotor system during the load-bearing contraction. However, this convergence was seen only when subjects supported a static load. When they moved the load differences in errors from conditioning persisted. Muscle vibration during load bearing or moving a load did not alter the distribution of errors. It is concluded that for position sense of an unloaded arm in the horizontal plane the brain relies on signals from muscle <b>spindles.</b> When the <b>arm</b> is loaded, an additional signal of central origin contributes, but only if the load is moved...|$|R
40|$|The {{machine of}} this {{invention}} {{provides for the}} forming of large round bales, weighing from a half a ton to a ton, from a windrowed ?brous material such as hay or the like, transporting the bales to a storage position, and releasing the bales at the storage position. A pair of transversely spaced swing arms are supported on a portable frame unit for up and down pivotal movement between bale releasing positions projected rearwardly of the frame unit to for wardly projected bale forming positions, and for pivotal movement toward and {{away from each other}} in either the bale forming or bale releasing positions therefor. A rotata ble material wrapping and bale supporting spindle is car ried at the free end of each arm so that when the arms are in their bale forming positions, the spindles project in wardly toward each other from the opposite ends of a bale forming compartment that extends transversely of the frame unit. With the swing arms in their bale forming positions and on a forward advance of the frame unit along a windrow, the windrowed material is picked up and directed into the bale forming compartment where it is engaged by the spindles for wrapping thereon. As the ma terial is wrapped it is yieldably con?ned about the spindles to give satisfactory compactness or density to the com pleted bale. When the bale is completed and while in the bale forming compartment it may be transported to a stor age position. At the storage position and while the bale is supported on the <b>spindles,</b> the swing <b>arms</b> are pivotally movable to their bale releasing positions, in which they are then pivotally moved away from each other to release the formed bale from the spindles...|$|R
50|$|The SD2 {{submunition}} was a 76 mm long cylinder of cast iron, {{which was}} slightly larger in diameter before its wings deployed. A steel cable 121 mm long was attached via a spindle to an aluminium fuze screwed into the fuze pocket {{in the side}} of the bomblet. The outer shell was hinged and would flip open as two half-cylinders when it was dropped. Additionally, spring-loaded wings at the ends would flip out. The wings at the end were canted at an angle to the airflow, which turned the spindle (connected to the fuze) anti-clockwise as the bomblet fell. After the spindle had revolved approximately 10 times (partially unscrewing itself from the bomb) it released a spring-loaded pin inside the fuze, which fully armed the SD2 bomb. The wings and <b>arming</b> <b>spindle</b> remained attached to the bomb after the fuze had armed itself, as the bomb descended towards the ground. Butterfly bombs contained the kleine Zündladung 34 (kl. Zdlg. 34/Np with a blasting cap and 7 grams of Nitropenta) booster and the main explosive filling consisting of 225 grams of cast Füllpulver 60/40 (Amatol) explosive. The fragmentation density produced by an SD 2 was 1 fragment per m² in 8 meters radius from a ground burst SD 2 bomb; overall, the body of an SD 2 did produce about 250 fragments with a mass of over 1 gram and a still greater number of lighter fragments. The fragments were generally lethal to anyone within a radius of 10 m and could inflict serious fragmentation injuries (e.g. deep penetrating eye wounds) as far away as 100 m. Butterfly bombs were usually painted either straw yellow (desert camouflage), or, if fitted with the DoppZ (41) or (41) A fuze, dark green or grey.|$|R
