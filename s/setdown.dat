50|$|A more {{detailed}} description involves radiation stress. This is the force (or momentum flux) exerted {{on the water}} column {{by the presence of}} the wave. As a wave shoals and increases in height prior to breaking, radiation stress increases. To balance this, the local mean surface level (the water level with the wave averaged out) drops — this is known as <b>setdown.</b> As the wave breaks and continues to reduce in height, the radiation stress decreases. To balance this force, the mean surface increases—this is known as setup. As a wave propagates over a sandbar with a gap (as shown in the lead image), the wave breaks on the bar, leading to setup. However, the part of the wave that propagates over the gap does not break, and thus <b>setdown</b> will continue. Thus, the mean surface over the bars is higher than that over the gap, and a strong flow issues outward through the gap.|$|E
50|$|For {{bodies with}} atmospheres, the landing occurs after {{atmospheric}} entry. In these cases, landers may employ parachutes {{to slow down}} and to maintain a low terminal velocity. Sometimes small landing rockets are fired just before impact to reduce the impact velocity. Landing may be accomplished by controlled descent and <b>setdown</b> on landing gear, with the possible addition of a post-landing attachment mechanism for celestial bodies with low gravity. Some missions (for example, Luna 9 and Mars Pathfinder) used inflatable airbags to cushion the lander's impact rather than a more traditional landing gear.|$|E
50|$|In fluid dynamics, wave {{setup is}} the {{increase}} in mean water level due {{to the presence of}} breaking waves. Similarly, wave <b>setdown</b> is a wave-induced decrease of the mean water level before the waves break (during the shoaling process). For short, the whole phenomenon is often denoted as wave setup, including both increase and decrease of mean elevation. This setup is primarily present in and near the coastal surf zone. Besides a spatial variation in the (mean) wave setup, also a variation in time may be present - known as surf beat - causing infragravity wave radiation.|$|E
40|$|The air-sea drag {{coefficient}} controls {{the transfer of}} momentum from wind to water. In modeling storm surge, this coefficient is a crucial parameter for estimating the surge height. This study uses two strong wind events on Lake Erie to calibrate the {{drag coefficient}} using the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system and the the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Simulated waves are generated on the lake with Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN). Wind <b>setdown</b> provides the opportunity to eliminate wave setup as a contributing factor, since waves are minimal at the upwind shore. The study finds that model results significantly underestimate wind <b>setdown</b> and storm surge when a typical open-ocean formulation without waves {{is used for the}} drag coefficient. The contribution of waves to wind <b>setdown</b> and storm surge is 34. 7 %. Scattered lake ice also increases the effective drag coefficient by a factor of 1. 1...|$|E
30|$|Best {{conditions}} for sediment accumulation are moderate storms that increase sediment resuspension near salt marshes, but don’t trigger fast flows in the channels (Fagherazzi and Priestas 2010). On the contrary, for sediment export the worst conditions occur during meteorological low tides (setdowns), when wind blows water {{away from the}} coastline and a large volume of water exits the marsh system. The <b>setdown</b> leads to shallow water depths, which, combined with large discharges, results in velocities that erode sediments in the channels. The low water levels also trigger large gradients in groundwater pressure leading to seepage and piping at channel banks (Gardner 2005; Howes and Goehringer 1994).|$|E
40|$|Background: Wind <b>setdown</b> is {{the drop}} in water level caused by wind stress acting {{on the surface of}} a body of water for an {{extended}} period of time. As the wind blows, water recedes from the upwind shore and exposes terrain that was formerly underwater. Previous researchers have suggested wind <b>setdown</b> as a possible hydrodynamic explanation for Moses crossing the Red Sea, as described in Exodus 14. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study analyzes the hydrodynamic mechanism proposed by earlier studies, focusing on the time needed to reach a steady-state solution. In addition, the authors investigate a site in the eastern Nile delta, where the ancient Pelusiac branch of the Nile once flowed into a coastal lagoon then known as the Lake of Tanis. We conduct a satellite and modeling survey to analyze this location, using geological evidence of the ancient bathymetry and a historical description of a strong wind event in 1882. A suite of model experiments are performed to demonstrate a new hydrodynamic mechanism that can cause an angular body of water to divide under wind stress, and to test the behavior of our study location and reconstructed topography. Conclusions/Significance: Under a uniform 28 m/s easterly wind forcing in the reconstructed model basin, the ocean model produces an area of exposed mud flats where the river mouth opens into the lake. This land bridge is 3 – 4 km long and 5 km wide, and it remains open for 4 hours. Model results indicate that navigation in shallow-water harbors can b...|$|E
40|$|The {{motions of}} (LNG) vessels moored {{offshore}} at depths ranging from about 20 to 100 m may depend significantly {{on the presence}} of (bound) low-frequency waves with periods in the order of 100 s. This is because these moored vessels show a large motion response in this frequency range and because the energy contents of low-frequency waves at these ‘intermediate’ depths is relatively large. As part of the Joint Industry Project HawaI, the operational Boussinesq-type wave model of Deltares, TRITON, was used to investigate whether this type of wave models could predict bound low-frequency waves (<b>setdown</b> waves) at intermediate depths. Comparison to measured and theoretical data, however, showed an underestimation of the computed levels of bound low-frequency wave heights for this depth range by a factor 2 to 4...|$|E
40|$|The rental fleet {{scheduling}} problem (RFSP) arises in vehicle-rental operations {{that offer a}} wide variety of vehicle types to customers, and allow a rented vehicle to &# 039;migrate&# 039; to a <b>setdown</b> depot other than the pickup depot. When {{there is a shortage of}} vehicles of a particular type at a depot, vehicles may be relocated to that depot, or vehicles of similar types may be substituted. The RFSP involves assigning vehicles to rentals so as to minimise the costs of these operations, and arises in both static and online contexts. The authors have adapted a well-known assignment algorithm for application in the online context. In addition, a network-flow algorithm with more comprehensive coverage of problem conditions is used to investigate the determination of rental pricing using revenue management principles.

40|$|The second-order, three-dimensional, finite-depth wave {{theory is}} here used to {{investigate}} the statistical properties of the surface elevation and wave crests of field data from Lake George, Australia. A direct comparison of experimental and numerical data shows that, {{as long as the}} nonlinearity is small, the second-order model describes the statistical properties of field data very accurately. By low-pass filtering the Lake George time series, there is evidence that some energetic wave groups are accompanied by a setup instead of a <b>setdown.</b> A numerical study of the coupling coefficient of the second-order model reveals that such an experimental result is consistent with the second-order theory, provided directional spreading is included in the wave spectrum. In particular, the coupling coefficient of the second-order difference contribution predicts a setup {{as a result of the}} interaction of two waves with the same frequency but with different directions. This result is also confirmed by numerical simulations. Bispectral analysis, furthermore, indicates that this setup is a statistically significant feature of the observed wave records. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work aims at {{assessing}} {{the influence of}} water depth on the potential flow solution for a semisubersible floating offshore wind turbine. More specifically, the system developed for the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration Continuation (OC 4) of the Inter- national Energy Agency IEA was considered for this paper. This work has been inspired by previous studies concerning the effect of shallow water on Liquified Natural Gas Carriers (LNGC). The influence of water depth on the hydrodynamics of such systems is evident from measurements {{as well as from}} simulations, specifically when secondary effects in the wave and flow modelling are addressed. This scenario has motivated the comparative study for the Floating Wind Turbine herein reported, also taking into account second order hydrodynamics (Quadratic Transfer Functions, QTF) as well as low frequency contribution in the incoming wave, due to shallow water (<b>Setdown</b> effect). The simulations were conducted relying on the codes DIFFRAC and aNySIM, de- veloped at Maritime Research Institute of Netherlands (MARIN) and the results are presented for a range of water depth between the nominal value of 200 m and the extreme shallow water of 30 m...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWind {{plays an}} {{important}} role in regulating mixing/stratification, estuarine circulation, and transport timescale in estuaries. A three-dimensional model was used to investigate the effect of wind on transport time by using the concept of water age (WA) in the tidal Rappahannock River, a western tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. The model was calibrated for water level, current, and salinity. A series of experiments regarding the effects of wind on WA was conducted under various dynamic conditions. The effect of wind on transport timescale depends strongly on the competition between the wind and buoyancy forcings, and on the pre-status of the circulation. A down-estuary wind generally decreases WA along the estuary. An up-estuary wind increases WA substantially because it changes the vertical mixing and estuarine circulation more significantly. When the buoyancy forcing increases, the up-estuary wind effect decreases whereas the down-estuary wind effect increases. A 2 -day period wind pulse with a maximum speed of 15 ms can alter WA for 3 days; but the wind influence on WA lasts up to 40 days in the simulation. Both local and non-local wind forcings alter WA distribution. The local wind enhances vertical mixing and changes the gravitational circulation in the downstream portion of the estuary whereas it enhances transport in the freshwater portion of the estuary. Consequently, the local wind has a significant impact on WA distribution. In contrast, the non-local wind does not change the gravitational circulation significantly by imposing setup (<b>setdown)</b> of water level at the open boundary, resulting in a lesser impact on WA distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} waves, wind, and {{bathymetry}} on tidal and subtidal hydrodynamics at unstratified, shallow New River Inlet, NC, are evaluated using field observations and numerical simulations. Tidal flows are ebb-dominated (- 1. 5 to 0. 6 m/s, positive is inland) inside the main (2 to 5 m deep) channel on the (1 to 2 m deep) ebb shoal, owing to inflow and outflow asymmetry at the inlet mouth. Ebb-dominance of the flows is reduced during large waves (> 1 m) owing to breaking-induced onshore momentum flux. Shoaling and breaking of large waves cause depression (<b>setdown,</b> offshore of the ebb shoal) and super-elevation (setup, on the shoal {{and in the}} inlet) of the mean water levels, resulting in changes to the cross-shoal pressure gradient, which can weaken onshore flows. At a 90 -degree bend 800 -m inland of the inlet mouth, centrifugal acceleration owing to curvature drives two-layered cross-channel flows (0. 1 to 0. 2 m/s) with surface flows going away from and bottom flows going toward the bend. The depth-averaged dynamics are tidally asymmetric. Subtidal cross-channel flows are correlated (r² > 0. 5) with cross-channel wind speed, suggesting that winds are enhancing and degrading the local-curvature induced two-layer flow, and driving three-layer flow. by Anna Wargula.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{campaign is}} {{reported on the}} slow-drift motion of a rectangular barge moored at different positions along an inclined beach, at waterdepths ranging from 54 cm to 21 cm, and submitted to irregular beam seas. The beach is achieved by inclining the 24 m long false bottom of the tank at a slope of 5 %, from a depth of 1. 05 m. The slow-drift component of the measured sway motion is first compared with state-of-the-art calculations based on Newman's approximation. At 54 cm depth a good agreement is obtained between calculations and measurements. At 21 cm depth the Newman calculations exceed the measured values. When the flat bottom <b>setdown</b> contribution is added up, the calculated values become 2 to 3 {{times larger than the}} measured ones. A second-order model is proposed to predict the shoaling of a bichromatic sea-state propagating in varying water-depth. This model is validated through comparisons with an extension of Schaffer's model for a straight beach [Schaffer HA. Infragravity waves induced by short-wave groups.) Fluid Mech 1993; 247 : 551 - 88] and with a fully nonlinear Boussinesq model. It appears that the long wave amplitude is much less than predicted by the flat bottom model, and that its phase difference with the short wave envelope also deviates from the flat bottom model prediction. As a result of this phase shift the actual second-order wave loads can be lower than predicted by Newman's approximation alone. Application of the shoaling model to the barge tests yields a notably better agreement between numerical and experimental values of its slow-drift sway motion...|$|E
40|$|The Ocean Turbulence Laboratory in the Oceanography Department at the Naval Postgraduate School has {{an active}} {{research}} program addressing {{a range of}} ocean turbulent boundary layer problems. The group has developed observational systems for studying sub-ice boundary layers in polar regions, coastal internal waves, solitons and turbulence over the continental shelf, and the wave forced boundary bottom boundary layer over the inner shelf and surf zone. Three instrument systems were successfully deployed at Duck NC during the ONR-sponsored SANDYDUCK experiment. A cross shore pressure array and manometer system were used to study wave transformation as waves break across the barred beach, and the resulting <b>setdown</b> and setup on the mean cross-shore water levels. Detailed sand morphology measurements were being made on 5 cm to 10 m scales using an array of eight acoustic altimeters mounted on the Army Corps of Enginners CRAB vehicle, to extend the large scale morpholgy measurements made by the CRAB each day. These sediment morphology surveys across the 1 km cross-shore by 2 km longshore study area were made in conjunction with detailed morphology and bottom boundary layer measurements made from an instrumented sled which was moved from beyond the offshore bar to the beach face each day. The sled also measured the vertical structure of the water column to study the mean velocity structure responding to breaking waves, bottom stress, and wind forcing, {{and the depth of}} influence of turbulence generated by breaking waves. Bottom stress, dissipation and sediment suspension processes were studied with the Bistatic Coherent Doppler Velocimeter which measured cm scale three component velocity and sediment concentration profiles from the bed to a height of 60 cm...|$|E
40|$|This {{report to}} the National Energy Board {{presents}} a compendium of ice loading events experienced by the Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. offshore platform "Molikpaq". To date, the primary interest in the Molikpaq has focused on a single event (the 0800 hr ice loading event on April 12 th, 1986 at Amauligak I- 65) which has perhaps led to some unbalanced views about {{the response of the}} Molikpaq during its four deployments in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. The intent of this report is to make the ice mechanics community more aware of the range of ice-structure interactions and ice load levels that the Molikpaq has experienced during the four winter deployments. Four winters of operation at four different locations have produced an enormous amount of data, far more than can be realistically used within a research context. However, much of the ice interaction data are similar. An objective of the work carried out for this report was to review the available information and filter out about 30 days with events which capture the key aspects of Molikpaq icestructure interaction and for which the available information is suitable for further research use. Icestructure interaction events where ice failed directly against the caisson are of most interest and are available from the first two deployments at Tarsiut P- 45 in 1984 / 85 and at Amauligak I- 65 in 1985 / 86. At these locations the Molikpaq was deployed at a <b>setdown</b> draft of 19. 5 metres, which resulted in no permanent accumulation of rubble ice around the caisson. A total of 10 operating days at Tarsiut P- 45 and 19 operating days at Amauligak I- 65 have been selected that contain representative periods with both ice documentation and Molikpaq instrumentation response data. A further objective {{of this study is to}} summarize how the reported loads were derived from the sensor data, and to address concerns about potential structural resonance and overall load estimate accuracy. The Molikpaq was deployed for hydrocarbon exploration and the acquisition of the ice structure interaction data was peripheral to its principal activity which was oil drilling. One consequence of this is that the extent of the sensor arrays and the completeness of the ice documentation was pragmatic, and perhaps less complete than ice researchers might wish. This in turn has led to some uncertainty over the magnitude of reported ice loads on the Molikpaq, which has been exacerbated by the divergent views on ice loads within the ice community. Therefore, this report presents an overview of how ice loads have been calculated and importantly identifies the traceability of these reported loads to reference calibrations. To provide researchers with confidence in their understanding of the data, a computer program running under the Microsoft Windows environment was developed to read and process the information obtained from the Molikpaq data acquisition system. The program, called DynaMAC, operates on the Molikpaq data sets which have been transferred from the original HP format to the industry-standard MS-DOS form and duplicates much of the functionality of the software developed by Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. Default calibration factors in DynaMAC correspond to values used for the Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. sponsored Dynamics Project and as such, this software provides a starting point for researchers to verify data records by reproducing the ice load plots previously reported. The program DynaMAC was further developed to provide a means of accessing a database that contains the ice documentation, and site photography from the Amauligak I- 65 ice events. This information, together with data on sensor status and location, availability of video records, and the response data has been stored on a CD-ROM, as illustrated below.
