5|$|NSB soon bought all {{the shares}} of the company, and also made an {{agreement}} that operations on the Arendal Line would {{be taken over by}} Timetoget. However, the new company tried to take a <b>short-cut</b> in giving engineers only a six-week training program, instead of the usual 18 months. This made NSB want to discontinue operations. They bought {{out the rest of the}} shareholders, and liquidated the company. Timetoget never ran anything but trials on the Bratsberg Line.|$|E
5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard <b>short-cut</b> to control multimedia, and removing the embedded numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a <b>short-cut</b> usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E

We are interested in <b>short-cutting</b> graphs while keeping degree increases bounded, a problem first posed by Chung and Garey. We prove sharp bounds for the problem, both in general and for special classes of graphs. Shortcutting with a degree constraint is proved to be NP-complete and W 2 -hard.

5|$|The Syriac, Jonah, who {{had helped}} Khalid enter the city by the East Gate, showed him a <b>short-cut</b> to Antioch. Leading a cavalry regiment, Khalid caught up with a convoy of Byzantine {{refugees}} from Damascus at the sea, near Antioch. The three-day truce had passed; Khalid's cavalry attacked the convoy during a heavy rain. In the subsequent battle, Khalid reportedly killed both Thomas and Harbees in a duel. After the Battle, known as the Battle of Marj-ud-Deebaj (Battle of Brocade Meadow), the Muslims took {{a great amount of}} brocade as booty. In addition, Thomas' wife, the daughter of Heraclius, was captured. According to chronicles, the Greek man Jonah, who guided Khalid on the short cut to Antioch, got his fiance, but she committed suicide. Khalid offered Jonah the daughter of Emperor Heraclius, whom he refused. Khalid sent her back to her father. Jonah died two years later in the Battle of Yarmuk.|$|E

This was the fate of Grange Road, the site of which is now covered by shops and housing, and by Forest Row which was sold to a club for £4,000, and is now part of a light industrial development. The redundant East Grinstead High Level station was demolished by BR in 1970, it had been used by passengers as a <b>short-cut</b> to the Low Level station and, following passenger complaints, BR was obliged to provide a footbridge to reinstate the <b>short-cut.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{norm for}} landing at Fornebu was to {{rendezvous}} with a radio beacon, Rumba, and conduct a fifteen-degree left turn {{for about half}} a minute. The aircraft would then be aligned with the 06 runway and could glide down following the instrument landing system (ILS). This maneuver would nominally take place {{at an altitude of}} 1,100meters (3,500ft). However, in clear weather the pilots often opted for a <b>short-cut</b> to reach the approach path more quickly. Because of the topography, it was possible that the ILS beams would deviate up to twenty-five degrees, which could cause the pilots to turn the aircraft too early and would cause the aircraft to fly over a range of hills on the wrong heading. This was a known fault with the system and pilots would therefore check the direction of the radio beacon at Asker to ensure they were in the correct position. This <b>short-cut</b> was carried out by Flight 239.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 another waterway, the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal (MRGO), was {{completed}} and began using Industrial Lock.

He collapsed on February 17, 2003 while pitching, and was soon pronounced dead. Bechler's death raised concerns over the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball.

25|$|Ulster Volunteers {{preparations}} for civil war were <b>short-cut</b> by {{the outbreak of}} the First World War. Hacket Pain re-enlisted in the British Army, and raised the 108th Infantry Brigade (part of the 36th (Ulster) Division) by recruiting the Ulster Volunteers. The Army welcomed the fact that the Volunteers were trained and armed, and Hacket Pain was appointed on 4 September to command the 108th Infantry Brigade in France. After two years he transferred back to Ireland to command the Northern Ireland district, where he served for three years.|$|E
25|$|The pilots took a <b>short-cut</b> during {{approach}} on runway 06 at Fornebu. Combined with false {{signals from the}} instrument landing system (ILS), this caused the pilots to misunderstand their location. This in turn led them to take an incorrect landing path, causing the plane to hit ground in a hilly area. The rescue operation was initiated almost immediately, but it took {{six and a half}} hours to find the aircraft. Three years later, the investigation commission concluded that various measures should be put in place to improve navigation, to avoid similar situations in which pilots misunderstood their location.|$|E
25|$|The HUD {{has also}} been altered. Egosoft removed {{non-functional}} internal cockpit graphics, giving the player a largely unobstructed view of space. There are now markers over game objects such as ships, stations and large asteroids, and each object is selectable by a simple mouse click, or through a keyboard or controller. X3 uses a new interface designed to be faster, more user friendly, and compatible with a console controller. The game carries over {{many of the same}} <b>short-cut</b> keys from previous games, but now the mouse too can be used for functions including menu navigation, target selection, flying and combat.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{renormalization}} group (RG) theory applied to complex networks are useful to classify network topologies into universality {{classes in the}} space of configurations. The RG flow readily identifies a small-world/fractal transition by finding (i) a trivial stable fixed point of a complete graph, (ii) a non-trivial point of a pure fractal topology that is stable or unstable according to the amount of long-range links in the network, and (iii) another stable point of a fractal with <b>short-cuts</b> that exists exactly at the small-world/fractal transition. As a collateral, the RG technique explains the coexistence of the seemingly contradicting fractal and small-world phases and allows to extract information on the distribution of <b>short-cuts</b> in real-world networks, a problem of importance for information flow in the system...|$|R

40|$|We {{study in}} detail the role of <b>short-cuts</b> in {{promoting}} the emergence of cooperation in a network of agents playing the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). We introduce a model whose topology interpolates between the one-dimensional euclidean lattice (a ring) and the complete graph by changing the value of one parameter (the probability p to add a link between two nodes not already connected in the euclidean configuration). We {{show that there is}} a region of values of p in which cooperation is largely enhanced, whilst for smaller values of p only a few cooperators are present in the final state, and for p → 1 - cooperation is totally suppressed. We present analytical arguments that provide a very plausible interpretation of the simulation results, thus unveiling the mechanism by which <b>short-cuts</b> contribute to promote (or suppress) cooperation...|$|R
25|$|By 1872 the {{disagreement}} over an interior or coastal route was raging and a compromise was proposed {{in which the}} line would be built with two branches. The government recommended a twin-armed line on 5 April 1873 and was approved in Parliament on 5 June. Detailed surveying was led by Carl Abraham Pihl and concluded on 31 March 1874. He wanted the route to take the shortest possible way from Askim to Rakkestad, bypassing Mysen. The <b>short-cut</b> was not endorsed by Parliament. With increasing cost estimates, Parliament decided to reduce the standard on the Eastern Line. The line was approved with 59 against 42 votes in Parliament on 4 June 1874.|$|E

25|$|Hydration and {{hardening}} {{of concrete}} {{during the first}} three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses {{at a time when it}} has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of <b>short-cut</b> polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.|$|E
25|$|The roads have {{reverted to}} their {{previous}} 'heavily restricted' status. There is still considerable car traffic {{into and out}} of the park, mainly of families with children, dog walkers, kite/model aeroplane fliers and other recreational use. However, cross-park 'through traffic' is now completely blocked by sturdy gates across the main link roads, similar to the existing gates at all road entrances and exits, that open and close with dusk and dawn. This measure has significantly reduced the use of the park as a rush-hour <b>short-cut</b> (notably between Boldmere and Streetly), with some noticeable impact on congestion of local routes around the Park. The benefit of traffic restriction is improvement in the enjoyability of the park; with cleaner air, safer roads for walkers and cyclists, and much reduced visual and noise pollution, plus reduced wear and tear on the poorly maintained, decaying road surfaces.|$|E
