40|$|The large use of {{nitrogen}} (N) and the finite nature of global phosphorus (P) resources {{have led to}} increasing concerns about balancing agronomic, environmental and economic gains from N and P use on dairy farms. Nitrogen and P inputs, {{in the form of}} fertiliser and concentrates, are key drivers of increased herbage yields and milk <b>saleable</b> <b>output</b> on most dairy farms. However, N and P inputs typically exceed N and P outputs in milk and livestock exported off the farms. Increased N and P use efficiency (NUE and PUE) may be considered as a strategy to reduce the expenditures on the main N and P inputs on dairy farms. Data from a 3 year (2009 - 2011) survey were used to assess farm-gate N and P balances and NUE and PUE on 21 intensive grass-based dairy farms operating under the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) regulations in Ireland, as well as the economic implications of NUE and PUE on 19 of these farms and the sensitivity of net profit to changes in milk and fertiliser N prices. Comparative profitability and sensitivity to changes in milk and fertiliser N prices of ten N fertilised grass (FN) and eight grass-white clover-based (WC) dairy systems were also investigated. Mean balances for the 21 farms were 175 kg N ha- 1 and 5. 09 kg P ha- 1, respectively, or 0. 28 kg N kg MS- 1 (milk solids), and 0. 004 kg P kg MS- 1, respectively. Mean NUE was 0. 23 and mean PUE was 0. 70. Comparison to similar studies carried out before the introduction of the GAP regulations in 2006 indicates that N and P balances have significantly decreased (by 40 and 74 %, respectively) and NUE and PUE increased (by 27 % and 48 %, respectively), mostly due to decreased inorganic fertiliser input and a notable shift towards spring application of organic manures. Mean net profit was € 598 ha- 1 and was driven mainly by milk receipts {{and to a lesser extent}} by expenditure on mineral fertilisers. Net profit was indirectly related to N and P surplus and N and P use efficiency. The results of this study generally indicate that Irish dairy farms, as low input production systems, have the potential to achieve both economic (as indicated by net profit per ha) and environmental (as indicated by N and P balances per ha, N and P use efficiency and N-eco-efficiency) sustainability. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that milk price was the main driver for changes in net profit between 2009 and 2011 both in high and low milk price situations investigated across nine price scenarios. Net profit was similar for FN and WC (€ 1, 274 ha- 1) mainly due to € 148 ha- 1 lower expenditure on mineral N fertiliser on WC. Net profit of WC was found to be comparably less sensitive than FN in low milk price situations. A wider adoption of WC on farms offers potential to meet the twin goals of a sustainable income for dairy farmers in the context of rising fertiliser N price while decreasing N surpluses on pasture-based dairy farms...|$|E

40|$|When formulating least-cost poultry diets, ME {{concentration}} {{should be}} optimised by an iterative procedure, not entered as a fixed value. This iteration must calculate profit margins by {{taking into account}} the way in which feed intake and <b>saleable</b> <b>outputs</b> vary with ME concentration. In the case of broilers, adjustment of critical amino acid contents in direct proportion to ME concentration does not result in birds of equal fatness. To avoid an increase in fat deposition at higher energy levels, it is proposed that amino acid specifications should be adjusted in proportion to changes in the net energy supplied by the feed. A model is available which will both interpret responses to amino acids in laying trials and give economically optimal estimates of amino acid inputs for practical feed formulation. Flocks coming into lay and flocks nearing the end of the pullet year have bimodal distributions of rates of lay, with the result that calculations of requirement based on mean output will underestimate the optimal amino acid input for the flock. Chick diets containing surplus protein can lead to impaired utilisation of the first-limiting amino acid. This difficulty can be avoided by stating amino acid requirements as a proportion of the protein...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the nature of competition for private donations that occurs between not-for-profit organisations (NPOs). This competition occurs because NPOs do not produce commercially viable outputs and therefore rely on donations. The financial sustainability of NPOs is problematic, both individually and in economy-wide terms, as they do not produce commercial <b>saleable</b> <b>outputs.</b> Instead they raise funds by either relying on government grants or competing for private donations. Sustainability of NPOs becomes an even greater issue when governments reduce their grant-giving in times of stress - precisely the time when calls on NPOs' resources increase. Design/methodology/approach - The research asks the question, do donation-raising expenditures by NPOs increase donations or do they damagingly divert donations from other NPOs? Using Australian data, competition between NPOs for donations is analysed using a modified oligopoly market model. NPO fundraising expenditures are central to this model, but other factors, including unpaid-volunteers, organisational size and age, are also explanatory variables in determining success in fundraising. NPOs concerned with human welfare, other than specialised aged care, are the primary focus of this paper, although other NPOs such as those concerned with animal welfare, science and the arts are also modelled. Findings - Crucially an NPO's fundraising expenditure has a direct and positive impact on its level of donations. A major influence on level of donations is the presence of volunteers within an NPO. There seems to be an interesting reciprocal relationship between the effect of size and age of organisations on their donations and the effect on fundraising. Critically for sustainability, NPOs competing for funds are established as having a negative effect on the level of donations to other NPOs with similar functions. Originality/value - It is believed that the material used here represents one of the first studies of financial sustainability of NPOs and highlights the value of both accounting and economic analysis of organisations' operations. Financial sustainability issues are compounded by the existence of competition for funds among charities operating in the same areas (Parsons, 2003; Trussel and Greenlee, 2004; Trussel and Parsons, 2008); it has been argued that competition for funds diminishes sustainability (Lyons, 2001; Weerawandena et al., 2010).

40|$|Introduction The {{conceptual}} field of governance has grown partly as an acknowledgement of major gaps in traditional treatments of development policy and management. We see the insufficiency of focusing only on government as the State; {{and the need}} for a wider perspective of governance, understood as the ‘array of ways in which interplay between the State, the market, and society is ordered’ (‘Insights’, 23 Sept. 1997, IDS Sussex). And we realize now how ineffective or disaster-prone public policy can be when key factors conducive to effective policy formation and implementation are absent, including sufficient political legitimacy and accountability, an adequately functioning legal apparatus, systems for public expression and social learning, and peace rather than war. A governance perspective brings an expectation of a more complex approach to policy evaluation than approaches which assume no substantial interplay between State, market and society; more complex, for example, than the assessment of projects with <b>saleable</b> inputs and <b>outputs</b> as if market-based or market-inspired criteria suffice. Similarly, the significance of legitimacy, accountability and public feedback have implications for the content and procedural design of policy evaluation...|$|R
