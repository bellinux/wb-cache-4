40|$|Abstract — System {{monitoring}} {{can help}} to detect abnormalities and avoid failures. Crafting monitors for today’s robotic systems, however, can be very difficult due to the systems’ inherent complexity. In this work we address this challenge through an approach that automatically infers system invariants and synthesizes those invariants into monitors. The approach is novel in that it derives invariants by observing the messages passed between system nodes and the invariants types are tailored to match the spatial, temporal, and operational attributes of robotic systems. Further, the generated monitor can be <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> into <b>systems</b> built on top of publishsubscribe architectures. An application of the technique on a system consisting of a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing on a moving platform shows that it can significantly {{reduce the number of}} crashes in unexpected landing scenarios.

40|$|Methods for {{triangle}} mesh decimation are common; however, most existing techniques operate only on static geometry. In this paper, {{we present a}} view- and pose-independent method for the automatic simplification of skeletally articulated meshes. Such meshes have associated kinematic skeletons {{that are used to}} control their deformation, with the position of each vertex influenced by a linear combination of bone transformations. Our method extends the commonly-used quadric error metric by incorporating knowledge of potential poses into a probability function. We minimize the average error of the deforming mesh over all possible configurations, weighted by the probability. This is possible by transforming the quadrics from each configuration into a common coordinate system. Our simplification algorithm runs as a preprocess, and the resulting meshes can be <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> into existing <b>systems.</b> We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for generating highly-simplified models while preserving necessary detail in deforming regions near joints...|$|R

This article describes an architecture for self-managing evolvable assembly systems. It involves on-the-fly self-assembly of robotic modules, dynamic coordination of tasks and self-adaptation to production conditions, mainly self-healing and self-optimisation.

40|$|Whole image {{descriptors}} {{have recently}} {{been shown to be}} remarkably robust to perceptual change especially compared to local features. However, whole-image-based localization systems typically rely on heuristic methods for determining appropriate matching thresholds in a particular environment.

In this paper we present a Bayesian model of probability for whole-image descriptors that can be <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> into localization <b>systems</b> designed for probabilistic visual input. We demonstrate this method using CAT-Graph, an appearance-based visual localization system originally designed for a FAB-MAP-style probabilistic input. We show that using whole-image descriptors as visual input extends CAT-Graph’s functionality to environments that experience a greater amount of perceptual change. We also present a method of estimating whole-image probability models in an online manner, removing the need for a prior training phase. We show that this online, automated training method can perform comparably to pre-trained, manually tuned local descriptor methods...|$|R

40|$|Production {{planning}} and scheduling {{is a long}} standing research area of great practical value, while industrial demand for production {{planning and}} scheduling systems is acute. Regretfully, most research results are seldom applied in industry because existing planning and scheduling methods can barely meet the requirements for practical applications. This paper identifies four major requirements, namely generality, solution quality, computation efficiency, and implementation difficulty, for practical production planning and scheduling methods. Based on these requirements, method, a multi-agent based beam search (MABBS), is developed. It <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrates</b> the multi-agent <b>system</b> (MAS) method and beam search (BS) method into a generic multi-stage multi-level decision making (MSMLDM) model to systematically address all the four requirements within a unified framework.

For solving complex real-world problems, an MABBS-based prototype production planning, scheduling and execution system is developed.

40|$|Real-world camera {{networks}} are often characterized by very wide baselines covering {{a wide range}} of viewpoints. We describe a method not only calibrating each camera se-quence added to the system automatically, but also taking advantage of multi-view correspondences to make the en-tire calibration framework more robust. Novel camera se-quences can be <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> into the <b>system</b> at any time, adding to the robustness of future computations. One of the challenges consists in establishing correspon-dences between cameras. Initializing a bag of features from a calibrated frame, correspondences between cameras are established in a two-step procedure. First, affine invariant features of camera sequences are warped into a common coordinate frame and a coarse matching is obtained be-tween the collected features and the incrementally built and updated bag of features. This allows us to warp images to a common view. Second, scale invariant features are ex-tracted from the warped images. This leads to both more numerous and more accurate correspondences. Finally, the parameters are optimized in a bundle adjustment. Adding the feature descriptors and the optimized 3 D positions to the bag of features, we obtain a feature-based scene ab-straction, allowing for the calibration of novel sequences and the correction of drift in single-view calibration track-ing. We demonstrate that our approach can deal with wide baselines. Novel sequences can <b>seamlessly</b> be <b>integrated</b> in the calibration framework. 1. Introduction and Relate...|$|R
40|$|A novel neutron {{detector}} {{is based}} on semiconductor technology. A boron-containing film {{is an integral part}} of the semiconductor device and is in physical contact with the charge-storage medium (CSM). The CSM is a proprietary cell design known as MirrorBit{trademark}, which is different from conventional memory designs such as SRAM or DRAM. The design doubles the resolution and sensitivity in the array. This enables a highly effective detection of the secondary particles, {sup 7 }Li and {sup 4 }He, produced due to neutron capture by {sup 10 }B in the device. Other approaches using semiconductor materials for neutron detection have employed single-diode detectors that require off-system preamplifiers to filter and condition the signal.

40|$|Message Passing Interface (MPI) {{point-to-point}} communications {{are usually}} realized with two protocols, the eager protocol for small messages and the rendezvous protocol for medium and large sized messages. Traditional senderinitiated rendezvous protocols are sub-optimal in many situations. In this work, we propose {{to refine the}} rendezvous protocol for medium and large messages on RDMA-enabled clusters with three protocols that are customized for different situations, a hybrid protocol for medium sized messages when the sender arrives early, a sender-initiated protocol for large messages when the sender arrives early, and a receiver-initiated protocol when the receiver arrives early. In comparison to traditional sender-initiated rendezvous protocols, the proposed scheme reduces unnecessary synchronizations, decreases the number of control messages {{that are in the}} critical path of communications, and improves the communication progress, which results in a significantly better communication-computation overlap capability. We present and analyze these protocols, and describe how these protocols and the eager protocol can be <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> in one <b>system</b> without introducing an excessive number of control messages.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{computational}} model for shape, illumination and albedo inference in a pulsed time-of-flight (TOF) camera. In contrast to TOF cameras based on phase modulation, our camera enables general exposure profiles. This results in added flexibility and requires novel computational approaches. To address this challenge we propose a generative probabilistic model that accurately relates latent imaging conditions to observed camera responses. While principled, realtime inference {{in the model}} {{turns out to be}} infeasible, and we propose to employ efficient non-parametric regression trees to approximate the model outputs. As a result we are able to provide, for each pixel, at video frame rate, estimates and uncertainty for depth, effective albedo, and ambient light intensity. These results we present are state-of-the-art in depth imaging. The flexibility of our approach allows us to easily enrich our generative model. We demonstrate that by extending the original single-path model to a two-path model, capable of describing some multipath effects. The new model is <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> in the <b>system</b> at no additional computational cost.

40|$|Abstract As {{networked}} sensors {{become increasingly}} {{connected to the}} Internet, RFID or barcode-tagged objects are likely to follow the same trend. The EPC Network {{is a set of}} standards to build a global network for such electronically tagged goods and objects. Amongst these standards, the Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) specifies interfaces to capture and query RFID events from external applications. The query interface, implemented via SOAP-based Web services, enables business applications to consume and share data beyond companies borders and forms a global network of independent EPCIS instances. However, the interface limits the application space to the rather powerful platforms which understand WS- * Web services. In this chapter we introduce tools and patterns for Webenabling real-world information systems advertising WS- * interfaces. We describe our approach to <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrate</b> RFID information <b>systems</b> into the Web by designing a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) architecture for the EPCIS.

40|$|Streaming video over IP is {{studied by}} {{integrating}} the error resilient scalable source codec with constant quality rate adaptation and prioritized network transmission. The scalable codec {{is based on}} the standardized ISO/IEC MPEG- 4 fine granular scalable (FGS) coding scheme, which allows arbitrary truncation according to the given rate budget. To maximize the end-to-end visual quality, constant quality video rate control (CQVRC) is proposed to preserve smooth video quality when there is a significant amount of variation in the video source, the available bandwidth or both. The proposed CQVRC attempts to provide smooth video quality for both the base layer (BL) and the enhancement layer (EL). The video stream is then prioritized for priority dropping, where rate adaptation is dynamically performed to meet the time-varying available bandwidth. This kind of prioritized stream can benefit from QoS networks such as the IP differentiated service (DiffServ). All key components, including FGS encoding, CQVRC based rate adaptation and packetization, error resilient decoding, and differentiated forwarding, are <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> into one <b>system.</b> By focusing on the end-to-end quality, we set both source and network parameters properly to achieve a superior performance of FGS video streaming.
