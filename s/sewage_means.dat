40|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{emission}} in sewer {{systems is}} associated with toxicity, corrosion, odour nuisance and high costs treatment. In this study, a novel method to inhibit sulfide generation from <b>sewage</b> by <b>means</b> of glutaraldehyde supplementation has been suggested and evaluated under anaerobic conditions. Different concentrations of glutaraldehyde at 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg·L− 1 have been investigated. Besides, the possible impacts of glutaraldehyde supplementation on an activated sludge system and an appraisal of the economic aspects are presented as well. As observed from the experimental results, a dosage of 20 mg·L− 1 glutaraldehyde resulted in a significant decrease of the sulfide production by 70 %– 80 % in the simulated sewage. Moreover, the impacts of additional glutaraldehyde at 20 mg·L− 1 on activated sludge, in terms of chemical oxygen demand removal and oxygen uptake rates, were negligible. From an economical point of view, {{the cost of the}} commercial glutaraldehyde products required in the operation, which was calculated on the basis of activated sulfide removal avoidance, was around € 3. 7 – 4. 6 S·kg− 1. Therefore it is suggested that glutaraldehyde supplementation is a feasible technique to abate the sulfide problems in sewer systems.

40|$|Vancomycin-resistant enterococcci (VRE) in Europe {{are thought}} to have emerged partly due {{to the use of the}} {{glycopeptide}} avoparcin in animal husbandry. We compared the occurrence of VRE in geographical regions of Europe in which until 1997 large amounts of avoparcin were used (Spain, United Kingdom, and Denmark) with the occurrence of VRE in Sweden, where avoparcin was banned in 1986. We also studied the relatedness between VRE strains from different regions and habitats. In total, 2, 580 samples were collected from humans, animals, and the environment (soil, sewage, recipient water). VRE resistant to 20 μg/ml vancomycin were identified in 8. 2 % of the samples and were found most frequently in raw and treated urban <b>sewage</b> samples (<b>means,</b> 71 % and 36 % of the samples, respectively), pig manure (17 %), and hospital sewage (16 %). The proportions of VRE-positive sewage samples were similar in Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom, whereas pig feces and manure were more often positive in Spain than in Sweden (30 % versus 1 %). Most VRE were Enterococcus faecium carrying vanA, and computerized biochemical phenotyping of the isolates of different ecological origins showed a high degree of polyclonality. In conclusion, it seems that animal-associated VRE probably reflect the former use of avoparcin in animal production, whereas VRE in human-associated samples may be a result of antibiotic use in hospitals. Since there seems to be a reservoir of the resistance genes in all countries studied, precautions must be taken to limit the use of antibiotics and antibiotic-like feed additives...|$|R

The purpose {{of this research is}} to characterize the {{flow characteristics}} of <b>sewage</b> by experimental <b>means.</b> A sophisticated and flexible experimental apparatus was designed and constructed.

Results indicated that raw sewage could be characterized as a power-law fluid with the rheological exponent n being 0. 891 and the rheological coefficient k being 0. 00175. In addition, the frictional loss factor formula in laminar flow for raw sewage was deduced by theoretical analysis of the power-law fluid. Furthermore, an explicit empirical formula for the frictional loss factor in turbulent flow was obtained through curve fitting of the experimental data. Finally, the equivalent viscosity of the raw sewage is defined in order to calculate the Reynolds number in turbulent flow regions; it was found that sewage had two to three times the viscosity of water at the same temperature. These results contributed to appropriate parameters of fluid properties when designing and operating sewage-source heat pump systems...|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{technology}} {{is based on}} differential air pressure. Rotary vane vacuum pumps generate an operation pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar at the vacuum station, {{which is also the}} only element of the vacuum sewerage system that must be supplied with electricity. Interface valves, that are installed inside the collection chambers, work pneumatically. <b>Sewage</b> flows by <b>means</b> of gravity from each house into a collection sump that might collect sewage from 2-6 houses and is located in public area. After a certain fill level inside this sump is reached, the interface valve opens. The impulse to open the valve is usually transferred by a pneumatically (pneumatic pressure created by fill level) controlled controller unit. No electricity is needed to open or close the valve. The energy is provided by the vacuum itself. While the valve is open, the resulting differential pressure between atmosphere and vacuum becomes the driving force and transports the wastewater towards the vacuum station. Besides these collection chambers, no other manholes, neither for changes in direction, nor for inspection or connection of branch lines, are necessary. High flow velocities keep the system free of any blockages or sedimentation.|$|R

The rates of growth and reproduction of P. excavatus, on a variety of organic wastes, were evaluated in these experiments. The time of maturation and the rates of growth of this species, under various population density pressures and temperatures between 15 7 C and 30 7 C, were also as-sessed.

A one-year study was performed with a total of 48 raw and treated sewage composite samples, which were collected biweekly from an activated sludge plant. Virus particles were concentrated by the adsorption-elution method using negatively charged membranes associated to a Centriprep Concentrator ® 50 (Nihon Millipore). HAstV were detected in 16. 7 % of the samples in raw and treated sewage by using both qualitative and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR and qPCR, respectively). Positive untreated <b>sewage</b> sample ex-hibited <b>mean</b> values of 1. 1 x 104 gEq/mL. The qPCR sensitivity was 18 gEq/reaction. Through utilization of qPCR, a HAstV recovery efficiency of 4. 2 % and 4. 3 % was demonstrated for raw and treated sewage samples, respectively. The presence of HAstV in both the raw and treated sewage samples demonstrated the dissemination of these viruses in the environment as well as viral permanence after sewage treatment.

This forest forms the landward boundary of the Buccoo Reef Marine Park in Southwest Tobago, and {{is part of a}} mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum. Biomass and productivity, as indicated by litterfall rates, were measured in seven 0. 01 ha monospecific plots from February 1998 to February 1999, and decomposition rates were determined. Red mangrove above-ground biomass ranged between 2. 0 and 25. 9 kg (dry wt.) m- 2. Mean biomass was 14. 1 ± 8. 1 kg (dry wt.) m- 2 yielding a standing crop of 11 318 ± 6 488 t. Litterfall rate varied spatially and seasonally. It peaked from May to August (4. 2 - 4. 3 g dry wt. m- 2 d- 1) and was lowest from October to December (2. 3 - 2. 8 g dry wt. m- 2 d- 1). Mean annual litterfall rate was 3. 4 ± 0. 9 g dry wt. m- 2 d- 1. Leaf degradation rates ranged from 0. 3 % loss d- 1 in the upper intertidal zone to 1 % loss d- 1 at a lower inter-tidal site flooded by <b>sewage</b> effluent. <b>Mean</b> degradation rate was 0. 4 ± 1 % loss d- 1. The swamp produces 2. 8 t dry wt. of litterfall and 12 kg dry wt. of decomposed leaf material daily. Biomass and litterfall rates in Bon Accord Lagoon were compared to five similar sites that also participate in the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity Programme (CARICOMP).

40|$|Growth and {{mortality}} {{of the three}} dominant coral species occurring in Kane'ohe Bay were determined for four periods from November 1991 to January 1993 at four stations in the bay's southeast basin. Twelve water quality parameters were monitored biweekly to monthly at these stations from November 1991 to August 1992. Both water quality measurements and coral survival and growth indicated considerable improvement to conditions that prevailed when treated sewage was discharged into this area of Kane'ohe Bay. Mean concentrations for orthophosphate, nitrite + nitrate, ammonia, and chlorophyll a, and mean values for light extinction and sedimentation were significantly less than those measured during time of sewage discharge in 19761977. Means {{of all of these}} except orthophosphate were not significantly different from means measured in 1978 - 1979 during the first year after <b>sewage</b> diversion. <b>Mean</b> orthophosphate concentration was approximately double the mean of the first year after diversion, and this increase may relate to increased abundances of the green macroalgae Dictyosphaeria cavernosa (Forskal) Boergesen that have been observed in this section of the bay in recent years. Montipora verrucosa (Lamarck) survived and grew well throughout the study period at all four stations, including stations in areas where rapid mortality and minimal growth occurred for this species in 1969 - 1971. The other two species, Porites compressa Dana and Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus), showed different survival and growth patterns according to station location. Most rapid mortality and lowest growth generally occurred for P. compressa at the station most affected by land runoff in the southernmost section of the bay. However, the major cause of early mortality and poor growth of Porites compressa at that location was the nudibranch Phestilla sibogae (Bergh), which rapidly consumed tissues of corals transplanted to that station, suggesting that predators that control P. sibogae parasitism elsewhere in the bay are absent from that area. Pocillopora damicornis survival and growth declined at all stations throughout the study, and this species may have been affected by fish predation.

40|$|The lower {{slope of}} the Mid-Levels area, Hong Kong, is one the most heavily {{urbanized}} coastal areas in the world. A comprehensive groundwater heavy metal and trace element {{study was conducted in}} the Mid-Levels area aiming to investigate the impacts of urbanization on the aqueous distributions of these chemicals. Groundwater samples were collected in the upper natural slopes and the lower highly urbanized spaces in the area in different seasons, and analyzed for heavy metal and trace element contents. Compared to the results from natural slopes, groundwater samples in the developed spaces did not exhibit significant elevated levels in Zn, Cr, Cu, Cd, Pb and Fe, which are commonly found in stormwater. On the other hand, the samples were found to have elevated contents in Mn, V, Co and Mo, minor stormwater-related heavy metals, suggesting that stormwater drains may be leaking to some extent. However, the results suggested that the vadose zone could remove many of the heavy metals, protecting groundwater from being contaminated seriously. Statistical analysis suggested that a certain amount of Mn and Co was likely to be re-mobilized from natural soils due to the changes in local redox conditions, while Mn, V, Co and Mo may also be derived from steel corrosion as a result of prolonged submergence. Besides, the average B concentration in the developed spaces was about eight times higher than that in the natural slopes, indicating the presence of <b>sewage.</b> The <b>mean</b> Se concentration in the developed spaces was about 100 times higher than that in the natural slopes. About 40 % of samples in the developed spaces contained Se level higher than the drinking water guideline value proposed by the World Health Organization. Se was found to be positively correlated with B and SO 4 2 - (R= 0. 534 and 0. 631, respectively), suggesting that Se may also be related to leakage from sewage pipes. Part of the Sr may come from leakage of flushing water and/or sewage as Sr was strongly correlated with Cl- (R= 0. 929). According to the measured results, deep groundwater samples collected from piezometers (> 10 m in depth) in the urbanized spaces appeared to be virtually free from any anthropogenic contaminations. This study may shed important light on the identification and evaluation of leakage from service pipes in a particular area based on aqueous distributions of heavy metals and trace elements. Moreover, the above findings may be instructional for other coastal cities with a similar level of urban development to understand the potential threats to their groundwater resources. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was conducted in 17 municipal mechanical-biological wastewater treatment plants which, to a slight degree, differed in the technological process of wastewater treatment and the method of hygienisation of sewage sludge. The selected treatment plants, located in seven regions, included five classified as large agglomerations (population equivalent - PE > 100 000), ten as medium-size (PE 15 000 - 100 000), and two as smaller size with PE 10 000 - 5000. The largest number of viable eggs of Ascaris spp., Toxocara spp., and Trichuris spp. was found in the sewage sludge collected from the primary settling tank. A slightly lower number of the eggs were found in the samples of excess sludge, which indicates that the sedimentation process in the primary settling tank is not sufficiently long to effectively separate parasites’ eggs from the sewage treated. The number of eggs of Ascaris spp. and Toxocara spp. in the fermented sludge was nearly 3 times lower than that in the raw sludge. The effectiveness of hygienisation of dehydrated <b>sewage</b> sludge by <b>means</b> of quicklime was confirmed in two wastewater treatment plants, with respect to Ascaris spp. eggs, in three plants with respect to Toxocara spp. eggs, and in one plant with respect to Trichuris spp. eggs.

40|$|Extensive {{data from}} O'ahu {{indicate}} that all streams {{on this island}} consistently exceed the USEPA standards (200 fecal coliform/ 100 ml, 33 enterococci/ 100 ml) for water quality. Soil {{was determined to be}} the source of the elevated counts of these bacteria. In tropical areas, as Hawai'i, these bacteria are able to survive and multiply in the soil. Thus, these bacteria can end up in nearby streams after heavy rains or due to erosion. As a result, the USEPA recommended indicator bacteria (fecal coliform, enterococci) cannot be used to reliably determine when waters in tropical areas are fecally contaminated. Several alternative indicators have been proposed for such areas such as C. perfringens and FRNA coliphages. Extensive monitoring data does not exist for the other islands of Hawai'i. Kaua'i differs from O'ahu in that it is older, wetter and contains an abundance of cesspools. The Nawiliwili Watershed, on the island of Kaua'i, was chosen for this study. Sampling was conducted over a period of one year, and all samples were assayed for the traditional USEPA indicators (fecal coliform, enterococci) as well as two alternative indicators (c. perfringens, FRNA coliphages). Of the 14 sites sampled, 12 contained levels of fecal coliform and enterococci that exceeded the USEPA standards (200 fecal coliform/l 00 ml and 33 enterococci/l 00 ml. This is similar to what has been documented in O'ahu streams. Based on the concentrations of these indicator bacteria, the USEPA would deem these sites as sewage contaminated. However, monitoring of these same sites for C. perfringens indicated that there was no <b>sewage</b> contamination (geometric <b>mean</b> values fell below the proposed standard of 50 CFU/l 00 ml). FRNA coliphage data indicate that cesspools may be leaching into nearby streams. Two streams (Nawiliwili, Papakolea) had geometric mean levels greater than the 50 PFU/IOO ml (based on O'ahu streams). Other streams in the watershed may be sporadically contaminated by cesspool because elevated FRNA coliphage levels were detected on occasion. Genotyping these FRNA coliphage isolates furthered supported the theory that cesspools were contaminating these sites because 98 % of the FRNA isolates were typed as human while only 2 % were typed as of animal origin. Current USEPA standards (fecal coliform, enterococci) are not reliable indicators of sewage pollution in tropical areas, thus, alternative indicators such as C. perfringens and FRNA coliphages may prove to be better indicators in these areas...|$|R

We measured soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from rain-fed perennial tropical grassland, wastewater-irrigated perennial tropical pastureland, recently cleared woodland, miombo woodland, a Eucalyptus plantation, regular cropland and recently cleared-and-cropped land, on two contrasting soils at five sites in one cropping season in Zimbabwe. Gas samples were collected using static chambers and analysed by gas chromatography. Considerably high GHG emissions were found on <b>sewage</b> effluent-irrigated pastureland (<b>means,</b> 190 mg CO 2 -C m− 2 hour− 1, 102 µg CH 4 -C m− 2 hour− 1 and 6 µg N 2 O-N m− 2 hour− 1 from sandy soil) and altered woodlands (mean ranges, 38 - 70 CO 2 -C m− 2 hour− 1, 12 - 43 µg CH 4 -C m− 2 hour− 1 and 20 - 31 µg N 2 O-N m− 2 hour− 1 from deforested and cultivated woodland on clay and sandy soils). Relatively low and less variable emissions were found among the rain-fed perennial tropical grasslands, regular croplands and Eucalyptus plantations (mean ranges, 19 - 39 mg CO 2 -C m− 2 hour− 1, − 9. 4 - 2. 6 µg CH 4 -C m− 2 hour− 1 and 1. 0 - 4. 7 µg N 2 O-N m− 2 hour− 1). Variability in CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from soils was to the greatest extent influenced by soil temperature, but soil moisture, mineral-N and pH were also important. The increased N 2 O emissions from cleared woodland on clay soil were attributed to increased mineralization and N availability when no tree could take up that N, while the N mineralized on the sandy soil could have been largely leached due to the soil's poor nutrient holding capacity, resulting in a relatively lower N 2 O emission response to clearing. We concluded that the alteration of woodlands by deforestation and cultivation increased soil temperature, resulting in increased soil respiration, while the establishment of Eucalyptus plantations may provide an option for reduction in soil emissions of CO 2 and N 2 O and a sink for CH...|$|R

In the first pilot plant, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies up to 84 % in total COD and 92 % in suspended COD were achieved at a mean hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 h in the settler and 5. 6 h in the reactor, equivalent to an upflow velocity (V up) of 0. 71 m/h. A granular sludge developed in the UASB reactor probably due to the low concentration of suspended solids (SS) and COD in the influent and an adequate combination of HRT and V up. Some of the granules were surprisingly big (up to 5 cm in diameter). The system studied was highly robust and efficient, it consistently delivered a final effluent in compliance with discharge standards for COD and SS, and produced a small amount of well-stabilized sludge. In the two-step UASB system of the second pilot plant, COD removal efficiencies up to 89 % were obtained at mean HRTs of 6. 4 + 5. 6 h (V up = 0. 62 + 0. 70 m/h), with 83 and 36 % removal in the first and second steps, respectively. The effluent concentration was similar to that obtained in the first pilot plant. The performance of the two-step system was not affected during the coldest period of the year, which usually lasts about three months. The anaerobic sludge showed good stability, especially in summer time, and could be directly disposed of without further treatment. After the posttreatment, the effluent also complied with discharge standards for pathogenic microorganisms. It was concluded that a single-stage UASB reactor followed by a series of WSP could be a very efficient, reliable, compact, and simple system for the treatment of raw sewage in subtropical regions like Salta. Finally, a comparative assessment of the sustainability of three technological options for sewage treatment was performed,   in terms of a series of technical, environmental, social, and economic criteria and indicators. In this preliminary assessment it was found that, under local conditions, a system UASB + WSP was more sustainable than (a) an aerobic high-rate treatment system based on trickling filters, and (b) a system of conventional WSP. The assessment method used (a multi-criteria weighted-scale matrix) was simple to perform and sensitive enough to detect differences in sustainability between the options compared. A representative panel of local stakeholders must perform the actual assessment in a transparent and participatory way before any concrete policy decision is taken. The final plead of this thesis is that sustainable development will only be achieved through a fully democratic way of decision-making that can go beyond political and economic motivations and that may be able to solve environmental problems and social injustices...|$|R
