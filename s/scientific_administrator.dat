6000|$|I {{have other}} reasons for fearing that this logical ideal of {{evolutionary}} regimentation--this pigeon-fanciers' polity--is unattainable. In {{the absence of any}} such a severely <b>scientific</b> <b>administrator</b> as we have been dreaming of, human society [24] is kept together by bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them. Social organization is not peculiar to men. Other societies, such as those constituted by bees and ants, have also arisen out of the advantage of co-operation in the struggle for existence; and their resemblances to, and their differences from, human society are alike instructive. The society formed by the hive bee fulfils the ideal of the communistic aphorism [...] "to each according to his needs, from each according to his capacity." [...] Within it, the struggle for existence is strictly limited. Queen, drones, and workers have each their allotted sufficiency of food; each performs the function assigned to it in the economy of the hive, and all contribute {{to the success of the}} whole cooperative society in its competition with rival collectors of nectar and pollen and with other enemies, in the state of nature without. In the same sense as the garden, or the colony, is a work of human art, the bee polity is a work of apiarian art, brought about by the cosmic process, working through the organization of the hymenopterous type.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the large}} amount of funds spent each year in this country on {{construction}} and remodeling of biomedical research facilities, a significant portion is directed to laboratories handling infectious microorganisms. This paper is intended for the <b>scientific</b> <b>administrators,</b> architects, and engineers concerned with the design of new microbiological facilities. It develops and explains the concept of primary and secondary barriers for the containment of microorganisms. The basic objectives of a microbiological research laboratory, (i) protection of the experimenter and staff, (ii) protection of the surrounding community, and (iii) maintenance of experimental validity, are defined. In the design of a new infectious-disease research laboratory, early identification should be made of the five functional zones of the facility and their relation to each other. The following five zones and design criteria applicable to each are discussed: clean and transition, research area, animal holding and research area, laboratory support, engineering support. The magnitude of equipment and design criteria which are necessary to integrate these five zones into an efficient and safe facility are delineated...|$|R

These studies usually do not include woman???s medical, scientific, social and religious definitions; the role of women as doctors, health <b>administrators,</b> <b>scientific</b> researchers, and/or health activists; the contribution of women???s and social movements to the improvement of women???s life conditions; the relations between sanitary and women???s movements, the construction of collective gender identities, the experience of real women in accessing and using oral contraceptives and so on.

The "RETE IMA WEB" survey was launched in 2007 from the Italian Society of Invasive Cardiology (SICI-GISE) in collaboration with the FIC, with the aim of evaluating the current state of RSC for STEMI in Italy. The personnel of the 118 Emergency System participated in the survey. Data collection was made using different electronic forms with access limited by personal passwords. We assessed the {{organization of}} the RSC together with local resource availability, with specific attention to the distance from a Hub center. The survey ended in December 31, 2008. We censored 701 hospitals admitting STEMI patients, 157 (22. 4 %) with uninterrupted access (h 24 / 7 days) to the catheterization laboratory (2. 67 per million inhabitants). An operative network was present in 36 / 103 (35. 9 %) provinces, with important geographic variability. Among hospitals without a full-time primary angioplasty facility, only 46 % was within a RSC. ECG was available in 72 % of the national territory, telemedicine in 50 %. Prehospital fibrinolysis was available in 16 % of the country.
