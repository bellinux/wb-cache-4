50|$|Throughout much of {{the early}} modern period, each Spanish realm {{retained}} its own freedoms and laws, and this included administrative and governance arrangements. Modes of taxation are {{an excellent example of}} the differing arrangements in the Spanish composite monarchy. The system of taxation in Spain varied depending on the kingdom or territory, and sometimes even within kingdoms there were <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The differing tax arrangements led to a reliance on the revenues from the Kingdom of Castile as opposed to other areas of Spain. While all of Spain was united under the same ruler, each territory was often treated very differently and was ruled by the King and central administrators in line with local customs and power structures. The king had more freedom to legislate in Catalonia than in the Kingdom of Aragon. Elites in Aragon and the Council that represented them were viewed as more powerful than elites in Catalonia. In the case of the petitions against hoarding, the King ignored the request to oppose the hoarding of grain in the case of Catalonia, while he accepted the request to oppose hoarding of grain in the Kingdom of Aragon. This demonstrates a different approach to governing each of the composite territories.|$|E
40|$|Proration is the {{restriction}} of oil production so that production will {{not exceed the}} current consumptive needs, considering oil and oil products in storage, available imports, and other facters. This program rests on a tripod, so to speak, the first leg being the proration laws of the oil-producing States, the second being the Federal Government in the from of legislation, and the third being the large integrated oil companies. That program has been sponsored by the major oil companies to control over-production of crude oil. Since proration was effective, the behavior of crude oil price became far more stable, and with minor exceptions, {{the only way it}} ever moved was upwards. In view of the supply inelasticity of competitive crude oil production, the smoothness of the transitions from one price to another and the long period of stability in the face of changing demand bespeak the characteristic of administered price. After World War II crude oil prices have risen sharply. This price rise is much greater than the cost rise per foot of wells drilled. This high price is reached and maintained by means of severe output controls to assure the greatest profit to the major companics. High prices and <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>arrangements</b> stimulated the exploration and development of oil wells and produced an increasing surplus of oil producing capacity over output. The result is the uneconomic use of resources and decrease in the return on investment...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is to assess the {{activities}} of travel agencies {{in terms of value}} added tax. The work is focused on characterization and use of a special VAT scheme for travel services not only domestically, but also at European level, with emphasis on evaluation of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The thesis is divided into three chapters. In the first chapter is an analysis of the current regulatory regime for special travel service in the Czech Republic. With the help of illustrative examples is ready basis for comparisons with subsequent modifications by the European Union and selected EU countries. The second chapter is devoted to the using of taxation of travel services from the perspective of European directives and requirements of the EC Commission. At the same time in the second chapter describes the system of taxation of travel services in Ireland, which represents a different taxation of this services. Aim of this thesis, which is to evaluate the use of special arrangements in selected Member States of the European Union, is achieved in the third chapter. Using the comparison it is shown that it is possible to gain a competitive advantage in the provision of services depending on the place of establishment of the travel services and therefore the legislation, which is governed by the service provider. Travel services provider can optimized their business thanks to competitive advantage...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Current {{pharmaceutical}} global pricing strategies functionally exclude {{developing countries}} {{from the market}} for drugs to treat many diseases. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate some of the proposed patent reward models to determine their feasibility in the current environment. Design/methodology/approach – A review of a variety of proposals including <b>special</b> financing or <b>tax</b> <b>arrangements,</b> public-private partnerships, and government-funded patent purchases are briefly reviewed. A more in-depth examination of the recently proposed health impact fund (HIF) is undertaken. Findings – In brief, the HIF requires developed countries to donate to a fund that finances the release of pharmaceutical patents. The pharmaceutical companies would be reimbursed over a ten-year period from the government donation pool based on the medicine's health impact. The expected consequence of this policy would be affordable medicines for developed and developing countries. This examination highlights deficiencies in the current HIF strategy and offers a number of suggestions mostly focused on a more balanced sharing of the inherent risks in pharmaceutical product development to improve the strategies viability. Practical implications – Although among the proposed strategies, the HIF offers the most promise, the suggested changes would result in a program viewed more favourably by the pharmaceutical industry and participating countries. Originality/value – Although it is recognized that pricing challenges are limiting the availability to essential medications in developing countries, current strategies often ignore many of the market dynamics for pharmaceuticals. This critique, focused on the HIF strategy, is presented in an effort to improve the likely success of the most promising of these strategies.
