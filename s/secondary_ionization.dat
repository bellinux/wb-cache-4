The experimental abundances of glycerol ions and of Cs+(CsCl) n cluster ions were successfully reproduced by assuming that most of the randomly distributed ions pair up with counterions shortly after impact. Further, it is considered that clustering (or proton transfer) reactions occur mainly between an ion that survives the pairing process and ion pairs (or basic analytes) in the immediate vicinity; however, some mixing undoubtedly occurs in the later stages of the desorption process. At the density of the original matrix, the range of proton transfer is calculated to be 5 - 15 Å and that of clustering approximately 25 % shorter. These reaction distance are inversely correlated with the internal energy of the ejected ions. In general, liquid <b>secondary</b> <b>ionization</b> mass spectra of alkali chloride solutions can be seen to result from competitive ion-ion recombination reactions in the decaying matrix.

A quantitative analysis of these cascades is needed, e. g. for assessing damage in optical components at X-ray free-electron lasers, and for understanding damage in samples exposed to the beam.

The calculations describe the <b>secondary</b> <b>ionizations</b> caused by these electrons, the three-dimensional evolution of the electron cloud, and monitor the equivalent instantaneous temperature of the free-electron gas as the system cools during expansion. The dissipation of the impact energy proceeds predominantly through the production of secondary electrons whose energies are comparable to the binding energies of the valence (40 − 50 eV) and the core electrons (300 eV) in accordance with experiments and the models of interactions.

However, the physics of melanin interaction with ionizing radiation is unknown. We rationally designed melanins from either 5 -S-cysteinyl-DOPA, L-cysteine/L-DOPA, or L-DOPA with diverse structures as shown by elemental analysis and HPLC. Sulfur-containing melanins had higher predicted attenuation coefficients than non-sulfur-containing melanins. All synthetic melanins displayed strong electron paramagnetic resonance (2. 14. 10 (18), 7. 09. 10 (18), and 9. 05. 10 (17) spins/g, respectively), with sulfur-containing melanins demonstrating more complex spectra and higher numbers of stable free radicals.

The rationally designed melanins protected mammalian cells against ionizing radiation of different energies. We propose that due to melanin's numerous aromatic oligomers containing multiple pi-electron system, a generated Compton recoil electron gradually loses energy while passing through the pigment, until its energy is sufficiently low that it can be trapped by stable free radicals present in the pigment.

At the first step multiple ionizations of target atoms by a projectile (Ca+ 19, E= 11. 4  MeV/amu) were described that gave the initial spatial distributions of free electrons having different momenta as well as distributions of holes in different atomic shells. Spatial propagation of fast electrons results in <b>secondary</b> <b>ionizations</b> of target atoms {{as well as in}} energy transfer to the lattice at times much shorter than the times of atomic oscillations (phonons). The well detected front of excitation in the electronic and ionic subsystems is formed due to this propagation which cannot be described by models based on diffusion mechanisms (e. g., parabolic equations of heat diffusion). At times ∼ 10  fs after the projectile passage, about ∼ 0. 1 % of the energy is already transferred to the lattice. About 63 % of the energy deposited by the ion is accumulated in holes at these times. Calculated distributions of these holes through the atomic shells are in excellent agreement with the spectroscopy experiments.

Our model takes into account multi-dimensional effects, X-ray feedback, <b>secondary</b> <b>ionizations</b> and primordial chemistry. We estimate Ly-α line widths by post-processing simulation output with Monte Carlo radiative transfer and calculate emissivity contributions from radiative recombination and collisional excitation.

All these effects are important to determine the line fluxes. We find that the combination of slopes: alpha_X,hard = - 1. 11, alpha_X,soft = - 0. 7, alpha_EUV = - 1. 3, alpha_UV = - 1. 7, maximizes the expected flux, f_Hnalpha = 10 microJy for z = 7 quasars with M_AB = - 27 in the n = 50 lines; allowed SED variations produce variations by a factor of 3 around this value. Secondaries boost the line intensity by a factor of 2 to 4, while stimulated emission in high-z quasars with M_AB = - 26 provides an extra boost to RRL flux observed at nu = 1 GHz if recombinations arise in HII regions with T_e = 10 ^ 3 - 5 K, n_e = 10 ^ 3 - 5 cm^- 3.
