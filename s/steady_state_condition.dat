2500|$|The {{basis of}} DSSM is that soils (including sands) can be sheared till they reach a {{steady-state}} condition at which, {{under conditions of}} constant strain-rate, there is no change in shear stress, effective confining stress, and void ratio.

2500|$|The {{difference}} between the steady state and the critical state is not merely one of semantics as is sometimes thought, and it is incorrect to use the two terms/concepts interchangeably. The additional requirements of the strict definition of the steady state {{over and above the}} critical state viz. a constant deformation velocity and statistically constant structure (the steady state structure), places the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>condition</b> within the framework of dynamical systems theory.

2500|$|The {{steady state}} has a {{slightly}} different value depending on the strain rate at which it is measured. [...] Thus the steady state shear strength at the quasi-static strain rate (the strain {{rate at which the}} critical state is defined to occur at) would seem to correspond to the critical state shear strength. [...] However, there is an additional difference between the two states. This is that at the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>condition</b> the grains position themselves in the steady state structure, whereas no such structure occurs for the critical state. In the case of shearing to large strains for soils with elongated particles, this steady state structure is one where the grains are oriented (perhaps even aligned) in the direction of shear.
