40|$|The {{problem of}} {{classification}} of risk factors in an uncertain environment {{is part of the}} risk management problem, which has a critical effect on the competitive advantage of production supply chain. The <b>severities</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences,</b> their relative importance, and the frequency of occurrence of risk factors are defined by risk management team, depending on their experience and the results of good practice. Fuzzy rating <b>of</b> the <b>severities</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> and the frequency of occurrence of risk factors are described by linguistic expressions, which are modeled by triangular fuzzy numbers. The risk values, obtained by the materialization of the identified risk factors, are given precisely with the usage of fuzzy algebra rules. The classification criterion is defined as the distance between current risk value and extreme risk values. The proposed model enables determination of the priorities of risk factors. It is illustrated by an example with real-life data from a production supply chain in auto industry...|$|R
50|$|If the {{consequences}} are dependent on dose, ie. the amount of exposure, the relationship between dose and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> must be established, and the risk depends on the probable dose, which may depend on concentration or amplitude and duration or frequency of exposure. This is the general case for many health hazards where the mechanism of injury is toxicity or repetitive injury, particularly where the effect is cumulative.|$|R

50|$|Defensive {{attribution}} hypothesis - Tendency {{of people}} to attribute more blame to the perpetrator of an accident as the consequences become more severe. However, if people perceive themselves to be more similar to the perpetrator characteristically or circumstantially they will rate the perpetrator as less culpable for the accident as the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> increase.

5000|$|While in some cases, {{safety or}} {{reliability}} risk can be eliminated, {{in most cases}} {{a certain degree of}} risk must be accepted. In order to quantify expected costs before the fact, the potential consequences and the probability of occurrence must be considered. Assessment of risk is made by combining the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> with the likelihood of occurrence in a matrix. Risks that fall into the [...] "unacceptable" [...] category (e.g., high severity and high probability) must be mitigated by some means to reduce the level of safety risk.|$|R

Software criticality levels range from A to E, corresponding to the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> Catastrophic to No Safety Effect. Higher levels of rigor are required for level A and B software and corresponding functional tasks and work products is the system safety domain are used as objective evidence of meeting safety criteria and requirements.|$|R
50|$|FMEA is a bottom-up, {{inductive}} {{analytical method}} {{which may be}} performed at either the functional or piece-part level.

The result highlights failure modes with relatively high probability and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences,</b> allowing remedial effort to be directed where it will produce the greatest value. FMECA tends to be preferred over FMEA in space and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military applications, while various forms of FMEA predominate in other industries.|$|E
5000|$|The weak version the Precautionary Principle is {{the least}} {{restrictive}} and allows preventive measures {{to be taken in}} the face of uncertainty, but does not require them (eg, Rio Declaration 1992; United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change 1992). To satisfy the threshold of harm, there must be some evidence relating to both the likelihood of occurrence and the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences.</b> Some, but not all, require consideration of the costs of precautionary measures. Weak formulations do not preclude weighing benefits against the costs. Factors other than scientific uncertainty, including economic considerations, may provide legitimate grounds for postponing action. Under weak formulations, the requirement to justify the need for action (the burden of proof) generally falls on those advocating precautionary action.

50|$|The {{confidentiality}} of sensitive business information is established through non-disclosure agreements, a legally binding contract between two parties {{in a professional}} relationship.

Depending on the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences,</b> a violation of non-disclosure may result in employment loss, loss of business and client contacts, criminal charges or a civil lawsuit, and a hefty sum in damages. When NDAs are signed between employer and employee at the initiation of employment, a non-compete clause may be a part of the agreement as an added protection of sensitive business information, where the employee agrees not to work for competitors or start their own competing business within a certain time or geographical limit.|$|E

5000|$|Performing a {{probabilistic}} {{risk assessment}} {{starts with a}} set of initiating events that change the state or configuration of the system. [...] An initiating event is an event that starts a reaction, such as the way a spark (initiating event) can start a fire that could lead to other events (intermediate events) such as a tree burning down, and then finally an outcome, for example, the burnt tree no longer provides apples for food. Each initiating event leads to another event and continuing through this path, where each intermediate event's probability of occurrence may be calculated by using fault tree analysis, until an end state is reached (the outcome of a tree no longer providing apples for food). [...] Intermediate events are commonly split into a binary (success/failure or yes/no) but may be split into more than two as long as the events are mutually exclusive, meaning that they can not occur at the same time. If a spark is the initiating event there is a probability that the spark will start a fire or will not start a fire (binary yes or no) as well as the probability that the fire spreads to a tree or does not spread to a tree. End states are classified into groups that can be successes or <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences.</b> An example of a success would be that no fire started and the tree still provided apples for food while the severity of consequence would be that a fire did start and we lose apples as a source of food. Loss end states can be any state {{at the end of the}} pathway that is a negative outcome of the initiating event. The loss end state is highly dependent upon the system, for example if you were measuring a quality process in a factory a loss or end state would be that the product has to be reworked or thrown in the trash.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{bullying}} in a nursing workplace, we test the argument that an offender‘s perspective-taking promotes victim conciliation, mediated by perceived perspective-taking, that is, {{the extent to which}} the victim perceives the offender as taking their perspective. Perceived perspective-taking facilitates the attribution of moral emotions (remorse, etc.) to the offender, thereby promoting conciliatory victim responses. However, perceived perspective-taking would be qualified by {{the extent to which the}} <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> expressed in the offender‘s perspective-taking matches or surpasses the severity for the victim. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns = 141 and 122), victims indicated greater trust and/or forgiveness when the offender had taken the victim‘s perspective. This was sequentially mediated by perceived perspective-taking and victim‘s inference that the offender had felt moral emotions. As predicted, in Study 2 (but not Study 1) <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> qualified victims‘ perceived perspective-taking. Study 3 (N = 138) examined three potential mechanisms for the moderation by severity. Victims attributed greater perspective-taking to the offender when the consequences were less severe than voiced by the offender, suggesting victims‘ appreciation of the offender‘s generous appraisal. Attributions of perspective-taking and of moral emotions to the offender may play an important role in reconciliation processes...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates farmers’ cognitive {{perceptions of}} risk and the behavioral intentions to undertake farm-level risk-reduction measures. It has been observed {{that people who are}} susceptible to natural hazards often fail to act, or do very little, to protect their assets or lives. To answer the question of why some people show adaptive behavior while others do not, a socio-psychological model of precautionary adaptation based on protection motivation theory and trans-theoretical stage model has been applied {{for the first time to}} areas of drought risk in the developing countries cultural context. The applicability of the integrated model is explored by means of a representative sample survey of smallholder farmers in northern Ethiopia. The result of the study showed that there is a statistically significant association between farmer’s behavioral intention to undertake farm-level risk-reduction measures and the main important protection motivation model variables. High perceived vulnerability, <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences,</b> self-efficacy, and response efficacy lead to higher levels of behavioral intentions to undertake farm-level risk-reduction measures. For farmers in the action stage, self-efficacy and response efficacy were the main motivators of behavioral intention. For farmers in the contemplative stage, self-efficacy and cost appear to be the main motivators for them to act upon risk reduction, while perceived <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> and cost of response actions were found to be important for farmers in the pre-contemplative stag...|$|E

Therefore, many standards are available for risk assessment, e. g. ISO 13824 : 2009 General principles on risk assessment of systems involving structures or ISO/IEC 31010 : 2009 Risk management – Risk Assessment Techniques. In different industrial sectors risk assessment is fundamental step to determine required safety integrity level (SIL), eventually performance level (PL), which guarantees risk linked to some equipment on ac-ceptable level. Standards applied for risk management based on SIL in different industrial sectors differ in methods used for risk evaluation and SIL determination. IEC 61508 - 5 accepts the use of qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative approach for risk evaluation and SIL determination. The standard uses hazardous event severity matrix {{as an example of}} qualitative approach for SIL determination, the standard furthermore uses layer of protection analysis (LOPA) as an example of semi-quantitative ap-proach. The standard also uses Risk graph method as an example of both qualitative and semi-quantitative approach. IEC 62061 only presents one semi-quantitative approach for risk evaluation and SIL determination based on combination of probability and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences.</b> This approach is different from the approach presented in IEC 61508 - 5.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that affect {{plays an important role}} in risk perception, and that such perception is mainly governed by emotional processes. However, upon closer scrutiny it turns out that the belief is based on weak empirical evidence, if the words affect and emotion are interpreted according to their dominating meanings in natural language, and to common usage in psychology at large. Instead, <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> emerges as a major factor in perceived risk, just as it did in a previous analysis of probability/risk vs. consequences (Sjöberg, 1999 b, 2000 a). The perception of <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> is not the same as emotion, although emotional effects may arise from considering some severe consequences of accidents or the use of certain technologies and facilities. The picture of the public as irrational and emotionally driven painted by the received message on the role of affect is unfortunate and possibly has unwanted policy implications. The word affect should be used to denote emotion; it is then clear that affect/emotion is of only minor importance in risk perception. When risk perception first became a topic in behavioral research, it was believed by many that the ‘‘biased’ ’ views held by the public on risks of technology were due to cognitive limitations, as described in the Kahneman– Tversky work on heuristics (Sjöberg, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). However, it later became clear that there were social and psychological dynamics involved (Sjöberg, 1980 a) which could be better accounted for by an approach bringing in non-cognitive factors. 2 Emotion or affect, specified as dread, was early held to be a dominating factor in risk perception...|$|E
