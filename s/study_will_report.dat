40|$|The {{composition}} and physical properties of raw milk from a commercial herd were studied over a one year period {{in order to}} understand how best to utilise milk for processing throughout the year. Protein and fat levels demonstrated seasonal trends, while minerals and many physical properties displayed considerable variations, which were apparently unrelated to season. However, rennet clotting time, ethanol stability and foaming ability were subject to seasonal variation. Many significant interrelationships in physico-chemical properties were found. It is clear that the milk supply may be more suited to the manufacture of different products at different times of the year or even on a day to day basis. Subsequent <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> <b>report</b> on variation in production and quality of products manufactured from the same milk samples described in the current <b>study</b> and <b>will</b> thus highlight potential advantages of seasonal processing of raw milk...|$|R

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that hydrogen separation membranes {{are a key}} component of the emerging hydrogen economy. A potentially exciting material for membrane separations are bulk metallic glass materials due to their low cost, high elastic toughness and resistance to hydrogen 'embrittlement' as compared to crystalline Pd-based membrane systems. However, at elevated temperatures and extended operation times structural changes including partial crystallinity may appear in these amorphous metallic systems. A systematic evaluation of the impact of partial crystallinity/devitrification on the diffusion and solubility behavior in multi-component Metallic Glass materials would provide great insight into the potential of these materials for hydrogen applications.

40|$|The {{problems}} of classroom management in many academic subjects are an impor-tant {{area of research}} in general education in many countries (Doyle, 1990; Jones, 1996; Kagan, 1992; Tauber, 1999). Compared {{to the level of}} interest in the field of general education, not enough attention is paid to classroom management is-sues in language classrooms, and in particular there is little empirical research on classroom management in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Japan. To fill the gap, this <b>study</b> <b>will</b> <b>report</b> on: a) classroom management difficulties that arise in Japanese EFL classrooms when teachers try to teach English communicatively, b) how teachers conceptualize and attempt to deal with these problems, and c) what strategies can be offered to alleviate these problems...|$|E
40|$|Since the end {{of federal}} funds from the Water Resources Planning Act of 1964, it has been largely the {{responsibility}} of the states to plan for their water resources. This <b>study</b> <b>will</b> <b>report</b> on the current status of state water planning, suggest some variables that may have an influence on a state's decision to prepare a state water plan, and test the variables through statistical analysis. Some of the variables that are suggested as having some influence on state water planning are precipitation, population density, large metropolitan areas, median per capita income (as a measure of state affluence), and percent of land irrigated. Among these, it is only precipitation that has a clearly significant correlation to the preparation of a state water plan. It is concluded that no single variable is an accurate predictor of state behavior, but that a combination of variables act together to influence state behavior...|$|E
40|$|Polynesian stone adze {{quarries}} {{anchor the}} system of tool production, distribution and consumption and are critical for examining changing social organization, symbolic values attributed to particular stone sources, economic intensification and ancient interaction. Although major adze quarries are known from most Polynesian archipelagos, a geologically informed archaeological survey was designed for discovering the variability in stone-tool-quality rock sources. Thirteen quarries and sources within the 20, 000 hectare traditional land unit of Kaluako 2 ̆ 7 i (literally, the adze pit) on Moloka 2 ̆ 7 i, Hawaiian Islands, vary considerably in size, production output and settlement context, suggesting that individual adze quarries were accorded different roles across the social landscape. Some sixty-four radiocarbon age determinations and U-series dates from quarries and habitation sites with artefacts originating from quarries, document the temporal sequence of use beginning in the Late Expansion Period (AD 1400 - 1650), at least two centuries after settlement of the island. Further <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> <b>report</b> on adze technology and on-going geochemical sourcing analyses...|$|R

40|$|Dental {{anxiety is}} a {{widespread}} phenomenon with deleterious oral health correlates. Consideration of variation in coping styles {{may be useful in}} the selection of effective dental anxiety interventions. Miller (1981, 1987) defined two key modalities for coping with threatening information: monitoring (attending to threatening information) and blunting (avoiding threatening information). This <b>study</b> <b>will</b> <b>report</b> on the New Zealand validation of a measure of children's monitoring-blunting copying styles in dental situations (the MBDS) in a sample of 240 New Zealand children aged 11 - 13 years. Internal consistency reliability and convergent validity with respect to a related scale wre adequate for both the monitoring and blunting subscales, although discriminant validity with regard to dental anxiety was weak for the blunting subscale. Use of a scale such as the MBDS may be one way in which dental staff can bring children's preferred copying styles into consideration when formulating interventions to manage dental anxiety. fals...|$|E

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is an {{autosomal recessive}} lethal disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes for CFTR, an epithelial cell-surface expressed protein {{responsible for the}} transport of chloride (Cl-). Gating mutations associated with defective conductance can be modulated by CFTR potentiators. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator approved {{for the treatment of}} CF patients > 6 yrs of age with at least one copy of the G 551 D-CFTR mutation. Herein, the clinical trial development programme for ivacaftor will be reviewed, including two pivotal studies in adolescents/adults and in children. These studies report sustained improvements in lung function and sweat chloride concentrations, and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations over a 48 -week treatment period. In the era of personalised medicine, ivacaftor offers an effective and well-tolerated treatment for the clinical management of CF patients with the G 551 D mutation.

30|$|The {{strength}} {{of the current study}} is the use of Bayesian hierarchical approaches to spatial autocorrelation thus addressing the limitations of linear methods which treat each suburb as being independent of surrounding suburbs. The map decomposition strategy developed by Law and Haining (2004) proved useful and in particular raised questions regarding the spatial distribution of unexplained components. Bayesian methods are increasingly being used in multilevel studies but their use in spatial multilevel studies has been limited.

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that the improvements of physical environment increase productivity at workplace. Recent research also suggests two directions of environmental research: the effects of behavioural environment {{as well as the}} effects of physical environment on occupant at workplace. However, there seems to be lack of a holistic approach to understanding the relationship between indoor environment and occupant response including health, comfort and productivity. The primary aim of the paper is to better understand their relationships through a structured questionnaire which evaluates occupant comfort and performance in work environments. It could be a way to confirm the effects of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) on employee productivity, understanding how occupants feel and interact with their environments. A structured questionnaire, which consists of five sections: job activities and general workplace, indoor environment, behavioural environment, health symptoms and demographic information, is proposed and the latent variables of the questionnaire are presented in the paper. This study also introduces the procedure in a field study using the proposed questionnaire in Seoul, Korea.
