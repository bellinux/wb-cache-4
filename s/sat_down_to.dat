25|$|Using his {{friendly}} {{relations with}} the British, Kâmil Pasha also <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> end the ongoing First Balkan War diplomatically. However, the heavy Ottoman military upsets during the war continued to sap morale, as rumors that the capital {{would have to be}} moved from Istanbul to inland Anatolia spread. The Bulgarian Army had soon advanced as far as Çatalca, a western district of modern Istanbul. At this point, Kâmil Pasha's government signed an armistice with Bulgaria in December 1912 and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> draw up a treaty {{for the end of the}} war at the London Peace Conference.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is then}} {{revealed}} that {{the events of the}} contrived murder and subsequent events were all simply part of the book Gifford had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> begin writing {{at the beginning of the}} film. None of it was real.|$|E
25|$|Years later, when I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> write Tropic of Fear, a {{political}} thriller set in South America, I thought of those experiences. They {{became part of}} the background of a secondary character, “Dink” Denton, a former roughneck, ex-Apache helicopter pilot in both Panama and the First Gulf War, now undercover in Paraguay as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E

25|$|While {{following}} Norton, Somervell {{suffered a}} severe {{problem with a}} blockage of his throat, and he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> await his death. In a desperate last attempt, he compressed his lungs with his arms, and suddenly disgorged the blockage — which he described as the lining of his throat. He then followed Norton, who was by now 30 minutes ahead, unaware of the life-threatening episode to his partner.|$|E
25|$|Across the Sky {{was formed}} when solo artists, Ben Kolarcik and Justin Unger, who were under {{consideration}} by Word Records, met and began collaborations in Nashville. Both artists {{had a history}} of performance and music ministry in their hometowns and in regional tours. After deciding on becoming a duo act, the pair <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> work on music together. After composing 50 or so titles, they settled on 12 for their first album. The pair was assisted along the way by such notable Contemporary Christian musicians and writers as Cindy Morgan, Scott Krippayne, Matthew Gerrard, Jeff Borders, Kyle Matthews and Tony Wood.|$|E
25|$|At {{the inauguration}} of the UN in 1945, no {{delegation}} from Poland had been invited. The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference {{did not have a}} delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the piano and played Poland Is Not Yet Lost loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous forte. When he had finished, the public rose to their feet and gave him a great ovation.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 1876, Hickok {{was playing}} poker at Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. When a seat opened {{up at the}} table, a drunk man named Jack McCall <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok {{encouraged}} McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Though McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted. The next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually sat {{with his back to}} a wall so he could see the entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from the door. He asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him twice, but Rich refused.|$|E
25|$|After {{gaining the}} {{permission}} of sultan Mehmed V {{to form a new}} government in late October 1912, Freedom and Accord leader Kâmil Pasha <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> diplomatic talks with Bulgaria after the unsuccessful First Balkan War. With the Bulgarian demand for the cession of the former Ottoman capital city of Edirne (Adrianople) looming and the outrage among the Turkish populace as well as the CUP leadership, the CUP carried out the raid on the Sublime Porte. After the coup, opposition parties like Freedom and Accord were subject to heavy repression and their leaders arrested or exiled to Europe, while many CUP members were put into power. Coup leader Enver Bey (later Pasha), soon to be Minister of War, withdrew the Ottoman Empire from the ongoing London Peace Conference and moved it closer to Germany ahead of World War I.|$|E
25|$|Having {{cleared the}} Ebro valley, Suchet sent Musnier to fight guerillas to the north, while Laval battled the Spanish to the south. For the {{remainder}} of 1809, the III Corps waged local anti-guerilla operations. A January 1810 order of battle shows that Habert commanded Suchet's 3rd Division, though he still ranked as a general of brigade. Its strength was 4,329 men in seven battalions. At this time King Joseph Bonaparte insisted that Suchet capture Valencia. Accordingly, the III Corps commander advanced to the gates of that port city on 6 March, but within four days abandoned the futile blockade and retreated. Instead, Suchet advanced on Lleida (Lerida), arriving before the city on 15 April and inflicting a stinging repulse to a Spanish relief force on 23 April at Margalef. The French <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> begin the Siege of Lerida on 29 April. During the operation, Habert's division included two battalions each of the 5th Light and 116th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions of the 117th Line, and two foot artillery batteries. The Spanish governor Garcia Conde surrendered on 13 May with 7,000 men.|$|E

500|$|When it {{was time}} to sup, the dance ceased, and six and thirty persons <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> two tables in the same room. [...] After supper the ladies sung Erse songs, to which I listened as an English {{audience}} to an Italian opera, delighted with the sound of words which I did not understand.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{began writing}} an opinion column, [...] "The Priyanka Chopra Column", for the Hindustan Times in 2009. She wrote {{a total of}} fifty columns for the newspaper. She said after her first year of writing: [...] "I'm a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, {{whenever}} I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore." [...] In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to New York, Adams met with Maurice Daly, then the [...] "dean of billiards". Daly listened to Adams' story, {{and said that he}} was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands. Daly offered Adams a set of four balls, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> watch Adams. After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots. At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained any idea of entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room.|$|E

500|$|In 1872 with a {{group of}} other Chronicle {{newspaper}} staffers, O'Connell helped form the Bohemian Club. At first, the group rented a modest room as their clubhouse, and spent many evenings enjoying food, drink, music and the literary arts. Chronicle publisher M. H. de Young later wrote that the Bohemian membership of some of his employees was [...] "not an unmixed blessing" [...] because the [...] "boys would go there sometimes when they should have reported at the office." [...] De Young said that [...] "very often" [...] when O'Connell <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a good dinner, [...] "he would forget that he had a pocketful of notes for an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom Calthrop is most {{associated}} with the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway. The line had been promoted under the Light Railways Act, and the initial plan was to build a railway of [...] gauge to be powered by electricity. Under the influence {{of one of the}} Light Railway Commissioners the company directors commissioned a report on the proposed line from Calthrop in mid-1900. In early December the railway's engineer died, and on 19 December 1900 the Directors <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> consider both a replacement and Calthrop's report. Calthrop proposed specifications for the line which would result in substantial savings in construction costs, and so he was offered the position of engineer, which he promptly accepted.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} all {{the stuff}} about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> write a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

500|$|After the German {{edition of}} Inside the Third Reich was {{published}} in late 1969, Speer proposed {{a visit to the}} embittered Wolters in Coesfeld. [...] Wolters advised against it, sarcastically suggesting that he was surprised that the author did not [...] "walk through life in a hair shirt, distributing his fortune among the victims of National Socialism, forswear all the vanities and pleasures of life and live on locusts and wild honey". [...] Nevertheless, Wolters expressed a willingness to meet, proposing (rather pointedly) a meeting at Wolters' house on November 19, Buß- und Bettag, the day of penance and prayer for German Protestants. [...] Speer duly visited, and as the two <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> lunch, enquired, [...] "Where are the locusts?" ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{casualty}} of Harrison's 1840 campaign was Democratic Michigan Congressman Isaac Crary who on February 14, 1840, as the House of Representatives debated {{funding for the}} Cumberland Road, essayed an attack on Harrison's record as an Indian fighter, deeming him a bogus hero. Crary <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> applause from his fellow Democrats. But the next day, Ohio's Thomas Corwin, known as a humorist, rose in the House, and depicted Crary, a militia general in his home state, {{having to deal with}} the terrors of the militia's parade day, until afterwards, safe with the survivors, [...] "your general unsheathes his trenchant blade... and with an energy and remorseless fury he slices the watermelons that lie in heaps around him". As word reached newspapers in February and March, there was much amusement across the nation; Crary failed of renomination to Congress.|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I {{was on the way}} to the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm {{on the way to the}} bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
