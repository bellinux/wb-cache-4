40|$|The jack {{mackerel}} before 1947, was of minor commercial importance {{having to take}} a back seat to the better known, more profitable, and more abundant Pacific sardine (Sardinops caeruleus) and the more desirable Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus). During these years it was referred to as "horse mackerel" and had relatively little market appeal. Much of the catch between 1926 and 1946 was absorbed by the fresh fish markets and consisted primarily of {{jack mackerel}} taken from mixed sardine and Pacific mackerel schools. Landings were low, varying between 183 and 15, 573 short tons. During the 1947 - 48 season, the industry, after being hit hard by poor sardine landings, turned to the jack mackerel as a substitute sardine and landed approximately 71, 000 <b>short</b> tons. Jack <b>mackerel</b> have been a major contributor to California's commercial landings ever since (Figure 1). In 1948, the U. S. Pure Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the common name jack mackerel on all labeling. This name was expected to have more consumer appeal than the original official name "horse mackerel". The California Department of Fish and Game commenced routine length and age sampling of the commercial landings in 1947, the year the fishery first blossomed into being. Due to the apparent healthy condition of the resource and the need for emphasis on other fisheries these sample data have not been subjected to a complete analysis. We have recently completed the assignment of ages to the otoliths sampled and anticipate dedicating most of our effort in 1968 to writing a manuscript describing the fishery, its year-class composition and other factors affecting the yield. The literature on the jack mackerel is somewhat scanty with the greatest part of it pertaining to: (i) taxonomy; (ii) egg and larva distribution, and survival; (iii) yield per area from California waters; and (iv) reviews of the jack mackerel fishery in California and preliminary discussions of biological knowledge. Accordingly, for this paper, I have called upon past work and much unpublished data from our files, including station data from pre-season albacore cruises and the previously mentioned length and age data.

5000|$|In Thailand shrimp paste (kapi, กะปิ, [...] ) is an {{essential}} ingredient in many types of nam phrik, spicy dips or sauces, and in all Thai curry pastes, such as the paste used in kaeng som. Very popular in Thailand is nam phrik kapi, a spicy condiment made with fresh shrimp paste and most often eaten together with fried pla thu (<b>short</b> <b>mackerel)</b> and fried, steamed or raw vegetables. In Southern Thailand there are three types of shrimp paste: one made only from shrimp, one containing a mixture of shrimp and fish ingredients, and another paste that is sweet. 'Nam prik meng daa' is available in Hat Yai and Satul markets. Meng is a night flying bug and its body fluids are pressed and mixed with 'kapi', quite sweet. 'nam prik makaam' is 'kapi' mixed with tamarind, more sour.|$|E

Histology and histochemistry were used to classify the stage of atretic follicles in R. brachysoma, obtained from the Upper Gulf of Thailand. Microscopically, {{it was clear that}} under atretic processing this species could be successively divided into two phases: atretic follicle during previtellogenic and vitellogenic stages, in which the latter was also classified into five steps (I, II, III, IV, and V). Histochemically the cortical alveoli, yolk granules and basement membrane were observed and discussed in this study...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{prevalence}} {{studies and}} outbreaks of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection have been extensively reported in shellfish and crustaceans. Information on the quantitative detection of V. parahaemolyticus in finfish species is limited. In this study, short mackerels (Rastrelliger brachysoma) obtained from different retail marketplaces were monitored {{with the presence}} of total and pathogenic strains of V. parahaemolyticus. Out of 130 <b>short</b> <b>mackerel</b> samples, 116 (89. 2 %) were detected {{with the presence of}} total V. parahaemolyticus and microbial loads of total V. parahaemolyticus ranging from 105 MPN/g. Prevalence of total V. parahaemolyticus was found highest in wet markets (95. 2 %) followed by minimarkets (89. 1 %) and hypermarkets (83. 3 %). Pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains (tdh+ and/or trh+) were detected in 16. 2 % (21 of 130) of <b>short</b> <b>mackerel</b> samples. The density of tdh+ V. parahaemolyticus strains were examined ranging from 3. 6 to > 105 MPN/g and microbial loads of V. parahaemolyticus strains positive for both tdh and trh were found ranging from 300 to 740 MPN/g. On the other hand, antibiotic susceptibility profiles of V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from short mackerels were determined through disc diffusion method in this study. Assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility profile of V. parahaemolyticus revealed majority of the isolates were highly susceptible to ampicillin sulbactam, meropenem, ceftazidime, and imipenem, but resistant to penicillin G and ampicillin. Two isolates (2. 99 %) exhibited the highest multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index value of 0. 41 which shown resistance to 7 antibiotics. Results of the present study demonstrated that the occurrence of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains in short mackerels and multidrug resistance of V. parahaemolyticus isolates could be a potential public health concerns to the consumer. Furthermore, prevalence data attained from the current study can be further used to develop a microbial risk assessment model to estimate health risks associated with the consumption of short mackerels contaminated with pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe first {{investigations}} of the thyroid gland and interrenal tissue {{with reference to the}} endocrine parenchyma of <b>short</b> <b>mackerel</b> Rastrelliger brachysoma were subjected to histological analysis. Specimens were collected during the fishing season (October to November 2013) from the Upper Gulf of Thailand. Under a light microscope, the thyroid gland of R.  brachysoma was distinctly found located within the branchial region. Within this gland, it consists of several follicles among afferent brachial arteries. Each follicle exclusively contained a colloid that was surrounded by a simple, cuboidal, follicle epithelium. Histological study showed that the localization of interrenal tissue was in the anterior kidney. This tissue was composed of two parts based on the structural compositions and cell types; (i) the stromal compartment was constituted of various interrenal cells and (ii) the interstitial compartment contained the connective tissue, leucocytes and blood sinuses, with reference to the lymphatic tissue...|$|E
40|$|The <b>short</b> <b>mackerel</b> is {{the most}} commercially {{important}} small pelagic fish in Indonesia. Parasitism plays {{a central role in}} fish biology. Parasitism is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the marine environment and it is probable that all marine fishes are infected with parasites. Helminth parasitic of Rastrelliger spp. are Lechitocladium angustonum (Digenea: Hemiuridae), Lecitochirium sp. (Digenea: Hemiuridae), Prodistomum orientalis (Digenea: Lepocreadiidae) and Anisakis typica (Nematodes: Anisakidae), with 90. 12 % of prevalence. They are not significant different of helminth parasitic abundance from R. kanagurta and R. brachysoma, but significant in helminth species richness. This different of helminth species richness was because of L. angustonum dominances. The different location wasn’t have significant different of helminth parasitic abundance because Indonesian in the tropical zone. Anisakis species in Java sea have a same genetic with Anisakis typical and not zoonotic parasite kategories. The fish digestion was a microhabitat for helminth parasitik because they have much food stuff. The fish growth have significant different in helminth parasitic abundance and intencity.

40|$|The ovarian {{structure}} and reproductive health of <b>short</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Rastrelliger brachysoma {{in the upper}} Gulf of Thailand from non-breeding (October to November 2013) and breeding seasons (December 2013 to February 2014), were examined by histological and histochemical techniques. The results revealed that the ovary in this species was enclosed by the tunica albuginea. It was considered as an asynchronous type, which could be classified into seven stages based on its histological characteristics. These seven stages were oogonium, chromatin nucleolar, perinucleolar, oil droplet and cortical alveolar, early, late and post vitellogenic stages. During the oogenic processes, the change and characterization of inclusions including lipids, cortical alveoli and yolk granules were detected by histolochemical techniques. The ovarian histopathology in R brachysoma was detected. This includes ovarian degeneration, ovarian atrophy and atresia in different stages (oogonia, previtellogenic stages and vitellogenic stages) as well as melano-magcrophage centers. Atretic follicles and ovarian atrophy were also observed and could negatively affect the reproductive health of the species, {{which could lead to}} population declines in R. brachysoma as well as threaten other marine fishes connected through the food web in Thailand...|$|E
