40|$|It is {{difficult}} to separate the <b>point</b> <b>symbols</b> from the scanned topographic maps accurately, which brings challenges for {{the recognition of the}} <b>point</b> <b>symbols.</b> In this paper, based on the framework of generalized Hough transform (GHT), we propose a new algorithm, which is named shear line segment GHT (SLS-GHT), to recognize the <b>point</b> <b>symbols</b> directly in the scanned topographic maps. SLS-GHT combines the line segment GHT (LS-GHT) and the shear transformation. On the one hand, LS-GHT is proposed to represent the features of the <b>point</b> <b>symbols</b> more completely. Its R-table has double level indices, the first one is the color information of the <b>point</b> <b>symbols,</b> and the other is the slope of the line segment connected a pair of the skeleton points. On the other hand, the shear transformation is introduced to increase the directional features of the point symbols; it can make up for the directional limitation of LS-GHT indirectly. In this way, the <b>point</b> <b>symbols</b> are detected in a series of the sheared maps by LS-GHT, and the final optimal coordinates of the setpoints are gotten from a series of the recognition results. SLS-GHT detects the <b>point</b> <b>symbols</b> directly in the scanned topographic maps, totally different from the traditional pattern of extraction before recognition. Moreover, several experiments demonstrate that the proposed method allows improved recognition in complex scenes than the existing methods. </p...|$|R

Using a simple software mapping tool, 50 pairs of school students, aged 11 – 14 years, were invited to make a map involving <b>point</b> <b>symbol</b> generalisation in order to identify their map making strategies. Discourse between participating pairs was recorded and analysed for its strategic and ideational content. The quality of map made was associated with the type of talk used whilst making it. Older pairs of children used more reasoning and questioning strategies in conjunction with greater use of cartographic concepts. Thematic <b>Point</b> <b>Symbol</b> Maps Figure 1 presents an extract from a small-scale thematic map of the type common in school atlases. Maps like these have undergone a significant amount of generalisation. For some types of economic activity, a symbol may represent the location of a single large plant. For others, it may represent the ‘centre of gravity’ of a number of enterprises. Absence of a symbol at this scale may not mean absence of the referent phenomenon but merely that it exists below the threshold for inclusion on the map. Despite a substantial literature on how maps ‘work’ (summarised in MacEachren, 1995) there is little evidence about the degree t...|$|R

As situations change within a crisis, it becomes essential for maps to display both the location and status of critical entities. The current standard for point symbolization for emergency management uses static <b>point</b> <b>symbols</b> to represent location as well as entity status; however, the need to have this information update in real time introduces a dynamic element to the question of symbolization; these types of dynamic symbols are called synchronic.

For the symbols evaluation was used free choice of response. A questionnaire was undertaken to analyze the characteristics of the respondents.

This standard is intended to support the Nation's producers and users of geologic map information by providing line <b>symbols,</b> <b>point</b> <b>symbols,</b> and colors and patterns {{that can be used}} to portray the various features on geologic maps. The objective of this standard is to aid in the production of geologic maps and related products, as well as to help provide geologic maps and products that are more consistent in both their appearance and their underlying database content. A geologic map is a cartographic product that expresses information about the geology of a particular area.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} structural modifications of the 3 -, 4 -connected net known as the Pt 3 O 4 structure-type (waserite), a novel 4 -, 8 -connected structure-type was discovered. This lattice is generated by replacing the 3 -connected trigonal planar vertices of the Pt 3 O 4 structure-type with 4 -connected tetrahedral vertices, to achieve a structure which possesses a generic empirical formula of JK 6 L 8. In such a topological modification, the four 3 -fold axes of the parent cubic, Pm 3 n, Pt 3 O 4 structure-type are retained. Thus the 4 -connected tetrahedral vertices are oriented so as to preserve cubic symmetry in the resulting Pm 3, JK 6 L 8 (jubilite) lattice. The unit cell contains a single 8 -connected cubecentered vertex, six 4 -connected distorted square planar vertices and eight 4 -connected distorted tetrahedral vertices. It is a Wellsean structure with a Wells <b>point</b> <b>symbol</b> given by (4 16 6 4 8 4) (4 2 8 2) 6 (4 3 8 3) 8 and a Schläfli symbol of (5 3 / 4, 4. 2667). This latter index reveals {{a decrease in the}} lattice’s polygonality and concomitant increase in the connectivity through the transformation from waserite to jubilite. The topology of the parent waserite lattice (Pt 3 O 4) corresponds to that of the Catalan structures with the Wells <b>point</b> <b>symbol</b> (8 4) 3 (8 3) 4, which has the Schläfli symbol (8, 3. 4285).

This kind of generalization algorithm can be used to construct images which visualize the main structures of the network. Some case studies demonstrate the algorithm. ...|$|R
