Lord Thrivewell is deeply distressed by the accusation, but Lady Thrivewell assures him that she can resolve him of her innocence. She reveals that she has played a version of the bed trick (so common in English Renaissance drama), and that the woman Careless mistook for Lady Thrivewell in the dark was actually his mistress Phebe.

40|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, Catholic {{religious}} sisters in each of what became the Australian states opened a refuge for penitent women - those who bore the stigma of disgrace through failing to meet society’s <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> female <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Their transgressions may have taken the form of working as a prostitute, becoming pregnant outside of marriage, being known to have engaged in pre-marital or extra-marital <b>sexual</b> activity, or <b>of</b> demonstrating a likelihood of engaging in one of these activities. This thesis contends that for several decades the object of the refuges was to serve the immediate material and spiritual needs of the women, but that through the influence of secular domestic ideology and evangelical Protestantism, the reformers changed their aim to inculcating the penitents with the values of feminine propriety and social usefulness. It aims to show compassion for the penitent women and empathy with the reformers who tried to alleviate their suffering. However, it will be critical of the social structure that created inequality of wealth between classes and inequality of opportunity between the sexes, and of the moral code that set narrow limits for acceptable female activity and strict censure of any deviation.

Its motto proclaimed, “The old expressions are with us always, and there are always others”. Others was a site of free thinking and the disruption <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviours,</b> where poets emerge together in the categories of “queerness”. It was also a space to proclaim a strong affiliation with the local community of the Lower East Side in New York that was identified with the mixed population of an excluded group of immigrants, such as Jews. Others’ poets wanted to show a positive image of Jewish immigration. This population {{can be seen as a}} representation of social and intellectual progressivism, and the experimentation of the “new”, instead of the stereotyped figure of the self-deprecating Jew; that was profoundly perpetuated by Euromodernism or poets from Little Review. Suzanne Churchill describes it as “a house for the most innovative free verse, and representative of new literature found dangerous and offensive”. It was considered ‘dangerous’ because critics of modernism viewed the intrusion of foreignness as a contamination to the traditional style of literature, while Others’ poets saw it as an innovation. Subsequently, the transformation of the American demographics simultaneously created a change in modern literature, which celebrated the merge with other cultures, or in other words the melting pot.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} sexual cultures between 1900 and 1920. It {{is based}} on court records of trials for 'sex crime' in the Wellington Supreme Court district, which covered the lower north island. Although sex crimes were an extreme manifestation <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> practice, and court records represent only partial and constructed accounts of it, the sources can provide insight into attitudes toward sexuality in the past. In this thesis, a crime is posited as an 'extraordinary moment', capable of illuminating a variety of cultural beliefs about sexuality. Victims, their families, the accused men, criminal justice authorities and many others expressed views about codes <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> in response to sex crimes. Combined, they form a multi-layered and, at times, contested grid <b>of</b> understandings about <b>sexual</b> mores. This thesis {{is focused on the}} reconstruction of these codes <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour.</b> To do this, a case study method has been employed which traces the construction of sexuality by individuals and within the courts. The possibilities <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> pleasure and sexual danger - autonomy and victimisation - framed the meaning attached to sexual encounters by the parties involved, and by others. Such understandings were predominantly shaped by the variables of age and gender. Very young children lacked sufficient sexual knowledge to identify a sexual encounter as either sexually pleasurable or dangerous; they labelled it a physical attack. By adolescence, girls and boys were increasingly sexually aware. For them, and for adults, sexual experiences were characterised by the possibility for sexual pleasure or danger, or a mix of the two. This potential for sexuality to be experienced as pleasure shaped observers' understandings <b>of</b> codes <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Observers often conflated sexual maturity with consent: childhood was predominantly constructed as a time <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> innocence and adulthood as times <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> activity and agency. But codes <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> were also mediated by gender. Gendered constructions of character shaped self-representations and observers' understandings <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> mores. While the double <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> morality set the backdrop for the understanding <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> mores in the wider Wellington area during the early twentieth century, there were considerable variations in levels of acceptance of it. This thesis examines constructions of sexuality in relation to children, adolescents, and adults of both sexes...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{dopamine}} in the rewarding aspects <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{in female}} rats was investigated.

40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} little {{ecological}} and evolutionary research on learning in the context <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> in insects. The traditional views still dominating the literature are that insects are short-lived and have little opportunity to learn about courtship and mating. In this paper I challenge these views by illustrating, theoretically, {{that at least some}} insects have ample opportunities to learn in the context <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> and that such learning may be beneficial. Some of the best empirical evidence for learning about <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> in insects is reviewed and future directions in this fruitful area of research are suggested. The role of learning in insect <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> has probably been underestimated. Such learning may have had an important effect on sexual selection and incipient speciation.

Purpose First, the study's purpose is exploration of variables that discriminate between girls' and boys' experiences <b>of</b> unwanted <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Secondly, {{the aim is}} to find empirical grounding for diversity in schools' interventions and policies. Sample Respondents were 2808 adolescents (14 or 15 years of age) in secondary schools, randomly selected in two regions in The Netherlands. Of the 22 schools that participated in the project, 30 % were Catholic, 25 % Protestant, 11 % interdenominational (several religions within one school) and 38 % of the schools were public schools. School size varied. The majority of the students' parents were born in The Netherlands (86 %), 14 % were born in Morocco, Turkey and Surinam. Design and methods Survey questionnaires were to be completed during class time. Non-response rate: 2 %. Analysis: discriminant function analysis. Results Girls more often experienced unwanted <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> by school personnel than boys. Their experiences were more often non-verbal in nature, physical or a combination of different sorts of behaviour. Girls experienced unwanted <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviour</b> as more upsetting than boys and they also experienced more psychosomatic health problems.
