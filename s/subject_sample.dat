40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) determine whether bilateral asymmetry in cycling changed systematically with pedaling rate, (2) determine whether the dominant leg as identi"ed by kicking contributed more to average power over a crank cycle than the other leg, and (3) determine whether the dominant leg asymmetry changed systematically with pedaling rate. To achieve these objectives, data were collected from 11 subjects who pedaled at "ve di!erent pedaling rates ranging from 60 to 120 rpm at a constant workrate of 260 W. Bilateral pedal dynamometers measured two orthogonal force components in the plane of the bicycle. From these measurements, asymmetry was quanti"ed by three dependent variables, the percent di!erences in average positive power (%AP), average negative power (%AN), and average crank power (%AC). Di!erences were taken for two cases * with respect to the leg generating the greater total average for each power quantity at 60 rpm disregarding the measure of dominance, and with respect to the dominant leg as determined by kicking. Simple linear regression analyses were performed on these quantities both for the <b>subject</b> <b>sample</b> and for individual subjects. For the <b>subject</b> <b>sample,</b> only the percent di!erence in average negative power exhibited a signi"cant linear relationship with pedaling rate; as pedaling rate increased, the asymmetry decreased. Although the kicking dominant leg contributed signi"cantly greater average crank power than the non-dominant leg for the <b>subject</b> <b>sample,</b> the non-dominant leg contributed signi"cantly greater average positive power and average negative power than the dominant leg. However, no signi"cant linear relationships for any of these three quantities with pedaling rate were evident for the subject sampl...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to objectively evaluate whether three functional de-rotational knee braces stabilize an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency. The <b>subject</b> <b>sample</b> consisted of fifteen males and females with a unilateral ACL deficiency. The data for each subject was obtained using the Genucom Knee Analyzer. A right knee-left knee anterior laxity difference of 3 mm or greater served as a subject inclusion parameter for protocol completion. The inclusion criteria reduced the <b>subject</b> <b>sample</b> to a total of eleven. The study consisted of a randomized block design. The experimental design consisted of three parts: (1) an investigation of translational stability, (2) an investigation of rotatory stability, and (3) a comparison between the three braces. The analysis involved a one way ANOVA of the criterion variables; anterior laxity (ALAX), anterior midrange stiffness (AMRS), anterior endrange stiffness (AERS), internal laxity (ILAX), and translation of the lateral tibial plateau (TLTP). The AMRS characteristics differed significantly (alpha = 0. 05) at 20 $ sp circ$ flexion. The results were the following: $-$ 10. 00 $ pm$ 9. 78 N/mm for brace 1, $-$ 2. 86 $ pm$ 7. 2 N/mm for brace 2 and $-$ 41. 02 $ pm$ 14. 79 N/mm for brace 3.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMyeloid and {{plasmacytoid}} {{dendritic cell}} (DC) subsets have been recently {{identified in the}} human lung based on their differential expression of Blood DC Antigens 1 – 3 (BDCAs). We investigated the expression of these antigens by isolated human pulmonary CD 1 a+ DCs, namely Langerhan's cells. MethodsUsing an in vitro cell culture system we successfully isolated a population of relatively pure (> 70 %) CD 1 a+ cells from human lung tissue (n= 5 <b>subject</b> <b>samples)</b> and stained these with antibodies against the myeloid DC markers BDCA 1 (CD 1 c) and BDCA 3 (CD 303), the plasmacytoid DC marker BDCA 2 (CD 141), the Langerhan's cell marker Langerin and the maturation marker CD 83. ResultsAmong different <b>subject</b> <b>samples,</b> the isolated CD 1 a+ cells showed variable expression of Langerin, BDCAs and CD 83. Interestingly, in two <b>subject</b> <b>samples,</b> which contained > 70 % CD 83 + mature CD 1 a+ cells, > 50 % of the cells were positive {{for all of the}} BDCAs. ConclusionsWe conclude that isolated pulmonary CD 1 a+ DCs in vitro have the capacity to express both myeloid and plasmacytoid BDCA markers and that rather than subset restriction in pulmonary DCs, a significant degree of flexibility/plasticity can be induced, albeit experimentally...|$|R

Also, PLS can model both reflective and formative constructs [66, 67]. PLS allows parameters to be estimated independent of sample size [68].

Wold [70] illustrated the low sample size requirement for PLS by analyzing a data set consisting of 10 observations. Chin and Newsted [71] also provide evidence using a Monte Carlo simulation where they found PLS path modeling approaches can provide information about the appropriateness of indicators at a sample size as low as 20.|$|E

The quality of attachment buffers the child from anxiety and depression and is strongly related to feelings of well-being. Adolescents who feel strongly and positively attached perceive themselves more positively and competently than adolescents who report weaker or negative attachments with parents. The present investigation sought to understand {{the relationship}} between attachment to mothers and fathers of male and female adolescents and the relationship of attachment to depression. ^ Consistent with the literature, it was hypothesized that: (1) the higher the perceived quality of maternal attachment, as measured by the Inventory for Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), the lower the level of depression, as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC). (2) the higher the perceived quality of paternal attachment, the lower the level of depression. (3) females will report higher levels of depression than males. ^ The study also examined differences in parenting influences based on sex of child and sex of parent. Cross validation procedures were used in order to increase the generalizability to other samples. ^ Subjects were selected from a larger longitudinal study and were divided into three samples: (1) The 1990 Separated database consisted of 188 subjects; (2) The 1991 Separated database consisted of 166 subjects; and (3) a Within subject database followed from 1990 to 1991 consisted of 81 subjects. The questionnaire designed for this study consisted of Background information (including sex of subject and age), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC), (Weissman, Orvaschel, and Padian, 1980), and the Inventory for Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), (Armsden 2 ̆ 6 Greenberg, 1987). ^ The first hypothesis was supported in the two separated samples and in the 1990 Within <b>Subject</b> <b>sample.</b> Consistent with the literature, {{it was found that the}} higher perceived mother attachment, the lower the level of depression (CES-DC). ^ The second hypothesis was also supported in the two separated samples and in the 1990 Within <b>Subject</b> <b>sample.</b> There was a positive correlation between CES-DC and father attachment. ^ The third hypothesis was supported in the two separated samples and in the 1990 Within <b>Subject</b> <b>sample.</b> There was a positive correlation between CES-DC and sex with females reporting higher levels of depression than males. ^ The results of multiple regressions for the 1990 Separated year was that sex and paternal attachment were significant predictors of depression. The results of multiple regressions for 1991 Separated year revealed mother attachment, sex and father attachment respectively were significant predictors of depression. For the 1990 Within Subject database, the significant predictors were sex, mother attachment and father attachment, respectively. For 1991 Within Subject database, there were no significant predictors of depression. Cross validation procedures for the separated data suggest that the results may be generalizable to other samples. Cross validation procedures for within were partially supportive of the model.
