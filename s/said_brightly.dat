6000|$|... 'I'll come {{tomorrow}} afternoon,' she <b>said</b> <b>brightly.</b> Between Fanny and Mrs. Goodall, his mother, {{there was}} naturally no love lost.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right, old fellow,' he <b>said</b> <b>brightly.</b> 'Don't {{come up to}} me. I'm incog. till I'm up and dressed. Are you in {{the same}} mind?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, how dreadful!" [...] she <b>said</b> <b>brightly.</b> [...] "I {{thought all}} {{boys and girls}} looked upon Christmas as the very best time in the year." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} catch at these words--that he remembered, too, long afterwards--and <b>said,</b> more <b>brightly,</b> 'Yes, Mr Clennam; yes, you may!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fathers do not {{ask their}} children's pardon,' <b>said</b> Eustacie, <b>brightly,</b> but then, with sudden dismay, 'Ah! you have not said I {{should go to the}} Moustier again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{returned}} Hare, [...] "but I--I'll never ride again." [...] He <b>said</b> it <b>brightly,</b> smiling the while; {{still the}} look in his eyes belied the cheerful resignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{had thought}} of that," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> almost. [...] "Yes! Himself, his wife, four children--one cabin might do. Whereas if his niece went..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{these are}} gone I'll get no more except linsey ones," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> yet her eyes shone with a wistful {{uncertainty}} of the future.|$|E
6000|$|She {{pressed her}} lips together. [...] "I see," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>brightly.</b> [...] "But then, was I not detestable too? so stubborn, so wilful, so demented, so--vain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is Italian {{blood in}} him,' <b>said</b> Charlotte <b>brightly.</b> 'For {{he spoke to}} me with an Italian accent. But I can't think whether he is {{a boy or a}} man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, {{daughter}} of the Tawaras," [...] <b>said</b> Madame <b>brightly</b> to her. [...] "We {{have been waiting for}} you. Good-morning, and all happiness, eh? Look, it is a gift-day for you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] <b>said</b> Jock, <b>brightly,</b> [...] "it {{only means}} that we have {{something}} and somebody to work for now;" [...] and he threw his arms round her waist and kissed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would want to have it again," [...] Grizel <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> {{producing}} the little parcel from her pocket, [...] "so I brought it to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jude," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> {{when he had}} {{finished}} and come back to her; [...] "will you let me make you a NEW New Testament, like the one I made for myself at Christminster?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ippegoo {{hesitated a}} moment. He felt just then so unusually solemn {{that he had}} {{difficulty}} in conceiving it possible to become more so, but remembering the change {{that was about to}} take place, he <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> [...] "Yes, I'll remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{the nearest}} {{approach}} to fetching the moon, I suppose," [...] <b>said</b> Ermine, <b>brightly.</b> [...] "It was {{very kind to}} me, for I was longing to see you, and I am glad to find you looking better than I expected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and we'll all claim kin!" [...] <b>said</b> Abraham <b>brightly</b> {{from under}} the bedstead. [...] "And we'll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her; and we'll ride in her coach and wear black clothes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were nearly}} making a bloomer!" [...] <b>said</b> Miss Willoughby <b>brightly.</b> [...] "You must be absent-minded, Mr. Marson--like his lordship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When my father, sir," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> [...] "tells {{you about}} my being {{interested}} in other people, even though they know nothing about me--which, by the bye, I told you myself--you ought to know how that comes about. That's my father's doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheero!" [...] he <b>said</b> <b>brightly</b> as he seated {{himself in}} my easy-chair and tapped {{the end of}} one of my {{cigarettes}} upon the tablecloth. [...] "I haven't been up so early for months, but I had to find you before you went out-- about these Bundercombes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, you {{can keep}} it,' she <b>said</b> <b>brightly.</b> 'It was very {{good of you to}} bring it back. But keep it for your very own. Take Mr. Glanville at his word, and don't explain. And, Tabitha, divide the strands into two bracelets; there are enough of them to make a pair.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Meaning {{our three}} banking-house friends, L, S, and who's the junior partner? D?" [...] <b>said</b> Mr. Skimpole, <b>brightly.</b> [...] "Not {{an idea of}} them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --You never know, <b>said</b> {{the dean}} <b>brightly.</b> We never {{can say what}} is in us. I most {{certainly}} should not be despondent. PER ASPERA AD ASTRA.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was much}} pleased," [...] <b>said</b> Anne <b>brightly.</b> [...] "He {{says there is}} a great {{improvement}} in them and he thinks the danger of her losing her sight completely is past. But he says she'll never be able to read much or do any fine hand-work again. How are your preparations for your bazaar coming on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{no longer}} {{quiescent}} in his chair; he wandered about the room, he dropped on the couch beside her. But as he awkwardly stretched his hand toward her fragile, immaculate fingers, she <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> [...] "Do give me a cigarette. Would you think poor Tanis was dreadfully naughty if she smoked?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You mustn't {{make too}} much of all this, my love,' he <b>said</b> <b>brightly.</b> 'These little things are always liable to happen to a man of business; they are the perils of the profession, {{and we have to}} put up with them, just as kings and queens {{have to put up with}} bomb-shells.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Happily Uncle Jim did {{not notice}} it. [...] "Now, then, old pard," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> [...] "we'll have a gay old time to-night--one of our jamborees! I've got some whiskey here and a deck o' cards, and we'll have a little game, you understand, but not for 'keeps' now! No, siree; we'll play for beans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tito, it was you, I know," [...] <b>said</b> Romola, smiling <b>brightly,</b> {{and kissing}} him. [...] "How {{is it you}} never care about {{claiming}} anything? And after that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I should travel {{all over}} the island," [...] <b>said</b> the fairy, <b>brightly,</b> [...] "and that is what I long to do. I do not care to work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean it," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt Plessington <b>brightly.</b> [...] "Think {{if we had}} a Dickens--and you are {{the nearest}} man alive to Dickens--on the side of social reform to-day!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They didna ask {{the right}} questions," [...] she told him, and when the warper asked if Tommy had said so, she {{declared}} that he had refused {{to say a word}} against them, which seemed to her to cover him with glory. [...] "But he doubted they would make that mistake afore he started, she <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> so you see he saw through them afore ever he set eyes on them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{that was}} enough, Strether had felt while his answer hung fire. He had {{felt at the}} same time, however, that nothing could less become him than that it should hang fire too long. [...] "Yes," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>brightly,</b> [...] "it was on the happy {{settlement}} of the question that I started. You see therefore to what tune I'm in your family. Moreover," [...] he added, [...] "I've been supposing you'd suppose it." ...|$|E
60|$|Sheila let {{fall the}} lid; and yet {{for a while}} her eyes roved over it as if in violent search for something. Then she turned: 'I am so very glad the vicar was at home,' she <b>said</b> <b>brightly.</b> 'And mind, mind you rest, Arthur. There's nothing so bad {{but it might be}} worse.... Oh, I can't, I can't bear it!' She sat down in the chair and huddled her face between her hands, sobbing on and on, without a tear.|$|E
6000|$|... "My errand won't {{take very}} long," [...] <b>said</b> Frances <b>brightly.</b> [...] "Mother {{wants you to}} spend Thanksgiving Day with us, Miss Price, {{if you have no}} other engagement. We will have a few other guests, but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley, who is the law partner and {{intimate}} friend of my brother Ernest in town. You'll come, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' <b>said</b> Mr Bethany, <b>brightly,</b> 'so {{your wife}} was saying. [...] "Fell asleep," [...] so have I too--scores of times'; he beamed, with {{beads of sweat}} glistening on his forehead. 'And then? I'm not, I'm not persisting?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{feel that}} I {{know the truth}} about {{anything}} till I've read them both!" [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Plumer <b>brightly,</b> tapping the table of contents with her bare red hand, upon which the ring looked so incongruous.|$|R
