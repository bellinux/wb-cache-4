The furnace shell and roof may be cooled either by water circulated through pipes which form a panel, or by water sprayed on the panel elements. Tubular panels may be replaced when they become cracked or reach their thermal stress life cycle. <b>Spray</b> <b>cooling</b> is the most economical and is the highest efficiency cooling method. A <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> piece of equipment can be relined almost endlessly; equipment that lasts 20 years is the norm. However while a tubular leak is immediately noticed in an operating furnace due to the pressure loss alarms on the panels, at this time there exists no immediate way of detecting a very small volume <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> leak. These typically hide behind slag coverage and can hydrate the refractory in the hearth leading to a break out of molten metal or in the worst case a steam explosion.|$|E

With the increase of water spraying flux, the gas temperature and the evaporation rate of water droplets tend to decrease. The decrease of gas temperature can be restrained by the phenomenon of “water assembled”, after the spraying flux rise to a certain value with continued increase.

The objective {{of this study was to}} establish the potential benefits of improving the performance of the current gas turbine plant into a more advanced cycle with high efficiency and power output through inlet air cooling. Problem statement: The hypothesis was that the low performance of the gas turbine plant was caused by high ambient temperature, the use of <b>spray</b> <b>cooler</b> was adopted to bring the air condition temperature close to ISO condition. Approach: In this study, performance characteristics were determined for a set of actual operational conditions including ambient temperature, relative humidity, turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Results: The results obtained show that the use of a <b>spray</b> <b>cooler</b> on the existing gas turbine cycle gives a better thermal efficiency and less irreversibility rate in the components system and the entire plant. The power output of the gas turbine plant with <b>spray</b> <b>cooler</b> was found to have increased by over 7 %, accompanied by 2. 7 % increase in machine efficiency with a reduction in specific fuel consumption of 2. 05 and 10. 03 % increase in the energy of exhaust.

50|$|The {{low-pressure}} core {{spray system}} is designed to suppress steam generated by a major contingency. As such, it prevents reactor vessel pressure from going above the point where LPCI and LPCS would be ineffective, which is above 32 atm (3200 kPa, 465 psi). It activates below that level, and delivers approximately 48,000 L/min (12,500 US gal/min) of water in a deluge {{from the top of}} the core. The core spray system collapses steam voids above the core, aids in reducing reactor pressure when the fuel is uncovered, and, in the event the reactor has a break so large that water level cannot be maintained, core spray is capable of preventing fuel damage by ensuring the fuel is adequately sprayed to remove decay heat. In earlier versions of the BWR (BWR 1 or 2 plants), the LPCS system was the only ECCS, and the core could be adequately cooled by core spray even if it was completely uncovered.

40|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>cooling</b> {{has proven}} to be {{efficient}} in managing thermal load in high power applications. Reliability of electronic products lies on the thermal management and understanding of heat transfer mechanisms of the most commonly used thermal management schemes such as <b>spray</b> <b>cooling.</b> Many experiments have been done to understand the heat transfer mechanisms associated with <b>spray</b> <b>cooling.</b> However, most of them have relied on comprehensive <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> experiments where multiple physical variables are at play simultaneously. Furthermore, experiments with single streams of droplets {{have not been able to}} elucidate the effects of the onset of boiling (ONB) during the droplet impingement process. Therefore, efforts have been undertaken to consider the effects of using three droplet streams arranged in a triangulated fashion. The effects of using triangulated multiple droplet impingements on the suppression or enhancement of boiling on heated surfaces has been investigated. Moreover, the effects of using screen laminated on the suppression of ONB during the droplet impingement process has been studied in detail. The main goal of this project is to study the effects of multiple droplet impingement on the flat heater surface in the <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> with and without the use of metallic screen laminates. Single and triple droplet impingement experiments have been performed to understand the droplet behavior in <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> systems where multiple droplets simultaneously impact a heated surface. The experiments consisted of using a stainless steel screen laminate over a sample surface to observe the suppression or enhancement of pool boiling which tends to occur at the periphery of each droplet impingement zone. An infrared-based imaging technique was used to measure surface temperature during droplet impingement. The heat transfer performance has been evaluated in terms of heat flux, droplet frequency and volume flow rate. The results indicate that droplet stream spacing and the use of copper meshes can enhance surface cooling significantly. Specifically, droplet stream spacing of 1000 ?m with copper meshes with a 6 mm hole and gap of 0. 2 mm lead to enhanced surface cooling during the multiple droplet impingement process. It is expected that the results and conclusions of this study will be useful in understanding the physics of <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> which should help design better <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> system...|$|E

40|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>cooling</b> is a {{technique}} for achieving large heat fluxes at low surface temperatures by impinging a liquid in droplet form on a heated surface. Heat is removed by droplets spreading across the surface, thus removing heat by evaporation and {{by an increase in}} the convective heat transfer coefficient. The addition of nano-sized particles, like aluminum or copper, to water to create a nanofluid could further enhance the <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> process. Nanofluids have been shown to have better thermophysical properties when compared to water, like enhanced thermal conductivity. Although droplet size, velocity, impact angle and the roughness of the heated surface are all factors that determine the amount of heat that can be removed, the dominant driving mechanism for heat dissipation by <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> is difficult to determine. In the current study, experiments were conducted to compare the enhancement to heat transfer caused by using alumina nanofluids during <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> instead of de-ionized water for the same nozzle pressure and distance from the heated surface. The fluids were sprayed on a heated copper surface at a constant distance of 21 mm.

The nanofluids showed an enhancement during the single-phase heat transfer and an increase in the critical heat flux (CHF).

40|$|Phase change {{technology}} is a science that is continually finding new applications, from passive refrigeration cycles to semiconductor cooling. The primary heat transfer techniques associated with phase change heat transfer are pool boiling, flow boiling, and <b>spray</b> <b>cooling.</b> Of these techniques, <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> is the least studied {{and the most recent}} to receive attention in the scientific community. <b>Spray</b> <b>cooling</b> is capable of removing large amounts of heat between the cooled surface and the liquid, with reported heat flux capabilities of up to 1000 W/cm 2 for water. Many previous studies have emphasized heat flux as a function of spray parameters and test conditions. Enhanced <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> investigations to date have been limited to surface roughness studies. These studies concluded that surface tolerance (i. e. variations in machined surface finish) had an impact upon heat flux when using pressure atomized sprays. Analogous pool boiling studies with enhanced surfaces have shown heat flux enhancement. A <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> study using enhanced surfaces beyond the surface roughness range may display heat flux enhancement as well. In the present study, a group of extended and embedded surfaces (straight fins, cubic pin fins, pyramids, dimples and porous tunnels) have been investigated {{to determine the effects of}} enhanced surface structure on heat flux. The surface enhancements were machined on the top surface of copper heater blocks with a cross-sectional area of 2. 0 cm 2. Measurements were also obtained on a flat surface for baseline comparison purposes. Thermal performance data was obtained under saturated (pure fluid at 101 kPa), nominally degassed (chamber pressure of 41. 4 kPa) and gassy conditions (chamber with N 2 gas at 101 kPa).
