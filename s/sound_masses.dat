50|$|Besides being {{influenced}} by composers such as Varèse and Xenakis who dealt with <b>sound</b> <b>masses,</b> Dusapin’s music also shows {{the influence of}} other musical traditions, including jazz. In fact, he was once a jazz pianist, though up until 1997 he refused to include piano in his compositions. Beginning in the late 1980s with his piece Aks (1987) and continuing into the 1990s, Dusapin incorporated French folk music into his musical language. In Aks, commissioned by the Société des Amis du Musé des Arts et Traditions Populaires, Dusapin immediately quotes a folk-melody, {{but the rest of}} the piece is composed independently from the folk song. Dusapin’s work from the 1990s further illustrates the influence of folk music through its frequent use of drones and use of restricted modes, though most often without obvious tonal centers. Other sources of inspiration include graphic arts and poetry.|$|E
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{sketches of}} the score reveal insights into his compositional procedure. The sketch for Polymorphia is 33 pages long and is ordered and numbered in reverse chronology. The complete draft {{of the score}} appears first, followed by sketches “which grow progressively more fragmented and graphically abstract.” The earlier sketches are abstract graphic drawings made from Penderecki’s aural concepts. From these, he formulated pitch material and formal structure. Finally a shorthand notation was applied which could be translated into the complete piece of music. This score, {{as well as others}} in the sonoristic style, are notated in cutout format. Also, the sketches are visually impressive with their use of red, green, blue, and black ballpoint ink. Also noteworthy is Penderecki’s encephalographic pitch notation in the second A section from rehearsals 57 through 60. Here, he bases the composition on actual electroencephalograms, which are representations of brain waves. These were recorded at the Kraków Medical Center as patients listened to a recording of his Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima.

Jolivet {{developed}} {{an interest in the}} arts early in his life, taking up painting and cello lessons at the age of 14. However, he was encouraged by his parents to become a teacher, going to teachers' college and teaching primary school in Paris (taking three years in between to serve in the military). One of his own teachers, however, believed Jolivet had a future in music, strongly encouraged him to pursue composition, and introduced him to Paul Le Flem, Jolivet's first teacher in composition. Le Flem gave Jolivet a firm grounding in classical forms of harmony and counterpoint. After hearing his first concert of Arnold Schoenberg, Jolivet became interested in atonal music, and then on Le Flem's recommendation became the only European student of Edgard Varèse, who passed on his knowledge of musical acoustics, atonal music, <b>sound</b> <b>masses,</b> and orchestration. In 1936 Jolivet co-founded the group La jeune France along with composers Olivier Messiaen, Daniel-Lesur, and Yves Baudrier, who were attempting to re-establish a more human and less abstract form of composition. La jeune France developed from the avant-garde chamber music society La Spirale, formed by Jolivet, Messiaen, and Lesur the previous year.|$|E

40|$|By {{the middle}} of the 1960 s, only a couple of years after his {{defection}} from Hungary to Austria and West Germany, Ligeti had already achieved canonical status in Western circles of contemporary music, even if more in German speaking countries than in English speaking ones. As a by-product of this extremely quick process, Ligeti was identified with the new musical language of ‚Klangkomposition‘ (sound-mass music) and micropolyphonic texture, an identification that has stuck with him since — the works written from 1958 to 1967, and Atmosphères in particular, remain by far his best known and most frequently cited compositions.

The generated source material consisted of several rhythmic strata whose pitches, mainly part of diatonic, octatonic or chromatic collections, followed the contour of the entered shape. With this visual process, it was also possible to explore the creation of contrapuntal textures by entering diagrams of lines representing the path of each contrapuntal voice. **This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

40|$|In his {{so-called}} "sonoristic" {{period of the}} early 1960 s [...] represented by pieces such as Threnody, Fluorescences, Polymorphia, and others [...] Penderecki employed a compositional system whose axiomatic concept {{was not a single}} sound, but the sound matter in its totality. Distinct states of this sound matter were governed by two relatively independent systems: (1) a basic system which ruled the texture of <b>sound</b> <b>masses</b> and (2) a timbre system governing their sound color. Categories of the basic system are a few binary oppositions concerning pitch, time, and loudness: spatial mobility vs. immobility, temporal mobility vs. immobility, spatial continuity vs. discontinuity, temporal continuity vs. discontinuity, high vs. low register, loud vs. soft dynamics. These categories account for the morphology of the basic system because a combination of terms chosen from individual categories generates an inventory of units in Penderecki's sonoristic style. The same set of categories also determines syntax, as the temporal order of units in the course of musical narration is ruled by the internal logic of individual binary oppositions. Categories of the timbre system are in turn metal, wood, and leather [...] materials of which the sound sources of traditional musical instruments are most often made [...] forming a ternary opposition. The timbre system underlies the wealth of new musical tools as well as eccentric playing techniques on traditional instruments called for by the composer...|$|E

[...] Bartók employs both diatonic and chromatic clusters in his Fourth String Quartet (1928). The <b>sound</b> <b>mass</b> technique in such works as Ruth Crawford Seeger's String Quartet (1931) and Iannis Xenakis's Metastaseis (1955) is an elaboration of the tone cluster.

[...] Clusters appear in two sections of the electronic music of Stockhausen's Kontakte (1958–60)—first as [...] "hammering points...very difficult to synthesize", according to Robin Maconie, then as glissandi. In 1961, Ligeti wrote perhaps the largest cluster chord ever—in the orchestral Atmosphères, every note in the chromatic scale over a range of five octaves is played at once (quietly).

40|$|Narrativity {{in music}} is seldom {{connected}} to the compositions based on aleatoric procedures {{and the use of}} <b>sound</b> <b>masses.</b> Yet, it can be demonstrated that the first movement of Witold Lutosławski's Second Symphony projects a meaningful set of relations which is later called into question and reconfigured, thus meeting {{at least some of the}} conditions for narratological approach. The attention is focused on the tone pitch parameter and in that sense it can be noticed that the movement is founded on the alternation of twelve-note aggregate and symmetrical, all-combinatorial hexachord 012678. This description suggests invariance, the lack of directed movement, since both tonal arrays are characterised by a high level of entropy. In spite of this, there is a clear effort to achieve a directed movement, as a result of the procedures used to organise tonal pitches, and, especially, as a result of the treatment of hexachords. The paper will investigate how the flow of events in this movement can be related to the system of mythos - the archetypal narrative categories - as were first defined by the Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye, and adjusted for musical narrative by Byron Almén. The system is based on the intersection of the two fundamental opposites: defeat/victory and order/disorder, resulting in four categories: comedy, romance, irony/satire and tragedy. No matter how paradoxical it may seem, it is the abovementioned entropy that can be considered as the initial order, and its disorder is achieved by attempts to establish directed movement. The ambivalence of archetypal categories and their interweaving is not uncommon in the narrative process. Therefore, the possibility of various interpretations of narrative trajectory will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to provide an {{analytical}} entry point into my compositional practice, I have identified eight themes which are significantly recurrent: reduction – {{the selection of a}} small number of elements; imperfection – a damaged or warped characteristic of sound; hierarchy – a concern with the roles of instruments with regard to their relative prominence; motion – apparently static <b>sound</b> <b>masses</b> consist of fine internal movement; listener perception – expectations for change influence the experience of affect; translation – the transitioning of electronic sounds to the acoustic realm, and vice versa; immersion – the creation of an accommodating soundscape; blurring – smearing and overlapping sounds or genres.

These include the minimalist compositions of Steve Reich and Arvo Pärt; the lo-fi aesthetic of Boards of Canada and My Bloody Valentine; concerns with political hierarchy in the work of Louis Andriessen; the variations of dynamics and microtonal shifts of Giacinto Scelsi; Leonard B.
