5000|$|Full {{floating}} variants {{are common}} while <b>Semi-floating</b> <b>axles</b> exist, but are less common. Axle spline count varies, with 30 spline {{being the most}} common.|$|R
50|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 53 is an {{automotive}} {{rear axle}} produced by Dana-Spicer used in medium to {{heavy duty truck}} applications. The Dana/Spicer Model 53 (Dana 53) is a <b>semi-float</b> <b>axle</b> that was produced from 1947-1965, both with a 53 differential and wheel ends, and with a Dana 44 differential and Dana 53 wheel ends.|$|R
50|$|The Ford 9 inch {{rear axle}} {{is known as}} one of the most popular axles in {{automotive}} history. Ford ended its production in 1986 when it was replaced by the Ford 8.8 inch axle. However, aftermarket companies still produce this axle. The Ford 9 inch is a <b>semi-floating,</b> drop-out <b>axle.</b> It had a GAWR up to 3600 lbs.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle {{initially}} had a three-speed {{manual transmission}} driving the rear roadwheels via a <b>semi-floating</b> live rear <b>axle.</b> [...] Later models had a four speed transmission option.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana 53 first {{appeared}} in the late 1940s and is much like a Dana 60. Although all Dana 53s are <b>semi-floating,</b> rear <b>axles,</b> 9.25" [...] ring gear diameter. It was used as OEM in 1960s full-size (C-body) Chrysler passenger cars equipped with the 440 CID engine. The Dana 53 was phased out in the late 1960s, replaced by the Dana 60.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana 61 {{was made}} in <b>semi-float</b> and full-float <b>axles</b> for select 4×2 and 4x4 Ford -ton and 1 Ton Pickups and Vans from 1974 to 1987. A Dana 61 front axle was {{selectively}} used in Dodge 4×4 -ton and 1 Ton pickups from 1987 to 1993. Although 3.07:1 and 3.31:1 gear sets are common for a Dana 61, lower gear sets deeper than (4.10:1 on down) are not.|$|R
50|$|For 1954, IHC {{introduced}} the new R-100, which looked exactly as the R-110, but cost US$ 60 less, and carried some improvements. including {{a bit more}} horsepower, improved gear ratios, larger brakes, more flexible springs. With a 4,200 lbs GVW (4,600 lbs on R-102) riding a 115 in wheelbase, the power came from a Silver Diamond 220 cid (3.6L), in-line 6-cylinder engine with overhead valves, 104 hp and a 7:1 compression ratio (up from 100 hp and 6.5:1 on the R-110), driving a 3-speed transmission and a <b>semi-floating</b> rear <b>axle.</b> By mid '54 {{it could also be}} had with an overdrive transmission which provided a 30% reduction in engine speed at 60 miles per hour, or with a torque converter fully automatic transmission (basically a GM sourced 3-speed Hydramatic). Power steering also became an option. Tire size was 6.00x16 6 ply.|$|R
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a <b>semi-floating</b> or non-floating <b>axle</b> assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle shaft flange is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|R
