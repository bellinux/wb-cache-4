5|$|The basic {{game was}} prototyped in a <b>single</b> <b>night,</b> {{but the team}} spent over half a year iterating through {{variations}} on the idea with visual themes such as sushi and chess.

5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their <b>single</b> <b>night</b> of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E

5|$|American Graffiti is a 1973 American coming-of-age comedy film {{directed}} and co-written by George Lucas starring Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Harrison Ford, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips, Bo Hopkins, and Wolfman Jack. Suzanne Somers and Joe Spano also {{appear in the}} film. Set in Modesto, California in 1962, the film is {{a study of the}} cruising and rock and roll cultures popular among the post–World War II baby boom generation. The film is told in a series of vignettes, telling the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over a <b>single</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
5|$|From January until May, the Parrett {{provides}} {{a source of}} European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a <b>single</b> <b>night.</b> The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.|$|E
5|$|From early on, ascetics {{have played}} a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They {{contribute}} towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a <b>single</b> <b>night.</b> Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of sannyasi in the sect. Prominent paramhansas included Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Gunatitanand Swami, Premanand Swami, Nishkulanand Swami, and Nityanand Swami.|$|E

5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring in a <b>single</b> <b>night</b> in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, {{were the main}} fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Levels {{have few}} wooded areas, just {{occasional}} willow trees. The landscape {{is dominated by}} grassland, mostly used as pasture for dairy farming with approximately 70per cent of the area being grassland and 30per cent arable. From January until May, the River Parrett provides a source of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a <b>single</b> <b>night.</b> The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is one of}} {{the major}} inner {{satellites}} of Saturn along with Dione, Tethys, and Mimas. It orbits at 238,000km from Saturn's center and 180,000km from its cloud tops, between the orbits of Mimas and Tethys. It orbits Saturn every 32.9 hours, fast enough for its motion to be observed over a <b>single</b> <b>night</b> of observation. Enceladus is currently in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Dione, completing two orbits around Saturn for every one orbit completed by Dione. This resonance maintains Enceladus's orbital eccentricity (0.0047), which is known as a forced eccentricity. This non-zero eccentricity results in tidal deformation of Enceladus. The dissipated heat resulting from this deformation is the main heating source for Enceladus's geologic activity. Enceladus orbits within the densest part of Saturn's E ring, the outermost of its major rings, and is the main source of the ring's material composition.|$|E

50|$|For many centuries, up to 1925, astronomers {{counted the}} hours and days from noon, {{because it was}} the easiest solar event to measure accurately. An {{advantage}} of this method (used in the Julian Date system, in which a new Julian Day begins at noon) is that the date doesn't change during a <b>single</b> <b>night's</b> observing.|$|R
5|$|Many {{years prior}} to the game's events, the world was {{controlled}} by King , who ruled the kingdom bearing his name. Originally a kind man, a spell to bring his people prosperity drained his goodness, causing him to turn into a vicious dictator who declared war on the rest of Erion. During his conquests, the Cauldron went wild and destroyed the kingdom in a <b>single</b> <b>night</b> — everyone was cursed and transformed into Pookas, while Valentine's kingdom was reduced to a wasteland. In the aftermath of Valentine's fall, Ragnanival and Ringford had become Erion's most powerful nations, while the other nations have become weak in comparison. At the game's opening, Ragnanival and Ringford are at war over the possession of the Cauldron in the wasteland of Valentine, as each see the Cauldron as too dangerous for the other to possess.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in a <b>single</b> <b>night.</b> Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} in {{the amount}} of parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E
5|$|Until 2001, {{participation}} in the festival was limited to a <b>single</b> <b>night.</b> The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system {{was seen as a}} major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semifinals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semifinals and final since 2003.|$|E
