Hurwitz <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Were You was partially inspired by the NPR show Car Talk, in that their audience listens for the banter between the two hosts, not necessarily the questions themselves.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, Haber {{spent four}} days {{training}} with Championship side West Bromwich Albion. After impressing during the trial, Haber signed for West Brom {{for an undisclosed}} fee, agreeing to personal terms and passing his medical on January 12, 2010. On joining the club, Haber said that [...] "The club were pretty straightforward with me from day one. They <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was given the opportunity, they would work to improve me as a young player". He was given a squad number of 40.|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 2007, in an {{unexpected}} turn of events, Henry {{was transferred to}} Barcelona for €24million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in the United States on July 25, 2008. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carter <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> Want to Believe proved successful, he would propose a third movie that {{would return to the}} television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. The film grossed $4 million on its opening day in the United States. It opened fourth on the U.S. weekend box office chart, with a gross of $10.2 million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $20,982,478 domestically and an additional $47,373,805 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $68,369,434. Among 2008 domestic releases, it finished in 114th place. The film's stars both claimed that the timing of the movie's release, a week after the highly popular Batman film The Dark Knight, negatively affected its success. The film received mixed to negative reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream film critics, reported [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews, with an average score of 47 based on 33 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 32% of 160 listed film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The website wrote of the critics' consensus stating; [...] "The chemistry between leads David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do live up to The X-Files televised legacy, but the roving plot and droning routines make it hard to identify just what we're meant to believe in." ...|$|E

He also participates in master classes and community outreach activities associated with the program. [...] "Out of my desire to give something back to the jazz community, I wanted to get involved. In fact, I've always <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wasn't a musician, that I would like to be a teacher. So I was glad to get involved and {{to be a part of}} this unique program that fosters such an open and accessible environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|I have it now. Many years ago, when I was {{studying}} for the gallows, I had a dear comrade, a youth {{who was not}} in my line, but still a scrupulously good fellow though devious. He was preparing {{to qualify for a}} place on the board, for {{there was going to be}} a vacancy by superannuation in about five years. This was down South, in the slavery days. It was the nature of the negro then, as now, to steal watermelons. They stole three of the melons of an adoptive brother of mine, the only good ones he had. I suspected three of a neighbor’s negroes, but there was no proof, and, besides, the watermelons in those negroes’ private patches were all green and small and not up to indemnity standard. But in the private patches of three other negroes there was a number of competent melons. I consulted with my comrade, the understudy of the board. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would approve his arrangements he would arrange. I said, “Consider me the board; I approve; arrange.” So he took a gun and went and collected three large melons for my brother-on-the-halfshell, and one over. I was greatly pleased and asked: ...|$|E

2500|$|In several {{interviews}} that Carter gave {{around the time}} the film came out, he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> Want to Believe proved financially successful, a third installment would be made {{going back to the}} TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the series finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. Fox Chairman Tom Rothman, responding to an interview question regarding the possibility of a third X-Files movie, said in October 2008, [...] "It's really up to Chris , David [...] and Gillian [...] ". During an interview at the Sarajevo Film Festival in August 2009, Anderson was asked about a third film and responded, [...] "They talked about maybe doing it in 2012. I think there were discussions about that. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not, but there isn't any reason not to do it." [...] Frank Spotnitz responded to his blog readers' requests for clarification regarding Anderson's comments by denying that any deal was in place, saying, [...] "I'm afraid I have no news to report other than our continuing desire to make a third film if there's an audience for it." [...] In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said that he wanted to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but still did not know if he would get the chance.|$|E

60|$|I {{may have}} <b>said</b> before, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{were going to}} be hanged myself, I think I should take an {{accurate}} note of my sensations, request to stop at some Public-house on the road to Tyburn and be provided with a private room and writing-materials, and give an account of my state of mind. Then, gee up, carter! beg your reverence to continue your apposite, though not novel, remarks on my situation;--and so we drive up to Tyburn turnpike, where an expectant crowd, the obliging sheriffs, and the dexterous and rapid Mr. Ketch are already in waiting.|$|R

60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. When I {{was going}} away he <b>said</b> to me <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever {{could give him}} any private {{information}} of real value he would make me a very rich man. I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless. Six weeks later certain private documents passed through my hands.|$|R
60|$|When I for {{the first}} time heard that letter read, nine years ago, I felt that it was the most {{remarkable}} one I had ever encountered.

Well, I visited St. Louis, but I did not hunt for Mr. Brown; for, alas! the investigations of long ago had proved that the benevolent Brown, like 'Jack Hunt,' was not a real person, but a sheer invention of that gifted rascal, Williams--burglar, Harvard graduate, son of a clergyman.|$|R
5000|$|As a protest, Fillipetti {{promised to}} carry both flags of Israel and the Palestinians {{in the next}} {{demonstration}} as a message of peace and solidarity with Israel's right to exist. As a result, she received threats and an urged meeting of the Green Party decided to forbid party activists to carry any national flag. Fillipetti honored the decision, but <b>said</b> <b>that</b> anti-war protests were still full with Iraq and Palestinian flags. [...] "It was a violent event" [...] she recalls.

60|$|Another {{thing that}} tormented me was my failure to see Zikali.

This {{might or might not}} be true; at any rate I could find no possible way of coming face to face with him, or even of getting a message to his ear. No, I was not to blame; I had done all I could, and yet in my heart I felt guilty. But then, as cynics would, say, failure is guilt.|$|R
