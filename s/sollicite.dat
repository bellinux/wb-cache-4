There is great joy in this Court for his being taken, and a hundred thousand crownes, I am told very privately, set upon his head; the French Ambassador in England watcht him, and hee has given the intelligence here of his being employed by the King, and sent into Switzerland by my Master to draw the Swisses into the Triple League. Hee aggravates the business as much as hee can to the prejudice of my Master to value his owne service the more, and they seeme here to wonder that the King my Master should have imployed or countenanced a man that had so base a design against the King's Person, I {{had a great deal of}} discourse with Monsieur about it, but I did positively say that he had noe relation to my knowledge to the King my Master, and if he should have I make a question or noe whither in this case the King will owne him.

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} {{is based on}} longitudinal studies relying on the essential values of the humanist psychology and more precisely the person-centered approach (PCA). The fieldwork of this thesis is carried out with mentally disabled children. The concept of person takes a crucial place in our working plan which focuses on the subjective experience of children and their mental health. In order to operationalize the PCA, we chose to work with two tools, i. e. the "Three Trees" test (TTT) and the "Notebook of the Tree". Afterwards, we analyzed the positive impact of the psychological mechanisms implied in these tests. The child's resources are indeed mobilized thanks to them, and this mobilization consequently reduces personality disorders (and can even suppress them) and increases the activation of the cognitive processes. The psychological accompaniment that we used in our work promotes a theory which respects and acknowledges the subject. It also makes the person respectable and recognizes {{his or her ability}} to change. La recherche qualitative repose sur une étude longitudinale portée par les valeurs fondamentales de la psychologie humaniste et plus précisément, celles de l'approche centrée sur la personne (l'ACP). L'expérience du terrain s'effectue auprès d'enfants en situation de handicap mental. Le concept de personne prend une place prépondérante dans le dispositif axé sur l'expérience subjective de l'enfant et sur sa santé mentale. Afin d'opérationnaliser l'ACP, nous utilisons deux outils : l'épreuve des trois arbres (l'ETA) et le cahier de l'arbre, nous analyserons l'impact positif des mécanismes psychologiques <b>sollicités</b> qui mobilisent les ressources de l'enfant facilitant ainsi, une diminution de certains troubles de la personnalité (voire leur suppression) et l'activation des processus cognitifs. L'accompagnement psychologique met en avant une théorie de la personne respectée, respectable, reconnue et en capacité à advenir...|$|R

Cette recherche a pour objectif de tester l'hypothèse d'exposition sélective à l'information de prévention du tabagisme en utilisant une mesure implicite de l'attitude en complément des mesures traditionnellement utilisées. Quarante-quatre fumeurs et 80 non-fumeurs, agents ou stagiaires d'un institut de formation ont pris part à cette étude. Les participants étaient <b>sollicités</b> sous prétexte de participer à la conception d'une formation sur les conduites addictives. Ils devaient se prononcer sur l'importance à accorder à six addictions parmi lesquelles le tabagisme. Un phénomène d'exposition sélective au regard du comportement tabagique a été mis en évidence. De plus, l'attitude implicite envers le tabac est prédictive des scores d'exposition à l'information pour les fumeurs. Ces résultats soutiennent l'hypothèse d'un effet de l'attitude lors de l'expression des besoins {{dans le cadre de}} conception de formation en prévention du tabagisme. /Many studies {{deal with}} the impact of prevention campaigns. Whatever the method used, most of them postulate that people take the campaign into consideration as soon as they are exposed to it. The cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957, 1964) postulates the principle of selective exposure. People tend to both expose themselves to consistent information to strengthen their attitude and behavior and avoid inconsistent one. Avoiding inconsistent information prevents them from threatening position which could modify their attitude. The goal of this research consists in verifying a selective exposure effect concerning smoking prevention using a measure of implicit attitude. This research was conducted in a professional training institute. Participants were recruited on the pretext of a consultation as part of a training design on addictions. They were either employees or trainees from the institute. Forty-four smokers and 80 non-smokers took part in the experiment. They had to precise which prevention thematic (among six addictions) would interest them in order to construct a new training/formation program dealing with dangers of addiction the harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, drugs etc. People were asked what kind of topic would interest them most. Then, their attitudes and behavior toward smoking were evaluated. To evaluate smoking attitudes, we used both an explicit (Attitude Toward Smoking Scale [ATS]; Etter et al., 2000) and an implicit measure (Single Category Implicit Association Test Personalized [SC-IAT-P]; Bardin et al., 2014). Smoking habits were also recorded. Results revealed that smokers have an implicit attitude less negative than non-smokers. Implicit attitude of smokers also predicts selective exposure. The more their attitude is positive, the less people would like to expose themselves to smoking prevention information. At last, smokers who have already considered quitting are more inclined to expose to such information than other smokers. These results support the hypothesis of an effect on attitudes explicit and implicit in the expression of needs in the context of smoking prevention training design...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTechnical and {{administrative}} executives, university staff, company heads or ministers, engineers trained in France occupy a privileged position in Algeria, {{and even more}} so in Morocco and Tunisia. The training of the elite {{is at the heart of}} numerous issues as well as real challenges for countries of the Southern Mediter-ranean and for France. However, the paths followed by these engineers have hardly been studied. How do these rigorously selected students for whom the French authorities facilitate the migration, considered as the path to excellence, come up with their migratory project?How is the choice of engineer training in France made in a French social, political and economic context which, in some ways, is not the most attractive for young Maghrebians for whom the choice of destinations is wide and families look to diversify the countries of studies? Finally, in a context where highly qualified youngsters are much sought-after, and where the poles of attraction are numerous, how do they construct their career beginnings and which migratory dynamics can be observed?These youngsters who are given hero status as soon as they are accepted for the preparatory classes for competitive entry to gradu-ate schools, have not only personal success in their hands but also the social ascendancy of their family, or at least the preservation of an already acquired standing. More than an attraction or a vocation, the career of engineer is seen as a way to belong to a dominant class. Viewed from this angle, they look to conciliate their personal aspirations with the constraints and duties that often pull them in different directions. This work shows that with the internationalize-tion of training and career perspectives, the crisis in the North and rapid growth elsewhere, offering new opportunities, these expatriated talents act by putting into place mastered management of their career, with a feeling of a wide open field of possibilities; at a time when communication and travel conditions have changed and offer unedited opportunities. This work endeavors to shed light on the manner in which the intellectual elite themselves experience these migratory phenomena. It also endeavors to bring new ways of considering these issues in terms of training and migratory politics. Cadres techniques et administratifs, universitaires, chefs d’entreprises ou ministres, les ingénieurs formés en France occupent une place privilégiée en Algérie, et encore davantage au Maroc et en Tunisie. La formation des élites est au cœur de nombreux enjeux mais aussi de véritables défis pour les pays du Sud de la Méditerranée et pour la France. Comment se fait le choix de la formation d’ingénieur en France dans un contexte social, politique et économique français qui, par certains aspects, n'est pas des plus attirants pour de jeunes Maghrébin, et alors que le choix des destinations est large ? Dans un contexte où ces jeunes hautement qualifiés sont très <b>sollicités,</b> et où les pôles d’attractivité sont nombreux, de quelle manière construisent-ils leur début de carrière et quelles dynamiques migratoires peut-on observer ?Ayant entre leurs mains leur réussite personnelle mais aussi l’ascension sociale de leur famille, ou au moins la préservation d’un statut déjà acquis, les élèves ingénieurs cherchent à concilier leurs aspirations personnelles avec des contraintes et des devoirs qui les tirent souvent dans des sens différents. Cet ouvrage montre qu’avec l’internationalisation des formations et des perspectives de carrière, avec la crise économique au Nord et la croissance rapide ailleurs qui offre des opportunités nouvelles, ces talents expatriés agissent en mettant en œuvre une gestion maîtrisée de leur carrière et cela avec le sentiment d’un champ des possibles très ouvert. Cet ouvrage entend apporter un éclairage sur la manière dont les élites intellectuelles vivent, elles-mêmes, ces phénomènes migratoires à l’heure où les conditions de communication et de circulation ont changé et offrent des opportunités inédites. Il entend également apporter de nouvelles manières de considérer ces enjeux en termes de formation et de politique migratoire...|$|R

[...] Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight [...] 350 [...] Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. [...] Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire [...] Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. [...] O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, [...] Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, [...] Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: [...] For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, [...] My Heart, which by a secret harmonie [...] Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet, [...] That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks [...] 360 [...] Now also evidence, but straight I felt [...] Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt [...] That I must after thee with this thy Son; [...] Such fatal consequence unites us three: [...] Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, [...] Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure [...] Detain from following thy illustrious track. [...] Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd [...] Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd [...] To fortifie thus farr, and overlay [...] 370 [...] With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. [...] Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won [...] What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd [...] With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd [...] Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, [...] There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, [...] As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World [...] Retiring, by his own doom alienated, [...] And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide [...] Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, [...] 380 [...] His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, [...] Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. [...] Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. [...] Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, [...] High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race [...] Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, [...] Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) [...] Amply have merited of me, of all [...] Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore [...] Triumphal with triumphal act have met, [...] 390 [...] Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm [...] Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent [...] Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I [...] Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease [...] To my associate Powers, them to acquaint [...] With these successes, and with them rejoyce, [...] You two this way, among those numerous Orbs [...] All yours, right down to Paradise descend; [...] There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth [...] Dominion exercise and in the Aire, [...] 400 [...] Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, [...] Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. [...] My Substitutes I send ye, and Create [...] Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might [...] Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now [...] My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, [...] Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. [...] If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell [...] No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. [...] So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed [...] 410 [...] Thir course through thickest Constellations held [...] Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, [...] And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips [...] Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down [...] The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side [...] Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, [...] And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, [...] That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, [...] Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, [...] And all about found desolate; for those [...] 420 [...] Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, [...] Flown to the upper World; the rest were all [...] Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls [...] Of Pandemonium, Citie and proud seate [...] Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, [...] Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. [...] There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand [...] In Council sate, sollicitous what chance [...] Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee [...] Departing gave command, and they observ'd. [...] 430 [...] As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe [...] By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines [...] Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes [...] Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond [...] The Realme of Aladule, in his retreate [...] To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late [...] Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell [...] Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch [...] Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting [...] Each hour their great adventurer from the search [...] 440 [...] Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, [...] In shew plebeian Angel militant [...] Of lowest order, past; and from the dore [...] Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible [...] Ascended his high Throne, which under state [...] Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end [...] Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while [...] He sate, and round about him saw unseen: [...] At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head [...] And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad [...] 450 [...] With what permissive glory since his fall [...] Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd [...] At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng [...] Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, [...] Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: [...] Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, [...] Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy [...] Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand [...] Silence, and with these words attention won. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] 460 [...] For in possession such, not onely of right, [...] I call ye and declare ye now, returnd [...] Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth [...] Triumphant out of this infernal Pit [...] Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, [...] And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, [...] As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven [...] Little inferiour, by my adventure hard [...] With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell [...] What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine [...] 470 [...] Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep [...] Of horrible confusion, over which [...] By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd [...] To expedite your glorious march; but I [...] Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride [...] Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb [...] Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, [...] That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd [...] My journey strange, with clamorous uproare [...] Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found [...] 480 [...] The new created World, which fame in Heav'n [...] Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful [...] Of absolute perfection, therein Man [...] Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile [...] Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd [...] From his Creator, and the more to increase [...] Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat [...] Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up [...] Both his beloved Man and all his World, [...] To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, [...] 490 [...] Without our hazard, labour or allarme, [...] To range in, and to dwell, and over Man [...] To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. [...] True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather [...] Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape [...] Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, [...] Is enmity, which he will put between [...] Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; [...] His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: [...] A World who would not purchase with a bruise, [...] 500 [...] Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account [...] Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, [...] But up and enter now into full bliss. [...] So having said, a while he stood, expecting [...] Thir universal shout and high applause [...] To fill his eare, when contrary he hears [...] On all sides, from innumerable tongues [...] A dismal universal hiss, the sound [...] Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long [...] Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; [...] 510 [...] His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, [...] His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining [...] Each other, till supplanted down he fell [...] A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, [...] Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power [...] Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, [...] According to his doom: he would have spoke, [...] But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue [...] To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd [...] Alike, to Serpents all as accessories [...] 520 [...] To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din [...] Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now [...] With complicated monsters, head and taile, [...] Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, [...] Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, [...] And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil [...] Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle [...] Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, [...] Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun [...] Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, [...] 530 [...] Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd [...] Above the rest still to retain; they all [...] Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, [...] Where all yet left of that revolted Rout [...] Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, [...] Sublime with expectation when to see [...] In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; [...] They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd [...] Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, [...] And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, [...] 540 [...] They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, [...] Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, [...] And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form [...] Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, [...] As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, [...] Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame [...] Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood [...] A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, [...] His will who reigns above, to aggravate [...] Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that [...] 550 [...] Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve [...] Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange [...] Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining [...] For one forbidden Tree a multitude [...] Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; [...] Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, [...] Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, [...] But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees [...] Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks [...] That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd [...] 560 [...] The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew [...] Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; [...] This more delusive, not the touch, but taste [...] Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay [...] Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit [...] Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste [...] With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, [...] Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, [...] With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws [...] With foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell [...] 570 [...] Into the same illusion, not as Man [...] Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd [...] And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, [...] Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, [...] Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo [...] This annual humbling certain number'd days, [...] To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. [...] However some tradition they dispers'd [...] Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, [...] And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld [...] 580 [...] Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- [...] Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule [...] Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n [...] And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. [...] Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair [...] Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, [...] Once actual, now in body, and to dwell [...] Habitual habitant; behind her Death [...] Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet [...] On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. [...] 590 [...] Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, [...] What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd [...] With travail difficult, not better farr [...] Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, [...] Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? [...] Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. [...] To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, [...] Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, [...] There best, where most with ravin I may meet; [...] Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems [...] 600 [...] To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. [...] To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. [...] Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours [...] Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, [...] No homely morsels, and whatever thing [...] The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, [...] Till I in Man residing through the Race, [...] His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, [...] And season him thy last and sweetest prey. [...] This said, they both betook them several wayes, [...] 610 [...] Both to destroy, or unimmortal make [...] All kinds, and for destruction to mature [...] Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, [...] From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, [...] To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. [...] See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance [...] To waste and havoc yonder World, which I [...] So fair and good created, and had still [...] Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man [...] Let in these wastful Furies, who impute [...] 620 [...] Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell [...] And his Adherents, that with so much ease [...] I suffer them to enter and possess [...] A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem [...] To gratifie my scornful Enemies, [...] That laugh, as if transported with some fit [...] Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, [...] At random yeilded up to their misrule; [...] And know not that I call'd and drew them thither [...] My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth [...] 630 [...] Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed [...] On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst [...] With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling [...] Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, [...] Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last [...] Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell [...] For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. [...] Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure [...] To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: [...] Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. [...] 640 [...] Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud [...] Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, [...] Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, [...] Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; [...] Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, [...] Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom [...] New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, [...] Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, [...] While the Creator calling forth by name [...] His mightie Angels gave them several charge, [...] 650 [...] As sorted best with present things. The Sun [...] Had first his precept so to move, so shine, [...] As might affect the Earth with cold and heat [...] Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call [...] Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring [...] Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone [...] Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five [...] Thir planetarie motions and aspects [...] In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, [...] Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne [...] 660 [...] In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt [...] Thir influence malignant when to showre, [...] Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, [...] Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set [...] Thir corners, when with bluster to confound [...] Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle [...] With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. [...] Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse [...] The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more [...] From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd [...] 670 [...] Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun [...] Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode [...] Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n [...] Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins [...] Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine [...] By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, [...] As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change [...] Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring [...] Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, [...] Equal in Days and Nights, except to those [...] 680 [...] Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day [...] Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun [...] To recompence his distance, in thir sight [...] Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known [...] Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow [...] From cold Estotiland, and South as farr [...] Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit [...] The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd [...] His course intended; else how had the World [...] Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, [...] 690 [...] Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? [...] These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd [...] Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, [...] Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, [...] Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North [...] Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar [...] Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice [...] And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, [...] Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud [...] And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; [...] 700 [...] With adverse blast up-turns them from the South [...] Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds [...] From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce [...] Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes [...] Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, [...] Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began [...] Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first [...] Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, [...] Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: [...] Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle, [...] 710 [...] And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, [...] Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe [...] Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim [...] Glar'd on him passing: these were from without [...] The growing miseries, which Adam saw [...] Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, [...] To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, [...] And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, [...] Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. [...] O miserable of happie! is this the end [...] 720 [...] Of this new glorious World, and mee so late [...] The Glory of that Glory, who now becom [...] Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face [...] Of God, whom to behold was then my highth [...] Of happiness: yet well, if here would end [...] The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare [...] My own deservings; but this will not serve; [...] All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, [...] Is propagated curse. O voice once heard [...] Delightfully, Encrease And Multiply, [...] 730 [...] Now death to heare! for what can I encrease [...] Or multiplie, but curses on my head? [...] Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling [...] The evil on him brought by me, will curse [...] My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, [...] For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks [...] Shall be the execration; so besides [...] Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee [...] Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, [...] On mee as on thir natural center light [...] 740 [...] Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes [...] Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! [...] Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay [...] To mould me Man, did I <b>sollicite</b> thee [...] From darkness to promote me, or here place [...] In this delicious Garden? as my Will [...] Concurd not to my being, it were but right [...] And equal to reduce me to my dust, [...] Desirous to resigne, and render back [...] All I receav'd, unable to performe [...] 750 [...] Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold [...] The good I sought not. To the loss of that, [...] Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added [...] The sense of endless woes? inexplicable [...] Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, [...] I thus contest; then should have been refusd [...] Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: [...] Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, [...] Then cavil the conditions? and though God [...] Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son [...] 760 [...] Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, [...] Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: [...] Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee [...] That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, [...] But Natural necessity begot. [...] God made thee of choice his own, and of his own [...] To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, [...] Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. [...] Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, [...] That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: [...] 770 [...] O welcom hour whenever! why delayes [...] His hand to execute what his Decree [...] Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, [...] Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out [...] To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet [...] Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth [...] Insensible, how glad would lay me down [...] As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest [...] And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more [...] Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse [...] 780 [...] To mee and to my ofspring would torment me [...] With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt [...] Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, [...] Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man [...] Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish [...] With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, [...] Or in some other dismal place, who knows [...] But I shall die a living Death? O thought [...] Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath [...] Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life [...] 790 [...] And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. [...] All of me then shall die: let this appease [...] The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. [...] For though the Lord of all be infinite, [...] Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, [...] But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise [...] Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? [...] Can he make deathless Death? that were to make [...] Strange contradiction, which to God himself [...] Impossible is held, as Argument [...] 800 [...] Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, [...] For angers sake, finite to infinite [...] In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour [...] Satisfi'd never; that were to extend [...] His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, [...] By which all Causes else according still [...] To the reception of thir matter act, [...] Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say [...] That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, [...] Bereaving sense, but endless miserie [...] 810 [...] From this day onward, which I feel begun [...] Both in me, and without me, and so last [...] To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear [...] Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution [...] On my defensless head; both Death and I [...] Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, [...] Nor I on my part single, in mee all [...] Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie [...] That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able [...] To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! [...] 820 [...] So disinherited how would ye bless [...] Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind [...] For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, [...] If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, [...] But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, [...] Not to do onely, but to will the same [...] With me? how can they acquitted stand [...] In sight of God? Him after all Disputes [...] Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain [...] And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still [...] 830 [...] But to my own conviction: first and last [...] On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring [...] Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; [...] So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support [...] That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, [...] Then all the world much heavier, though divided [...] With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st, [...] And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope [...] Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable [...] Beyond all past example and future, [...] 840 [...] To Satan onely like both crime and doom. [...] O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears [...] And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which [...] I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! [...] Thus Adam to himself lamented loud [...] Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, [...] Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air [...] Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, [...] Which to his evil Conscience represented [...] All things with double terror: On the ground [...] 850 [...] Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft [...] Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd [...] Of tardie execution, since denounc't [...] The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, [...] Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke [...] To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, [...] Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? [...] But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine [...] Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. [...] O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, [...] 860 [...] With other echo farr I taught your Shades [...] To answer, and resound farr other Song. [...] Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, [...] Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, [...] Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: [...] But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. [...] Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best [...] Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false [...] And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, [...] Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew [...] 870 [...] Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee [...] Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended [...] To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee [...] I had persisted happie, had not thy pride [...] And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, [...] Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd [...] Not to be trusted, longing to be seen [...] Though by the Devil himself, him overweening [...] To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting [...] Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, [...] 880 [...] To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, [...] Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, [...] And understood not all was but a shew [...] Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib [...] Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, [...] More to the part sinister from me drawn, [...] Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie [...] To my just number found. O why did God, [...] Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n [...] With Spirits Masculine, create at last [...] 890 [...] This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect [...] Of Nature, and not fill the World at once [...] With Men as Angels without Feminine, [...] Or find some other way to generate [...] Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, [...] And more that shall befall, innumerable [...] Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, [...] And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either [...] He never shall find out fit Mate, but such [...] As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, [...] 900 [...] Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain [...] Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind [...] By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld [...] By Parents, or his happiest choice too late [...] Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound [...] To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: [...] Which infinite calamitie shall cause [...] To humane life, and houshold peace confound. [...] He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve [...] Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, [...] 910 [...] And tresses all disorderd, at his feet [...] Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught [...] His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. [...] Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n [...] What love sincere, and reverence in my heart [...] I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, [...] Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant [...] I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, [...] Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, [...] Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, [...] 920 [...] My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, [...] Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? [...] While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, [...] Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, [...] As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie [...] Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, [...] That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not [...] Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, [...] On me already lost, mee then thy self [...] More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou [...] 930 [...] Against God onely, I against God and thee, [...] And to the place of judgement will return, [...] There with my cries importune Heaven, that all [...] The sentence from thy head remov'd may light [...] On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, [...] Mee mee onely just object of his ire. [...] She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, [...] Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault [...] Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught [...] Commiseration; soon his heart relented [...] 940 [...] Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, [...] Now at his feet submissive in distress, [...] Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, [...] His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; [...] As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, [...] And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. [...] Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, [...] So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st [...] The punishment all on thy self; alas, [...] Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine [...] 950 [...] His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, [...] And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers [...] Could alter high Decrees, I to that place [...] Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, [...] That on my head all might be visited, [...] Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, [...] To me committed and by me expos'd. [...] But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame [...] Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive [...] In offices of Love, how we may light'n [...] 960 [...] Each others burden in our share of woe; [...] Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, [...] Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, [...] A long days dying to augment our paine, [...] And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. [...] To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. [...] Adam, by sad experiment I know [...] How little weight my words with thee can finde, [...] Found so erroneous, thence by just event [...] Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, [...] 970 [...] Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place [...] Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine [...] Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, [...] Living or dying from thee I will not hide [...] What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, [...] Tending to som relief of our extremes, [...] Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, [...] As in our evils, and of easier choice.

40|$| pouvoir et de confrontations. Enfin, j’étudie les codifications locales du rituel civique qui visent à renforcer son efficacité symbolique, pour ensuite {{examiner}} les luttes qui s’engagent autour de la réception des résultats. Luttes qui impliquent non seulement les factions rivales, mais également différentes catégories d’élites. Cet examen {{montre que}} si la pratique électorale municipale permet d’accéder au pouvoir à des groupes restés longtemps à la périphérie, les élections sont un lieu et un moment où s’articulent différents modes d’exercice et de représentations du pouvoir provenant à la fois de la société dominante israélienne et de la société locale. Car dans la compétition qu’ils se livrent, les acteurs tentent d’imposer des modes de représentation du pouvoir pour légitimer leurs actions, faisant émerger à terme des modes hybrides de domination et de solidarité. Ceci est particulièrement net {{dans le cadre de}} l’apparition de nouvelles élites qui imposent de nouvelles manières de penser le politique. Dans la troisième partie, l’analyse des élections nationales de 1999 offre des éléments complémentaires. Elle permet d’envisager sur une autre échelle les modes d’intégration de la population bédouine dans le système étatique israélien. En outre, elle donne la possibilité d’apprécier davantage la multiplication des centres de pouvoir dans cette société et la spécialisation des activités politiques. Car les élites qui organisent la campagne municipale et la campagne nationale ne sont pas les mêmes. Enfin, compte tenu des enjeux moins importants pour les groupes de parenté réels ou classificatoires en compétition sur la scène locale, les individus sont moins <b>sollicités</b> par les solidarités de corps. La mobilisation des votants est donc davantage influencée par des facteurs idéologiques même si les formes de domination et de solidarité inscrites dans « l’ethos tribal » continuent de jouer un rôle important. La question des relations entre ces deux modes d’affiliation se pose ainsi avec plus d’acuité que lors des élections municipales. D’ailleurs, l’examen des visites privées pour le démarchage des voix montre que les chaînes de médiation clientélaires servent de principal canal à la diffusion d’une culture politique fortement individualiste et idéologiquement marquée. Pour mesurer l’impact de la transmission de cette culture politique dans ces conditions particulières, j’envisage les parcours de militants puis ceux d’électeurs locaux. L’accent est mis sur la manière dont les individus articulent différents modes d’autorité et de solidarité pour repenser leur rapport au politique. Dans ce cadre, j’étudie également différents rituels de contestation improvisés au cours de la campagne électoral, rituels qui visent principalement à renverser l’équation dominant/dominé et qui impliquent autant les Bédouins et la société israélienne que les Bédouins et leurs élites locales. Ces rituels jouent un rôle fondamental dans l’expression, mais surtout dans la construction d’une conscience politique collective. Ils compensent également le peu d’influence que les Bédouins peuvent exercer sur les dirigeants nationaux à travers leur vote. Cela me conduit à envisager une nouvelle fois les réappropriations du rituel civique et plus particulièrement les techniques de fraude qui visent moins à modifier les résultats de vote qu’à mettre en scène le pouvoir des militants et de certains électeurs, mais aussi à sanctionner l’affranchissement de la communauté locale de la tutelle des autorités de l’Etat. La fraude favorise donc l’émergence de nouvelles formes de civisme. Dans l’ensemble, décryptant le sens des pratiques politiques locales cet examen permet de mieux cerner le degré de participation et le sens que les Bédouins attribuent au contenu et à la forme de leur vote. Cette étude offre donc une meilleure lecture des résultats électoraux dans le Néguev à la fin des années quatre-vingt-dix, qu’une analyse statistique ne pourrait fournir à elle seule. L’étude des phénomènes d’hybridation des modes d’exercice et de représentation du pouvoir lors de ces deux campagnes, ainsi que celle des phénomènes de politisation remettent en question le supposé rapport d’antinomie entre les modes d’affiliations inscrits dans l’ethos tribal et ceux reposant sur une culture partisane. Elles montrent en outre que cette société tribale arabe est loin d’être rétive à des formes d’arrangements locaux de pouvoir plus démocratiques. Car si la participation des électeurs aux élections locales et nationales ne permet pas toujours d’influencer de manière significative le pouvoir des gouvernants locaux et nationaux, elles contribuent à transformer considérablement les attentes que développent les gouvernés vis-à-vis de leurs gouvernants et plus particulièrement celles concernant leur rôle dans la société. En somme cette analyse ne présente pas simplement une étude des modes d’intégration des Bédouins dans les rouages administratifs de l’Etat, mais surtout la manière dont ils perçoivent, vivent et renégocient leurs relations de pouvoir avec l’Etat et la société dominante...|$|R

A ferraiolo of watered silk also denotes the wearer is an apostolic nuncio or is attached to the Papal household. The Pope does not wear a ferraiolo.Even in modern times of the 21st century, the Order of Canons Regular of Premontre (Premonstratensians, Norbertines or white canons), the Camaldolese, the members of the Orders of Our Lady of Mercy and of the Holy Trinity, and the Olivetans, as well as a few other orders who wear a prelatical costume have the privilege of wearing the ferraiolo entirely of white cloth. The Premonstratensians also have the privilege of wearing this garment with a white four-cornered biretta of the same material. Some white canons even choose to wear white shoes when dressed in this formal attire. The additional items traditionally worn by the clergy, i.e. cincture or sash is also entirely white. The Canon Regular is allowed to wear a surplice for any liturgical circumstance and the rochet for non-liturgical events, but not worn with the ferraiolo. The Premonstratensian canon, as a simple priest, deacon or seminarian is permitted to wear the (filed or textured charmeuse) ferraiolo, band cincture/sash with braided fringe and biretta (without pom) entirely made of white cloth, unlike the secular priests who must wear a black wool ferraiolo. The Premonstratensian Abbots regiminis, as well as Abbots nullius, are permitted to wear the ferraiolo of watered silk and add to their monastic habit the pectoral cross and the ring. This same regular prelate or abbot, who also as a Canon Regular, may wear a biretta (with pom). In addition to wearing the other privileged items, the mantelletta, made of the same cloth of his monastic habit, may be worn by an abbot who is not in his own monastery of record, but worn without the ferraiolo. The simplification of clerical dress for the Roman Church following the Second Vatican Council has been promulgated in three documents, which together comprise the current body of ecclesiastical law on this question. The first is the Instruction of the Secretariat of State of 31 March 1969 Ut sive <b>sollicite</b> (USS), on the dress, titles, and coats-of-arms of Cardinals, Bishops, and lesser Prelates. The second is the Circular Letter of the Sacred Congregation for the Clergy of 30 October 1970 Per Instructionem, on the reform of choir dress, which applies the prescriptions of USS to Canons, Beneficiaries, and Pastors, and by explicit extension to all other categories of ecclesiastics. Neither of these documents sets out synthetic schemata of the forms of dress of all secular and religious clergy of the Roman Rite, but rather they amend the pre-existing paradigms. A more systematic list of the forms of dress, relying on these two previous documents and augmenting them in part, is given in the first appendix of the new Caeremoniale Episcoporum (CE), on the dress of Prelates. However, even the last named document does not give every detail, as it presupposes the sartorial customs of the Roman Church and does not treat those ecclesiastics under the rank of Prelates and Canons. For the pre-conciliar paradigms and for the perduring sartorial customs of the Roman Rite concerning details about which these documents are silent, older works must be relied upon, the best of which is Nainfa's Costume of Prelates of the Catholic Church.1 The Church's traditions and documents can only speak to the dignity of wearing such formal attire in the appropriate setting such as academic commencements, formal balls and dinners and other local and state gatherings that mandate formal attire be worn.|$|E

Tourism neither “polluted” Balinese culture (as some of its critics would have it) nor entailed its “renaissance” (as the proponents of “cultural tourism” are prone to claim). What happened is that the focus on “cultural” tourism convinced the Balinese people {{that they had a}} “culture”, something precious and perishable which they perceive as a capital to be exploited and as a heritage to be protected. As it was being manipulated and appropriated by the tourism industry, their culture became not only a source of profit and pride but also a cause of anxiety for the Balinese, who started wondering whether they were still authentically Balinese. Thus it is that tourism provoked an overriding concern about identity amongst the Balinese – about what they call their “Balineseness”.

Owing to its selectivity and sensitivity, mass spectrometry has become a key technique in analytical platforms for proteomic and lipidomic investigations. Using this technique, many strategies have been developed based on unbiased or targeted approaches to highlight or monitor molecules of interest from biomatrices. Although these approaches have largely been employed in cancer research, this type of investigation has been met by a growing interest in the field of cardiovascular disorders, potentially leading to the discovery of novel biomarkers and the development of new therapies. In this paper, we will review the different mass spectrometry-based proteomic and lipidomic strategies applied in cardiovascular diseases, especially atherosclerosis.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for more than 150 years that action effects in bridges due to traffic action are higher than it has to be {{expected}} for purely static loads. In the design of road bridges, this difference is considered by multiplying static traffic loads with a "dynamic amplification factor". The amplification factors defined in codes are based on dynamic load tests on existing bridges. Despite of hundreds of tests in several countries, experimental investigation has not given satisfactory explanation of the observed phenomena, which has resulted in marked differences between amplification factors defined in different codes. This {{is due to the fact}} that the core of the matter – the dynamic interaction between vehicles and bridges– is a complex mechanical problem. Based on a detailed analysis it is shown in the introduction, that it can also be attributed to the fact, that the experimental investigation is more part of the problem than its solution. This thesis aims at getting a solid and systematic grounding in the problem using theoretical analysis. The centre of attention is the question, which importance dynamic phenomena have in those scenarios which are effectively relevant for the structural safety of a bridge. All scenarios are considered that justify an amplification factor, and not only dynamic vehicle – bridge interaction. The structural safety evaluation of a bridge includes the verification of the ultimate and the fatigue limit state. Accordingly, this thesis distinguishes between the interaction at ultimate limit state, for which inelastic bridge behaviour is assumed, and the interaction at service limit state with linear elastic bridge behaviour. The structural analysis of a bridge shows in addition, that the elements of the bridge deck differ considerably from the main girders: For the elements of the deck – i. e. primarily for the deck slab – dynamic interaction is of little importance, and amplification of action effects is essentially due to amplification of traffic action. In the case of the main girders, action effects are additionally amplified due to the oscillations of the structure. In order to analyse interaction at service limit state in detail, very sophisticated models are required, which do not only cover all relevant eigenmodes of the bridge but also the non-linear, dynamic behaviour of heavy vehicles and the precise road surface profile. Design and analysis of such models are mostly conferred to specialists in numeric analysis and structural dynamics. In the contrary, this thesis aims at capturing the fundamental connections by simple models, which facilitates the identification of the key parameters and the interpretation of their influence. The most important result of the analysis of vehicle – bridge interaction at service limit state is that the amplification factor is most influenced by the weight and the number of vehicles on a bridge. Whereas the amplification is negligible for high vehicle loads, tests with relatively lightweight vehicles on long bridges lead to a significant over-estimation of amplification factors. Furthermore it is shown that neither the span nor the natural frequency of a bridge is appropriate for fixing the amplification factor for a particular bridge and safety verification, respectively. It has been observed in dynamic load tests that deflection measurements consistently result in higher amplification factors than strain measurements. This phenomenon {{has been known}} for more than fifty years, but no explanation has been given so far. In this thesis an explanation is proposed and it is shown that deflection measurements result in an over-estimation of amplification factors. Similar considerations lead to a proposal for a more suitable application of amplification factors in the verification of shear force. A completely new approach is chosen for the analysis of vehicle – bridge interaction at ultimate limit state. The effective behaviour at rupture is taken into account, which necessitates first to deal with the influence of loading velocity on material strength. It is shown that only for impact loading of deck slabs due to dynamic tyre forces a minor increase in concrete strength can be expected. An important prerequisite for the understanding of dynamic behaviour at ultimate limit state is the "gravity effect", which is shown to cause massive reduction in the dissipation capacity of a structure. The determinant criterion with inelastic behaviour is deformability and not stiffness. Simple models are used to study the influence of deformability and gravity effect in the most important cases of dynamically amplified traffic action. The results show, under which conditions the dynamic amplification of action effects can be compensated by plastic deformation of the structure without causing its failure. If the steel yield stress is already attained due to the static part of traffic action, compensation of the dynamic part is only assured if the rupture behaviour is characterised by strain hardening. A simple condition of equilibrium shows that dynamic amplification due to centrifugal forces cannot be absorbed by deformations of the structure. However, rupture behaviour characterised by significant deformation causes a delay in the failure of the structure, which can be sufficient to prevent the definitive rupture anyway, depending on the scenario. In addition to these reflections, it is attempted to determine the importance of shear failures with respect to flexural failures, in order to estimate the probability of this comparatively brittle failure mechanism. In view of the application of the findings, the relevant results are synthesized and a concept for the safety verification accounting for dynamic traffic action is developed. The concept is based on the distinction between verifications at ultimate and service limit state on the one hand, and the separate treatment of elements of the deck and main girders on the other hand. This differentiation allows integrating risk based considerations using explicit hazard scenarios. An important point in the application of the findings is the recommendation to emphasize the benefit of good road surface evenness in the maintenance of structures. A necessary complement in establishing the recommended amplification factors is the detailed analysis of the reaction of vehicles to road surface irregularities. The dynamic tyre forces for different vehicle and axle types, respectively, are analysed, since the findings indicate that the amplification of tyre forces is much more important in fixing amplification factors than the dynamic behaviour of bridges. The investigations clearly show that higher axle loads imply lower amplification factors, and that the maximum amplification of axle forces in axle groups never occurs simultaneously for all axles. The thesis is finished by an annexe including introductions to the dynamic behaviour of vehicles and bridges as well as to the modelling of traffic loads and road surface irregularities. In addition to an extensive review of the state of the art, these introductions constitute an important basis of the work and facilitate understanding of the calculations in the main part. Seit mehr als 150 Jahren ist bekannt, dass die Beanspruchung einer Brücke bei der Belastung durch bewegte Fahrzeuge höher ist als bei Stillstand derselben Fahrzeuge. Diesem Unterschied wird in der Bemessung von Strassenbrücken dadurch Rechnung getragen, dass die statischen Verkehrslasten mit einem "dynamischen Vergrösserungsfaktor" multipliziert werden. Die in den Tragsicherheitsnachweisen verwendeten Vergrösserungsfaktoren stützen sich auf Lastversuche an bestehenden Brücken. Trotz hunderter Versuche in diversen Ländern haben diese Versuche jedoch keine befriedigende Erklärung der Phänomene geliefert, sodass sich die Vergrösserungsfaktoren von Land zu Land teilweise beträchtlich unterscheiden. Dies hängt damit zusammen, dass es sich beim Kernproblem – der dynamischen Wechselwirkung zwischen Fahrzeug und Brücke – um eine komplizierte mechanische Fragestellung handelt. Aufgrund einer eingehenden Analyse in der Einleitung wird dies jedoch auch darauf zurückgeführt, dass die experimentelle Untersuchung mehr Teil des Problems als dessen Lösung ist. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, die Fragestellung aufgrund einer theoretischen Analyse systematisch aufzubereiten. Im Zentrum steht dabei die Fragestellung, welche Bedeutung dynamische Phänomene in jenen Szenarien haben, welche effektiv für die Tragsicherheit einer Brücke massgeblich sind. Zudem werden alle Szenarien betrachtet, welche einen Vergrösserungsfaktor rechtfertigen, und nicht nur die Szenarien mit dynamischer Wechselwirkung. Der Tragsicherheitsnachweis einer Brücke umfasst die Nachweise des Bruch- und des Ermüdungswiderstands. Dementsprechend wird unterschieden zwischen der Wechselwirkung auf Bruchniveau, bei der von inelastischem Materialverhalten ausgegangen wird, sowie der Wechselwirkung auf Gebrauchsniveau unter Beschränkung auf rein elastisches Verhalten. Die Analyse des Tragverhaltens einer Brücke zeigt zudem, dass sich die Elemente der Fahrbahn von den Brückenlängsträgern ganz wesentlich unterschieden: Bei den Elementen der Fahrbahn – das heisst vor allem bei der Fahrbahnplatte – spielt die dynamische Wechselwirkung praktisch keine Rolle, und die Vergrösserung der Beanspruchung besteht im Wesentlichen aus der Lastvergrösserung. Bei den Brückenlängsträgern erhöht sich die Beanspruchung, zusätzlich zur Lastvergrösserung, durch deren eigene Schwingungen. Zur genauen Erfassung der dynamischen Wechselwirkung auf Gebrauchniveau sind sehr komplizierte Modelle erforderlich, welche nicht nur alle Eigenschwingungsformen der Brücke sondern auch das nicht-lineare, dynamische Verhalten von Fahrzeugen sowie die Fahrbahnunebenheiten präzise abbilden. Erstellung und Analyse dieser Modelle werden daher meistens von Spezialisten der Numerik und Baudynamik übernommen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird im Gegensatz dazu versucht, die wesentlichen Zusammenhänge durch möglichst einfache Modelle zu erfassen. Dies vereinfacht es, den Einfluss der wichtigsten Parameter zu erfassen und auszuwerten. Das wichtigste Resultat der Analyse der Wechselwirkung auf Gebrauchsniveau ist, dass das Fahrzeuggewicht sowie die Anzahl an Fahrzeugen auf einer Brücke einen enormen Einfluss auf den Vergrösserungsfaktor haben. Während die dynamische Vergrösserung bei hohen Verkehrslasten praktisch vernachlässigbar ist, führen Versuche mit relativ leichten Fahrzeugen auf langen Brücken zu einer markanten Überschätzung des Vergrösserungsfaktors für den Tragsicherheitsnachweis. Weiters konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich weder die Spannweite einer Brücke noch deren Grundfrequenz zur Festlegung eines Vergrösserungsfaktors eignen. Bei dynamischen Lastversuchen ergeben Durchbiegungsmessungen durchwegs höhere Vergrösserungsfaktoren als Dehnungsmessungen. Dieses Phänomen ist seit fünfzig Jahren bekannt, ohne dass bisher eine Erklärung gegeben werden konnte. In dieser wird eine Erklärung vorgeschlagen und gezeigt, dass der Vergrösserungsfaktor aufgrund von Durchbiegungsmessungen deutlich überschätzt wird. Analoge Überlegungen erlauben auch zu zeigen, wie die dynamische Vergrösserung der Querkraft besser erfasst werden kann als dies bis anhin der Fall ist. Für die Analyse der Wechselwirkung auf Bruchniveau wird ein gänzlich neuer Ansatz gewählt, der das effektive Bruchverhalten der Brücke berücksichtigt. Daher wird zuerst grundsätzlich auf den Einfluss der Belastungsgeschwindigkeit bei der Beanspruchung durch Verkehrslasten eingegangen. Es zeigt sich, dass nur bei der stossförmigen Belastung der Fahrbahnplatte durch dynamische Radkräfte eine gewisse Erhöhung der Festigkeiten erwartet werden kann. Eine wichtige Voraussetzung für das Verständnis des dynamischen Verhaltens auf Bruchniveau ist die Schwerkraftwirkung. Diese bewirkt eine drastische Verringerung der Dissipationskapazität des Tragwerks. Entscheidend ist bei inelastischem Verhalten die Verformbarkeit und nicht die Steifigkeit des Tragwerks. Anhand einfacher Modelle wird versucht, die wichtigsten Szenarien mit dynamischer Vergrösserung zu erfassen, wobei in erster Linie das Versagen auf Biegung untersucht wird. Anhand des Vergleichs der Resultate für verschiedene Kraft-Verschiebungs-Diagramme wird abgeschätzt, unter welchen Voraussetzungen der dynamische Anteil der Beanspruchung durch plastische Verformungen aufgenommen werden kann, ohne dass es zum Bruch kommt. Wenn die statische Beanspruchung bereits das Fliessmoment erreicht, dann gelingt dies aufgrund der Schwerkraftwirkung nur noch bei einem Bruchverhalten mit Dehnungsverfestigung. Anhand einer einfachen Gleichgewichtsbetrachtung wird gezeigt, dass bei der dynamischen Lastvergrösserung infolge von Kurvenfahrt oder Bremsung der dynamische Anteil der Einwirkung nicht dissipiert werden kann. Ein verformungsreiches Bruchverhalten führt in diesem Fall jedoch zu einer Verzögerung des Bruchs, die je nach Szenario ausreichen kann, damit ein Auto den Gefahrenbereich verlässt. Darüber hinaus wird auch versucht, die Bedeutung des Schubbruchs im Vergleich zum Biegebruch zu bestimmen, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit dieses verformungsarmen Bruchs abzuschätzen. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse fliessen schliesslich in ein Nachweiskonzept ein, in welchem geeignete Vergrösserungsfaktoren angegeben werden, wobei einerseits zwischen Bruch- und Gebrauchsniveau und andererseits zwischen Elementen der Fahrbahn und Brückenlängsträgern unterschieden wird. Die empfohlenen Werte beruhen dabei auf expliziten Gefährdungsbildern, was die Einbeziehung von Risikoüberlegungen ermöglicht. Die Erkenntnisse zeigen bei der Erhaltung bestehender Brücken künftig mehr auf die Gewährleistung einer möglichst ebenen Fahrbahn zu achten. Abgerundet wird die Arbeit durch ausführliche Einführungen zum dynamischen Verhalten von Schwerfahrzeugen und Strassenbrücken, sowie zu Verkehrslasten und Fahrbahnunebenheiten. Dies erleichtert Fachleuten aus dem Brückenbau den Zugang, welche nicht Spezialisten der Baudynamik sind. Den dynamischen Radkräften verschiedener Fahrzeug- bzw. Achstypen infolge von Fahrbahnunebenheiten wird sehr grosse Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet, da dieser Aspekt oft zu Gunsten der Fokussierung auf das Verhalten der Brücke vernachlässigt wurde. Il est connu depuis plus de 150 ans que les efforts internes d'un pont <b>sollicité</b> par le trafic sont plus grands quand les charges sont en mouvement que quand elles sont à l'arrêt. Cette différence est prise en compte lors du dimensionnement d'un pont routier en multipliant les charges de trafic statiques par un « facteur d'amplification dynamique ». Les facteurs d'amplification utilisés dans la vérification structurale se basent sur des essais de charge sur des ponts routiers existants. Malgré des centaines d'essais dans différents pays, l'expérimentation n'a pas fourni une explication satisfaisante des phénomènes observés. En conséquence, les facteurs d'amplification prescrits dans les normes varient parfois considérablement. D'une coté ceci peut être ramené au fait que le cœur du problème – l'interaction dynamique entre un véhicule et un pont – est un problème mécanique complexe. D'un autre coté, une analyse approfondie dans l'introduction de cette thèse montre que l'étude expérimentale fait plutôt partie du problème que de sa solution. Cette thèse a pour but de traiter le problème de manière systématique à l'aide d'une approche théorique. Le cœur est formé par la question : quelle est l'importance des phénomènes dynamiques dans les scénarios, qui sont effectivement déterminants pour la sécurité structurale d'un pont. Tous les scénarios, qui justifient un facteur d'amplification, sont considérés, et non pas seulement l'interaction dynamique véhicule – pont. L'évaluation de la sécurité structurale d'un pont comprend la vérification de la résistance à l'état ultime ainsi qu'à la fatigue. En conséquence, cette thèse distingue entre l'interaction véhicule – pont à l'état ultime, caractérisée par un comportement inélastique du pont, et l'interaction à l'état de service, où un pont se comporte essentiellement de manière linéaire élastique. L'analyse du comportement structural d'un pont montre de plus que, les éléments du tablier se distinguent fondamentalement des poutres longitudinales : pour les éléments du tablier – principalement la dalle de roulement – l'interaction dynamique n'a pratiquement pas d'importance, et l'amplification de la sollicitation est due à l'oscillation des véhicules. Pour les poutres longitudinales s'ajoutent les oscillations de la structure aux oscillations des véhicules. Une étude théorique précise de l'interaction dynamique au niveau de service nécessite des modèles très complexes, qui reproduisent non seulement les modes d'oscillation d'un pont mais aussi le comportement non-linéaire et dynamique des véhicules ainsi que le profil précis de la chaussée. Par conséquence, le développement et l'analyse de tels modèles sont normalement pris en charge par des spécialistes du calcul numérique et dynamique. Cette thèse tente, au contraire, de reproduire les effets principaux à l'aide de modèles les plus simples possibles. Ceci facilite l'identification des paramètres clés et la mise en évidence de leurs influences. Le résultat principal de l'analyse de l'interaction véhicules - pont à l'état de service est l'identification du poids et du nombre des véhicules comme paramètre principal pour le facteur d'amplification. Alors que l'amplification dynamique est pratiquement négligeable pour des charges très élevées, les essais avec des véhicules relativement légers, sur un grand pont, résultent dans une surestimation significative du facteur d'amplification pour une vérification structurale. En outre on montre que ni une portée, ni la fréquence fondamentale d'un pont, ne sont des critères adéquats pour déterminer un facteur d'amplification dans le cas concret d'une vérification structurale. Lors d'un essai dynamique, les mesures de flèches résultent dans des facteurs d'amplification plus élevés que des mesures de déformations. Ce phénomène est connu depuis cinquante ans, sans qu'une explication n'ait été fournie. Cette thèse propose une explication et montre la surestimation de facteurs d'amplification dérivés de mesures de flèches. Des réflexions analogues amènent à une proposition pour une meilleure application du facteur d'amplification dans la vérification de l'effort tranchant. Une approche nouvelle est utilisée pour analyser l'interaction dynamique à l'état ultime. Elle tient compte du comportement effectif à la rupture, ce qui nécessite d'étudier d'abord l'influence de la vitesse de chargement sur la résistance apparente des matériaux. Dans le cas de charges de trafic, seul une légère augmentation de la résistance du béton de la dalle de roulement est à attendre, si une roue heurte un obstacle. Une condition essentielle pour comprendre le comportement à l'état ultime est « l'effet de la gravité », qui cause une réduction radicale de la capacité de dissipation de la structure. Le critère déterminant dans un comportement inélastique est la déformabilité et non la rigidité. Des modèles simples sont utilisés pour étudier l'influence de la déformabilité ainsi que de l'effet de la gravité dans les scénarios avec une amplification dynamique importante. Les résultats montrent sous quelles conditions l'amplification dynamique peut être compensée par la déformation plastique de la structure sans qu'une rupture n'ait lieu. Si l'acier atteint sa limite d'élasticité sous l'effet des charges statiques, une sollicitation dynamique additionnelle ne peut être compensée si l'acier présente un comportement durcissant. Une simple considération d'équilibre montre que l'amplification dynamique due aux forces centrifuges ou aux forces de freinage ne peut pas être compensé par une déformation de la structure. Dans ce cas, un comportement ductile aide à ralentir la rupture, ce qui peut être suffisante pour permettre un véhicule de passer la zone critique. En outre, des réflexions sont présentées sur l'importance d'une rupture à l'effort tranchant, qui consiste généralement en un mode de rupture avec peu de déformation. On montre que la probabilité que ce mode ait lieu avant une rupture à la flexion est faible. En vue de l'application des résultats, les points les plus importants sont résumés et un concept pour la vérification structurale est développé, qui contient de valeurs explicites pour le facteur d'amplification. Le concept se base sur la distinction entre l'état ultime et l'état de service. On distingue également le cas des éléments du tablier et celui des poutres longitudinales. Cette différentiation permet l'intégration de critères de risque sur la base de scénarios détaillés. En plus du concept de vérification, il est recommandé de mettre l'accent plus explicitement sur le bénéfice d'une bonne planéité de la chaussée lors de la maintenance d'une structure. Un complément nécessaire pour l'établissement des facteurs d'amplification recommandés est l'analyse détaillée de l'excitation de véhicules par les irrégularités dans la chaussée. Les forces de roues dynamiques pour différents types de véhicules et d'essieux, respectivement, sont analysées, car les résultats des autres chapitres indiquent que l'amplification des forces d'essieux est nettement plus importante que le comportement dynamique du pont. Les résultats de cette analyse montrent clairement que des essieux plus chargés ont des facteurs d'amplification plus bas, et que la force maximale n'est jamais atteinte pour tous les essieux d'un groupe simultanément...|$|E
