50|$|Zille, {{aware that}} {{externally}} carried gondola parachute {{was tied to}} the same structural ring that also carried scientific instruments, feared that the dynamic shock caused by parachute deployment will destroy instruments. Instead of deploying the parachute he dumped unnecessary items left in the gondola, <b>stabilizing</b> <b>descent</b> speed at three meters per second. Shortly before landing, out of precaution, he stepped outside the gondola, holding on to external ladder steps; the landing near Trufanovo, Tula Oblast turned out soft and safe. The crew were hailed as heroes and awarded Order of Lenin.|$|R

25|$|At 9:07 Moscow Time Osoaviakhim-1 {{lifted off}} and soon made radio {{contact with the}} airfield. By 9:56 the {{aircraft}} reached 15,000 metres according to on-board altimeter; at around 17,700 metres its envelope expanded into a nearly perfect sphere and eventually reached static equilibrium at 19,500 metres, exactly as intended by design. The crew experienced problems with carbon dioxide absorbers, but {{it appeared to be}} manageable. Fedoseenko dumped 310 kilograms of ballast and by 10:50 the balloon passed its design altitude of 20,500 metres. This moment was later marked as the point of no return: at 20,500 metres Osoaviakhim-1 carried just enough ballast to <b>stabilize</b> <b>descent</b> speed. Further ascent and inevitable loss of hydrogen made this ballast insufficient; the only escape route was through bailing out on personal parachutes, provided that the crew could open the awkward hatch. After nearly an hour at 20,600 metres Osoaviakhim-1 climbed again, reaching 22,000 metres at 12:33 and hovered at this record altitude for 12 minutes.|$|R

40|$|Demands for {{planetary}} landing Unmanned exploratory {{missions to}} e. g. Mars involve a landing phase, where the spacecraft descends vertically to the planetary surface. In {{order to minimize}} the impact during landing a breaking system of parachutes and airbags is employed. This system is uncontrolled and hence not able to adapt to unforeseeable situations. Indeed, landing spacecraft may easily hit a stone, slide down crater rims or be dragged along by strong winds on the planetary surface. In all these events, the costly mission is highly endangered as failures in landing systems in the near past have proven. Due to the communication round-trip delay time between the spacecraft and ground control, external supervision of the descent is impossible. As a consequence, a landing device is desired that can autonomously <b>stabilize</b> the <b>descent</b> and visually guide the spacecraft to a safe landing place. Auto-piloting systems as known from modern aircrafts are capable of landing safely. However, such systems cannot be employed for planetary landing fo...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} measurement device called the thermal probe. The thermal probe is a melt sonde; the probe uses heaters to melt into glacial ice and provides in situ {{sampling of the}} meltwater conductivity and particulates. Gravity is the primary mover, but several techniques are described for keeping the probe vertically <b>stabilized</b> during <b>descent.</b> When the probe is intentionally frozen into the ice at a known depth, monitoring the probe orientation and temperature indicates the glacial ice properties at that depth. Knowledge of these basic ice properties are valuable in determining past climate history, but more importantly, the thermal probe is a valuable surveying tool for location of deep drill sites for more precise but costly ice core studies. ^ The details of fabricating a thermal probe are contained in this dissertation. Test data are included to support {{the design of the}} probe. A proposal for a new generation probe is presented based on the performance of past probes. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Many web-based {{application}} areas must infer label distributions {{starting from}} a small set of sparse, noisy labels. Examples include searching for, recommending, and advertising against image, audio, and video content. These labeling problems must handle millions of interconnected entities (users, domains, content segments) and thousands of competing labels (interests, tags, recommendations, topics). Previous work has shown that graph-based propagation can be very effective at finding the best label distribution across nodes, starting from partial information and a weightedconnection graph. In their work on video recommendations, Baluja et al. [1] showed high-quality results using Adsorption, a normalized propagation process. An important step in the original formulation of Adsorption was re-normalization of the label vectors associated with each node, between every propagation step. That interleaved normalization forced computation of all label distributions, in synchrony, {{in order to allow}} the normalization to be correctly determined. Interleaved normalization also prevented use of standard linear-algebra methods, like <b>stabilized</b> bi-conjugate gradient <b>descent</b> (BiCGStab) and Gaussian elimination. This paper presents a method that replaces the interleaved normalization with a single pre-normalization, done once before the main propagation process starts, allowing use of selective label computation (label slicing) as well as large-matrix-solution methods. As a result, much larger graphs and label sets can be handled than in the original formulation and more accurate solutions can be found in fewer propagation steps. We also report results from using pre-normalized Adsorption in topic labeling for web domains, using label slicing and BiCGStab.

30|$|As {{demonstrated}} in Torii and Hagan (2002), there always exists a momentum coefficient that will <b>stabilize</b> the steepest <b>descent</b> algorithm, {{regardless of the}} value of the learning rate (we will define it below). In addition, it shows how the value of the momentum coefficient changes the convergence properties. Momentum acceleration, its performance in terms of learning speed and scalability properties is evaluated and found superior to the performance of reputedly fast variants of the BP algorithm in several benchmark training tasks in Perantonis and Karras (1995). Qian (1999) shows that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field.|$|R

INTRODUCTION During the last few decades, widespread innovations in the realm of Computational Intelligence have been witnessed, the approaches of which offer a practical framework for solving complex problems through the use of human expertise and a priori knowledge about the problem in hand.

2500|$|After reentry, a small, drogue {{parachute}} (H) was deployed at [...] for <b>stabilizing</b> the spacecraft's <b>descent.</b> The main parachute (I) was deployed at [...] {{starting with a}} narrow opening that opened fully {{in a few seconds}} to lessen the strain on the lines. Just before hitting the water, the landing bag inflated from behind the heat shield to reduce the force of impact (J). Upon landing the parachutes were released. An antenna (K) was raised and sent out signals that could be traced by ships and helicopters. Further, a green marker dye was spread around the spacecraft to make its location more visible from the air. Frogmen brought in by helicopters inflated a collar around the craft to keep it upright in the water. The recovery helicopter hooked onto the spacecraft and the astronaut blew the escape hatch to exit the capsule. He was then hoisted aboard the helicopter that finally brought both him and the spacecraft to the ship.|$|R
2500|$|The aircraft, {{flying at}} , had been {{vectored}} by Boston's approach control to intercept the final approach course to the ILS runway 4R approach at a 45 degree angle, about [...] outside the outer marker. As {{it was later}} revealed, the controller was busy handling a potential collision conflict between two other aircraft, and therefore neglected to clear Flight 723 for the approach. The flight crew had to ask the controller for approach clearance, which was immediately given, {{but by that time}} [...] more than a minute after the intercept vector had been issued [...] they were high and fast and almost over the outer marker. The flight crew subsequently failed to <b>stabilize</b> the aircraft's <b>descent</b> rate and airspeed, descended below the glideslope and drifted away from the localizer course, hitting a seawall about [...] {{to the right of the}} extended runway centerline, about [...] short of the runway's displaced threshold. The aircraft was destroyed, killing 87 of its 89 occupants. One of the two survivors died after two hours, and the other, Leopold Chouinard, died of burn injuries on December 11, 1973; Chouinard is not listed as a Delta 723 fatality due to language in the Code of Federal Regulations that defines a fatality as taking place within 30 days of the accident.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a region-based active contour method for the segmentation of intensity inhomogeneous images using an energy functional based on {{local and global}} fitted images. A square image fitted model is defined by using both local and global fitted differences. Moreover, local and global signed pressure force functions are introduced in {{the solution of the}} energy functional to <b>stabilize</b> the gradient <b>descent</b> flow. In the final gradient descent solution, the local fitted term helps extract regions with intensity inhomogeneity, whereas the global fitted term targets homogeneous regions. A Gaussian kernel is applied to regularize the contour at each step, which not only smoothes it but also avoids the computationally expensive re-initialization. Intensity inhomogeneous images contain undesired smooth intensity variations (bias field) that alter the results of intensity-based segmentation methods. The bias field is approximated with a Gaussian distribution and the bias of intensity inhomogeneous regions is corrected by dividing the original image by the approximated bias field. In this paper, a two-phase model is first derived and then extended to a four-phase model to segment brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into the desired regions of interest.
