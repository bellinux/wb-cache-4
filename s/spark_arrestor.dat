25|$|Rotary exhaust {{temperatures}} reach , and as such, on a motorcycle, {{required a}} specialized exhaust system. Suzuki {{dealt with the}} problem by first exhausting into a large, heavily finned manifold which split the single exhaust into two streams. They then built two twin-shelled exhaust pipes which included air cooling ducts. Each muffler contains a stainless steel inner pipe {{which is a little}} shorter than the length of the external shell. The internal pipe ends in a removable stinger drilled with numerous holes and wrapped in a fibreglass-like material. The stinger (or <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> as Suzuki calls it) exits the exhaust system {{at the end of the}} external shell. At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed through the holes drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot exhaust gasses before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and pillions. The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.|$|E
500|$|When the {{rebuilding}} programme (see below) was halted in 1961, further modifications {{were made to}} the unrebuilt locomotives. The most notable was on No. 34064 Fighter Command, which was fitted with a Giesl ejector in 1962 on the grounds that a desired <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> would [...] "suffocate" [...] an ordinary blastpipe. Following some adjustment, the ejector improved smoke deflection and fuel consumption, allowing it to steam well with low-grade coal. As a consequence of the positive experience with No. 34064, preserved No. 34092 City of Wells was similarly fitted in the mid-1980s.|$|E
50|$|The South Western Railway had a {{total of}} four steam locomotives. The {{machines}} were fitted with <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> on the chimneys, for the prevention of forest fires.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives {{built in}} Great Britain, where coke {{was the most}} common fuel, often used {{chimneys}} of cast iron, as they lasted longer than chimneys fabricated from sheet metal. Early North American locomotives often used wood fuel; and large numbers of glowing embers were carried through the boiler and out of the chimney by high velocity exhaust steam. <b>Spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> became a common feature of wood-burning locomotive chimneys {{to reduce the number of}} fires started by escaped embers. The difficulty of casting complex <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> encouraged fabrication of sheet metal chimneys for wood-burning locomotives.|$|R
25|$|Innovative design {{features}} of the AA class included air sanding equipment, improved Gresham No. 9 injectors, horizontal grid <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors,</b> steam for auxiliaries supplied directly from the dome, and a sloped ashpan to provide easier cleaning.|$|R
2500|$|A {{chimney cowl}} {{is placed on}} top of the chimney to prevent birds and other animals from nesting in the chimney. [...] They often feature a rain guard to prevent rain or snow from going down the chimney. [...] A metal wire mesh is often used as a <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> to {{minimize}} burning debris from rising out of the chimney and making it onto the roof. Although the masonry inside the chimney can absorb a large amount of moisture which later evaporates, rainwater can collect {{at the base of the}} chimney. Sometimes weep holes are placed at the bottom of the chimney to drain out collected water.|$|E
2500|$|Testing {{was planned}} to occur with a lipped chimney, and on receipt {{of the first}} full livery, Tornado would be fitted with an {{authentic}} rimless chimney, described as the original non-capped version. The fluted chimney intended for apple green running was still not fitted {{at the time of}} the green livery launch on 13 December, due to it still being machined at the manufacturer. It was completed and fitted in time for the inaugural main line passenger run. The locomotive chimney would also be fitted with a <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor.</b> The locomotive number on the smokebox door may be moved higher up as was [...] "once the norm" [...] (requiring the moving of the lamp-bracket). Moving the number plate above the smokebox door hand-rail was confirmed as being intended at the time of Tornado's unveiling at the NRM. Tornado would also be fitted with a chime whistle from an A4 class locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|Lytton was {{a typical}} Columbia River steamer. She had three decks, the first one being {{reserved}} for freight, machinery and crew quarters, the second for passengers, including cabins and an observation saloon. Down {{the center of the}} passenger deck was a dining room with raised clerestory windows At the front of the top deck was placed the pilot house. Just behind the pilot house was a small structure called the [...] "", which contained cabins for the officers. Behind the [...] was the vessel's single funnel, and {{on the front of the}} funnel was the steamer's whistle. In the case of Lytton, the funnel flared out in cone near the top, and may have been fitted with a <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor.</b> This detail was somewhat unusual and allows Lytton to be more readily identified in photographs of the period. The foredeck was open, and was often heavily loaded with cordwood fuel or cargo.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tool rest}} {{needs to be}} tight and within 2 to 3 mm of the wheel (1/16" [...] to 1/8"). This {{prevents}} the workpiece from slipping down between the wheel and the tool rest. The <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> catch stray <b>sparks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fuel {{is usually}} coal but the engine may be {{designed}} to use wood fuel, straw or bagasse (sugar cane residue) instead. A longer, circular firebox is particularly suitable for burning logs rather than shorter wood billets. [...] Machines designed for wood-burning may be fitted with <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{chimneys}} and exhausts {{of other}} fuel-burning engines such as steam engines or internal combustion engines {{might also have}} <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> fitted {{if there would be}} a fire risk from their operation. For example, a trail bike might be fitted with a centrifugal arrestor, which will trap glowing hot pieces of soot.|$|R
2500|$|The {{trial was}} {{successful}} with the locomotive {{noted for its}} clean running {{and the elimination of}} smoke, spark hazard and <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> cleaning. With the grate automatically stoked via a tender-mounted conveyor screw and blower motor, it was now possible to harness the full steam-raising potential of the locomotive's boiler without the stamina of the fireman being a limiting factor. The steam requirements for both engine and booster were able to be met for unlimited periods at maximum steam pressure even against the action of both injectors. Comparative performance tests with black coal-fired X30 revealed that X32 was able to generate a drawbar horsepower output of [...] at , exceeding by 5 to 10% that which could be produced by X30 with good quality Maitland or Lithgow coals. The locomotive gained a reputation for both speed and dependability. On one occasion, X32 hauled a [...] load between Seymour and Melbourne in 105 minutes, where the working timetable for a full [...] load allowed 147 minutes. On 4 April 1951 it replaced a defective S class locomotive in hauling the Spirit of Progress from Wallan to Melbourne, taking 43 minutes to cover the same distance the S class-hauled train would normally cover in 40 minutes, despite having to start the train from standstill and running with a lower permissible maximum speed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> on the {{air intake}} (carburettor or {{electronic}} fuel injection) â€” a wire mesh screen on the <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> cools any internal flame or spark created by back-fire, thereby preventing it from igniting fuel vapours inside the engine compartment.|$|E
50|$|He {{obtained}} patents for a <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> and a {{gauge glass}} protector.|$|E
50|$|Limewash was {{normally}} {{applied to}} magazines' exterior walls. Care {{was taken to}} minimise and isolate the explosives from damp, heat and grit. The magazine structures incorporated insulated walls and were designed to create a naturally and reasonably cooled and ventilated environment. Their ventilation shafts were covered by metal ventilation louvers, coupled with <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> and dust deflectors.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the opening}} of the RNAD at Ditton Priors, the steam {{locomotives}} were fitted with <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> but, after the arrival of RNAD diesel locomotives, they did not enter the armaments depot. The steam locomotive was taken off the goods train at Cleobury North (just south of Ditton Priors) and the wagons were drawn into the depot by an RNAD diesel locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Fires {{may produce}} sparks as updrafts carry {{particles}} {{of the burning}} fuel aloft. This was a great problem with steam locomotives as the sparks might {{set fire to the}} adjacent landscape or even to the train itself, especially if the engine burned wood rather than coal. To prevent this dangerous nuisance, a variety of <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> were invented and fitted.|$|R

50|$|Their large spark-arresting {{chimneys}} {{were replaced}} with a straight chimney, with a conical <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> being located in the smokebox.|$|E
50|$|Some other {{historical}} engine controls, {{which are}} automated in modern cars, were the choke valve, ignition timing, and <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Superheating {{was applied}} in the 1920s, {{followed}} by piston valves shortly afterwards. Between 1935 and 1940 the class received Waikato <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> and tender cabs. Second sand domes and standard funnels were added around this time. By now the class were all stationed in Southland and performed branchline work in and around Invercargill, and were well regarded in these duties.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, {{while working}} in the {{roundhouse}} on a steam boiler, it exploded. His brother August Gerlinger was killed and several others were injured. Carl lost his right arm. He also temporarily lost his sight. He was laid up {{for over a year}} until he regained his sight. He decided to concentrate on inventing. Among his inventions are the oil distributor, oil retort and <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> for locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Tractors {{tailored}} {{to use in}} fruit orchards typically have features suited to passing under tree branches with impunity. These include a lower overall profile; reduced tree-branch-snagging risk (via underslung exhaust pipes rather than smoke-stack-style exhaust, and large sheetmetal cowlings and fairings that allow branches to deflect and slide off rather than catch); <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> on the exhaust tips; and often wire cages to protect the operator from snags.|$|R
50|$|A spark {{arrester}} (sometimes <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor)</b> is any device which prevents the emission of flammable debris from combustion sources, such as internal combustion engines, fireplaces, and wood burning stoves.|$|E
50|$|Newly {{constructed}} flues may {{feature a}} chase cover, a cap, and a <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> {{at the top}} to keep small animals out and to prevent sparks from being broadcast into the atmosphere. All fireplaces require trained gas service members to carry out installations.|$|E
50|$|Modern gauze is {{also made}} of {{synthetic}} fibers, especially {{when used in}} clothing. It can also be made of metal, such as a wire gauze placed {{on top of a}} Bunsen burner, used in a safety lamp or <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor,</b> or used as a fence.|$|E
50|$|FTR is a {{seen as a}} {{role model}} for other racing {{organizations}} in Florida, and even around the country. In 2006, FTR issued a 96 dB rule for Enduros and Harescrambles. The regulation was placed due to the growing problem of noise from competition off-road vehicles, and the land closures due to it. For the 2008 season, FTR required a USFS approved <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> for all vehicles competing in FTR Enduro, and Harescramble events.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inclined cylinders, arranged {{outside the}} plate frames. The piston valves were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, while the reversing gear {{was controlled by}} a combination of hand and steam mechanism. The locomotives were superheated and their smokeboxes were equipped with Stone's Patent louvre <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors.</b> Their coupled wheel axleboxes were provided with mechanical force-feed lubrication. They were the first locomotives in South Africa to be equipped with exhaust steam injectors, which were of the Davies and Metcalfe pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} did {{not change}} greatly during their NZR career. The first change was to fit Waikato-type <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> {{to many of the}} North Island-based engines, resulting in a new 'pear-shaped' smokebox with an ash hopper {{at the base of the}} smokebox. The cast-iron smokebox doors were replaced by steel ones, and the brake pump was moved from its original location on the right-hand side of the smokebox to a new position, recessed into the running board, just forward of the cab on the same side.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{an inside}} frame {{which was built}} as a water tank. The boiler comprised two shell rings. The steam dome with its safety valve sat on the forward shell ring. The smokebox was very short. The smokestack has a Kobel <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor.</b> Later a PrÃ¼smann chimney was used.|$|E
50|$|Rihosek won special acclaim for his {{development}} of railway brakes, where he preferred {{the use of}} compressed air brakes. He carried out this work {{in conjunction with the}} firm of GebrÃ¼der Hardy A.G., on whose board he sat until his death. In addition he invented the <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> and the exhaust steam preheater.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were easy}} to recognise in Ireland thanks to their diminutive size and European characteristics - which included a sandbox {{on top of the}} boiler, and a funnel-shaped chimney which allowed for the potential fitting of a <b>spark</b> <b>arrestor</b> for wood-burning. Unusually, they also have a well tank in addition to two side tanks.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> {{were simply}} iron wire screens {{installed}} within the stack. This screen reduced {{the rate at}} which smoke and steam could escape from the boiler. Embers caught upon the screen further reduced available space for passing steam and smoke and heat generated by these burning embers rapidly melted the restraining wire screen. Chimney top diameters enlarged to increase screen surface area and reduce smoke velocity through the screen so embers might fall away from the screen into collection hoppers. Baldwin Locomotive Works compiled a diagram illustrating 57 different spark arresting chimney designs in response to an 1857 patent infringement claim.|$|R
5000|$|Initially fifty Price built engines were {{allocated}} to the North Island the rest to the South. The class were delivered with 1700 gallon tenders which were inadequate for work on the NIMT. To solve this larger tenders were ordered for the BB class which were given A class tenders. Delivered with saturated boilers, one of the class was given a superheated boiler after two years. Cost meant the rest were converted only as their boilers wore out. From the thirties onward the class were fitted with pressed-steel smokebox doors for Waikato <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors,</b> although not always the arrestors themselves.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1967, {{a special}} project was {{undertaken}} with the Stormer. Four bikes were built at Marston Road, all equipped with <b>spark</b> <b>arrestors</b> {{on the end}} of the tailpipe and with a rudimentary lighting system. Three of them had 250 cc engines and were badged as AJS machines. The fourth one had the [...] "360" [...] engine (actually only 334 cc) and was badged as a Matchless. This bike was probably the last one built with a Matchless badge and the only two-stroke Matchless. The four bikes were taken on by members of the Royal Air Force motor Sports Association and entered in the 1968 International Six-Days Trial.|$|R
