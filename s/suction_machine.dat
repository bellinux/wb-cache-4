50|$|At {{the day of}} the Golden Jubilee, Scrooge reluctantly takes part, leaving Donald {{in charge}} of {{guarding}} the Money Bin. Shortly, Donald gets a visit from the Beagle Boys disguised as his family members and grows suspicious of them. Down at the festival, Huey notices that the host is actually Glomgold in disguise (by looking at his shadow) and tells it to Scrooge, who realises that Magica is in league with him. He and the boys rush back to the Bin and collide with Magica interrupting her magic and breaking her transmutation, which wears off the Beagles Boys' disguises. One of the Beagles then steals the security grid key from Miss Quackfaster, allowing them to use the invention they had Gyro build to tear open the Money Bin and suck out all of Scrooge's money. Immediately following this, the villains all escape into the <b>suction</b> <b>machine</b> themselves, with Scrooge following behind.|$|E

50|$|Three {{concerns}} become immediate for the 4077th: {{the procurement}} {{of a new}} generator, a patient of B.J. Hunnicutt's with a stomach problem that needs round-the-clock treatment, and the camp's food supply, which {{is in danger of}} spoiling because {{there is no longer any}} refrigeration. Colonel Potter is able to take care of two of the three concerns immediately. First, to help B.J.'s patient, he jury rigs a Wangensteen suction device from two old pickle jars and a suction tube to relieve the patient's distress. He then organizes a smorgasbord for the entire camp and all the Korean civilians living in the area to get rid of the food. Although the unit succeeds in consuming the food and B.J.'s patient stays safe, Klinger is having problems finding a replacement generator, and the patient will need treatment with an electrical <b>suction</b> <b>machine</b> if he is to survive longer.|$|E

50|$|The suction {{machinery}} was {{the first}} fully automatic glassware manufacturing machinery produced. Owens {{put it on the}} market in 1903 and controlled the patents on it. Owens licensed the use of the machinery to different manufacturers for only specific kinds of glassware, and thus set a market-division pattern that was later followed by Hartford in the licensing and leasing of its automatic feeders. For example, Owens licensed Ball Brothers to make fruit jars and licensed Hazel-Atlas to manufacture wide mouth glassware. After Hartford developed the gob feeder, which largely superseded the suction machinery, Hartford licensed and leased gob feeders in much the same manner that Owens had licensed its <b>suction</b> <b>machines,</b> that is, by issuing licenses to make only specific kinds of glassware. After patent interferences developed between Hartford and Empire. a subsidiary of Corning Glass, the companies settled their disputes by a 1916 agreement in which Hartford was granted an exclusive license by Corning's subsidiary to use the latter's patented glass making apparatus and processes for the production of glass containers while Corning obtained the exclusive right to Hartford's machinery and patents in Corning's lines of ware—the pressed and blown field or the non-container field. This gave Hartford a free hand in the glass container field.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study reports an {{outbreak}} of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in 14 patients during a 2 -month period (August-September, 2008) {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital in Kuwait. Materials and Methods: The clinical sources were blood (9), urine (3) and respiratory secretions (2) identified by the automated VITEK- 2 ID System. Susceptibility testing was performed by the E-test method. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production was assessed using the ESBL E-test and confirmed by PCR. Carriage of bla genes was determined by PCR and sequence analysis. The transferability of resistance phenotypes was demonstrated by conjugation experiments and clonal relatedness was determined by PFGE. Results: The isolates were susceptible to imipenem, meropenem, and tigecycline and produced ESBL. All isolates yielded an amplicon of 499 bp with universal consensus primers (MA primers). DNA sequence analysis showed that they all harboured blaCTX-M- 15 and blaTEM- 1 genes. The environmental isolate obtained from a <b>suction</b> <b>machine</b> was also CTX-M- 15 /TEM- 1 producer. The resistance phenotypes were transferrable to the Escherichia coli J 53 r strain. PFGE, revealed two clones, A and B, related with a Dice coefficient of > 94. 1 %. A mortality rate of 21. 4 % was recorded. Conclusion: The outbreak was contained by robust and aggressive infection control measures.

40|$|BACKGROUND The vacuum {{assisted}} closure (VAC) {{therapy has}} revolutionized the modern wound care. We {{developed a new}} concept of ‘VAC at home ’ in order to decrease the hospital cost. METHODS The {{study was conducted in}} a private hospital from January 2009 to December 2010. Only those patients were included among whom the wounds were not complicated by concomitant injury and the patients were otherwise fit to be discharged from the hospital. The VAC was applied in the hospital. The VAC changes were done after 48 - 72 hours depending on the general wound conditions. The cost of the VAC changes during the therapy at home was compared with the expected cost of hospital stay. RESULTS Thirteen patients were enrolled with a female to male ratio of 1. 6 : 1. The mean age of male patients was 22. 4 years as compared to 29. 6 years in females. Road traffic accident was the most common cause. Leg (16. 2 %) was the commonly affected area. The average number of VACs was 15. 8. The average cost of the <b>suction</b> <b>machine</b> was 100. 1 USD. The average cost of the expected hospital stay during the whole therapy was 68 USD per day. The mean duration of therapy was 35. 8 days. The average total cost to be paid to the hospital was 2434. 4 USD. Each patient had definitely saved a net of 2739. 7 USD. CONCLUSION With the increasing experiences of VAC, it can safely be instituted as an ‘outpatient ’ procedure to decrease the hospital cost at home...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) is an {{established}} method {{that can be}} used in order to cover for soft tissue defects. This study focuses on the use of a modified <b>suction</b> <b>machine</b> in the form of an aquarium pump as an economical substitute for the VAC dressing. The improvised suction apparatus was a regular aquarium pump, which was altered in order to draw air in instead of expelling it. The patients were followed-up for a period of three weeks in the wards. METHODS: VAC was applied over the soft tissue defects. Sterilized foam was used and attached to a French 16 suction tube. A tight seal was ensured using a sterile adhesive covering. The tube was then attached to the modified vacuum machine, which maintained the negative pressure. CASE STUDIES: Three cases are presented in this study. The first and second cases involved pediatric patients who sustained degloving injuries of the foot. The third case involved a 23 year-old male who sustained an open patellar fracture due to a motorcycle accident. The dressing was changed every five days and the progress was documented using photographs. The patients were placed on VAC dressing for a period of two weeks. On the 14 th day, good granulation was evident on the soft tissue defects hence; the patients were scheduled and subsequently underwent splitthickness skin grafting. DISCUSSION: The modified suction pump is an effective and economical alternative to the VAC machine for the purpose of providing constant negative pressure to promote tissue granulation and healing for large tissue defects. However, in order to establish the efficacy of the proposed intervention, the modified suction pump should be tested on more cases...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, families' {{experiences}} {{of caring for}} a technology-dependent child were examined from a temporal perspective. This involved exploring the multiple 'technological', 'social' and 'natural' rhythms and routines around which the families' lives were variously structured. A purposive sample of 36 families with technology-dependent children who used one or more medical devices {{on a daily basis}} was recruited. Devices included feeding pumps, <b>suction</b> <b>machines,</b> dialysis machines and ventilators. Using mainly qualitative methods, children, parents and siblings were interviewed to establish what the care routines involved and how these impacted on family members. The authors found that the rhythms and routines of care varied across the sample, depending on the type and number of devices used, the individual child's needs, and who provided technical care during the day and/or at night at home and in other settings. While the children's health and quality of life benefited from the technology, the time demands of the care routines and lack of compatibility with other social and institutional timeframes had some negative implications for the children and their families, limiting their participation in school, employment and social life in general. The need to use and oversee the use of some medical technologies at night also meant that many parents suffered regular disruption to their sleep. In conclusion, the authors argue that the care of technology-dependent children at home places considerable time demands on families. Families have little or no access to suitably trained carers who can provide technical care required in the home or away from the home to give parents and the whole family a break from caring where required. More trained carers and short-term care provision, better coordination of services and improvements in the design of devices would all help to reduce the negative effects of the care routines on families...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Carbapenem-resistant Entero{{bacteria}}ceae (CRE) {{and other}} Gram-negative bacteria {{are among the}} most common pathogens responsible for both community and hospital acquired infection. The global spread of cephalosporinases in Enterobacteriaceae has led to the increased use of carbapenems resulting in the emergence and rapid spread of CRE. This has become an alarming public health concern, yet the condition in Libya remains unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain a better understanding of CRE strains prevalent in Libyan patients by investigating their phenotypic characteristics and antibiograms. Methods: Gram-negative bacterial species were collected from Misrata Central Hospital, Misrata Cancer Centre and Privet Pathology Laboratories. Clinical samples and swabs were obtained from hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients and from mechanical ventilation and <b>suction</b> <b>machines.</b> Patients who had received antibiotic therapy for at least three days prior to the study were excluded. The identification and characterization of the isolated species were achieved using the growth characteristics on MacConkey and blood agar, spot tests and API 20 E or API 20 NE biochemical testing systems. Screening for carbapenem resistance was performed using the disk diffusion method with carbapenem 10 μg and cephalosporin 30 μg disks and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) determined using the Sensititre Gram-negative Xtra plate format (GNX 2 F). All strains demonstrating resistance or reduced susceptibility to one of the four carbapenems were subjected to carbapenememase activity detection using the RAPIDEC CARBA NP test, Modified Hodge test and carbapenem inactivation methods. Results: A total of one hundred and forty isolates representing fourteen bacterial species were isolated from 140 non-duplicated specimens. Clinical specimens included urine samples (96 / 140, 68. 57 %), sputum (15 / 140, 10. 71 %), surgical wound swabs (18 / 140, 12. 85 %), foot swabs from diabetes mellitus (DM) patients (6 / 140, 4. 29 %), ear swabs (3 / 140, 2. 14 %) and wound swabs (2 / 140, 1. 43 %). Thirty-four (24. 29 %) isolates demonstrated resistance to at least one of the four carbapenems with Klebsiella pneumoniae representing 73. 53 % (25 isolates) of all carbapenem resistant species, followed by 8. 82 % for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 isolates), 5. 88 % for both Proteus mirabilis (2 isolates) and Escherichia coli (2 isolates) and 2. 94 % for both Citrobacter koseri (1 isolate) and Rahnella aquatilis (1 isolate). The other isolates were either susceptible or cephalosporinase producers. Conclusion: This study has revealed the high rate of carbapenem resistance amongst Libyan patients and emphasizes the crucial need for accurate screening, identification and susceptibility testing to prevent further spread of nosocomial and community acquired resistance. This may be achieved through the establishment of antibiotic stewardship programmes along with firm infection control practices.

40|$|Rotary {{twin screw}} {{machines}} {{are used in}} the wide range of industrial applications and are capable of handling single and multiphase fluids as compressors, expanders and pumps. Concentration of liquid in the inlet flow can influence the performance of the machine significantly. Characteristics of the multiphase flow at the suction of a screw compressor depend on the local flow velocities and concentration. Local flow velocity measurements inside the screw compressors are difficult to obtain. However other flow properties such as local pressures are easier to attain. It is therefore useful to carry out experiments with local pressure variations in the suction which can be used to validate the 3 D numerical Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models that could help in studying the single and multiphase flow behaviour in screw compressors. This paper presents experimental efforts to measure the local pressure losses inside the suction plenum of the screw compressor. Pressure variations are measured at 23 locations in the suction port at various operating conditions and compared with 3 D CFD model. The grid generator SCORGTM was used for generating numerical mesh of rotors. The flow calculations were carried out using commercial 3 D solver ANSYS CFX. It was found that the local pressure changes predicted by the CFD model are in the good agreement with measured pressures. This validated the use of CFD for modelling of the single phase flows in <b>suction</b> of screw <b>machines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Metallic glasses have {{typically}} {{been treated as}} a “one size fits all” type of material. Every alloy is considered to have high strength, high hardness, large elastic limits, corrosion resistance, etc. However, similar to traditional crystalline materials, properties are strongly dependent upon the constituent elements, how it was processed, and {{the conditions under which}} it will be used. An important distinction which can be made is between metallic glasses and their composites. Charpy impact toughness measurements are performed to determine the effect processing and microstructure have on bulk metallic glass matrix composites (BMGMCs). Samples are <b>suction</b> cast, <b>machined</b> from commercial plates, and semi-solidly forged (SSF). The SSF specimens have been found to have the highest impact toughness due to the coarsening of the dendrites, which occurs during the semi-solid processing stages. Ductile to brittle transition (DTBT) temperatures are measured for a BMGMC. While at room temperature the BMGMC is highly toughened compared to a fully glassy alloy, it undergoes a DTBT by 250 K. At this point, its impact toughness mirrors that of the constituent glassy matrix. In the following chapter, BMGMCs are shown to have the capability of being capacitively welded to form single, monolithic structures. Shear measurements are performed across welded samples, and, at sufficient weld energies, are found to retain the strength of the parent alloy. Cross-sections are inspected via SEM and no visible crystallization of the matrix occurs. Next, metallic glasses and BMGMCs are formed into sheets and eggbox structures are tested in hypervelocity impacts. Metallic glasses are ideal candidates for protection against micrometeorite orbital debris due to their high hardness and relatively low density. A flat single layer, flat BMG is compared to a BMGMC eggbox and the latter creates a more diffuse projectile cloud after penetration. A three tiered eggbox structure is also tested by firing a 3. 17 mm aluminum sphere at 2. 7 km/s at it. The projectile penetrates the first two layers, but is successfully contained by the third. A large series of metallic glass alloys are created and their wear loss is measured in a pin on disk test. Wear is found to vary dramatically among different metallic glasses, with some considerably outperforming the current state-of-the-art crystalline material (most notably Cu₄₃Zr₄₃Al₇Be₇). Others, on the other hand, suffered extensive wear loss. Commercially available Vitreloy 1 lost nearly three times as much mass in wear as alloy prepared in a laboratory setting. No conclusive correlations can be found between any set of mechanical properties (hardness, density, elastic, bulk, or shear modulus, Poisson’s ratio, frictional force, and run in time) and wear loss. Heat treatments are performed on Vitreloy 1 and Cu₄₃Zr₄₃Al₇Be₇. Anneals near the glass transition temperature are found to increase hardness slightly, but decrease wear loss significantly. Crystallization of both alloys leads to dramatic increases in wear resistance. Finally, wear tests under vacuum are performed on the two alloys above. Vitreloy 1 experiences a dramatic decrease in wear loss, while Cu₄₃Zr₄₃Al₇Be₇ has a moderate increase. Meanwhile, gears are fabricated through three techniques: electrical discharge machining of 1 cm by 3 mm cylinders, semisolid forging, and copper mold suction casting. Initial testing finds the pin on disk test to be an accurate predictor of wear performance in gears. The final chapter explores an exciting technique in the field of additive manufacturing. Laser engineered net shaping (LENS) is a method whereby small amounts of metallic powders are melted by a laser such that shapes and designs can be built layer by layer into a final part. The technique is extended to mixing different powders during melting, so that compositional gradients can be created across a manufactured part. Two compositional gradients are fabricated and characterized. Ti 6 Al¬ 4 V to pure vanadium was chosen for its combination of high strength and light weight on one end, and high melting point on the other. It was inspected by cross-sectional x-ray diffraction, and only the anticipated phases were present. 304 L stainless steel to Invar 36 was created in both pillar and as a radial gradient. It combines strength and weldability along with a zero coefficient of thermal expansion material. Only the austenite phase is found to be present via x-ray diffraction. Coefficient of thermal expansion is measured for four compositions, and it is found to be tunable depending on composition. </p...|$|R
