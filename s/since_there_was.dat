5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not enough room to expand old Dudley Field at its site near Kirkland Hall, the Vanderbilt administrators {{purchased}} land adjacent to the present 25th Avenue South for the new facility. The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E
5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day.

5|$|In late 1974, the CFA {{decided to}} {{schedule}} a special championship. Although board members were uncertain whether Nea Salamina should play (due to the refugee problem), they decided to participate so the team could remain in the Cypriot First Division and stay alive. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no permanent stadium, the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974–75, the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975–76, the GSZ Stadium again in 1976–77, Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977–78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980.|$|E

Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E

In the third round it began to rain. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no marquee covering the ring, both fighters continued to fight in the rain. During the third, Judah scored a knockdown on Davis, although he recovered, he went on to lose by a wide margin (119-109 119-109 118-110).|$|E
5|$|Plante's {{first foray}} into {{organized}} hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years older than he was.

Parsons agreed to try to do so.|$|E
5|$|Roger Waters met Nick Mason {{while they}} were both {{studying}} architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet named Sigma6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar (<b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> rarely an available keyboard). The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom {{in the basement of}} the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.|$|E
5|$|Schmeisser helped {{organize}} and {{played on the}} Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, a highly successful Baltimore-based amateur team. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no professional league, many former college lacrosse stars played for Mount Washington. The club regularly participated in exhibition games against the top intercollegiate programs and very rarely lost. In 1904, Schmeisser and Abercrombie co-authored Lacrosse: From Candidate to Team, a book which became the sport's standard text for the next fifty years.

The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.|$|E
5|$|The first West Saxon nunneries {{were founded}} in Ine's reign by Ine's kinswoman, Bugga, the {{daughter}} of King Centwine, and by Ine's sister Cuthburh, who founded the abbey of Wimborne at some point after she separated from her husband, King Aldfrith of Northumbria. At the bishop Aldhelm's suggestion in 705, Ine built the church which later became Wells Cathedral, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also records that Ine built a minster at Glastonbury.

5|$|When Lancaster {{arrived at}} the town of Boroughbridge, Harclay was already in {{possession}} of the bridge crossing the river. The rebel forces counted probably no more than 700 knights and men-at-arms, against the 4,000 or so soldiers in the royal army. Lancaster initially tried to negotiate, but Harclay could not be swayed. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no realistic alternative place to cross the river, and with the royal forces in pursuit from the south, the rebels {{had no choice but}} to fight.

5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|Books were expensive, {{since each}} copy {{had to be}} written out {{individually}} on a roll of papyrus (volumen) by scribes who had apprenticed to the trade. The codex—a book with pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty {{in the time of}} the poet Martial (1st century AD), {{but by the end of}} the 3rd century was replacing the volumen and was the regular form for books with Christian content. Commercial production of books had been established by the late Republic, and by the 1st century AD certain neighbourhoods of Rome were known for their bookshops (tabernae librariae), which were found also in Western provincial cities such as Lugdunum (present-day Lyon, France). The quality of editing varied wildly, and some ancient authors complain about error-ridden copies, as well as plagiarism or forgery, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no copyright law. A skilled slave copyist (servus litteratus) could be valued as highly as 100,000 sesterces.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no way to prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} by Antonio Saldías (pen name Don Antonio de Petrel) {{regarding}} {{the appropriateness of the}} date used to celebrate the anniversary of Pichilemu, which commemorated the creation of the commune, on 21 December 1891, a date also used in the coat of arms. Saldías pointed out that, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Johnson Field {{assigned}} Deady {{to serve}} as a circuit court judge for the United States circuit court located in San Francisco, California. Deady did the same in 1868 and 1869 <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no circuit court judge assigned to the West Coast at that time, spending three months in San Francisco each year. This was a common practice during this period, as United States Supreme Court justices still rode circuit, and often assigned federal district court judges to serve on the appellate level circuit courts. The Judiciary Act of 1869 reduced much of this process, as did the Judiciary Act of 1891 that established the current United States courts of appeals with Oregon in the Ninth Circuit. While serving on the district court, Deady {{served as president of the}} Board of Regents of the State University (later University of Oregon) from 1873 to 1893. He also designed the university’s seal, which is still used by the school.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E
50|$|For π-electron ligands {{such as the}} cyclopentadienide ion C5H5−, alkenes and the cyclooctatetraenide ion C8H82−, {{the number}} of atoms in the π-electron system that bind to the central atom is termed the hapticity.
