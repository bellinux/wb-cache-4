50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure <b>superheated</b> <b>vapor.</b> The <b>superheated</b> <b>vapor</b> travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|E

50|$|A {{saturation}} {{state is the}} point where a phase change begins or ends. For example, the saturated liquid line represents the point where any further addition of energy will cause {{a small portion of}} the liquid to convert to vapor. Likewise, along the saturated vapor line, any removal of energy will cause some of the vapor to condense back into a liquid, producing a mixture. When a substance reaches the saturated liquid line it is commonly said to be at its boiling point. The temperature will remain constant while it is at constant pressure underneath the saturation dome (boiling water stays at a constant of 212F) until it reaches the saturated vapor line. This line is where the mixture has converted completely to vapor. Further heating of the saturated vapor will result in a <b>superheated</b> <b>vapor</b> state. This is because the vapor will be at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature (212F for water) for a given pressure.|$|E

The surface superheats are from - 20 to 190 K, and the heat fluxes reach 140 W/cm(2). The 30 and 60 ppi foam covers show the periodic single bubble generation and departure pattern at low surface superheats. With continuous increases in surface superheats, they show the periodic bubble coalescence and/or re-coalescence pattern.

At moderate or large surface <b>superheats,</b> <b>vapor</b> fragments continuously escape to the pool liquid. Boiling curves of copper foams show three distinct regions. Region I and II are those of natural convection heat transfer, and nucleate boiling heat transfer for all the foam covers. Region III is that of either a resistance to vapor release for the 30 and 60 ppi foam covers, or a capillary-assist liquid flow towards foam cells for the 90 ppi foam covers. The value of ppi has an important effect on the thermal performance. Boiling curves are crossed between {{the high and low}} ppi foam covers. Low ppi foams have better thermal performance at low surface superheats, but high ppi foams have better one at moderate or large surface superheats and extend the operation range of surface superheats.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} of <b>superheated</b> <b>vapor</b> in {{condenser heat exchanger}} is common in many applications, as heat pump or organic Rankine cycle. Rarely taken into consideration {{in the literature of}} plate heat exchangers, the present article focuses on the influence of the <b>superheated</b> <b>vapor</b> on the condensation characteristics of an organic fluid (pentane) in a brazed plate heat exchanger (BPHE). A specific experimental approach has been developed for this objective. The tested BPHE prototype consists of 2 channels with chevron angle of 55 degrees, and a hydraulic diameter equal to 4. 4 mm. The effect of the pentane mass flux, 9 - 30 kg m(- 2) s(- 1), and the vapor superheat, 5 - 25 K, at a mean constant saturation temperature of 36. 5 degrees C (1. 029 bars), on the global and local thermo-hydraulic characteristics has been identified. An infrared (IR) metrology is used to distinguish the different fluid state distributions, which are representative of various heat transfers along the BPHE. The IR thermography shows a significant impact of the vapor superheat, on the fluid distribution at the channel inlet depending on the mass flux. Comparing the results with vapor superheat going from 5 to 25 K, we note: 1 /an increase of the heat transfer coefficient reaching 70 % for the lowest mass flux; 2 /an increase of the pressure drop, whose rate (18 %) is equivalent to the increase of the heat transfer coefficient for the larger mass fluxes. <b>Superheated</b> <b>vapor</b> is therefore very favorable to heat transfer for condensation in the gravity mode compared to the convective one.

"Includes bibliographical references (p. 95 - 96). The mercury-boiler development program was undertaken to develop a system that would utilize the heat of radioisotope decay to boil and <b>superheat</b> mercury <b>vapor</b> for use with a small turbine-generator package. Through the use of a Rankine cycle, the mercury vapor can be provided continuously to power a turbine-driven alternator and produce electricity for extended periods of time. This mercury boiler and the related power-conversion system was planned for a satellite that would orbit the earth. This system design and development program was designated as SNAP-I. Development of the mercury boiler is described and a chronological description of the various mercury-boiler concepts is presented. The applicable results of an extensive literature survey of mercury are included. The mercury-boiler experimental-test-program description provides complete coverage of each experimental boiler and its relation to the system design of that period.
