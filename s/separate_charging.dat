50|$|A {{two-stage}} design (<b>separate</b> <b>charging</b> section {{ahead of}} collecting section) has {{the benefit of}} minimizing ozone production, which would adversely affect health of personnel working in enclosed spaces. For shipboard engine rooms where gearboxes generate an oil mist, two-stage ESP's are used to clean the air, improving the operating environment and preventing buildup of flammable oil fog accumulations. Collected oil is returned to the gear lubricating system.|$|E

50|$|The first {{commercial}} two-stroke engine involving in-cylinder compression {{is attributed to}} Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk, who patented his design in 1881. However, unlike most later two-stroke engines, his had a <b>separate</b> <b>charging</b> cylinder. The crankcase-scavenged engine, employing the area below the piston as a charging pump, is generally credited to Englishman Joseph Day. The first truly practical two-stroke engine is attributed to Yorkshireman Alfred Angas Scott, who started producing twin-cylinder water-cooled motorcycles in 1908.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, {{two factors}} changed the {{provision}} of vehicle radio within the British Army. The first of these was a change of philosophy for battlefield radio communication {{as a result of}} wartime experiences and the political and military situation in Europe after 1945 which was addressed by the [...] "New Range" [...] of sealed, primarily VHF/FM Combat Net Radio introduced from 1954. This would later become known as the Larkspur series of equipment after the 1962 project to equip the whole army with the new radio system. This modern design of equipment, although still using valves, was lightweight and where possible avoided the motor-generator/ rotary converter power supplies of earlier generation equipment such as the No. 19 set, {{in order to reduce the}} sets' power requirements. [...] The second factor was the development of the 'CT' (a contraction of CombaT) range of soft-skin combat vehicles, as a purpose-designed and more rugged alternative to the General Service vehicles based on modified commercial (CL) vehicles. These CT vehicles, particularly the FV1801 Austin Champ ¼ ton and the FV1600 series Humber 1 ton, were powered by the new Rolls-Royce B range engines. Drawing on wartime experience, these engines were designed with built-in radio suppression, especially their ignition system, and they were also available with purpose-designed high-output generators, and were based on 24v systems in accordance with agreements reached with the US and Canadian armies in 1948. These 25A generators were initially thought sufficiently powerful to supply and charge the radio batteries directly, no longer needing the <b>separate</b> <b>charging</b> set. The generator had an internal two-speed automatic gearbox, which increased the charging rate when the engine was running at near-idling speed. However it soon became clear that this was insufficient to meet the demands of the new sets and higher output systems based on alternators were later introduced.|$|E

The paper describes the Solid State Pulsed Power Module (SSPPM) for driving this device and the application specific requirements for this power system. Based on the same technology used to power CYMER excimer lasers, the SSPPM employs IGBT switching and magnetic pulse compression to generate the pulse delivered to the DPF. The current design generates a 4 kV, ~ 30 ns risetime pulse. Two <b>separate</b> <b>charging</b> systems {{have been used to}} date.

40|$|Laboratory {{simulations}} of dust grain charging {{can provide an}} unique data about inuence of the <b>separate</b> <b>charging</b> processes, which are inseparable otherwise. Knowledge of the inuence of individual processes is important for understanding charging dust grains in real conditions. For laboratory experiments the electrodynamic trap, in which is captured single dust grain, is used. We have analysed several particular trap geometries and their inuence on the accuracy of measurements in this work. We deale mainly with nding of the electrode layout, which forms an open trap and therefore minimises unwanted electron emission from electrodes. We have found such modication of a linear quadrupole, which allows to trap the charged grain in the axial direction too. The calculation shows that the modication should not have a negative inuence on the electric eld {{with respect to the}} measuring of the grain specic charge...|$|E
