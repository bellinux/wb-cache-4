40|$|National audienceWe {{investigated}} hysteresis {{and context}} {{effects in the}} pitch perception of Shepard tones (Shepard, J Acoust Soc Am, 1964). Hysteresis is a memory-like phenomenon which occurs in systems whose present state depends on recent history. Shepard tones are complexes of sinusoidal components with an octave relationship, filtered by a fixed Gaussian envelope. When two such tones with different fundamental frequencies (F 0) are presented successively, the dominant cue for judging pitch direction is the log-frequency proximity between components. At an F 0 -interval of a half-octave (6 semitones, or a tritone), the pitch direction heard is ambiguous. We investigated hysteresis in Shepard tones in several different conditions, which were presented to subjects as series of trials. In the first condition, Shepard tone pairs were presented with a fixed F 0 -interval of 6 semitones. The order of <b>standard</b> and <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> within each trial was random. Subjects indicated whether they heard upward or downward pitch change. Perception was ambiguous across subjects and series, but remarkably stable for a single series. In a second condition, F 0 -intervals (from 1 to 11 semitones) were presented in random order. Hysteresis was observed: the percept in a given trial was biased by the percept in the previous trial. Hysteresis was confirmed in additional conditions where F 0 -intervals were presented in increasing or decreasing series. Unlike previous investigations, hysteresis is observed with an equivalent number of upward or downward responses. Thus, the biases observed cannot be attributed to response perseverence {{and are likely to}} be perceptual in origin. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} produce strong hysteresis in pitch perception by using ambiguous stimuli. Our method creates possibilities for future investigations of the neural bases of pitch as activity may be recorded for different subjective percepts caused by the same stimulus...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the spontaneous detection of “wrong notes ” in a melody that modulated continuously through all 24 {{major and minor}} keys. Three variations of the melody were composed, each of which had distributed within it 96 <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> of the same pitch, for example, A 2. Thus, the <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> would blend into some keys and pop out in others. Participants were not asked to detect or judge specific test tones; rather, {{they were asked to}} make a response whenever they heard a note that they thought sounded wrong or out of place. This task enabled us to obtain subjective measures of key membership in a listening situation that approximated a natural musical context. The frequency of observed “wrong-note ” re-sponses across keys matched previous tonal hierarchy results obtained using judgments about discrete probes following short contexts. When the <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> were nondiatonic notes in the present context they elicited a response, whereas when the <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> occupied a prominent position in the tonal hierarchy they were not detected. Our findings could also be explained by the relative salience of the test pitch chroma in short-term memory, such that when the <b>test</b> <b>tone</b> belonged to a locally improbable pitch chroma it was more likely to elicit a response. Regardless of whether the local musical context is shaped primarily by “bottom-up ” or “top-down ” influences, our findings establish a method for estimating the relative salience of individual test events in a continuous melody...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined whether {{timing of}} short intervals is beat- or interval-based. In Experiment 1, subjects heard {{a sequence of}} standard tones followed by 2 test tones; they compared the interval between <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> to the interval between the standards. If optimal precision required beat-based timing, performance should be best in blocks in which the interval between <b>standard</b> and <b>test</b> reliably matched the standard interval. No such effect was observed. In Experiment 2, subjects heard 2 <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> and reproduced the intertone interval by producing 2 keypress responses. Entrainment to the beat was apparent: First-response latency clustered around the standard interval and {{was positively correlated with}} the produced interval. However, responses occurring on or near the beat showed no better temporal fidelity than off-beat responses. One plausible interpretation of these findings is that the brain always times brief intervals with an interval timer; however, this timer {{can be used in a}} cyclic fashion to trigger rhythmic responses. The perception of short intervals of time is a fundamental perceptual process that is relatively poorly understood. I consider two very different conceptions of how the brain's underlying timing circuitry might work. The first conception is of a beatbase...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Decrements of {{auditory}} evoked responses elicited by repeatedly presented sounds {{with similar}} frequencies {{have been well}} investigated by means of electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However the possible inhibitory interactions between different neuronal populations remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of proceeding notch-filtered noises (NFNs) with different frequency spectra on a following <b>test</b> <b>tone</b> using MEG. Results Three-second exposure to the NFNs resulted in significantly different N 1 m responses to a 1000 Hz <b>test</b> <b>tone</b> presented 500 ms after the offset of the NFNs. The NFN with a lower spectral edge closest to the <b>test</b> <b>tone</b> mostly decreased the N 1 m amplitude. Conclusion The decrement of the N 1 m component after exposure to the NFNs could be explained partly in terms of lateral inhibition. The results demonstrated that the amplitude of the N 1 m was more effectively influenced by inhibitory lateral connections originating from neurons corresponding to lower rather than higher frequencies. We interpret this effect of asymmetric lateral inhibition in the auditory system as {{an important contribution to}} reduce the asymmetric neural activity profiles originating from the cochlea. </p...|$|R

40|$|Results were {{reported}} of psychophysical forward-masking experiments using a lateralization method. A general interpretation of masking was given, considering masking {{to be the}} combined result of three different mechanisms: the overlap mechanism, the adaptation mechanism, and the suppression mechanism.

Masking was measured in a band-widening experiment using a <b>test</b> <b>tone</b> frequency of 3 kHz, which is the center frequency of the masking noise.

40|$|Research has {{established}} {{that there is}} a cognitive link between perception and production of the same movement. However, there has been relatively little research into the relevance of this for non-expert perceivers, such as music listeners who do not play instruments themselves. In two experiments we tested whether participants can quickly learn new associations between sounds and observed movement without performing those movements themselves. We measured motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of participants’ right hands while <b>test</b> <b>tones</b> were heard and single transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses were used to trigger motor activity. In Experiment 1 participants in a ‘human’ condition (n= 4) learnt to associate the <b>test</b> <b>tone</b> with finger movement of the experimenter, while participants in a ‘computer’ condition (n= 4) learnt that the <b>test</b> <b>tone</b> was triggered by a computer. Participants in the human condition showed a larger increase in MEPs compared with those in the computer condition. In a second experiment pairing between sounds and movement occurred without participants repeatedly observing the movement and we found no such difference between the human (n= 4) and computer (n= 4) conditions. These results suggest that observers can quickly learn to associate sound with movement, so it should not be necessary to have played an instrument to experience some motor resonance when hearing that instrument...|$|R
