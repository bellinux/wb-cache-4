As I walked beside your horse when you carried my daughter before you after saving her life, I felt that this relation had commenced, and that henceforward our fates were connected.

Over the years, it has grown quite a bit to encompass capabilities that go beyond the simple sequential file. Most SAS programmers have used the FILENAME statement to read/write external files stored on disk. However, few programmers have used it to access devices other than disk or to interface with different access methods. This paper focuses on some of those capabilities by <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> interesting devices and access methods supported by the FILENAME statement.
