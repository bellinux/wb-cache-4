2500|$|After 1825 a horse tramway {{led from}} the High Horse Level round {{the edge of the}} marsh to a picking floor {{near the top of the}} Swart Beck. Here, pieces of waste rock were {{separated}} from ore by hand and dumped. The ore was then crushed, originally by hand using wide-headed hammers (called buckers). A crushing mill was erected in about 1827, probably using a roller crusher powered by a water wheel, although this still required ore to be broken by hand (known as [...] "knocking") into pieces less than [...] in <b>size.</b> <b>Water</b> was also used to separate the galena from the gangue in hotching tubs. These worked by jigging the crushed mixed ore up and down in a tub of water; the heavier galena worked its way to the bottom of the swirling mixture and the lighter gangue to the top. There were probably no slime pits at this date, so very fine lead ore and mud in the water polluted the beck and the lake. Until 1828 the concentrated ore was taken to the High Wath smelter at Caldbeck.|$|E

50|$|In sedimentology, wave-formed ripples or wave-formed {{ripple marks}} are {{a feature of}} sediments (sandstones, limestones, siltstones) and dunes. These ripple marks are often characterised (and thus {{distinguished}} from current ripples) by symmetric cross sections and long relatively straight crests, which may commonly bifurcate. Commonly, these crests can be truncated by subsequent flows. Their wavelength (periodicity) depends on the sediment grain <b>size,</b> <b>water</b> depth and water-particle orbits in the waves. On tidal flats the pattern of wave-formed ripples may be complicated, {{as a product of}} changing depth and wind and tidal runoff directions. Symmetrical ripples are commonly found in shallow waters. Beaches are a good place to find these ripples.|$|E

50|$|Osmosis {{is a vital}} {{process in}} {{biological}} systems, as biological membranes are semipermeable. In general, these membranes are impermeable to large and polar molecules, such as ions, proteins, and polysaccharides, while being permeable to non-polar and/or hydrophobic molecules like lipids {{as well as to}} small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and nitric oxide. Permeability depends on solubility, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute <b>size.</b> <b>Water</b> molecules travel through the plasma membrane, tonoplast membrane (vacuole) or protoplast by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer via aquaporins (small transmembrane proteins similar to those responsible for facilitated diffusion and ion channels). Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells. The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis across the cell membrane between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment.|$|E
50|$|The Washoe process, a {{variation}} of pan amalgamation, {{was developed in the}} 1860s by Almarin B. Paul and others, to work the ore from the Comstock Lode in Nevada, United States (Washoe was an early name for the area; see Washoe Valley). In the Washoe process, the copper pans were replaced by iron tanks with mechanical agitators. Each tank ("pan") was circular, and commonly held 1,200 to 1,500 pounds of ore that had been crushed to sand <b>size.</b> <b>Water</b> was added to make a pulp, and 60 to 70 pounds of mercury, along with one-half to three pounds each of salt (sodium chloride) and bluestone (copper(II) sulfate) were also added. A circular iron plate called a muller was mounted on a vertical shaft and lowered into the pan, and was rotated to provide both agitation and additional grinding. Heat was delivered to the pans by steam pipes. The iron filings worn from the muller and pan proved to be an essential ingredient in the process.|$|E
50|$|The Azraq Wetlands, {{located in}} Jordan's eastern desert {{near the town}} of Azraq, is RSCN's only {{wetlands}} reserve. The reserve, once a popular stopover for millions of migratory birds going from Africa to Eurasia, is now severely depleted due to over-pumping to support Jordan's growing population. In 1978, the reserve was established as an effort to conserve the oasis. Between 1981 and 1993, water levels decreased sharply, concluding with the drying up of the springs in 1992. Azraq today only makes up 0.04% of its former <b>size.</b> <b>Water</b> levels are maintained by RSCN in order to save indigenous fish species such as the Azraq Killfish and to keep the site a tourist destination. Efforts have been partially successful; some birds have returned and killfish have increased in numbers, but attempts to increase the water mass by 10% of the original size have been unsuccessful. Water pumping and lack of manpower and wetland experience keep water levels at a low.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} DSO 606, [...] "Quantifying Skeletal Muscle SIze by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)," [...] was to non-invasively {{quantify}} changes in <b>size,</b> <b>water,</b> and lipid composition in antigravity (leg) muscles after spaceflight. This experiment {{was the first}} attempt to measure limb volumes before and after flight since the less sophisticated methods of measuring limb girths during Apollo and SKylab programs were used. The subjects included a total of eight Space Shuttle crewmembers, five from a 7-day flight and three from a 9-day flight. All subjects completed one preflight and two postflight tests on either L-30 or L-16 and on R+2 and R+7. Testing involved obtaining an MRI scan of the leg (soleus and gastrocnemius) at The University of Texas - Houston Health Science Center, Hermann Hospital. Multi-slice axial images of the leg were obtained to identify and locate various muscle groups. Changes in water and lipid content were measured, in addition to CSA, to distinguish changes in fluid versus tissue volumes. Multiple slices were measured by computerized planimetry.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} prey selection, Siberian weasels are midway between small, rodent-eating mustelids {{and the more}} {{polyphagous}} martens. They rarely eat reptiles, invertebrates and plants, preferring instead to prey on rodents of small to moderate <b>size.</b> <b>Water</b> voles are their most frequent prey in their western range, while voles and mice are eaten in their eastern range. Moderate sized rodents targeted by Siberian weasels in the east include Daurian and Alpine pikas, and Siberian zokors. In local areas, chipmunks, muskrats, red squirrels and jerboas are eaten. Fish may be eaten in some areas during certain seasons. In Ussuriland, they may scavenge extensively on the kills of wolves and yellow-throated martens during the winter. Elsewhere, small birds are an important food item. Reptiles and amphibians are typically eaten at {{the periphery of the}} Siberian weasel's range. Plant foods known to be eaten by Siberian weasels include pine nuts and actinidia fruits. They typically eat about 100-120 gm of food daily, and cache excess food. In urban areas in China, Siberian weasels prey extensively on rats. They are capable of single-handedly killing and dragging the largest fowls. In contrast to sables, which are ambush predators, Siberian weasels are active hunters, readily chasing prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses.|$|E

50|$|Jal-tarang {{finds its}} first mention in Sangeet Parijaat. This medieval musical {{treatise}} categorizes this instrument under Ghan-Vadya (Idiophonic instruments in which sound {{is produced by}} striking a surface, also called concussion idiophones.) SangeetSaar considered one with 22 cups to be complete jal tarang and one with 15 cups to be of mediocre status. Cups, of varying sizes were made of either bronze or porcelain. Today only china bowls are preferred by artistes, numbering around sixteen in normal use. Cups for Mandra Swar (notes of lower octave)are large while those for Taar Swar (notes of higher octaves) are smaller in <b>size.</b> <b>Water</b> is poured into the cups and the pitch is changed by adjusting the volume {{of water in the}} cup. The number of cups depends on the melody being played. The bowls mostly are arranged in a half-circle in front of the player who can reach them all easily. The player softly hits the cups with a wooden stick on the border to get the sound. It's not easy to tune the instrument and needs some skill. During playing fine nuances can be reached if the performer is accomplished. SangeetSaar mentions that if the player can rotate the water through a quick little touch of the stick, nuances and finer variations of the note can be achieved.|$|E
50|$|The shallowness of {{the links}} between the Bras d'Or Lake and the Atlantic Ocean have {{resulted}} in a complex post-glacial history. Final melting of glacial ice probably occurred about 10,000 years after the Younger Dryas climatic oscillation. The first sediments deposited above glacial till in {{the central part of the}} lake, probably 10,000 to 9,000 years ago, contain dinocysts that indicate some penetration of marine water into the lake. The relatively high sea level inferred at this time reflects the continuing depression of the land from loading by glacial ice. Rebound from this depression cut off marine-water influx from about 9,000 to 4,500 years ago. As a result, for many thousands of years the Bras d'Or Lakes were fresh and relatively stable in <b>size,</b> <b>water</b> level and shoreline and were divided into a series of smaller lakes connected by rivers. East Bay was for the most part dry land during this period but the deeper area in the western part of the present bay was even then a significant bay off the main body of the largest of these lakes. Well-preserved and recognizable submerged coastal landforms are common in this part of East Bay. Clearly discernible tombolos, spits, and barrier beaches are present at this former coastline, 25 - 23 m below present lake water levels. To the east, the present deep section of the bay east of the McPhee Islands was also a small lake, separated from the other lakes by a section of dry land, connected by a stream.Late Holocene subsidence resulted in a renewed influx of marine water in the last 4,500 years. The effects of this subsidence are seen in the transgressive character of many of the shoreline features.|$|E

The mechanical performance of rovings and single fibres of well-defined silane <b>sized</b> and <b>water</b> <b>sized</b> E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to 400 °C. Thermal conditioning for 15 minutes led to strength degradation of greater than 50 % at higher temperatures. The tensile strength of silane coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 °C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. The <b>water</b> <b>sized</b> fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution of the <b>water</b> <b>sized</b> fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three parameter Weibull distribution.
