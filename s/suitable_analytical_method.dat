The main {{objective of this}} work was to study, in model cosmetic lipophilic vehicles, the degradation of retinyl palmitate (RetP) to the less active cis-isomers in presence of widely used conservative agents (propyl gallate and Vitamin E). Two lipophilic phases were used (liquid paraffin and almond oil) because liquid paraffin, almost composed of satured hydrocarbons, is not degraded by light exposure, while almond oil, containing several double bonds, could interfere with light-induced degradative process of RetP. In the first phase, the more <b>suitable</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> was chosen between normal and reverse phase HPLC to follow the degradation of RetP.
