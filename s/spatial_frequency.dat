LoschkyTo {{investigate}} {{the role of}} various bands of <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> for drawing, untrained artists drew four portraits from four different bands of <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> (e. g. unfiltered, 4 - 8, 8 - 16, & 16 - 32 cycles per face width (c/fw)). Raters then judged {{the accuracy of the}} drawings in comparison to both the source image from which the drawings were produced and an unfiltered version of the same face. The results show that low <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> (LSFs) and high <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> (HSFs) were useful for drawing, relative to middle <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> (MSFs). Additionally, the unfiltered condition that contained all <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> produced the most accurate drawings. This suggests that when artists are allowed access to both LSFs and HSFs they are able to utilize the global structure information carried in LSFs as well as the edge and detail information carried in HSFs to create more accurate drawings. The author posits that the MSFs that are useful for face recognition become redundant for drawing and that novice artists discount these MSFs in the control condition in order to increase the saliency and usefulness of the LSFs and HSFs. The results have implications for art education, drawing technology and the development of low-level drawing theory...|$|R

25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in brightness between two stimuli, divided by the sum of brightness of both stimuli. Contrast sensitivity is the inverse of the smallest contrast that can be detected, a contrast sensitivity of 100 means that the smallest contrast that can be detected is 1%. Birds have comparably low contrast sensitivity to mammals. Humans have been shown to detect contrasts as low as 0.5-1%, whereas most birds tested have require ca 10% contrast to show a behavioural response. A contrast sensitivity function describes an animal's ability to resolve detect the contrast of patterns of different <b>spatial</b> <b>frequency</b> (detail). For stationary viewing experiments the contrast sensitivity is highest for a medium <b>spatial</b> <b>frequency</b> and lower for higher and lower spatial frequencies.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to find out what {{differences}} between foveal and peripheral pattern recognition remain unexplained by the inhomogeneities of retinal sampling and the optics of the eye. We measured contrast thresholds for pattern recognition at different eccentricities. The effects of retinal sampling were homogenised by using M-scaling of the stimuli, and the effects of the optics of the eye were by-passed either by using strong external noise (signal-to-noise ratio is not affected by optical attenuation) or by computing retinal image contrast by means of the optical modulation transfer function. The stimuli were hand-written numerals filtered to two-octave bands of various centre object <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> (c/object). The results were described as contrast thresholds and recognition efficiency. At all eccentricities, lowest contrast thresholds and highest recognition efficiencies were found at medium object <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies.</b> At high object <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> the peripheral retinal contrast thresholds and recognition efficiencies were nearly as good as at the fovea, but at low object <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> most of the data showed superiority of the fovea to the periphery. Therefore, at high object <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> peripheral recognition performance could be explained relatively well by the retinal sampling gradient, or equivalently by the cortical magnification factor, together with the effects of the optics of the eye.

25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, <b>spatial</b> <b>frequency,</b> and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E

2500|$|Saccadic {{suppression}} {{is responsible}} for maintaining a continuous, stable, visual world by reducing visual sensitivity to events occurring before, during and after a saccade. The more complex the background on which the stimulus is presented, the larger the suppression. The increase in saccadic suppression {{can lead to a}} decrease in detection of change in the visual field. Saccadic suppression can be linked to the phenomenon of change blindness, in which individuals lack the ability to detect small or large changes within an environment without the aid of directed attention. [...] There are two types of saccadic suppression, with the first concerning the detection of light spot flashes during saccades. The lower the <b>spatial</b> <b>frequency,</b> meaning less objects in the visual field, of the light flashes the stronger the saccadic suppression. With a less number of items in the visual field it is easier for saccadic suppression to occur. The higher the <b>spatial</b> <b>frequency,</b> which involves more complex objects within the visual field, the less likely there will be saccadic suppression. The second type concerns the detection of image displacement or a change in an image during eye movement. A displacement between saccades would not be detected because the movement of the eye eliminates the signal for the detection of the displacement. The location of the target forms an image feature that is used by the visual system to establish space constancy, which maintains the location of an object in space. Target blanking is used to study visual stability, space constancy and the content of information transferred across saccades. Blanking a target after a saccade eliminates an attempt to make a second saccade, resulting in the visual system failing to find the target information. Stability and constancy across the saccades is broken, as a result, image displacements become easier to detect when blanking occurs during or right after the saccade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of stimuli which {{were hard to}} verbalize, and unlikely {{to be held in}} long-term memory, revolutionized the study of VSTM in the early [...] 1970s (Cermak, 1971; Phillips, 1974; Phillips & Baddeley, 1971). The basic experimental technique used required observers to indicate whether two matrices (Phillips, 1974; Phillips & Baddeley, 1971), or figures (Cermak, 1971), separated by a short temporal interval, were the same. The finding that observers were able to report that a change had occurred, at levels significantly above chance, indicated {{that they were able to}} encode [...] aspect of the first stimulus in a purely visual store, at least for the period until the presentation of the second stimulus. However, as the stimuli used were complex, and the nature of the change relatively uncontrolled, these experiments left open various questions, such as: (1) whether only a subset of the perceptual dimensions comprising a visual stimulus are stored (e.g., <b>spatial</b> <b>frequency,</b> luminance, or contrast); (2) whether [...] perceptual dimensions are maintained in VSTM with greater fidelity than others; and (3) the nature by which these dimensions are encoded (i.e., are perceptual dimensions encoded within separate, parallel channels, or are all perceptual dimensions stored as a single bound entity within VSTM?).|$|E
2500|$|This {{technique}} allows several (e.g., four) SSEPs to {{be recorded}} simultaneously from any given location on the scalp. Different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain, but easily separated by Fourier series analyzers. For example, when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies (F1 and F2) and superimposed, multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency (mF1 ± [...] nF2) are created in the SSEP, where m and n are integers. These components allow nonlinear processing in the brain to be investigated. By frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings, <b>spatial</b> <b>frequency</b> and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied. Stimuli of different sensory modalities can also be tagged. For example, a visual stimulus was flickered at Fv Hz and a simultaneously presented auditory tone was amplitude modulated at Fa Hz. The existence of a (2Fv + 2Fa) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain, {{and the distribution of}} this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized. More recently, frequency tagging has been extended from studies of sensory processing to studies of selective attention and of consciousness.|$|E

Here, the authors tested the hypothesis that the holistic perception of a face mainly relies on its low <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Holistic face perception was tested in two classical paradigms: the whole-part advantage (Experiment 1) and the composite face effect (Experiments 2 - 4). Holistic effects were equally large or larger for low-pass filtered faces as compared to full-spectrum faces and significantly larger than for high-pass filtered faces. The disproportionate composite effect found for low-pass filtered faces was not observed when holistic perception was disrupted by inversion (Experiment 3). Experiment 4 showed that the composite face effect was enhanced only for low <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but not for intermediate <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies</b> known be critical for face recognition. These findings indicate that holistic face perception is largely supported by low <b>spatial</b> <b>frequencies.</b> They also suggest that holistic processing precedes the analysis of local features during face perception. status: publishe...|$|R
