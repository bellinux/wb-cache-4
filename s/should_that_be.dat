500|$|Criticisms of Green Wing {{include the}} lazzi methods of filming {{and the overall}} length of the episodes, {{claiming}} that hour-long episodes are too long. The show won the 2005 and 2006 Comedy Tumbleweed Awards for [...] "Worst Camerawork". Some were also critical of what {{was seen as a}} decline in quality when the second series began. Cathy Pryor in The Independent on Sunday said that, [...] "Sadly, though, since I'm something of a fan, I have to report that the first episode of the second series is, disappointingly, rather flat. To be fair, {{there were a couple of}} laugh-out-loud moments - Dr Statham banging his head and falling down being one of them - but the whole [...] didn't quite gel. Or <b>should</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> coagulate? I'll stop making bad jokes now since I'm still not as funny as anyone in the show. But I sincerely hope that the opener is a one- off and not a sign that Green Wing is going down the pan." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man". In one speech he declares: [...] "The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of lifeâ€“ [...] why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? [...] Goddamnit, why <b>should</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> a hard pill to swallow? [...] Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater." [...] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the [...] "common man" [...] living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because [...] "you DON'T LISTEN!" [...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E
