40|$|The {{aim of this}} BachelorÂ´s Thesis is to {{characterize}} fundamental transient processes, which takes place in nuclear power-reactor. The main goal is the theoretical analysis of these processes, which include xenon poisoning, <b>samarium</b> <b>poisoning,</b> xenon after shutdown, xenon oscillation, and permanent poisoning. A {{significant part of the}} thesis deal with the simulation of xenon poisoning and <b>samarium</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Model was created using Maple software. One of the other points is to state the basic concepts of nuclear physics and also to describe nuclear power-reactor primary operating processes...|$|E
