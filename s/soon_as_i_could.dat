2500|$|Margarita's {{father wanted}} her to become a {{professional}} dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, [...] "From the time I was {{three and a half}} … as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons." [...] She noted [...] "I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a stranger, Walter. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> draw {{my breath}} again, I {{recognised}} him. He was {{the owner of}} the Lunatic Asylum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{followed}} {{you here}} as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Tom Bradley made another will, {{as he lay}} dying. I must have it, Mr. Merrick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, indeed," [...] responded Jim. [...] "The sea is my native element. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> swim in it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> a'most <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> walk, and <b>I</b> believe that--one way or other, in or on it--I {{have had}} more to do with it than with the land." ...|$|R
60|$|They are all witty dogs, thought I to myself, {{trying to}} make the best of the matter, for I saw it would not do to resent what they said; they can't mean any harm, though they are {{certainly}} very impudent; so I tried to laugh off their banter, but <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> put down my name and beat a retreat.|$|R
60|$|It was thereupon {{arranged}} that I {{should leave}} the next morning, that I should occupy {{one or two}} days in examining all the most convenient houses in Torquay, and that I should return with my report <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> conveniently <b>could.</b> A memorandum was written for me by his lordship, stating the requisites which the place I was sent to take must be found to possess, and a note of the pecuniary limit assigned to me was added by Sir Percival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, for I {{was finding}} my young friend a trifle overpowering, [...] "this is most satisfactory." ...|$|E
6000|$|Allonby laughed. [...] "Of {{course you}} could. But, I had my instructions. I {{was told to}} give Mr. Torrance the message as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> without troubling anybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak of}} Walter any more," [...] I said, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> control myself. [...] "Oh, Laura, spare us both the wretchedness of talking of him now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|His indignation, {{which seemed}} real and generous, {{transformed}} him into another man. He showered question after question upon me concerning my uncle and Mr. Allen; {{declared that he}} had known many villains, but had yet to hear of their equals; and finally, cooling a little, gave it as his judgment that the crime could never be brought home to them. This was my own opinion. He advised me, before we turned in, to [...] "gie the parson a Grunt" [...] <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> lay hands upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; not at first, that is. Of course I {{asked him}} {{who he was}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> thought he <b>could</b> bear the question. But he turned away, and merely {{said that he was}} a stupid man about some old London business, and that he should have gone to Prendergast. But when, after a while, I pressed him, he said that the man's name was Mollett, and that he had, or pretended to have, some claim upon the city property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} the first part will end <b>soon.</b> As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find out <b>as</b> we {{travelled}} through the country, and in Paris, even the mob are getting sick of this terrible bloodshed. That feeling will get stronger, until finally I believe that Robespierre and his gang will be overturned. What will come after that, I don't know. One may hope that some strong man will rise, drive out the Convention, and establish a fixed government. After that, I should say {{that no one can}} guess what will follow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{wonder you}} think so," [...] said Harry, laughing; [...] "but if I were you, I'd go home as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> {{and get some}} dry clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} {{two or three}} times,"' replied Bince, [...] "that I'd let you have it as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get it. I can't get you any now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--er--I packed it in a hurry, you know. I {{wanted to}} go fishing, and so I got through as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Oh, I guess it's all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, {{interrupting}} him: [...] "I saw {{just how}} it was going to be, and I'm thankful, THANKFUL that it happened. I saw that you didn't care enough for me to take me into your whole life; that you despised and distrusted me, and that it would get worse and worse to the end of our days; that we should grow farther and farther apart, and I should be left moping at home, while you ran about making confidantes of other women whom you considered WORTHY of your confidence. It all FLASHED upon me in an INSTANT; and I resolved to break with you, then and there; and <b>I</b> did, just <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go to my room for your things, and I'm glad,--yes,--Oh, hu, hu, hu, hu, hu!--SO glad I did it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know that. When I said I {{had never}} loved, I meant {{more than the}} love of a man for some {{particular}} woman. I meant love in every sense. I do not {{know what it is to}} have an affection for any human being. My parents died before I can remember. My only living relative was a penurious old uncle who brought me up for shame's sake and kicked me out on the world <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> don't make friends easily. I have a few acquaintances whom I like, but there is not a soul on earth for whom I care, or who cares for me." ...|$|R
60|$|When I reached London I found {{waiting for}} me an urgent request that I should go to Mrs. Strickland's <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> after dinner <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> found her with Colonel MacAndrew and his wife. Mrs. Strickland's sister was older than she, not unlike her, but more faded; {{and she had the}} {{efficient}} air, as though she carried the British Empire in her pocket, which the wives of senior officers acquire from the consciousness of belonging to a superior caste. Her manner was brisk, and her good-breeding scarcely concealed her conviction that if you were not a soldier you might as well be a counter-jumper. She hated the Guards, whom she thought conceited, and she could not trust herself to speak of their ladies, who were so remiss in calling. Her gown was dowdy and expensive.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{got away}} as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Gilbert was {{by way of}} {{becoming}} incoherent, and, so far as I was concerned, {{there was nothing more}} to be said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; O'Connor {{promised that}} he would ask for me, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak the language, so I stuck at it hard; and now, you see, I have got my reward." ...|$|E
6000|$|I lit in {{the middle}} of the floor, shot there by the {{electric}} suddenness of the surprise. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get my voice I said, apologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.' ...|$|E
60|$|Father Fahy's Civilities, {{when last}} at Madrid, {{exacting}} of me some suitable Acknowledgment, I went {{to pay him}} a Visit; as to render him due Thanks for the past, so {{to give him a}} further Account of his Countryman Brennan; but I soon found he did not much incline to hear any Thing more of Murtough, not expecting to hear any Good of him; for which Reason, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> well <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> changed the Conversation to another Topick. In which some Word dropping of the Count de Montery, I told him, that I heard he had taken Orders, and officiated at Mass: He made answer, it was all very true. And upon my intimating, that I had the Honour to serve under him in Flanders, on my first entring into Service, and when he commanded the Spanish Forces at the famous Battle of Seneff; and adding, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not but be surprized, that he, who was then one of the brightest Cavalieroes of the Age, should now be in Orders; and that I should look upon it as a mighty Favour barely to have, if it might be, a View of him; he very obligingly told me, that he was very well acquainted with him, and that if I would come the next Day, he would not fail to accompany me to the Count's House.|$|R
60|$|As <b>soon</b> after this, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get an Opportunity, I deliver'd, at his Quarters, my recommendatory Letters to Sir Walter Vane; who receiv'd me very kindly, {{telling me}} at the same time, that there were six or seven English Gentlemen, who had enter'd {{themselves}} Voluntiers in the Prince's own Company of Guards: And added, that he would immediately recommend me to Count Solmes, their Colonel. He was not worse than his Word, and I was enter'd accordingly. Those six Gentlemen were as follows, ---- Clavers, who since was better known by the Title of Lord Dundee; Mr. Collier, now Lord Portmore; Mr. Rooke, since Major-General; Mr. Hales, who lately died, and {{was for a long}} time Governor of Chelsea-Hospital; Mr. Venner, Son of that Venner remarkable for his being one of the Fifth-Monarchy Men; and Mr. Boyce. The four first rose to be very eminent; but Fortune is not to all alike favourable.|$|R
500|$|As a child, Rogen did {{not want}} to pursue any career other than comedy, stating [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{realized}} you <b>could</b> be funny as a job, that was the job I wanted". He got his start in show business at age 12 after enrolling in a comedy workshop taught by Mark Pooley. His early comedy routines involved jokes about his bar mitzvah, his grandparents, and his camp counsellors. During his teenage years he would perform stand-up comedy routines at places like bar mitzvahs and small parties, later shifting to bars. A mohel paid him to write jokes. At the age of13, he co-wrote a rough draft of Superbad with childhood friend Evan Goldberg, whom he had met at bar mitzvah classes. Based on their teenage experiences, Rogen and Goldberg spent the rest of their time in high school polishing the script. They initially worried that American Pie (1999) had beaten them to the idea for the movie, but they decided that the film [...] "managed to totally avoid all honest interaction between characters... which is what we're going for." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} I thought that his bad luck ’ad turned ’is brain. [...] "You’ve got it wrong," [...] I ses, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak. [...] "She walked out with me." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold a pen, I sent a {{telegram}} to you. Pray, pray {{come by the}} earliest train. I also telegraphed to old Mr. Dunboyne, at the hotel in London.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] I asked, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak. [...] "I am {{yours and}} yours only. What have I said, what have I done, to deserve those dreadful words?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{massacre}} at Fort Pillow occurred April 12, 1864, {{and has been}} the subject of congressional inquiry. No doubt Forrest's men acted like a set of barbarians, shooting down the helpless negro garrison after the fort was in their possession; but I am told that Forrest personally disclaims any active participation in the assault, and that he stopped the firing <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> also take it for granted that Forrest did not lead the assault in person, and consequently that he was to the rear, out of sight if not of hearing at the time, and I was told by hundreds of our men, who were at various times prisoners in Forrest's possession, that he was usually very kind to them. He had a desperate set of fellows under him, and at that very time there is no doubt the feeling of the Southern people was fearfully savage on this very point of our making soldiers out of their late slaves, and Forrest may have shared the feeling.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the {{massacre}} General Grant was no longer in Tennessee but had transferred to the east to command all Union troops. Major General William Tecumseh Sherman, Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, which included Tennessee, wrote: The massacre at Fort Pillow occurred April 12, 1864, and {{has been the subject of}} congressional inquiry. No doubt Forrest's men acted like a set of barbarians, shooting down the helpless negro garrison after the fort was in their possession; but I am told that Forrest personally disclaims any active participation in the assault, and that he stopped the firing <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> also take it for granted that Forrest did not lead the assault in person, and consequently that he was to the rear, out of sight if not of hearing at the time, and I was told by hundreds of our men, who were at various times prisoners in Forrest's possession, that he was usually very kind to them.

60|$|I {{knew that}} my only hope lay in escape {{from the city of}} Zodanga, for the matter of the four dead guardsmen would have to be explained, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never reach my {{original}} post without a guide, suspicion would surely rest on me so <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was discovered wandering aimlessly through the palace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid, my dear parents, and {{my beloved}} grandmother," [...] I continued, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, {{conscious}} {{of the necessity of}} being as prompt as possible, [...] "that you have misunderstood me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{went out}} to the carriage, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get away from you; but he wasn't in it. I sent Mr. Westover back to you and set out to look for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you tell}} me, Chainbearer, that Ursula has {{actually}} written a note, a letter, to this young man?" [...] I asked, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> muster resolution {{enough to put}} so revolting a question? ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{heard that}} I {{began to suspect}} Mrs. Tauilo {{was a little bit}} of a ventriloquist; and imitating <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> the sort of voice they make, asked her if the bad spirit did not talk like that. Faauma was very much surprised, and told me that was just his voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} might not fully have {{realized}} the effect of what you said. I ought to tell you, <b>I</b> think, that <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> reached home <b>I</b> wrote out, <b>as</b> accurately <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> from memory, the gist of your remarks. And I must say frankly, although I try to put it mildly, that they appear to contradict and controvert the doctrines of the Church." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{observation}} {{he made in}} a tone {{of perfect}} good-humour. I pricked up my ears at the hint, and answered <b>as</b> politely <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> that my ignorance of his condition and rank could be the only cause of my having stumbled on anything disagreeable; and that I was most willing to apologize for my unintentional offence, so <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> should know wherein it consisted.|$|R
