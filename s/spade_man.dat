2500|$|Huston used {{much of the}} {{dialogue}} from the original novel. The only major section of the novel which wasn't used {{at all in the}} film {{is the story of a}} man named [...] "Flitcraft", which Spade tells to Brigid while waiting in his apartment for Cairo to show up. Huston removed all references to sex that the Hays Office had deemed to be unacceptable. Huston was also warned not to show excessive drinking. The director fought the latter, on the grounds that <b>Spade</b> was a <b>man</b> who put away a half bottle of hard liquor a day and showing him completely abstaining from alcohol would mean seriously falsifying his character.|$|R
5000|$|From [...] "Digging" [...] My {{grandfather}} cut more turf in a dayThan {{any other}} man on Toner's bog.Once I carried him milk in a bottleCorked sloppily with paper. He straightened upTo drink it, then fell to right awayNicking and slicing neatly, heaving sodsOver his shoulder, going down and downFor the good turf. Digging.The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slapOf soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edgeThrough living roots awaken in my head.But I've no <b>spade</b> to follow <b>men</b> like them.Between my finger and my thumbThe squat pen rests.I'll dig with it. from [...] "Digging", Death of a Naturalist (1966) In 1957, Heaney travelled to Belfast to study English Language and Literature at Queen's University Belfast. During his time in Belfast, he found a copy of Ted Hughes's Lupercal, which spurred him to write poetry. [...] "Suddenly, the matter of contemporary poetry was the material of my own life," [...] he said. He graduated in 1961 with a First Class Honours degree.|$|R
5000|$|Give me the <b>spade,</b> and the <b>man</b> who can use it,A fig {{for your}} Lord and his soft silken hand;Let {{the man who}} has {{strength}} never stop to abuse it,Give it back to the giver - the land, boys, the land!There's no bank like the earth to deposit your labour,The more you deposit, the more you shall have;If there's more than you can give to your neighbour,And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave.Give me the spade! England's hope, England's glory!That fashioned the field from the bleak barren moor.Let us blazon its rare deeds in ballad and story,While 'tis brightened with labour - not tarnished with gore.It was not the sword that won our last battle,Created our commerce - extended our trade, -Gave food to our loving wives children, and cattle,But the queen of all weapons - the spade, boys, the spade.Give me the spade! There's a magic about itThat turns the black soil into bright shining gold,What would our fathers have done, boys, without it, -When the land lay all bare, and the night winds blew cold?Where the tall forest stood, and the wild beasts were yelling,And our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid, -The rich corn-stack is raised, and man claims a dwelling,Then hurrah! for our true friend - the spade, boys, the spade! ...|$|R
6000|$|A temper of {{scrutiny}} and dissent {{broke out in}} every direction. In almost every relation men and women asked themselves by what right Conformity levied its tax, and whether they were not false to their own consciences in paying it. 'What a fertility of projects for the salvation of the world! One apostle thought that all men should go to farming; and another thought that no man should buy or sell--that use of money was the cardinal evil; another thought the mischief was in our diet--that we eat and drink damnation. These made unleavened bread, and were foes to the death to fermentation. Others attacked the system of agriculture, the use of animal manures in farming, and the tyranny of man over brute instinct. These abuses polluted his food. The ox must be taken from the plough, and the horse from the cart; the hundred acres of the farm must be <b>spaded,</b> and the <b>man</b> must walk wherever boats and locomotives will not carry him.... Others assailed particular vocations.... Others attacked {{the institution of marriage}} as the fountain of social evils.... Who gave me the money with which I bought my coat? Why should professional labour and that of the counting-house be paid so disproportionately to the labour of the porter and the woodsawer? Am I not too protected a person? Is there not a wide disparity between the lot of me and the lot of thee, my poor brother, my poor sister?' ...|$|R
60|$|WHOEVER has had {{opportunity}} of acquaintance with society in New England {{during the last}} twenty-five years, with those middle and with those leading sections that may constitute any just representation of the character and aim of the community, will have been struck with the great activity of thought and experimenting. His attention must be commanded by the signs that the Church, or religious party, is falling from the Church nominal, and is appearing in temperance and non-resistance societies; in movements of abolitionists and of socialists; and in very significant assemblies called Sabbath and Bible Conventions; composed of ultraists, of seekers, of all {{the soul of the}} soldiery of dissent, and meeting to call in question the authority of the Sabbath, of the priesthood, and of the Church. In these movements nothing was more remarkable than the discontent they begot in the movers. The spirit of protest and of detachment drove the members of these Conventions to bear testimony against the Church, and immediately afterward, to declare their discontent with these Conventions, their independence of their colleagues, and their impatience of the methods whereby they were working. They defied each other, like a congress of kings, each of whom had a realm to rule, and a way of his own that made concert unprofitable. What a fertility of projects for the salvation of the world! One apostle thought all men should go to farming, and another that no man should buy or sell, that the use of money was the cardinal evil; another that the mischief was in our diet, that we eat and drink damnation. These made unleavened bread, and were foes to the death to fermentation. It was in vain urged by the housewife that God made yeast, as well as dough, and loves fermentation just as dearly as he loves vegetation; that fermentation develops the saccharine element in the grain, and makes it more palatable and more digestible. No; they wish the pure wheat, and will die but it shall not ferment. Stop, dear nature, these incessant advances of thine; let us scotch these ever-rolling wheels! Others attacked the system of agriculture, the use of animal manures in farming, and the tyranny of man over brute nature; these abuses polluted his food. The ox must be taken from the plough and the horse from the cart, the hundred acres of the farm must be <b>spaded,</b> and the <b>man</b> must walk, wherever boats and locomotives will not carry him. Even the insect world was to be defended,--that had been too long neglected, and a society for the protection of ground-worms, slugs, and mosquitos was to be incorporated without delay. With these appeared the adepts of homoeopathy, of hydropathy, of mesmerism, of phrenology, and their wonderful theories of the Christian miracles! Others assailed particular vocations, as that of the lawyer, that of the merchant, of the manufacturer, of the clergyman, of the scholar. Others attacked the institution of marriage as the fountain of social evils. Others devoted themselves to the worrying of churches and meetings for public worship; and the fertile forms of antinomianism among the elder puritans seemed to have their match in the plenty of the new harvest of reform.|$|R
6000|$|My {{acquaintance}} with grave-diggers, considering its length, was unremarkable. One, indeed, whom I found plying his spade {{in the red}} evening, high above Allan Water and {{in the shadow of}} Dunblane Cathedral, told me of his {{acquaintance with}} the birds that still attended on his labours; how some would even perch about him, waiting for their prey; and, in a true Sexton's Calendar, how the species varied with the season of the year. But this was the very poetry of the profession. The others whom I knew were somewhat dry. A faint flavour of the gardener hung about them, but sophisticated and disbloomed. They had engagements to keep, not alone with the deliberate series of the seasons, but with mankind's clocks and hour-long measurement of time. And thus there was no leisure for the relishing pinch, or the hour-long gossip, foot on <b>spade.</b> They were <b>men</b> wrapped up in their grim business; they liked well to open long-closed family vaults, blowing in the key and throwing wide the grating; and they carried in their minds a calendar of names and dates. It would be [...] "in fifty-twa" [...] that such a tomb was last opened, for [...] "Miss Jemimy." [...] It was thus they spoke of their past patients--familiarly but not without respect, like old family servants. Here is indeed a servant, whom we forget that we possess; who does not wait at the bright table, or run at the bell's summons, but patiently smokes his pipe beside the mortuary fire, and in his faithful memory notches the burials of our race. To suspect Shakespeare in his maturity of a superficial touch savours of paradox; yet he was surely in error when he attributed insensibility to the digger of the grave. But perhaps it is on Hamlet that the charge should lie; or perhaps the English sexton differs from the Scottish. The [...] "goodman delver," [...] reckoning up his years of office, might have at least suggested other thoughts. It is a pride common among sextons. A cabinet-maker does not count his cabinets, nor even an author his volumes, save when they stare upon him from the shelves; but the grave-digger numbers his graves. He would indeed be something different from human if his solitary open-air and tragic labours left not a broad mark upon his mind. There, in his tranquil isle, apart from city clamour, among the cats and robins and the ancient effigies and legends of the tomb, he waits the continual passage of his contemporaries, falling like minute drops into eternity. As they fall, he counts them; and this enumeration, which was at first perhaps appalling to his soul, in the process of years and by the kindly influence of habit grows to be his pride and pleasure. There are many common stories telling how he piques himself on crowded cemeteries. But I will rather tell of the old grave-digger of Monkton, to whose unsuffering bedside the minister was summoned. He dwelt in a cottage built into the wall of the churchyard; and through a bull's-eye pane above his bed he could see, as he lay dying, the rank grasses and the upright and recumbent stones. Dr. Laurie was, I think, a Moderate; 'tis certain, at least, that he took a very Roman view of death-bed dispositions; for he told the old man that he had lived beyond man's natural years, that his life had been easy and reputable, that his family had all grown up and been a credit to his care, and that it now behoved him unregretfully to gird his loins and follow the majority. The grave-digger heard him out; then he raised himself up on one elbow, and with the other hand pointed through the window to the scene of his lifelong labours. [...] "Doctor," [...] he said, [...] "I hae laid three hunner and fower-score in that kirkyaird; an it had been His wull," [...] indicating Heaven, [...] "I would hae likit weel to hae made out the fower hunner." [...] But it was not to be; this tragedian of the fifth act had now another part to play; and the time had come when others were to gird and carry him.|$|R
