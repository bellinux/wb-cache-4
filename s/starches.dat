5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as <b>starches</b> and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert <b>starches</b> in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the <b>starches</b> stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E

40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the effects of}} progressive in vitro haemodilution (30 % and 60 %) with potato <b>starch</b> derived hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> and corn <b>starch</b> derived hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> on blood coagulation in 80 patients using thrombelastography. Both solutions significantly compromised blood coagulation as evidenced {{by an increase in}} coagulation time and decrease in angle alpha, maximum amplitude and coagulation index (p < 0. 05). Blood coagulation was more compromised during haemodilution with potato <b>starch</b> derived hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> as compared with corn <b>starch</b> derived hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> (p < 0. 05). When taking the effect of haemodilution with 0. 9 % saline into account, haemodilution with both hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> solutions also augmented clot lysis (p < 0. 05), with potato <b>starch</b> derived hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> having a greater effect than corn <b>starch</b> derived hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Low Glycemic Index (GI) food {{products}} could become good choices for diabetic patients or {{people at risk}} of developing diabetes type 2. Arrowroot tuber (Maranta arundinacea) is a local tuber that has lower GI (8 - 32). Glycemic Index strongly related with <b>starch</b> digestibility. Amylose and resistant <b>starch</b> are two factors that influence <b>starch</b> digestion. Higher amylose and resistant <b>starch,</b> related with crystalline form of <b>starch,</b> can lower <b>starch</b> digestion. Processing arrowroot into instant <b>starch</b> or flour with low starchy digestion can be a proper choice. Drying using high temperature {{is known to be}} able to increase amylose, resistant <b>starch</b> and reduce the <b>starch</b> digestibility. This researh aim was to evaluate the effect of the drying temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C) on the amylose, resistant <b>starch,</b> and in vitro <b>starch</b> digestibility of instant arrowroot flour and <b>starch.</b> The analysis done were amylose, resistant <b>starch</b> and in vitro <b>starch</b> digestibility analysis. The higher the drying temperatures, resulted higher amylose content in instant <b>starch</b> and flour (Δamylose up to 34 %). For resistant <b>starch</b> analysis, the result showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between instant arrowroot <b>starch</b> and flour, also among the drying temperatures. Native <b>starch</b> and flour had the highest content of resistant <b>starch.</b> In vitro <b>starch</b> digestibility showed the highest glucose and <b>starch</b> released at the 120 minute, while at the 150 minute the glucose and <b>starch</b> release started to decrease.

5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and <b>starches</b> (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.|$|E

50|$|<b>Starch</b> {{production}} is an isolation of <b>starch</b> from plant sources.

30|$|<b>Starch</b> accumulates {{in plants}} {{as a complex}} {{carbohydrate}} form. There are various types of starch: the common corn/maize <b>starch,</b> tapioca <b>starch,</b> and wheat, rice and potato <b>starch.</b> The <b>starch</b> is insoluble in cold water, but dissolves in warm water. Dissolved <b>starch</b> in warm water makes <b>starch</b> paste [16]. The <b>starch</b> paste is used as thickening, stiffening or gluing agent. In this study, the tapioca <b>starch</b> (Pine Brand, Sitthinan Company Ltd.) from Central Department Store, Rattanathibet, Nonthaburi Province, Thailand was used.|$|R
25|$|Companies and labs {{are working}} on plants {{that can be used}} to make bioplastics. Potatoes that produce industrially useful <b>starches</b> have been {{developed}} as well. Oilseed can be modified to produce fatty acids for detergents, substitute fuels and petrochemicals.|$|E
25|$|During {{cooking and}} soaking, {{a number of}} {{chemical}} changes {{take place in the}} grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. <b>Starches</b> swell and gelatinize, and some <b>starches</b> disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body.|$|E
25|$|To produce ethanol from starchy {{materials}} such as cereal grains, the starch must first be converted into sugars. In brewing beer, this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or malt, which produces the enzyme amylase. When the malted grain is mashed, the amylase converts the remaining <b>starches</b> into sugars.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogenated <b>starch</b> hydrolysates are {{produced}} by the partial hydrolysis of <b>starch</b> - most often corn <b>starch,</b> but also potato <b>starch</b> or wheat <b>starch.</b> This creates dextrins (glucose and short glucose chains). The hydrolyzed <b>starch</b> (dextrin) then undergoes hydrogenation to convert the dextrins to sugar alcohols.|$|R
50|$|Acid-treated <b>starch</b> (INS 1401), {{also called}} thin boiling <b>starch,</b> is {{prepared}} by treating <b>starch</b> or <b>starch</b> granules with inorganic acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid {{breaking down the}} <b>starch</b> molecule and thus reducing the viscosity.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of potato <b>starch</b> comprises the steps such as delivery and unloading potatoes, cleaning, rasping of tubers, potato juice separation, <b>starch</b> extraction, <b>starch</b> milk rafination, dewatering of refined <b>starch</b> milk and <b>starch</b> drying.|$|R
25|$|The actual {{roasting}} {{begins when}} the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately , though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down <b>starches,</b> changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters {{the color of the}} bean.|$|E
25|$|Burmese cuisine also {{includes}} a variety of salads (a thoke), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from <b>starches</b> like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, kaffir lime, long bean, lahpet (pickled tea leaves), and ngapi (fish paste). These salads have always been popular as fast foods in Burmese cities.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{produced}} alcohols, {{most commonly}} ethanol, and less commonly propanol and butanol, {{are produced by}} the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or <b>starches</b> (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). Biobutanol (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.|$|E
50|$|Potato <b>starch</b> is <b>starch</b> {{extracted}} from potatoes. The {{cells of the}} root tubers of the potato plant contain <b>starch</b> grains (leucoplasts).
