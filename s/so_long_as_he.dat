5|$|The decree of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus's De Revolutionibus {{and other}} heliocentric works until correction.

5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have been searching for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought to fracture the Christian community by publicizing {{the fact that its}} clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some of the clergy sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were eager to be rid of the clergy in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, had his hands seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were told they had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E

25|$|One {{afternoon}} Ondine {{was walking}} near some stables {{when she heard}} the familiar snoring of her husband. When she entered the stable, she saw Sir Lawrence lying in the arms of another woman.

25|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{the notion}} of an inertial frame. For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid inertial frame, even if he is accelerating under gravity, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has no knowledge about anything outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, inertial frame is a relative concept. With this in mind, we can define inertial frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, so that a single inertial frame is defined as an element of this set.|$|E
25|$|Beazley's {{leadership}} of the Labor Party came under increasing pressure. Opposition to Beazley again centred around foreign affairs spokesperson Kevin Rudd and health spokesperson Julia Gillard. According to media reports, the New South Wales Right faction promised its support to Rudd for leadership <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> challenged Beazley before Christmas. On 30 November 2006, Rudd met with Beazley and announced his intention to challenge for the leadership. On 1 December, Beazley announced not only a leadership election but also that all frontbench positions within the Parliamentary Labor Party would be made vacant. Both sides claimed {{that they were in}} a winning position.|$|E
25|$|After making {{camp for}} the night, Prompto struggles with the {{knowledge}} that he is a clone who was intended to become a weapon. He admits to Aranea his fear of being rejected by Noctis if Noctis learns his secret and divulges his plan to run away. Aranea chastises him for being too concerned about what other people think as she was enlisted by Noctis to find him. She reveals that Verstael created a new model of magitek weapon called Immortalis that she intends to destroy, but refuses Prompto's help <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> doubts himself. Prompto is visited by the spirit of Lunafreya who reminds him of the bonds he shared with his friends, and Prompto resolves to rejoin them.|$|E

25|$|The war {{went very}} badly, and the Madison {{administration}} quickly sought peace, but were {{rejected by the}} British. The U.S. Navy did experience several successes after Monroe convinced Madison to allow the Navy's ships to set sail rather than remaining in port {{for the duration of}} the war. After the resignation of Secretary of War William Eustis, Madison asked Monroe to serve in dual roles as Secretary of State and Secretary of War, but opposition from the Senate limited Monroe to serving as acting Secretary of War until Brigadier General John Armstrong won Senate confirmation. As the war dragged on, the British offered to begin negotiations in Ghent, and the United States sent a delegation led by John Quincy Adams to conduct negotiations. Monroe allowed Adams leeway in setting terms, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ended the hostilities and preserved American neutrality.|$|E
25|$|News of {{the conference}} leaked and Tory churchmen were shocked that Rochester might have wavered in his faith. Rochester {{requested}} another conference and James consented. Rochester {{let it be known}} to influential Catholics at court that he would do everything they requested (except convert) <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remained in office. He told them that as a Protestant he would prove more useful to them than as a Catholic. However, on 17 December James called Rochester into an audience and told him that so high an office of Lord Treasurer could not be held by a staunch Anglican under a Catholic monarch. James asked him to think again on his refusal to convert but Rochester would not and on 4 January 1687 he was dismissed. However he received a pension of approximately £4000 per annum and £40,000 and estates from a convicted traitor.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Labor (DOL) and United States Department of Justice (DOJ) had prosecuted the Laborers' Union in 1995 for racketeering, {{corruption}} and ties to organized crime. A consent decree permitted Coia (elected in 1992) to remain president <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> made significant progress toward internal reforms. DOJ retained {{the authority to}} take over the union (appointing its own officers, setting its own budget, and making its own reforms) if Coia did not make what DOJ considered to be adequate progress toward reform. The agreement was modified and extended for one year in January 1998, and again in January 1999. By 1999, 226 individuals were expelled from the union, and 40 trusteeships of local unions established. A major reform was the first secret-ballot election for president and secretary-treasurer at the union's 1996 convention, which was also the first contested election for a LIUNA presidency.|$|E

25|$|Although Louis was a pious man, he {{soon came}} into a violent {{conflict}} with Pope Innocent II. In 1141, the Archbishopric of Bourges became vacant, {{and the king}} put forward as a candidate one of his chancellors, Cadurc, while vetoing the one suitable candidate, Pierre de la Chatre, who was promptly elected by the canons of Bourges and consecrated by the Pope. Louis accordingly bolted the gates of Bourges against the new bishop. The Pope, recalling similar attempts by William X to exile supporters of Innocent from Poitou {{and replace them with}} priests loyal to himself, blamed Eleanor, saying that Louis was only a child and should be taught manners. Outraged, Louis swore upon relics that <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lived Pierre should never enter Bourges. An interdict was thereupon imposed upon the king's lands, and Pierre was given refuge by Theobald II, Count of Champagne.|$|E
25|$|The Palestinian {{movement}} relocated {{most of its}} fighting {{strength to}} Lebanon {{at the end of}} 1970 after being expelled from Jordan in the events known as Black September. The umbrella organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)—by itself undoubtedly Lebanon's most potent fighting force at the time—was little more than a loose confederation, but its leader, Yassir Arafat, controlled all factions by buying their loyalties. Arafat allowed little oversight to be exercised over PLO finances as he was the ultimate source for all decisions made in directing financial matters. Arafat's control of funds, channeled directly to him by the oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Libya meant that he had little real functional opposition to his leadership and although ostensibly rival factions in the PLO existed, this masked a stable loyalty towards Arafat <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was able to dispense financial rewards to his followers and members of the PLO guerrilla factions.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen {{was born}} to an Afrikaner father and English mother in Pietermaritzburg, Natal Province, South Africa. He made his {{first-class}} debut for Natal in 1997 before moving to England in 2000, after voicing his displeasure at the racial quota system in South African cricket. Being of English ancestry, Pietersen was eligible for the England team <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> first served a four-year qualifying period in English county cricket. He was called up by England almost immediately after he completed four years with Nottinghamshire. He made his international debut in the One Day International (ODI) match against Zimbabwe in 2004 and his Test match debut in the 2005 Ashes series against Australia. Pietersen left Nottinghamshire for Hampshire in 2005, but the England team's subsequent reliance on him resulted in Pietersen making only a single first-class appearance for his new county between 2005 and 2010. In June 2010, Pietersen announced his wish to leave Hampshire; he joined Surrey on loan {{for the remainder of}} the season, then moved permanently in 2011.|$|E
