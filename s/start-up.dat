40|$|We use {{longitudinal}} data {{over a decade}} on <b>start-ups</b> and employment in Swedish regions and analyze the effect of <b>start-ups</b> on subsequent employment growth. We extend previous analyses by examining the influence of regional <b>start-ups</b> in a sector on regional employment growth in the same sector and on other sectors. We find differences between different types of <b>start-ups.</b> Knowledge-intensive <b>start-ups</b> seem to have larger effects on the regional economy. In particular, <b>start-ups</b> in high-end services have significant negative impacts on employment in other sectors but a positive long-run impact.

40|$|Abstract: It is a well-recognized fact {{across the}} world that <b>start-ups</b> in general, and {{technical}} <b>start-ups</b> in particular, are not exactly known for the systematic human resource development techniques, neither during their inception stage nor at their growth stage. The signifi cance of strategic human resource development strategy for <b>start-ups</b> is not considered, as they suffer from the myopia that HR strategies are only meant for mature and big organizations. But conversely, the business mortality is more {{in the case of}} technical <b>start-ups</b> than in the case of mature and stable organizations. Most often it is the exodus of key human resources results in the mortality of the technical <b>start-ups.</b> Hence, it is high time that <b>start-ups</b> in general and technical <b>start-ups</b> in particular adopt the proactive HR strategy and policy to deal with employee problems for an effective organization. Therefore, this research paper demonstrates the need for and imperative of rational HR policy and strategy for technical <b>start-ups.</b> It outlines the process of creating an effective HR policy and strategy for technical <b>start-ups.</b> Key-Words: technical <b>start-ups,</b> human resource development, human resource strategy, employee problems 1...|$|R
5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor <b>start-up</b> (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor <b>start-up</b> (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E

40|$|New {{technology}} based <b>start-ups</b> play a {{very important}} role in developing the economy of a country. In India telecom sector has seen unprecedented growth over the decade and this has led to emergence of several telecom related <b>start-ups.</b> However, product based B 2 Bstart-ups are still rare and they have to undergo several challenges to stay afloat. Surprisingly not much research work has been undertaken in identifying capabilities among early stage <b>start-ups</b> although the early phase represents a very crucial phase for product based firms and in determines the success or failure for <b>start-ups.</b> Present study explores the inherent marketing capabilities that enable commercialization among such early stage <b>start-ups</b> by adopting a multiple case based inductive methodology with Indian telecom <b>start-ups</b> as our context. We have identified market orientation, positioning and segmentation, selling and after sales services as components of marketing capability of such <b>start-ups.</b> We also identify several idiosyncrasies among telecom <b>start-ups</b> vis-�-vis established firms in the sector. Fina lly we make a case for policy level intervention to promote telecom <b>start-ups</b> in the Indian context. ...|$|R

In 2008 there were 351, 000 such <b>start-ups</b> with 1. 51 â€‰m employees.

40|$|This paper {{performs}} a {{critical analysis of}} the financial instruments that can be employed to fund social innovation, with a specific focus on social tech <b>start-ups</b> that develop and deploy technology-driven solutions to address social needs in a financially sustainable manner. The paper analyses how these <b>start-ups</b> can access financing, the barriers to financing that these organisations experience and the financial instruments that are most suitable to address their financial needs. Social tech <b>start-ups</b> have many points of overlap with high-tech <b>start-ups</b> {{in terms of the}} barriers they encounter to financing in different lifecycle stages. Still, the institutional solutions that are commonly exploited by high-tech <b>start-ups</b> for growth are not enough to support social tech <b>start-ups</b> to scale.
