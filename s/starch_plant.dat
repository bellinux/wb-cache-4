25|$|Teryokhin {{was born}} on 17 March 1896 {{in the village of}} Polyany in Ryazan Governorate to a peasant family. He {{graduated}} from seven grades, working as a shepherd and in a <b>starch</b> <b>plant</b> during his childhood and adolescence. In the winter he studied at a rural school, from which he graduated in 1910. From August 1915 he served in the Imperial Russian Army as a Ryadovoy and an Unteroffizier. Teryokhin was sent into combat in March 1917 in the Baltic, and reached the rank of Senior Unteroffizier before the Imperial Russian Army disintegrated following the Russian Revolution. He joined the Red Army in August 1918 and fought in the Russian Civil War. Teryokhin {{became a member of the}} Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) in 1919. He successively served as a platoon instructor in a volost vsevobuch department, the armourer of a Cheka battalion in Kaluga, and a platoon commander, fighting against the Mamontov raid, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine and the Tambov Rebellion. In 1920, he graduated from the Ryazan Infantry Courses.|$|E

40|$|A {{strength}} of two-dimensional {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} (2 D PAGE) {{is its ability to}} resolve and investigate the abundance of several thousand proteins in a single sample. Two different extraction procedures for two-dimensional electrophoresis of plant proteins are compared in this work. Phenol-based extraction methods have been mainly used to extract proteins from different organs or tissues on many species. We wanted to determine which of these protocols was optimal for <b>starch</b> <b>plants</b> in order to achieve both efficient protein extraction and high spot resolution on 2 -D gels. The phenol-based protocol was superior to the sodium phosphatase methods, showing larger protein yields and greater spot resolution on 2 -D gels...|$|R
50|$|Agrana {{was founded}} in 1988 as a holding company for the Austrian sugar and Starch industry. Operations started with 3 sugar plants (Tulln, Leopoldsdorf and Hohenau), a potato <b>starch</b> <b>plant</b> (Gmünd) and a corn <b>starch</b> <b>plant</b> (Aschach). Company history should however be {{considered}} dating back to 1902, when raw sugar production started in Leopoldsdorf. Similarly, sugar production in Tulln had started in 1937.|$|E

5000|$|Polymers {{which are}} {{branched}} but not crosslinked are generally thermoplastic. Branching sometimes occurs spontaneously during synthesis of polymers; e.g., by free-radical polymerization of ethylene to form polyethylene. In fact, preventing branching to produce linear polyethylene requires special methods. Because {{of the way}} polyamides are formed, nylon {{would seem to be}} limited to unbranched, straight chains. But [...] "star" [...] branched nylon can be produced by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with polyamines having three or more amino groups. Branching also occurs naturally during enzymatically-catalyzed polymerization of glucose to form polysaccharides such as glycogen (animals), and amylopectin, a form of <b>starch</b> (<b>plants).</b> The unbranched form of starch is called amylose.|$|R

He demolishes an old factory {{building}} while {{with a bit}} of help from Dozer, a bulldozer, dynamite is used to demolish two water towers and a tall cement chimney. Mack truck also arrives to pick up beams from the demolition site. The episode took place at the St. Lawrence <b>Starch</b> <b>Plant</b> in Port Credit Mississauga which was located at Hurontario and Lakeshore.|$|E
5000|$|The {{business}} made {{soluble starch}} from both farina and sago; by 1847 {{the business was}} profitable generating an excess of £1,000 (...) [...] In the late 1840s the business began promoting itself through extensive use of advertising, though initial positive effects were limited. In the 1850s the business began manufacturing laundry blue using ultramarine, and then black lead; the two products together with starch, plus their derivatives became the mainstay of the business. In 1857 the company began manufacturing biscuits. The developments of the 1850s led to extension of the works at Dansom Lane, and a new biscuit factory was built 1861, and a rice <b>starch</b> <b>plant</b> in 1864.|$|E

50|$|These noodles {{are made}} using various <b>plant</b> <b>starches.</b> Mung bean starch noodles will often be cut with tapioca starch {{to make them}} more chewy and reduce {{production}} costs.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>starch</b> synthesis in <b>plants,</b> <b>starch</b> can be synthesized from non-food starch mediated by an enzyme cocktail. In this cell-free biosystem, beta-1,4-glycosidic bond-linked cellulose is partially hydrolyzed to cellobiose. Cellobiose phosphorylase cleaves to glucose 1-phosphate and glucose; the other enzyme—potato alpha-glucan phosphorylase {{can add a}} glucose unit from glucose 1-phosphorylase to the non-reducing ends of starch. In it, phosphate is internally recycled. The other product, glucose, can be assimilated by a yeast. This cell-free bioprocessing does not need any costly chemical and energy input, can be conducted in aqueous solution, and does not have sugar losses.|$|R
50|$|Freight traffic usually {{operates}} only to {{the junction}} with the Metropolitan line at Tempe. A large amount of coal and a lesser amount of other freight are transported by rail on the line daily to and from Port Kembla, although freight trains are restricted from using the suburban lines during peak hours. South of Unanderra, freight trains serve the ballast quarries at Dunmore and Bombo while the only freight trains south of Bombo are to the Manildra Group's Bomaderry <b>starch</b> <b>plant.</b> As at October 2016, all services were operated by Pacific National. The only active coal mine on the line is served by a siding south of Otford. Most other coal trains come from the Gwabegar line in the state's Central West.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gelatinization}} {{temperature of}} starch depends upon plant type {{and the amount}} of water present, pH, types and concentration of salt, sugar, fat and protein in the recipe, as well as starch derivatisation technology are used. Some types of unmodified native starches start swelling at 55 °C, other types at 85 °C. [...] The gelatinization temperature of modified starch depends on for example on the degree of cross-linking of the amylopectin, the degree of acid treatment, acetylation.Gel temperature can also be modified by genetic manipulation of starch synthase genes. Gelatinization temperature also depends on the amount of damaged starch granules. These will swell faster. Damaged starch can be produced, for example, during the wheat milling process, or when drying the starch cake in the <b>starch</b> <b>plant.</b> There is an inverse correlation between gelatinization temperature and glycemic index.|$|E
50|$|The port was supplanted as {{a trading}} centre for {{shipping}} by {{the coming of}} the railway. Later in the 19th century, it became known for its stonehooking trade. Other industries such as the St. Lawrence Starch Works (1889-1989) and the Port Credit Brick Yard (1891-1927) provided employment for many local residents. In 1932 L.B. Lloyd built an oil refinery on the old brick yard site and operated by a succession of operators culminating in its purchase by a division of Texaco who operated it until its closing in 1985, when Texaco opened a new much larger facility at Nanticoke on Lake Erie. The tallest structure in Port Credit used to be the 320 ft smokestack at the St Lawrence <b>Starch</b> <b>plant</b> which has since been demolished. The stack falling marked the change of Port Credit into a residential area from the former industrial hub.|$|E
50|$|This {{solution}} {{is used as}} an indicator test {{for the presence of}} starches in organic compounds, with which it reacts by turning a dark-blue/black. Elemental iodine solutions like Lugol's will stain starches due to iodine's interaction with the coil structure of the polysaccharide. <b>Starches</b> include the <b>plant</b> <b>starches</b> amylose and amylopectin and glycogen in animal cells. Lugol's solution will not detect simple sugars such as glucose or fructose. In the pathologic condition amyloidosis, amyloid deposits (i.e., deposits that stain like starch, but are not) can be so abundant that affected organs will also stain grossly positive for the Lugol reaction for starch.|$|R
50|$|These noodles are {{typically}} made only with rice and water without {{the addition of}} salt. Although unorthodox, some producers may choose to add other <b>plant</b> <b>starches</b> to modify {{the texture of the}} noodles.|$|R
50|$|Another {{major factor}} in {{petroleum}} demand is {{the widespread use of}} petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, corn <b>starch,</b> hemp <b>plants,</b> pea <b>starch,</b> or microbiota. They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.|$|R
