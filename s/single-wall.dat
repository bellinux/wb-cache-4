2500|$|To {{design the}} cabins at Rapidan Camp, Lou Henry Hoover hired an {{architect}} who had built Girl Scout camps. The facilities were extremely rustic by modern standards. Some {{of the early}} structures such as the original Five Tents had just a wooden floor and [...] walls, with canvas tents above. Even the President's Cabin was built with <b>single-wall</b> uninsulated construction—slats of German Siding nailed to studs and exposed on both sides. There are no interior ceilings; rafters and roof boards are exposed. Shower stalls have tin walls and concrete floors. During Hoover's administration, cabin porches were decorated with boxes filled with geraniums, and interior floors were covered with grass rugs. The camp was modified throughout Hoover's presidency with new cabins and additions to existing cabins.|$|E

50|$|Having {{traced the}} cases to visitor stays {{earlier in the}} summer in what were called Signature Tent Cabins, erected to replace {{structures}} lost to the rockfall, the National Park Service closed all 91 new cabins.

The former helps keep the inner tent dry, but the latter is easier to pitch.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>single-wall</b> carbon nanotubes, {{excitons}} {{have both}} Wannier-Mott and Frenkel character. This {{is due to}} the nature of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes in one-dimension. The dielectric function of the nanotube itself is large enough to allow for the spatial extent of the wave function to extend over a few to several nanometers along the tube axis, while poor screening in the vacuum or dielectric environment outside of the nanotube allows for large (0.4 to [...] ) binding energies.|$|E
