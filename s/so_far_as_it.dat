25|$|Suite française, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was completed, {{was written}} in {{microscopic}} handwriting in a single notebook; Tempête and Dolce together filled 140 pages, corresponding to 516 published pages.

Comparison with surviving Greek and Latin fragments recommends the translation as literal and accurate <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> goes, but suggests {{that some of the}} original content is missing.

Logic he probably despised as merely an instrument of pedantic judgment for which, in his day, and especially at the universities, there was only too much ground.|$|E

25|$|I {{emphasize}} the violent and iconoclastic {{aspect of this}} painting because it is usually enshrined as the great formal exercise which was {{the starting point of}} Cubism.

25|$|In 1993, in {{cooperation}} with the Austrian Federal Bureau of Cultural Heritage Management (Bundesdenkmalamt), a garden grooming project was begun with the goals of preserving and reconstructing the gardens as a cultural monument to Romanticism.

25|$|Motherhood- Three {{generations of}} {{motherhood}} {{are present in}} the novel. The relationship most thoroughly explored is the one between Anna and her daughter Alyona. This relationship as depicted by Anna seems tumultuous and fraught with drama. However, as the novel progresses, the reader sees that Anna’s portrayal of her relationship with her daughter is accurate only in <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is a reflection of her relationship with her own mother. The novel ends on a redemptive note in which Anna shows that she is willing to forfeit everything- perhaps even her sanity- for her aging mother, and Alyona finds the strength to break away from the domineering Anna in order to be a better mother to her own children.|$|E

25|$|The second-oldest {{published}} {{account is}} {{known by the}} opening words of its long title: Huei tlamahuiçoltica ("The great event"). It was published in Nahuatl by the then vicar of the hermitage at Guadalupe, Luis Lasso de la Vega, in 1649. In four places in the introduction, he announced his authorship of {{all or part of}} the text, a claim long received with varying degrees of incredulity because of the text's consummate grasp of a form of classical Nahuatl dating from the mid-16th century, the command of which Lasso de la Vega neither before nor after left any sign. The complete work comprises several elements including a brief biography of Juan Diego and, most famously, a highly wrought and ceremonious account of the apparitions known from its opening words as the Nican Mopohua ("Here it is told"). Despite the variations in style and content which mark the various elements, an exclusively textual analysis by three American investigators published in 1998 provisionally (a) assigned the entire work to the same author or authors, (b) saw no good reason to strip de la Vega of the authorship role he had claimed, and (c) of the three possible explanations for the close link between Sánchez's work and the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, opted for a dependence of the latter upon the former which, however, was said to be indicated rather than proved. Whether the role to be attributed to Lasso de la Vega was creative, editorial or redactional remains an open question. Nevertheless, the broad consensus among Mexican historians (both ecclesiastical and secular) has long been, and remains, that the Nican Mopohua dates from as early as the mid-16th century and (<b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is attributed to any author) that the likeliest hypothesis as to authorship is that Antonio Valeriano wrote it, or at least had a hand in it.The Nican Mopohua was not reprinted or translated in full into Spanish until 1929, although an incomplete translation had been published in 1895 and Becerra Tanco's 1675 account (see next entry) has close affinities with it.|$|E
