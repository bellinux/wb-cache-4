40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} the importance of workers’ perceptions of and attitudes to <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Past researchers have found that a variety of individual factors (age, gender, gender role, and past experiences of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment),</b> and organisational factors (gender ratio, <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> policies and the role of employers), correlate with the incidence of sexually harassing behaviours. Two studies presented in this thesis extend this research and were designed to investigate how these factors relate to workers’ attitudes towards and perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Study one investigated 176 workers from a large, white-collar organisation. Study two sampled 75 workers from a smaller, blue-collar organisation. By comparing two different workplaces the effect of the organisational climate was investigated. Individuals from Study two experienced more <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> <b>were</b> more tolerant of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> and perceived less behaviour as <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> compared with individuals from Study one. The organisational context was found to affect the way in which organisational and individual factors related to workers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes to and their experiences of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> However, the factors that influenced workers’ perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>were</b> stable across both studies. Although workers’ attitudes to and their perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>were</b> significantly correlated, they were influenced by different factors. Overall, workers’ perceptions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>were</b> influenced by their attitudes, the behavioural context, and the gender of the victim and perpetrator. In contrast, attitudes to <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> appeared to <b>be</b> more strongly influenced by individual factors, such as age, gender, gender role, past experiences of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> and perceptions of management’s tolerance of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> The broader implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are suggested...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> <b>is</b> that it involves a range of behaviors.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the experience and perception of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> during the clinical practice of Korean nursing students. Methods: The descriptive study was conducted using a self-report questionnaire from December 2009 to January 2010. Participants were 542 nursing students recruited from 12 nursing colleges in Korea, who had finished 1, 000 hours of clinical practice which is the minimum requirement for graduation. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: Ninety-seven participants (17. 9 %) reported that they experienced <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> during clinical practice and 36 participants (6. 7 %) answered whether it <b>was</b> a <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> or not. When <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>was</b> asked by the specific 18 items in the <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> checklist, 52. 0 % (n =  282) of participants reported that they experienced at least 1 item among 18 items of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> <b>Sexual</b> <b>harassments</b> <b>were</b> frequently made by the persons in their 40 s (41. 2 %), men (97. 9 %) and patients (96. 9 %) and in the psychiatric wards (67. 0 %). Many respondents recognized that <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> during clinical practice was caused by abnormal sexual desire of a pervert (34. 5 %) or men’s sexual impulse (26. 2 %). Also, <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>was</b> perceived as a serious problem (19. 4 %) and education was necessary for prevention (88. 3 %). Conclusion: Education program is needed to prevent <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> and enhance the gender sensitivity of nursing students, who are in the high-risk group of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> during clinical practice. This will in turn contribute to a safe educational environment for clinical practice...|$|R
25|$|Research {{is ongoing}} into {{occupational}} hazards {{that may be}} specific to women. Of particular interest are potential environmental causes of breast cancer and cervical cancer. <b>Sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> an occupational hazard for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including anxiety, depression, nausea, headache, insomnia, and feelings of low self-esteem and alienation.

25|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> defined as, {{when any}} verbal, non-verbal or {{physical}} action {{is used to}} change a victim's sexual status against {{the will of the}} victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.|$|E
25|$|Peer-to-peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> {{three times}} more likely than perpetration by {{teachers}} or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers may also be a result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could be seen if a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical sexual harassment. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in peer groups.|$|E

25|$|A ban on {{discrimination}} {{was included}} in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure. Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.|$|E
25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the challenges}} faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E
