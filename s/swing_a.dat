5|$|The Macdonalds {{sought to}} {{maintain}} the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s. In the first few years, the park added a circle <b>swing,</b> <b>a</b> Whip, a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster. World War II and the resulting rationing forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the Caterpillar and a small showboat that sailed in Lake Bouquet.|$|E

5|$|Jazz is a {{genre of}} music from the United States which reached Barbados {{by the end of}} the 1920s. The first major {{performer}} from the island was Lionel Gittens, who was followed by Percy Green, Maggie Goodridge and Clevie Gittens. These bandleaders played a variety of music, including <b>swing,</b> <b>a</b> kind of pop-jazz, Barbadian calypso and waltzes. With little recorded music on the island, radio broadcasts such as Willis Conover's Voice of America had a major influence. In 1937, riots over poverty and disenfranchisement occurred, and people like Clement Payne had risen to fame advocating reform. In that year, Payne was deported and riots broke out in Bridgetown, spreading throughout the island. The following year, the Barbados Labour Party was formed by C. A. Braithwaite and Grantley Adams.|$|E
5|$|Western <b>Swing,</b> <b>a</b> musical genre {{with roots}} in country music, was made popular at Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom. The Tulsa Sound, a {{variation}} of rockabilly, blues, and rock 'n' roll, was started and largely developed by local musicians J. J. Cale and Leon Russell in the 1960s and 1970s. The Tulsa Sound heavily influenced musicians Eric Clapton and Jimmy Markham. Musicians from Tulsa or who started their musical careers in Tulsa include Garth Brooks, The Gap Band, Hanson, Caroline's Spine, Ronnie Dunn, Gene Autry, David Gates, Jamie Oldaker, Jim Keltner, Bob Wills, David Cook, Broncho, Tyson Meade, John Moreland, The Damn Quails, LANY, and JD McPherson.

25|$|The LCBL is {{a unique}} summer collegiate league for many reasons; most notably, the option players have to <b>swing</b> <b>a</b> bat made of wood or metal.

25|$|Virtually all {{proposals}} {{were based on}} the seconds pendulum, in which each <b>swing</b> (<b>a</b> half period) takes one second, which is about a meter (39inches) long, because by the late 17th century it had become a standard for measuring gravity (see previous section). By the 18th century its length had been measured with sub-millimeter accuracy at a number of cities in Europe and around the world.|$|E

25|$|The K-MAX {{relies on}} two primary {{advantages}} of synchropters over conventional helicopters: The increased efficiency compared to conventional rotor-lift technology; and the synchropter's natural tendency to hover. This increases stability, especially for precision work in placing suspended loads. At the same time, the synchropter is {{more responsive to}} pilot control inputs, {{making it possible to}} easily <b>swing</b> <b>a</b> load, or to scatter seed, chemicals, or water over a larger area.|$|E
25|$|Outswinger: An outswinger to a {{right-handed}} batsman can be bowled by aligning {{the seam}} {{slightly to the}} left towards the slips and placing the roughened {{side of the ball}} on the left. To extract consistent <b>swing,</b> <b>a</b> bowler can also rotate his wrist toward the slips while keeping his arm straight. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving away to the off side while in flight, usually outwards from his body.|$|E
