40|$|Commercially-available {{digital circuit}} modules {{have been used}} to {{construct}} a versatile <b>spectrum</b> <b>stabilizer</b> which can be used in conjunction with any multichannel pulse height analyzer employing analogue-to-digital conversion. Drifts in the position of a peak in the pulse-height spectrum cause the stabilizer to generate a correction voltage which can be utilized to restore the peak to its original position. The device follows the same sound principle as stabilizers described by Von Dardel and Ladd and Kennedy - that is, the point at which drifts in the spectrum are sensed (the input to the memory of the analyzer) occurs after the pulses have passed all the drift-prone stages of the spectrometer.

40|$|At the University of Hong Kong's {{positron}} beam {{two related}} positron defect spectroscopies are being developed, namely, positron deep level transient spectroscopy (PDLTS), and coincidence Doppler broadening spectroscopy. Both of these spectroscopies {{require the use}} of high purity Ge detectors and the standard high gain nuclear instrumentation amplifiers. In this paper we review some of the difficulties that we have encountered in making such measurements satisfactorily in one of the busiest cities of the world. Attempts, such as using battery power supply, opto-isolating from local mains, connecting to an independent ground and adding a <b>spectrum</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> have been made to overcome the noise problem. However, the results are not particularly promising. The reasons why are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
25|$|Sodium iodide systems, as {{with all}} {{scintillator}} systems, are sensitive to changes in temperature. Changes in the operating temperature caused by changes in environmental temperature will shift the spectrum on the horizontal axis. Peak shifts of tens of channels or more are commonly observed. Such shifts can be prevented by using <b>spectrum</b> <b>stabilizers.</b>|$|R

Topics considered include integrality over the invariant rings, properties of the canonical map between the prime <b>spectra,</b> orbital and <b>stabilizer</b> algebras, projectivity over the invariant rings, and descent of Cohen–Macaulayness...|$|R
