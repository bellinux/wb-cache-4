Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|E

50|$|In {{modern times}} only the terms Class 4 and Class 5 are much used, as any tandem office is {{referred}} to as a Class 4. This change was prompted in great part by changes in the power of switches and the relative cost of transmission, both of which tended to flatten the <b>switch</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> The breakup of the Bell System, and the need for each of the surviving regional operating companies to handle long distance interconnections, also promoted the inclusion of inter-regional and international processing through larger Class 4 offices.|$|R
50|$|Please {{note that}} the {{currently}} attached diagram of <b>switch</b> <b>hierarchy</b> is incorrect, as it identifies Class 1 points with International switching. International connections were located in places generally close to cable, later satellite, termination locations, and were {{not directly related to}} Class 1 switches. Major international connection points were located in Oakland, California; Miami, Florida; and New York, New York, with a number of secondary international operator toll points. Only after the rapid expansion of ESS terminal offices did operator handling of international calls begin to be off-loaded into the domestic network structure, as international calling services began to be customer dialable, ca. the mid-1980s. This in part paralleled the demise of the five-level hierarchy, so identification of international switches and class one offices is incorrect.|$|R

40|$|The vector-borne {{bacterium}} Borrelia hermsii, a {{relapsing fever}} agent, switches gene {{expression of a}} surface protein between different antigenic variants, thereby causing sequential waves of immune escape within hosts and increasing the likelihood of transmission. Analogous programmed systems of antigenic variation occur in African trypanosomes and Plasmodium falciparum. In these examples, switch rates to individual variants differ over a wide range. We studied how B. hermsii determines switch rates in two experimental infections: one where variants were identified by specific antisera and one based on identification by DNA sequence. Unexpressed loci of variant antigens copy into a single expression site at rates determined by extragenic features of silent loci rather than similarity between coding sequences of variants at silent sites and the single expression site. Two elements, in particular, determine switch rates. One set of elements overlaps the 5 ′ ends of the expressed gene and the silent loci; greater sequence identity between elements {{was associated with a}} higher switch rate. The second set of elements flanks the expression site on the 3 ′ side and occurs at variable distances downstream from silent loci; the nearer an element to a silent locus, the greater the switch rate of that locus into the expression site. In combination, these two features of the genome provide a simple mechanism to modulate switch rate whereby silent loci form a hierarchy of switch rates into the expression site. Although the <b>switching</b> <b>hierarchy</b> causes changes in individual cells that are stochastic, ordering of variants within hosts is semipredictable...|$|E
40|$|Mutually {{exclusive}} gene expression, whereby {{only one}} member of a multi-gene family is selected for activation, {{is used by the}} malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to escape the human immune system and perpetuate long-term, chronic infections. A family of genes called var encodes the chief antigenic and virulence determinant of P. falciparum malaria. var genes are transcribed in a mutually exclusive manner, with switching between active genes resulting in antigenic variation. While recent work has shed considerable light on the epigenetic basis for var gene activation and silencing, how switching is controlled remains a mystery. In particular, switching seems not to be random, but instead appears to be coordinated to result in timely activation of individual genes leading to sequential waves of antigenically distinct parasite populations. The molecular basis for this apparent coordination is unknown. Here we show that var 2 csa, an unusual and highly conserved var gene, occupies a unique position within the var gene <b>switching</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Induction of switching through the destabilization of var specific chromatin using both genetic and chemical methods repeatedly led to the rapid and exclusive activation of var 2 csa. Additional experiments demonstrated that these represent "true" switching events and not simply de-silencing of the var 2 csa promoter, and that activation is limited to the unique locus on chromosome 12. Combined with translational repression of var 2 csa transcripts, frequent "default" switching to this locus and detection of var 2 csa untranslated transcripts in non-pregnant individuals, these data suggest that var 2 csa could {{play a central role in}} coordinating switching, fulfilling a prediction made by mathematical models derived from population switching patterns. These studies provide the first insights into the mechanisms by which var gene switching is coordinated as well as an example of how a pharmacological agent can disrupt antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum...|$|E
5000|$|By the mid-1920s, {{a revised}} manual system where [...] "local" [...] toll {{operators}} connected tandem routes (a process formally called Combined Line and Recording) {{as needed to}} complete telephone calls, reduced the process {{to an average of}} two minutes, but still meant that some complex routing might interconnect as many as sixteen points. As long distance services grew in the Contiguous Continental US (48 states) and Canada, the amount of overhead equipment and people required to determine and establish Rates and Routes became excessive. As technology improved, network design included consideration of more automated and defined procedures. Thus, beginning with a switch installed in Philadelphia PA in 1943, AT&T began to automate the system, and establish a new <b>switch</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> which lasted until the breakup of AT&T in the 1980s.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{data centers}} will contain tens of {{thousands}} of servers with massive aggregate bandwidth requirements for generating, accessing, and analyzing immense amounts of data. The I/O requirements of the myriad applications that these data centers must support run the gamut from extreme IOPS intensive to extreme bandwidth intensive. Delivering high performance with unreliable commodity hardware for this range of workloads is truly a grand challenge. ZoneFS is a parallel file system that targets cloud data center infrastructures built up of commodity network switches. ZoneFS employs a highly-available and flexible storage architecture that divides a cluster <b>switch</b> <b>hierarchy</b> into zones and stripes data across servers and disks to maximize aggregate I/O throughput and avoid storage server hotspots. In this paper, we present the overall design and implementation of ZoneFS and evaluate its key features with several cloud computing workloads. Our experimental results show that ZoneFS can improve application runtime performance by up to 76 % over standard parallel file systems and by up to 85 % over Internet-scale file systems. I...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{requirement}} of hosting {{tens of thousands of}} hosts in today's data centers, data center networks strive for scalability and high throughput on the one hand. On the other hand, the cost for networking hardware should be minimized. Consequently, the number and complexity (e. g. TCAM size) of switches has to be minimized. These requirements led to network topologies like Clos and Leaf-Spine networks only requiring a shallow <b>hierarchy</b> of <b>switches</b> [...] -two levels for Leaf-Spine networks. The drawback of these topologies is that switches at higher levels like Spine switches need a high port density and, thus, are expensive and limit the scalability of the network. In this paper, we propose a data center network topology based on De Bruijn graphs completely avoiding a <b>switch</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and implementing a flat network topology of top-of-rack switches instead. This topology guarantees logarithmic (short) path length. We show that the required routing logic can be implemented by standard prefix matching operations in hardware (TCAM) allowing for using commodity switches without any modification. Moreover, forwarding requires only {{a very small number of}} forwarding table entries, saving costly and energy-intensive TCAM...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our {{experience}} on model checking of an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch using the Verification Interacting with Synthesis (VIS) tool. The switch we considered is in use for real {{applications in the}} Cambridge Fairisle network. It is composed of four input/output port controllers and a switch fabric, and contains around 1 MB memory, 2 KB FIFO buffer and 800 registers (latches). To overcome state space explosion, we adopted several abstractions and reductions, and applied compositional reasoning combined with two novel property division approaches. For the verification in VIS, we produced Verilog descriptions of the switch {{at different levels of}} design hierarchy and defined a number of relevant properties in CTL. Using the above techniques, we succeeded in verifying the <b>switch</b> at different <b>hierarchy</b> levels within reasonable CPU time, and thus illustrated the applicability of model checking to large designs containing a considerable number of state-holding elements. In addition, we succeeded in discovering several injected design errors in both the fabric and the port controllers...|$|R
3000|$|Data center network {{architectures}} {{are typically}} classified into two categories: switch-centric and server-centric. In switch-centric DCNs, the routing intelligence {{is placed on}} switches and each server connects to the network through a single port. In server-centric DCNs, the routing intelligence is placed on servers which connect to the network through multiple ports while switches serve merely as cross-bars. Although a number of architectures in both categories have been proposed {{in order to achieve}} scalability, efficiency, reliability, cost minimization etc. in addition to some dual-centric architectures combining the best of both categories, the legacy three-tier tree-based architecture continues to be the most widely deployed and fat-tree being the most promising in terms of scalability, robustness and cost (Bilal et al. 2013). Both of these architectures are switch-centric. A typical data center network consists of access layer, aggregation layer and core layer. It consists of routers and switches, in two-level or three-level hierarchy. In two-level hierarchy there are no aggregation <b>switches</b> while three-level <b>hierarchy</b> includes all three layers. The most realistic and practical DCN simulation involves three-level architectures. We briefly explain the legacy three-tier and fat-tree architectures below: [...]...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{availability}} {{is often}} characterized by mean annual amounts, while ignoring the spatial variation within habitats and the temporal variation within a year. Yet, {{temporal and spatial}} variation may be especially important for identifying the source of stress in low productivity environments such as deserts where resources are often pulsed and resource renewal events are separated by long periods of low resource availability. Therefore, the degree of stress will be determined {{in part by the}} length of time between recharge events. Here, we investigated the effect of timing and total amount of water application on two congeneric pairs, each with a population from a low (desert) and a high (Mediterranean) productivity habitat. As expected, highest survival and greatest growth were found at low or intermediate recharge intervals, and the magnitude of response to increases in total seasonal amounts was greater for Mediterranean species than desert species. The species that had greater survival <b>switched</b> in the <b>hierarchy</b> under high total water depending on interval length. These results demonstrate that temporal variation in resource availability can be as important as annual total amounts for plant performance and that response to temporal dynamics can vary between species. This has implications for community-level processes, as competitive <b>hierarchies</b> may <b>switch</b> based on resource dynamics rather than only total availability. ...|$|R
40|$|The type III {{secretion}} apparatus (T 3 SA) is used {{by numerous}} Gram-negative pathogens to inject virulence factors into eukaryotic cells. The Shigella flexneri T 3 SA spans the bacterial envelope and its assembly requires the products of ~ 20 mxi and spa genes. Despite progress made in understanding how the T 3 SA is assembled, the role of several predicted soluble components, such as Spa 13, remains elusive. Here, we show that the secretion defect of the spa 13 mutant is associated with lack of T 3 SA assembly which {{is partly due to}} the instability of the needle component MxiH. In contrast to its Yersinia counterpart, Spa 13 is not a secreted protein. We identified a network of interactions between Spa 13 and the ATPase Spa 47, the C-ring protein Spa 33, and the inner-membrane protein Spa 40. Moreover, we revealed a Spa 13 interaction with the inner-membrane MxiA and showed that overexpression of the large cytoplasmic domain of MxiA in the WT background shuts off secretion. Lastly, we demonstrated that Spa 13 interacts with the cleaved form of Spa 40 and with the translocator chaperone IpgC, suggesting that Spa 13 intervenes during the secretion <b>hierarchy</b> <b>switch</b> process. Collectively, our results support a dual role of Spa 13 as a chaperone escort and as an export gate-activator switch. © 2014 SGM. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} “constraint-based graphic statics”, a geometrical {{support for}} computer-aided structural design. This support increases the freedom {{with which the}} designer interacts with the plane static equilibriums being shaped. Constraint-based graphic statics takes full advantage of geometry, both its visual expressiveness and its capacity to solve complex problems in simple terms. Accordingly, the approach builds on the two diagrams of classical graphic statics: a form diagram describing the geometry of a strut-and-tie network and a force diagram vectorially representing its inner static equilibrium. Two new devices improve the control of these diagrams: (1) nodes — considered as the only variables — are constrained within Boolean combinations of graphical regions; and (2) the user modifies these diagrams by means of successive operations whose geometric properties do not at any time jeopardise the static equilibrium of the strut-and-tie network. These two devices offer useful features, {{such as the ability}} to describe, constrain and modify any static equilibrium using purely geometric grammar, the ability to compute and handle multiple solutions to a problem at the same time, the ability to <b>switch</b> the <b>hierarchy</b> of constraint dependencies, the ability to execute dynamic conditional statements graphically, the ability to compute full interdependency and therefore the ability to remove significantly the limitations of compass-and-straightedge constructions and, finally the ability to propagate some solution domains symbolically. As a result, constraint-based graphic statics encourages the emergence of new structural design approaches that are highly interactive, precognitive and chronology-free: highly interactive because forces and geometries are simultaneously and dynamically steered by the designer; precognitive because the graphical region constraining each points marks out the set of available solutions before they are even explored by the user; and chronology-free because the deductive process undertaken by the designer can be switched whenever desired. Applications cover the design of reticular systems — regardless of whether they are isostatic, indeterminate, prestressed, self-stressed or mechanisms — regular and irregular beams subject to bending, compression-only structures described by lines of thrusts, and structures that can be modelled with discontinuous stress fields.
