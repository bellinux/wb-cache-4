5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element {{that can be}} found in low levels within all rock, <b>soil,</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E

3000|$|... (iii) <b>Soil</b> {{temperature}} <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content On {{the temporal}} scale, soil respiration rates {{were found to}} be driven by the seasonality of <b>soil</b> temperature <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content. The soil respiration rates were higher in the hot and humid season than in the cold and dry season. The combined <b>soil</b> temperature <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content model indicated that soil temperature positively contributed to the soil respiration rate. In addition, a bidirectional relationship was observed between <b>soil</b> respiration <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content. At the lowland plantations, higher soil water content led to higher soil respiration, whereas excessive amounts of water at the mid-elevation plantation limited the oxygen supply, yielding lower soil respiration.|$|R
5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} C 111 {{spreader}} canal project, {{structural and}} operational modifications involving incremental raises in canal stage are planned along {{one of the major}} canals (i. e., C 111) separating Everglades National Park and agricultural production areas to the east of the park. This study used Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) as an alternative tool to physically based models to explore the relationship between different hydrologic variables and the effect of proposed changes in surface <b>water</b> management on <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents in south Florida. To achieve the goal, objectives were to: (1) use DFA to identify the most important factors affecting temporal variation in <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents, (2) develop a simplified DFA based regression model for predicting <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents as a function of canal stage and (3) assess the effect of the proposed incremental raises in canal stage on <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents. DFA revealed that 5 common trends were the minimum required to describe unexplained variation in the 11 time series studied. Introducing canal stage, <b>water</b> table evaporation <b>and</b> net recharge resulted in lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) and higher Nash-Sutcliffe (C[subscript eff]) values. Results indicated that canal stage significantly (t > 2) drives temporal variation in <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents, which was represented as scaled frequency while net surface recharge was significant in 7 out of the 11 time series analyzed. The effect of water table evaporation was not significant at all sites. Results also indicated that the most important factor influencing temporal variation in <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents in terms of regression coefficient magnitude was canal stage. Based on DFA results, a simple regression model was developed to predict <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents at various elevations as a function of canal stage and net recharge. The performance of the simple model ranged from good (C[subscript eff] ranging from 0. 56 to 0. 74) to poor (C[subscript eff] ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 15), performance was better at sites with smaller depths to water table (< 1 m) highlighting the effect of micro-topography on <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> content dynamics. Assessment of the effect of 6, 9 and 12 cm increases in canal stage using the simple regression model indicated that changes in temporal variation in <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> contents were negligible (average< 1. 0 % average change) at 500 to 2000 m from C 111 (or low elevations) which may be attributed to the near saturation conditions already occurring at these sites. This study used DFA to explore the relationship between <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> bedrock <b>water</b> dynamics <b>and</b> surface <b>water</b> stage in shallow water table environments. This approach can be applied to any system in which detailed physical modeling would be limited by inadequate information on parameters or processes governing the physical system...|$|R
