40|$|Knowledge {{has been}} subject of {{philosophical}} study since ancient times. This {{is not surprising}} since knowledge is crucial to humans {{in order to control}} their actions and the appetite for acquiring it seems innate to the human race. Phi- losophy, therefore, has always occupied itself with the question as to the nature of knowledge. This area of philosophy is generally referred to as epistemology from the Greek word for knowledge, viz. episteme. Plato defined knowledge as "justified true belief", and this definition has influenced philosophers ever since (cf. [6, 25]); for instance, it is still held by the contemporary philosopher Al- fred Ayer.

30|$|It can {{be clearly}} {{observed}} {{that there is}} slight agglomeration of SiC particulates at some places in Figure  1 a, and distribution of SiC particulates is more uniform in Figure  1 b. The comparison reveals {{that the size of}} reinforcement particulates is one of the influencing factors for their uniform distribution in MMC, and the distribution becomes more uniform as the particle size reduces. It can be observed that there is non-uniformity of size of SiC particulates in Figure  2. The uniformity of distribution of SiC particulates is better as compared to that of Figure  1 a and slightly poor as compared to that of Figure  1 b. This difference might be either due to variation of particulate size or due to variation of volume fraction of reinforcement or even might be due to variation of composition of matrix material, which is difficult to predict, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> parameters of the composite represented in Figure  2, i.e. matrix material (Al- 5 % Cu), size (average 3.5  μm) and volume fraction (15 %) of reinforcement, are different as compared to those of Figure  1.|$|E
40|$|Molecular and isotopic {{compositions}} of nine gas {{samples from}} seven {{fields in the}} Thrace basin (northwest Turkey) are determined in order to define {{the characteristics of the}} respective possible source rocks. According to previous organic geochemical studies, the Hamitabat, Ceylan and Mezardere formations are considered as potential source rocks. A first evaluation of the delta(13) C values of methane, ethane, propane and the deltaD isotope value of methane indicated in general a thermogenic origin. However, a further evaluation, which considers the isotopic composition of delta(13) C from methane, ethane and propane vs. 1 /n, where n is the respective number of carbon atoms in each gas molecule, showed mixing of gases of different origin in most of the analysed gas samples. Consequently, three gas groups are distinguished: group A-a thermogenic gas from a single source rock, group B-a mixture of thermogenic and microbial gases, group C-a mixture of thermogenic gases at least from two different source rocks. A modelling approach, which predicts the isotopic composition of a thermogenic gas from a marine or terrestrial organic matter as a function of isotopic composition and maturity of the respective source rock enabled definition of source rock properties. A mature (1. 3 - 1. 6 vitrinite reflectance) source rock with a mixed (terrestrial+marine) type of organic matter and an early mature (0. 7 - 0. 8 vitrinite reflectance) source rock with marine organic matter were identified as precursors of thermogenic gases in the basin. Furthermore, microbial gas also contributed to the formation of some gas fields. In all natural gas samples investigated, the mature source rock of mixed type organic matter contributed the major part of thermally generated gas. In this way, it has to be considered as the main gas producing source in the Thrace basin. However, a final gas-source rock correlation was not performed, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> possible source rocks have gained the predicted maturity ranges in the kitchen areas of the gas fields, and the spatial distribution of organo-facies of the potential source rocks is unknown. This study in Thrace basin has shown that determination of source rock properties by isotopic modelling contributes to gas-source rock correlation, which is problematic in basins with more than one possible source rock.

40|$|Bovine, {{buffalo and}} porcine {{materials}} in food products {{are sensitive to}} religions and a big threat to health and fair economic practices. Current methods to authenticate these animal materials in food chain are based on mainly single gene target which are generally longer in length and thus breakdown during food processing treatments. For the first time, here I targeted double gene sites in short-amplicon length multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assays for the detection and differentiation of bovine, buffalo and porcine materials in food chain. Multiple targets detection in single assay saves analytical cost and time. Both the conventional and real-time PCR platforms were developed and authentic target detection was confirmed through sequencing and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis. Mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND 5) genes were targeted and six different targets (length: 73 - 146 bp), two for each of cow (121 and 106 bp), buffalo (90 and 138 bp) and pig (73 and 146 bp), were amplified from raw, boiled, autoclaved and microwaved cooked meat under pure and mixed matrices. The specificity of the PCR assays were checked against three targets and 25 non-target species. Specific PCR products were found only from beef, buffalo, and pork that were targeted in this assay. To eliminate the possibility of any false-negative detection, eukaryotic endogenous control was used for specificity testing. The detection limit was 0. 01 ng DNA for tetraplex and 0. 02 ng DNA for hexaplex under pure states and 0. 1 % target meat in mixed and commercial matrices. Complete sequence matching was found for five the PCR products but 98. 5 % for buffalo ND 5 gene. The PCR products were digested by four restriction enzymes, namely AluI, EciI, FatI and CviKI- 1 and clear restriction fingerprints were obtained. The developed methods {{were used for the}} screening of bovine, buffalo and porcine materials in various commercial meat curries and processed foods, namely, meatballs and frankfurters. Survey results revealed about 80 % of beef meatballs were adulterated with buffalo and about 20 % of beef products were totally replaced with buffalo. Moreover, the analysis of 20 beef frankfurters revealed the presence of both beef and buffalo in all specimens. This demonstrated that all beef frankfurter products are adulterated with buffalo in Malaysia. However, the analysis of 7 beef curries reflected only 2 them were beef and 5 were buffalo. In contrast, porcine meatball and frankfurter were found 100 % authentic and also no pork was detected in halal branded beef curries, meatballs and frankfurters and chicken frankfurters. Finally, the developed TaqMan probe multiplex real-time PCR (mqPCR) assay successfully detected 0. 003 ng DNA in a pure state and 0. 1 % target meat in mixed and commercial matrices. Analysis of commercial products under mqPCR assay revealed 71 % and 100 % of beef frankfurters, meatballs and 85 % burgers contained buffalo adulteration but no pork in Malaysian markets. The advantage of the method was evidenced in terms of fidelity, cost and time <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> species were detected and the option of alternative targets could complement missing targets even in decomposed specimens...|$|E

40|$|Hong Kong has practiced {{seawater}} toilet flushing since 1950 s. It saves 22 % {{of fresh}} water but inevitably results in high sulfate-laden saline sewage, causing corrosion of pressure sewers and odor (mainly H 2 S) at sewage treatment plants. The former has been solved by applying anti-corrosion pipes and dosing with super-oxygenated liquids. However, the latter cannot be solved at low cost because {{there are two major}} odor sources: 1) primary treatment and 2) sludge treatment. At the same time, current sewage treatment plants in Hong Kong produce 1000 tonnes of dried sludge per day, which has to be incinerated in the near future since the landfill capacity will be surpassed by 2017. In order to solve these problems cost-effectively as well as to maximize the benefits of the seawater toilet flushing practice, we have recently developed a novel biological nitrogen removal process for saline sewage treatment, which is named Sulfate reduction, Autotrophic denitrification and Nitrification Integrated (SANI®) process. The key features of this novel process include: elimination of primary treatment and sludge production as well as oxygen demand in organic matter removal. This novel process uses sulfate in the saline sewage originating from seawater toilet flusing to realize biological sulfate reduction (BSR) for effective removal of organic matter under an anaerobic condition. The produced sulfide dissolved completely due to production of sufficient alkalinity, providing adequate electron donors for subsequent autotrophic denitrification. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> major biomasses, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), autotrophs for denitrification and nitrification produce little sludge, total sludge production can thus be minimized significantly. A 500 -day lab-scale system has demonstrated that no purposeful withdrawal of excess sludge was needed. In order to verify these results and further understand this feature, a steady-state model was developed in this research based on the mass balances of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, sulfur and charge and the stoichiometries of the sulfate reduction, autotrophic denitrification and nitrification. The model predictions agreed well with the measured data on COD, nitrate and sulfate removals, sulfide production, effluent Total Suspended Solids (TSS) as well as the mass balances of COD, sulfur and nitrogen in the system. The model also well explained the performance of the SANI® lab-scale system in the sludge production and the COD and nitrogen removals under various operating conditions. In order to further demonstrate the SANI® process in treating real saline sewage, a pilot-scale study was conducted with 10 m 3 /day of 6 -mm screened saline sewage at the Tung Chung Sewage Pumping Station. The SANI® pilot plant consisted of a sulfate reduction up-flow sludge bed (SRUSB), an anoxic bioreactor for autotrophic denitrification and an aerobic bioreactor for nitrification. The plant was operated at a steady state for 225 days, during which the average removal efficiencies of both COD and TSS were 87 % and no excess sludge was purposefully withdrawn. The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was found to be 55 % only, which was attributed to a very high fraction (26. 5 %) of inert soluble organic nitrogen in the incoming sewage, which mainly originated from the wastewater of the Hong Kong International Airport. Furthermore, a tracer test of the SRUSB revealed 5 % shortcircuit flow and 34. 6 % dead zones in this key reactor of the plant, indicating a good possibility to maximize the treatment capacity of the process for full-scale saline sewage treatment through reactor design optimization. Compared with conventional biological nitrogen removal processes, the SANI® process eliminates 90 % sludge waste, saves 35 % energy and reduces 36 % greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. This research work has confirmed that the SANI® process not only helps to eliminate the major odor sources originating from primary treatment and sludge treatment, but also promotes saline water supply as an economic and sustainable solution for water scarcity and sewage treatment in water-scarce costal areas. A new steady-state model was further developed in this research for evaluating the SANI® pilot plant. The model comprised: 1) a COD-based anaerobic hydrolysis kinetics to determine the removal of biodegradable COD and anaerobic hydrolysis rate in BSR under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and sludge retention times (SRTs), 2) elements (C, H, O, N, P, S), COD and charge mass balances for prediction of the concentrations of alkalinity (H 2 CO 3 * alkalinity+H 2 S alkalinity), COD, sulfate, sulfide, nitrate and free saline ammonia in the SRUSB, the anoxic autotrophic denitrifying reactor as well as the aerobic autotrophic nitrifying reactor of the plant, and 3) an inorganic carbon (HCO 3 -) and sulfide (H 2 S/HS-) mixed weak acid/base chemistry for pH prediction. Through characterization of the sewage organic matter and determination of the anaerobic hydrolysis kinetic rate and other relevant parameters, the steady-state model was validated successfully for application in the SANI® process. The model predictions agreed well with the experimental data of the pilot-scale trial, demonstrating that the model developed from this research can explain the causes and conditions for the minimal sludge production in the SANI® pilot plant. An integrated biological kinetic model was finally developed and applied to simulate the SANI® pilot plant. This kinetic model allows for five organic types, i. e. volatile fatty acids (VFA), fermentable biodegradable soluble organics (FBSO), biodegradable particulate organics (BPO), unbiodegradable particulate organics (UPO) and unbiodegradable soluble organics (USO), with different compositions of the incoming saline sewage. The kinetic model predictions (restricted to the steady state conditions) conformed favorably to the experimental measurements and the steady state model predictions, which validated the kinetic model. Based on the system optimization by this kinetic model, the SANI® pilot plant showed the potential to futher increase the volumetric loading rate and reduce the HRT simultaneously. The optimum values of recycle rateio from aerobic to anoxic bioreactor can be selected between 2. 5 and 2. 75, such as 2. 5 in the operation of SANI® pilot plant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A WSN system {{incorporates}} a gateway that provides wireless connectivity {{back to the}} wired world and distributed nodes. Routing is the main operation in wireless sensor (WSN). In this work, the energy of a node, distance of a node from the current node and the angle made by a node with the sink node, are considered as parameters. The fuzzy system estimates {{the chance of a}} node capable of handing over a packet to the surrounding nodes. The chance is estimated based on the distance, angle made by a node with the sink and energy of the node. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find an efficient route from a source to Base station. The path from the source node to the sink node is recorded and the packet is routed on the identified path. The proposed approach increases the speed and accuracy, <b>since</b> it considers <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> relevant parameters.

40|$|This work {{tries to}} {{establish}} three general {{requirements of the}} doctrine of real subrogation under Korean private law. The work argues that <b>the</b> following <b>three</b> elements are needed in applying the doctrine: (1) a pre-existing legal relationship binding the defendant; (2) substitution of an asset for another; and (3) statutory ground. The doctrine of real subrogation has commonly been understood as a means used when those who have security interests want to assert their pre-existing proprietary interests over the substitutes in the hand of their defendant. However, the work proves that the doctrine is not a terrain only for those security right-holders under the current Korean private law. They are also available for those entitled to enjoy benefits arising from the devise, donatio mortis causa, and trusts. Deduced from the analyses of the mechanism {{of the doctrine of}} real subrogation used in those cases are <b>the</b> <b>three</b> aforementioned requirements.

For Tuva, of special importance {{is that of}} Subudei (1176 - 1248), one of Genghis Khan’s chieftains, an Uriankhai by birth and a suggested ancestor of many contemporary Tuvans. This article deals with how often Subudei appears in Tuvan naming practices of the last 30 years. Statistically, the article depends on the data from territorial offices of the ZAGS (Russian registry office) in the Republic of Tuva in 1985 - 2016, as well as reports of regional Ministry of Education and Science {{on the status of}} students at schools and pre-school institutions in 2015. On May 10, 1985 a boy born in the city of Kyzyl was named Subudai. From that day to January 31, 2016, the ZAGS offices in the raions of Tuva registered 625 cases of boys given that name. The peak year was 2007, and the highest number of cases was registered in Tuva’s capital, the city of Kyzyl (172 boys). Traditionally, there has been a good deal of variation in the name’s spelling, with the most popular other variants being “Subudei” (117 cases since 1992) and “Subuday” (5 cases <b>since</b> 1992). <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> versions together give 747 cases of people being named for the Uriankhai military leader. At the moment, they are aged 1 to 32. The Ministry for Education and Science reported that as of 2015, 242 namesakes of the Uriankhai study in preschool institutions and schools of the regions. Female versions of the name, such as Suvuda, also exist. Throughout the 20 th century, the Tuvan naming conventions have greatly changed. The most recent trends show that in naming, the parents wish their children a good life, a better lot, and a more glorious path. The name “Subudai” suits all of these wishes well. The wide spread of this name in its male and newly-sprung female versions reveals people’s great expectations and lofty goals they set for the new generations of Tuvans...|$|R
