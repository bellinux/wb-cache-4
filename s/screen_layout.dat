5|$|Metroid Fusion was {{developed}} by Nintendo Research & Development 1 (R), the same development team that created the 1994 video game Super Metroid for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which visually bears a resemblance to Metroid Fusion. Its gameplay, <b>screen</b> <b>layout,</b> and controls mimic those of Super Metroid, with minor enhancements. Metroid Fusion is the first 2D Metroid game with animated cutscenes; the game's story is revealed through text and visual close-ups. Metroid Fusion was {{written and directed by}} series designer Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Takehiro Izushi.|$|E

50|$|Considering {{requirements}} specification as an example, the project should precisely specify those features where risk is reduced through precise specification (e.g., interfaces between hardware and software, interfaces between prime and sub contractors). Conversely, the project should not precisely specify those features where precise specification increases risk (e.g., graphical <b>screen</b> <b>layouts,</b> behavior of off-the-shelf components).|$|R
50|$|Mighty Bomb Jack was {{released}} in 1986. The game was largely {{identical to the original}} game in almost all factors, except that the same <b>screen</b> <b>layouts</b> from the first game in the same sequence were now linked in a map-like continuous form by scrolling passages. Mighty Bomb Jack got less favorable reviews than the original game.|$|R
50|$|Stuart Fotheringham, one of {{the artists}} and game {{designers}} on Nodes of Yesod, claims that an earlier finished version of the map and <b>screen</b> <b>layouts</b> was created but was lost in a Microdrive crash and the maps and screens had to be recreated from scratch. He claims that the second, published, version was slightly inferior to the lost original.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} use of mockups in {{software}} development {{is to create}} user interfaces that show the end user what the software will look like without having to build the software or the underlying functionality.

50|$|Different layouts {{may be used}} within news {{broadcasting}} {{to achieve}} varying effects, and designs are often formulated by broadcast designers {{with the intention of}} being informative and visually appealing. The main purpose of television news <b>screen</b> <b>layouts</b> are to present to viewers a concentrated level of information within the shortest amount of time possible, whilst maintaining a reasonably adequate balance so that excessive detail does not confuse the viewer.|$|R

50|$|On August 17, 2008, {{the project}} was founded by Chris Tusa with work on version 1 of the code. A year later, {{development}} on this branch, now known as OpenTG/1, ended. The back-end configuration tool had taken shape using the NCurses library, and database abstraction using ruby-DBI and PostgreSQL for the backend database engine.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of screen design is aesthetic evaluation of <b>screen</b> <b>layouts.</b> While it is conceivable to define a set of variables that characterise the key attributes of many alphanumeric display formats, such a task seems difficult for graphic displays because of their much greater complexity. This article proposes a theoretical approach to {{capture the essence of}} artists' insights with fourteen aesthetic measures for graphic displays. Our empirical study has suggested that these measures are important to prospective viewers and may help gain attention and build confidence in using computer systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.
