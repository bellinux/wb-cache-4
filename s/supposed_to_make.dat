5|$|Who's That Girl is a 1987 American screwball comedy film {{written by}} Andrew Smith and Ken Finkleman, and {{directed}} by James Foley. It stars Madonna and Griffin Dunne, and depicts {{the story of a}} street-smart girl who is falsely accused of murdering her boyfriend and is sent to jail. After getting released, she meets a man, who is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure she gets on her bus back to Philadelphia, and convinces him to help her catch those responsible for her confinement. While searching for the embezzler, they fall in love with each other.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing to}} the New England Patriots in the American Football Conference Championship Game and losing Marcus Washington who joined the Washington Redskins, the Colts shuffled their linebacker lineup and June was listed as a starter when the Colts arrived at mini-camp. At the 2004 Colts {{training}} camp, June competed with Keyon Whiteside for the starting weakside linebacker position. By the end of training camp, June was the starter, and 2004 rookie Gilbert Gardner was the backup. June made his debut as a starter in the opening game against the 2004 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. That season, the Colts used a 4-3 defense with a fourth linebacker on passing downs. In week 5, June had a team-high ten tackles and his first interception in a 3514 victory over the Oakland Raiders. In week 15, June returned an interception 71yards to the four-yard-line where {{he stepped out of}} bounds with 59seconds remaining in the game at the RCA Dome, the Colts' home stadium. This prompted the fans to chant for Peyton Manning to enter the game to attempt to tie Dan Marino's single-season touchdown pass record. Since the Colts led the game 2010 and had clinched the AFC South division, Manning took a knee instead. Coach Dungy's scheme is designed so that the weakside linebacker is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the most tackles, and June was the Colts' leading tackler by a wide margin that season. June started every game that season.|$|E

25|$|Beatty was {{appointed}} {{executive officer of}} the small battleship HMS Barfleur, flagship of the China Station, on 20 April 1899. The first year of his tour of duty was uneventful, but unrest against foreigners was growing in China. The Boxer movement was a secret Chinese peasant society committed to resisting oppression both from foreigners and from the Chinese government. The Empress Dowager Tzu-hsi partly encouraged the Boxer's opposition to foreigners in an attempt to turn their attention away from herself. The name was derived from ritual exercises <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their users immune to bullets, which resembled boxing.|$|E

25|$|Flight 171 was a {{scheduled}} domestic passenger flight from Bombay (Mumbai) to Madras (Chennai). A Boeing aircraft was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the flight but it developed engine trouble {{and was replaced}} with a Sud Aviation Caravelle. Shortly after takeoff from runway 27, Flight 171 suffered a No. 2 engine failure. The crew of Flight 171 immediately turned back to attempt an emergency landing on Bombay Airport's runway 09. With its undercarriage down approximately 1000 yards {{from the end of}} the runway and while at an altitude of 300 feet, the aircraft suffered a loss of control and plummeted into the ground.

The reassignment of the 7th Division to Đính gave his III Corps complete encirclement of Saigon. The encirclement would prevent Cao from storming the capital to save Diệm as he had done during the 1960 coup attempt. This arrangement was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Đính's task of serving the regime easier, but it was exploited to bring down the Ngô family.|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from Kobayashi’s type system for lock freedom, we define a behavioral type system for ensuring progress in an asynchronous language of sessions. The key {{idea is to}} annotate session types with timestamps representing the (abstract) times at which input/output actions are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> occur, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that such actions can be partially ordered, and to verify that processes execute such actions in this order. Compared to related systems for session-based languages, the presented type system is relatively simpler and appears capable of establishing global progress for {{a wider range of}} processes. ...|$|R

25|$|The current {{church is}} the second to stand on this site. The {{original}} church, built during the 19th century, took more than 40 years to build. It was destroyed in 1931 {{on the order of}} Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. The demolition was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> way for a colossal Palace of the Soviets to house the country's legislature, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Construction started in 1937 but was halted in 1941 when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union during World War II. Its steel frame was disassembled the following year, and the Palace was never built. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the current church was rebuilt on the site during 1995–2000.|$|E
25|$|At 4:45 AM on 3 October, Flagship New England {{left the}} gate and was {{initially}} cleared to depart from runway 30; however, apparently unfavorable wind conditions prompted Stephenville Air Traffic Control to clear it for runway 07 instead. Overcast skies blocked out light from the moon and stars, rendering the terrain ahead unlit. Flights departing from runway 07 were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a right-hand turn immediately after take-off {{so as to avoid}} hilly terrain in line with the runway. However, the pilots of Flagship New England instead allowed the aircraft to continue going straight ahead after lifting off. At about 5:03 AM, some seven miles {{from the end of the}} runway, the aircraft hit a ridge at an elevation of about 1,160 feet and crashed, killing everyone on board. The investigation into the accident indicated the pilots' failure to change course, which led the aircraft across terrain over which sufficient clearance could not be gained, led to the crash.|$|E

The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season, further complicating matters.
