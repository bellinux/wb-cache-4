In this study, the genetic basis of individual difference in liking for one&# 39;s name was examined in a survey of 304 pairs of twins from Beijing, China. Results showed that (1) liking for name was heritable (47 %), while unique environment also played a role (53 %); (2) the positive association between name-liking and subjective well-being is driven by common genetic (r(g) :. 21 -. 41) and non-shared <b>environmental</b> (<b>r(e)</b> :. 14 -. 22) influences. These findings have provided novel evidence that liking for one&# 39;s name is a fundamentally important trait and further shed light on the understanding of implicit self-esteem.

The Semi-Structured Assessment of the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) was used to assess cannabis involvement which was categorized into: (0) no cannabis use (reference category); (1) cannabis use only; (2) 1 - 2 cannabis use disorder symptoms; (3) 3 or more symptoms.

40|$|While {{genotype}} × environment interactions (G × E) impede {{progress in}} plant breeding, efforts have {{focused more on}} their statistical analysis than on characterizing crop environments per <b>se.</b> <b>Environmental</b> conditions are commonly the major sources of yield variation across breeding trials, and their characterization may improve breeding efficiency. This chapter reviews different facets of environment characterization, including how to describe the target population of environments (TPE; i. e. conditions to which future-release cultivars might be subjected), and how to identify relevant environment classes where genotypes are expected to perform similarly. Due to seasonal variability and resource constraints, multienvironment breeding trials typically offer a biased representation of the TPE. Weighted analysis based on how representative trials can help breeders correct for this bias, and select for germplasm better adapted to the TPE. Managed-environment trials are another way to evaluate performance in representative environments or for particular stresses, allowing detailed assessment of germplasm, traits or genes of interest. While limited resources restrict the collection of experimental data, modeling tools offer a cost-effective avenue to explore the complex genotype × environment × management (G × E × M) interactions and, in particular, to assess the potential value of traits and alleles depending on 2 ̆ 7 genetic backgrounds 2 ̆ 7 (G × G and trait × trait interactions), environments (e. g. current and future climates) and management practices.

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} how obesity, insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation link to circulating metabolites, {{and whether the}} connections are due to genetic or environmental factors. Subjects and methods. Circulating serum metabolites were determined by proton NMR spectroscopy. Data from 1368 (531 monozygotic (MZ) and 837 dizygotic (DZ)) twins were used for bivariate twin modeling to derive the genetic (r(g)) and <b>environmental</b> (<b>re)</b> correlations between waist circumference (WC) and serum metabolites. Detailed examination of the associations between fat distribution (DEXA) and metabolic health (HOMA-IR, CRP) was performed among 286 twins including 33 BMI-discordant MZ pairs (intrapair BMI difference >= 3 kg/m(2)). Results. Fat, especially in the abdominal area (i. e. WC, android fat % and android to gynoid fat ratio), together with HOMA-IR and CRP correlated significantly with an atherogenic lipoprotein profile, higher levels of branched-chain (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids, higher levels of glycoprotein, and a more saturated fatty acid profile. In contrast, {{a higher proportion of}} gynoid to total fat associated with a favorable metabolite profile. There was a significant genetic overlap between WC and several metabolites, most strongly with phenylalanine (r(g) = 0. 40), glycoprotein (r(g) = 0. 37), serum triglycerides (r(g) = 0. 36), BCAAs (r(g) = 0. 30 - 0. 40), HDL particle diameter (r(g) = - 0. 33) and HDL cholesterol (r(g) = - 0. 30). The effect of acquired obesity within the discordant MZ pairs was particularly strong for atherogenic lipoproteins. Conclusions. A wide range of unfavorable alterations in the serum metabolome was associated with abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation. Twin modeling and obesity-discordant twin analysis suggest that these associations are partly explained by shared genes but also reflect mechanisms independent of genetic liability.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{potential}} synergies and conflicts between greenhouse gas mitigation {{and other environmental}} objectives (EOs) are studied. A starting point is taken in energy scenarios developed within the research programme LETS (www. lets 2050. <b>se).</b> <b>Environmental</b> impacts appear in all steps of the energy chain, from land-use effects (both direct and indirect) of renewable energy extraction to emissions at end-use energy conversion. Of the studied energy alternatives, the greatest potential conflicts with other environmental objectives come from the utilisation of bioenergy. The conflict depends, however, on both {{the magnitude of the}} future expansion and the methods used for biomass production. Therefore, to allow a large scale expansion of biomass, the development of adequate policy instruments that govern land-use both nationally and globally will be essential. For wind power on the other hand, there seem to be no fundamental obstacles from the EO perspective to allow the amounts assumed in the studied scenarios although conflicts may be significant locally. Strategies for reducing energy use and transportation demand generally leads to less conflict with other EOs and give improved conditions for achieving all of them. It is not possible today to guarantee that the presented mitigation scenarios are compatible with reaching other EOs as it depends on what methods and technologies that are used, the successful development of new technologies and the development in other sectors of society such as the food sector. It seems important that systems of governance are implemented on the adequate level (as close to the environmental impact as possible) {{in order to keep the}} development of the transport and energy systems within sustainable borders.

40|$|Sexual conflict, the {{different}} interests {{of males and}} females over reproduction, is a potent evolutionary force. Here I investigate sexual conflict in the context of parental care by focussing on two questions: (i) which behavioural, morphological and environmental traits influence the parents’ decision to care for the brood or desert? (ii) How does sexual conflict influence the evolution of behaviour and morphology? I investigate both questions using a small, polygamous passerine bird, the Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus, which exhibits intense sexual conflict over parental care such that either the male, the female or both parents desert the clutch. Using detailed behavioural observations during the crucial few days preceding desertion, I argue that it may be in the parents’ best interest to conceal their intention to care for (or desert) their brood. The rapid resulting process that leads to variable parental care resembles a coordination game in which either parent may desert first. I developed a game-theoretical model that suggests that a key to resolving the conflict between parents is the sex difference in reproductive payoffs for given parental care strategies, rather than differences in parental quality per <b>se.</b> <b>Environmental</b> variables (e. g. food availability and mating opportunities) seem only subsidiary in the decision-making process of parents. My final chapter explores ramifications of sexual conflict at an evolutionary timescale. By comparing the highly polygamous Eurasian penduline tit with the monogamous Cape penduline tit, I show that morphological and behavioural differences between these two species are consistent with predictions of sexual conflict theory. During my PhD I also identified that there is considerable variation in breeding systems within different species of penduline tits. I argue that by studying these systems new insights will emerge into (i) the drivers of breeding systems, and (ii) neural and genomic traits that underlie breeding system evolution.

Both argon and hydrogen based interferences, the most common spectral interferences on selenium isotopes in HG-MC-ICP-MS, decrease with increasing methane addition. Therefore analyte-interference ratios and precision are improved. Methane addition has thus a high potential for the application to stable Se isotopes ratios by HG-MC-ICP-MS...|$|R

The organizational culture perspective was applied to examine ways ENMs used the strategies within their existing job context.

Results indicated ENMs had limited and uncertain u <b>se</b> of <b>environmental</b> strategies, and were ambivalent about their impact. The strategies u sed had multiple dimensions: setting targeted, content (nutrition or physical activity) addressed, and tasks performed in applying each strategy. Strategy use was positively associated with whether ENMs had allocated funds; program size; community networking; perceptions of community readiness and job expecta tions; beliefs about obesity prevention; and time devoted to environmental work. Only at moderately high levels of networking were ENMs effective in u sing environmental strategies.

However, the precise geographic areas at risk, the geochemical factors controlling <b>environmental</b> <b>Se</b> levels and human Se status are poorly defined and appropriate remediation strategies have yet to be established...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between conduct disorder (CD) symptoms and marijuana use (MU) was assessed in 1, 480 adolescent twins {{participating in the}} National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health. A strong association was found between CD and MU for both males (r=. 38, P<. 01) and females (r=. 31, P<. 01). Structural equation modeling on age-corrected rank normalized scores using the program Mx indicated significant {{gender differences in the}} genetic and environmental contributions to MU. Additive genetic influences were comparable in size for males (29 %) and females (24 %). However, for females the influence of common environmental influences was greater (58 %) than for males (36 %). There was also evidence of greater common environmental influences for females, as well as greater genetic influences for males for CD, but these differences did not reach significance. In addition, for CD common environmental influences did not differ significantly from zero. Additive genetic influences accounted for 61 % of the variance in CD, with the remainder being of unique environmental origin. Bivariate genetic analyses suggested a moderate genetic correlation between CD and MU (r(g) =. 28) and a low unique <b>environmental</b> correlation (<b>r(e)</b> =. 14). These results suggest that CD and MU share genetic influences, while environmental influences tend to be more specific to each behavior. These findings may have implications for the prevention and treatment of CD and substance use among adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Iron-rich sediments {{cover the}} riverbeds {{affected}} by acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from sulfide mineral oxidation. Precipitates {{are mainly composed of}} schwertmannite, {{which is a}} poorly-crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxysulfate that recrystallizes over a short-time period to goethite. Schwertmannite precipitation has a strong capacity for removal of some toxic elements like As. This study examines the influence of the initial As(V) concentration on the kinetics of precipitation and transformation of schwertmannite by means of batch experiments. A set of schwertmannites were synthetized with different As concentrations, and solid-solution interactions were allowed at 60 °C during different time periods (from 1 h to 75 d). The increase of the initial As concentration notably the precipitation of schwertmannite and its transformation to goethite. Moreover, the transformation of schwertmannite into goethite entails the release of sulfate and, at a longer time scale, of part of the previously retained As. Thus, As acts as a retardant for schwertmannite transformation; however, this toxic element is released from the precipitates once the schwertmannite is transformed, which is per <b>se</b> an <b>environmental</b> paradox. Furthermore, schwertmannite precipitation also {{plays an important role in}} the AMD treatment systems; hence, the long-term behavior of these precipitates should be considered for the solid waste management...|$|R
40|$|Mechanistic {{data have}} {{revealed}} {{a key role}} for selenium (Se) and selenoproteins in biological pathways known to be altered in multifactorial diseases, such as cellular maintenance, response to oxidative stress and correct protein folding. Although epidemiological studies indicate that low Se intake is linked to increased risk for various chronic diseases, supplementation trials have given confusing outcomes, suggesting that additional genetic factors could affect the relationship between Se and health. Genetic data support this hypothesis, as risk for several chronic diseases, in particular cancer, was linked {{to a number of}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) altering Se metabolism, selenoprotein synthesis or activity. Interactions between SNPs in selenoprotein genes, SNPs in related molecular pathways and biomarkers of Se status were found to further modulate the genetic risk carried by the SNPs. Taken together, nutritional genomics approaches uncovered the potential implication of some selenoproteins as well as the influence of complex interactions between genetic variants and Se status in the aetiology of several chronic diseases. This review discusses the results from these genetic associations in the context of selenoprotein functions and epidemiological investigations and emphasises the need to assess in future studies the combined contribution of <b>Se</b> status, <b>environmental</b> stress, and multiple or individual SNPs to disease risk...|$|R
40|$|Many recent {{researches}} in island biogeography {{attempted to}} disentangle {{the effects of}} area per se and “habitat diversity” on species richness. However, the expression “habitat diversity” in this context should be avoided, because habitats can be only recognized by referring to the resources needed by a particular species. What is really measured in such researches is some form of “environmental heterogeneity”. Although habitat heterogeneity {{can be measured in}} various ways, most researches in island biogeography simply used the number of biotopes (typically classified as land cover categories). However, not all biotopes have the same surface. On the basis of the area occupied by each land cover categories, it is possible to calculate indices of environmental diversity, evenness and dominance, as commonly done in community ecology research. These indices may be useful to investigate the role of environmental diversity in determining species richness. We used the tenebrionid beetles inhabiting twenty-five small islands around Sicily (Central Mediterranean) to illustrate these concepts. We found that both area per <b>se</b> and <b>environmental</b> heterogeneity contributed to determine species richness. Moreover, we found that the relationship between species richness and environmental homogeneity followed a power function model. This indicates that environmental homogenization may determine a rapid, non linear decline in species richness. JRC. H. 3 -Forest Resources and Climat...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{cross-linked}} chitosan was synthesized with Diethylene Triamine (DCCTS). The adsorption of Se (VI) on DCCTS was studied. The effect factors on adsorption and the adsorption mechanism were considered. The {{results indicated that the}} DCCTS could concentrate and separate Se (IV) at pH = 3. 6; the maximum adsorption efficiency was 94 %, the adsorption equilibrium time was 30 min; the maximum adsorption capacity was 42. 7 mg/g; the adsorption fitted Langmuir equation. A novel method for speciation of Se (VI) and <b>Se</b> (IV) in <b>environmental</b> water samples has been developed using DCCTS as adsorbent and ICP–OES as determination means. The detection limit of this method was 12 ng/L, the relatively standard deviation was 4. 5 % and the recovery was 99 %~ 104 %...|$|R
40|$|High {{concentrations}} of As and Se in mining wastes covering {{a large area}} in the mine operating countries present a threat to public health, environment and ecological diversity in different countries. Therefore, a rapid, cost-effective, affordable and routine analysis is needed to monitor the preliminary contamination levels in these countries. In order to achieve this goal, this study has optimised the flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) to determine the high {{concentrations of}} As and Se using standard samples. The best result of the calibration curve fit (R 2 = 0. 959) was found for the standard As concentrations of 0, 5. 61, 11. 22, 16. 83 and 22. 45 mg/L; and indicated the very strong linearity of calibration. This procedure allowed a rapid determination of As from minimum 4. 462 mg/L to higher concentrations without sample pre-treatment. Besides As, this method successfully measured Se concentrations from minimum 1. 0 mg/L to higher concentrations. The results showed that FAAS can measure lower concentrations of Se than As. Therefore, this method can be widely applied in different countries for determination of As and <b>Se</b> in <b>environmental</b> samples with high concentrations for the rapid, cost-effective and routine analysis, {{who can not afford}} the expensive methods such as ICP-MS, ICP-AES, ICP-OES etc. The study finally suggests the implications of the findings to chemica...|$|R
