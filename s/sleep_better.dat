5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to <b>sleep</b> <b>better</b> than he had in weeks.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 July 2015, Cattrall {{was cast}} {{in the title role}} of the play Linda, written by Penelope Skinner, {{directed}} by Michael Longhurst, and produced at the Royal Court Theatre in London. [...] She was forced to drop out of that production {{a few days before the}} opening, due to “chronic, debilitating insomnia”. She then returned to New York, and started a program of cognitive behaviour therapy to train herself to be able to <b>sleep</b> <b>better.</b> The therapy was successful; it included developing certain evening rituals, removing electronic devices from her bedroom, and limiting the use of the bed to two activities, one of which would be sleeping. Her part in the play, Linda was recast, her part played by Noma Dumezweni, and it opened in December 2015.|$|E
