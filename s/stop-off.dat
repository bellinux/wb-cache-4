Following the British hegemony in India, virtually all of the black pepper found in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa was traded from Malabar region.|$|E

5000|$|On Monday, 19 April, the {{combination}} of heavy fog with a warning by Transport Canada and Nav Canada of a 30% risk of volcanic ash reaching St. John's {{has led to the}} cancellation of several flights scheduled to leave St. John's International Airport, Gander and Deer Lake. Because of the heavy fog, it is unclear if the ash cloud warning was really the cause of the cancellations and delays in Newfoundland, and most flights returned to their normal schedule within the day. Air Canada said their flights were [...] "subject to some delays due to inclement weather, unrelated to ash cloud." [...] On Tuesday, 20 April, two Air Canada Jazz flights between the Magdalen Islands and Quebec City cancelled <b>stop-offs</b> in Gaspé because of ash over the Michel-Pouliot Gaspé Airport.|$|R

They took over Aosta from the Salassi Celtic tribe in 25 AD and engineered roads which extended northwards into Europe via the Great St Bernard Pass and the Little St Bernard Pass. Courmayeur, on the southern side of the massif, began to develop as a <b>stop-off</b> along their trans-alpine trading routes between Italy and France.

5000|$|The new {{specials}} {{were highly}} anticipated and Welcome to the Places of My Life was generally well received. Ben Lawrence, writing for The Daily Telegraph, gave the episode 3½ stars {{out of a}} possible 5, said [...] "Egotistical, bombastic, bigoted, insecure, lonely, needy. Partridge remains a brilliant, monstrous, pathetic creation who can still raise a smile in his audience. If Partridge was once merely a figure of fun, he is now a character of true pathos." [...] Tim Glanfield of RadioTimes stated [...] "Sky Atlantic delivers the best Alan Partridge of the 21st Century. Welcome to the Places of my Life is well observed, carefully constructed and very, very funny." [...] Alex Fletcher said, writing for Digital Spy's 'Tube Talk', that [...] "Welcome to the Places of My Life is up there with the funniest work of Coogan's career. A one-hour 'documentary' following Alan acting as a tour guide around his favourite destinations (Thetford Forest) and daily <b>stop-offs</b> (his local newsagent), the show is rich enough and hilarious enough to make you long for a full series." ...|$|R

2500|$|Lichfield {{started to}} develop a lively {{coaching}} trade as a <b>stop-off</b> on the busy route between London and Chester from the 1650s onwards, making it Staffordshire's most prosperous town. In the 18th century, and then reaching its peak in the period from 1800—1840, the city thrived as a busy coaching city on the main routes from London to the north-west and Birmingham to the north-east. It also became a centre of great intellectual activity, being the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson, David Garrick, Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward; this prompted Johnson's remark that Lichfield was [...] "a city of philosophers". In the 1720s Daniel Defoe described Lichfield as 'a fine, neat, well-built, and indifferent large city', the principal town in the region after Chester. [...] During the late 18th and early 19th century much of the medieval city was rebuilt with the red-brick Georgian style buildings still to be seen today. Also during this time, the city's infrastructure underwent great improvements, with underground sewerage systems, paved streets and gas-powered street lighting. An infantry regiment of the British Army was formed at Lichfield in 1705 by Col. Luke Lillingstone in the King's Head tavern in Bird Street. In 1751 it became the 38th Regiment of Foot, and in 1783 the 1st Staffordshire Regiment; after reorganisation in 1881 it became the 1st battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment.|$|E
