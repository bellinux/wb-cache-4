This type of weave, derived from space shuttle pressure suits, assures practically equal strength in every direction; has essentially no bias, or weak dimension offering greater resistance to tear and shear along with significant weight reduction. Applications of the Triax line include inflatable equipment, life vests, aircraft evacuation slides, helicopter flotation devices, tension structures, safety clothing and sailcloth for boats. Ability to accept compound curvatures with no {{distortion of the}} weave configuration makes it useful in manufacturing molded composites...|$|R

50|$|The usual {{solution}} to the dye lot dilemma is to purchase sufficient skeins from the identical lot before beginning a project. Published craft designs provide estimated material quantities for this purpose. If the crafter neglects to check dye lots or a design underestimates the yarn requirement, or if a store lacks sufficient quantities of a single lot, then one compromise solution is to construct the item so that a contrasting color <b>separates</b> <b>yarns</b> from different lots. Other workarounds are to change stitch patterns for the odd lot, to use the odd lot for a border or other separate and contrasting element, or to conceal the juncture between two dye lots with a surface embellishment.|$|R
50|$|Hosiery {{garments}} are {{the product}} of hosiery fabric produced from hosiery yarn. Like the yarn used for making woven fabric, hosiery yarn comes from a <b>separate</b> spinning (<b>yarn</b> making) process, and is used with circular knitting machines to form fabric. One or more hosiery yarn is used to make knitted or hosiery fabric, and garments produced out of this are generally referred to as hosiery garments.|$|R

5000|$|There are few {{constraints}} on positioning the holes, so practically any picture or pattern can be outlined with holes; common motifs include leaves, rosettes, ferns and flowers. To design a simple lace motif, a knitter can draw its lines {{on a piece}} of knitting graph paper; right-slanting lines should be produced with [...] "k2tog, yo" [...] stitch-pairs (as seen on the right side) whereas left-slanting lines should be produced with [...] "yo, k2tog tbl" [...] (or, equivalently, [...] "yo, ssk" [...] or [...] "yo, skp") stitch pairs (again, as seen on the right side). More sophisticated patterns will change the grain of the fabric to help the design, by <b>separating</b> the <b>yarn</b> overs and decreases.|$|R

40|$|A {{slashing}} {{process for}} preparing warp yarns for weaving operations includes {{the steps of}} sizing and/or desizing the yarns in an acoustic resonance box and <b>separating</b> the <b>yarns</b> with a leasing apparatus comprised {{of a set of}} acoustically agitated lease rods. The sizing step includes immersing the yarns in a size solution contained in an acoustic resonance box. Acoustic transducers are positioned against the exterior of the box for generating an acoustic pressure field within the size solution. Ultrasonic waves that result from the acoustic pressure field continuously agitate the size solution to effect greater mixing and more uniform application and penetration of the size onto the yarns. The sized <b>yarns</b> are then <b>separated</b> by passing the warp yarns over and under lease rods. Electroacoustic transducers generate acoustic waves along the longitudinal axis of the lease rods, creating a shearing motion {{on the surface of the}} rods for splitting the yarns...|$|R
40|$|Nanofibres {{prepared}} by electrospinning typically have randomly oriented fibrous structure. They have large surface-to-volume (or weight) ratio and excellent porous characteristic, which have shown enormous potential in diverse applications. However, electrospun nanofibres are often prepared {{in the form}} of randomly orientated fibrous web, which are fragile and difficult to be tailored in fibrous structures. Herein, we demonstrate a novel yarn electrospinning method which uses a rotating ring collector to convert newly electrospun nanofibres directly into a continuous yarn. The use of ring collector <b>separates</b> the <b>yarn</b> formation from the electrospinning zone. The deposition of later-spun nanofibres to the inner surface of fibrous cone eliminates hooked or curled nanofibres in the final yarn. The effects of polymer concentration and operating parameters on nanofibre and yarn morphology, diameter and the ring collector on yarn twist feature were examined. The nanofibre yarns had a surface twist angle up to 54. 4 °, and tensile strength as high as 93. 6  MPa (elongation at break 242. 6 %). Increasing twist levels improves tensile strength and strain values...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a 3 D woven fabric-based approach {{for the development}} of pressure switch. A fabric substrate, being elastic and extendable is very useful in addition to its high breaking strength and low cost. The developed resistive-type switch is based on the multilayer interlock 3 D fabrics. In the top and bottom layers, certain number of conductive <b>yarns</b> are woven <b>separated</b> by cotton <b>yarns</b> in both transversal and thickness direction. Application of pressure makes the layers of conductive yarn to come in contact, resulting in a short circuit, which may be recorded using multi-meters. Removing the pressure cause the connection points to separate away and it depends on the weave design. Such switch can be used as an on/off switch for usage in security systems, can be sewn into carpets and wearable garments for a number of purposes...|$|R
25|$|Automatic {{patterning}} machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, {{and have}} machine stitch patterning {{features such as}} plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held {{in such a way}} that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a <b>separate</b> piece of <b>yarn,</b> often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.|$|R

In this work, a unique two-layered structure was developed, on a double-needle bed warp knitting machine. In this structure, two yarns are combined together in the inner layer to form loops and are <b>separated</b> into individual <b>yarns</b> to form two loops in the outer layer. Using different combinations of methods of transferring the yarns from the inner layer to the outer, four types of branching-structured fabrics were developed and the water transport properties of these structures were compared against those of the standard interchanging fabrics. The systematic measurements of various water transport properties, in terms of wicking rate and wetting area, demonstrated that warp knitted fabrics with branching structure absorbed water faster than the corresponding interchanged plain knitted fabrics. The plant-structured knitted fabrics also have lower values of air resistance, which is beneficial to summer wear. It is believed that the new developed fabrics have advantages for sportswear and summer casual wear...|$|R

With an output of 32. 9 million tons in 2009, spun yarns satisfy more than half the needs of the global textiles and clothing industry. The present study is devoted to developing computational and digital methods and systems for the accurate and efficient analysis of three predominant aspects of spun yarns: yarn formation, internal structure and surface appearance. In this study, a new generalized theoretical model has been developed by using Finite Element Method (FEM) for the theoretical and numerical analysis of yarn formation in spinning triangle. In this proposed model, the initial conditions are formulated together with an algorithm for fiber buckling. Compared with the earlier models, some important parameters ignored previously, such as inclined angle of spinning tension, frictional contact of fibers with bottom roller and fiber torsional strains, are considered. Numerical simulations were then carried out to explore the quantitative relationships between the mechanical performance of ring spinning triangle and various spinning parameters. Further comparison results showed that fiber tensions predicted by the proposed model are in good agreements with earlier models while the calculated torque of yarns is generally closer to experimental measurements. Moreover, a dynamic model of spinning triangle has been further developed in this study based on the above static FEM model with consideration of the dynamic characteristics of fiber inertia and damping for a more complete and accurate description. By this model, the dynamic behavior of fibers in spinning triangle, such as the natural frequency, mode shape, resonant response, harmonic analysis and response under a time-varying tension, has been originally studied. The results showed that dynamic parameters have a great influence on the amplitude and attenuation of the response of constituent fibers in spinning triangle. Tracer fiber measurement has been widely used for analysis of yarn internal structure by tracing the fiber path in a transparent liquid. Currently, the image mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images largely involve manual operation. It is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent computer method has been developed for automatic mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images. In this method, an extended QRS complex detection method is developed for tracer fiber detection. A decision function, integrating several matching functions extracted from tracer fiber and gradient image, is proposed for image mosaic. An objective method is then proposed to evaluate the qualities of image mosaic and segmentation of the proposed method. Fifty series of tracer fiber images (total 872 images) with five different yarn counts (10 Ne~ 60 Ne) were prepared and used for a full evaluation of the proposed image processing method with respect to conventional manual method. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method works well in mosaic and segmentation for tracer fiber images and presents a much higher efficiency than the conventional method. For yarn surface evaluation, an intelligent computer method has been developed to analyze yarn blackboard image and objectively evaluate yarn quality using computer vision and artificial intelligence. The evaluation method for yarn surface quality currently in use is mainly based on manual inspection. Although some works have been done on digital yarn analysis in order to resolve the limitations of human visual inspection, none of them can fully imitate human behavior in the inspection of yarn quality on a blackboard according to ASTM D 2255 standard. In the proposed method, a multi-scale attention model is proposed and developed, which can fully imitate human attention at different observation distances for the whole and detailed yarn information. A Spectral Residual method is then extended to establish a general benchmark for the comparison among different grade yarns. In the developed system, Fourier transform is employed to <b>separate</b> <b>yarn</b> diameter and hairs, and image conspicuity is obtained by the multi-scale attention model. Total sixteen features, obtained from yarn diameter, hairiness and image conspicuity, are extracted to present the yarn surface characteristics and then used to classify and grade yarn surface qualities using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Two kinds of PNNs, i. e. global and individual PNNs, and two types of classification, i. e. eight-grade and five-grade classifications, are designed and developed for various yarn quality classification purposes. For the evaluation of the proposed method, a database was constructed with 296 yarn board images, covering eight yarn counts (7 Ne~ 80 Ne) and different grades. Experimental results showed that the accuracy for eight-and five-grade global PNNs are 92. 23 % and 93. 58 %, respectively, demonstrating a good classification performance of the proposed digital method in yarn surface grading. Finally, with the above developed computer methods, two intelligent digital systems have been developed for the computerized analysis and evaluation of yarn internal structure and surface appearance, respectively. The systems were designed for controlling and visualizing the whole process of yarn measurement and analysis, covering image acquisition, image processing and data analysis with interactive and user-friendly interface. Both digital systems are potential for application in textile laboratories and spinning mills for yarn structure and surface analyses. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

40|$|Introduction. The {{protozoan}} parasite Giardia {{is one of}} {{the important}} biological cotaminants in water. lts presence in water has caused the outbreak of a number of epidemics in various part of the world including the United States. The major impediment in detecting this particular parasite is unavailability of suitable filters capable of removing it from water. Regarding the fact yarn wound filters (cartridge) used in removing Giardia under laboratory condition are currently difficult to obtain in Iran, attempts were made to design and manufacture the filters according to standards recommended in the literature. &# 13; Methods. To determine the efficiency of filters manufactured in this way, a pilot system was established and parameters of concern were investigated. A given number of cysts were introduced in each case to the water in the pilot tank after being counted on the hemocytometer lamella After the entire tank water (at least 4001) had been pumped through the filters, the filter were removed from the pilot system to have their <b>yarns</b> <b>separated</b> and washed. The cysts recovered were then counted and compared with the original input cysts to determine the efficiency of the filters. Formation of sediments on filters due to suspended solids in water was a great impediment in counting the cysts hidden in the sediments. To overcome this difficulty, the method of floatation in sucrose was used to remove the hidden cysts from the sediments. &# 13; Regarding the morphological characteristics of the cysts, the method was also studied in terms of the sucrose film concentration and the effects of centrifugal speed and duration on the removal of cysts from sediments. &# 13; Results. The results indicated an efficiency of 80. 69 ± 5. 85, which was ideal for a first experience in Iran. a level of 2. 5 molar of Sucrose with a duration of 10 minutes for the centrifugation time at 2, 000 rpm were considered to be optimum levels to yield a certainty of 95 percent and an efficiency of 89. 95 ± 4. 25. &# 13; Discussion. The comparison of the efficiency obtained with those obtained across the world from the application of other techniques associated with this method indicated that this filter was advantages to similar filters, keeping in mind also that this filter can be used in field situations. It is essential to modify in each region the method of cyst removal from sediments using Sucrose gradient according to the particular morphological characteristics and density of cystes. The optimization of Sucrose gradient and the centrifugation duration and speed seems equally important...|$|R
