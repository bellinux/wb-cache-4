However problems with the <b>spring</b> <b>hangers</b> fouling the electric third rail system on the lines from Liverpool to Ormskirk between the engine shed and the sidings led to their withdrawal from this service.|$|R
50|$|A more {{successful}} scheme for equalizing the pony truck to the drivers {{was invented by}} William S. Hudson, superintendent of the Rogers Locomotive Works, and patented in 1864. In this design, a large equalizing lever linked the front truck with a transverse bar connected to the front <b>spring</b> <b>hangers</b> of the driving wheels. This design was an immediate success and was used on American-built locomotives {{until the end of}} steam building.|$|R
50|$|On 3 June 1942, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth paid a {{visit to}} Scotland, {{travelling}} during the night. They had a train of 440 tons, and hauled by two Kingmoor compounds, nos. 1141 and 1145. They passed New Cumnock around 3 a.m., and some genius arranged to put them down the Catrine branch {{for the remainder of the}} night. A Caley class 3F 0-6-0 was put at the rear end to supply steam heat. At a suitable hour of morning they set off again. Now the Catrine branch consisted of 1¼ miles of 1 in 60 right up to the junction, with a final sharp curve. The rail was probably wet, the compounds slipped furiously, and they came to a dead stand three times. Finally they had to get the steam heat engine up to push in the rear. They got to Kilmarnock, and there discovered that in the struggles no. 1141 had broken a <b>spring</b> <b>hanger.</b>|$|E

50|$|To allow side-play in curves, {{the axle}} boxes {{of the leading}} and {{trailing}} coupled wheels had no inside flanges. Their wheel arrangement, without leading or trailing wheels to lend stability at speed, was more suitable for yard work at slow speeds than for mainline working.

2500|$|American {{practice}} {{for many years}} was to use built-up bar frames, with the smokebox saddle/cylinder structure and drag beam integrated therein. In the 1920s, {{with the introduction of}} [...] "superpower", the cast-steel locomotive bed became the norm, incorporating frames, <b>spring</b> <b>hangers,</b> motion brackets, smokebox saddle and cylinder blocks into a single complex, sturdy but heavy casting. André Chapelon developed a similar structure, welded instead of cast, causing a 30% saving in weight for the 2-10-4 locomotives, the construction of which was begun then abandoned in 1946.|$|R
50|$|All E-units {{used the}} same EMD {{passenger}} truck design by engineer Martin Blomberg. This was an A1A-A1A truck, with the outer axles powered and the center axle unpowered. Like the well-known two-axle Blomberg B trucks, these trucks had outside <b>spring</b> <b>hangers</b> between the wheels for better cushioning of side-to-side motion. Also like the Blomberg B, there were no drop equalizers between the axles. Two direct current generators powered four traction motors, two on each truck, in an A1A-A1A arrangement. This truck design was used on all E units and on CB&Q 9908 and MP 7100 power cars. The success of the design is shown by the few changes to it over the years.|$|R
40|$|Thin walled beams warp under {{torsional}} and longitudinal loads. Warping restraint produces high longitudinal stresses. This is {{an analysis}} of the stress distribution in the side members of commercial vehicle chassis frames under the effects of the previously little studied longitudinal loads which may act on a truck chassis through <b>spring</b> <b>hanger</b> brackets. The structure analysed is a model chassis frame consisting of channel section side members and four cross members with different joint connections. The developed theories are incorporated into a special purpose finite element program which may be used in the preliminary stages of chassis frame design. Although the program is only used for the longitudinal load case in this thesis, it is generally applicable for other chassis load cases, including torsion, bending,. [...] etc and combination of these. The theoretical results obtained from the program and the finite element analysis on complete chassis frame models are validated against experiments performed on a strain-gauged chassis frame model constructed with the same dimensions and constructional details as the finite element models with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions. Suggestions for the optimum design and attachment positions for components such as <b>spring</b> <b>hanger</b> bracket which may apply longitudinal loads to the side members of the chassis frame are discussed {{from the point of view}} of longitudinal loadings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Swing cams are {{important}} components of main-compensating constant spring hangers, therefore {{the design of}} cam curve is the key of constant spring hangers. The working principle of the constant hangers is studied. Based on the mechanical analysis of the constant <b>spring</b> <b>hanger,</b> the mathematical model of cam curve is established by means of coordinate transformation. Meanwhile, the cam curve model is programmed in the MATLAB programming environment, and then IBL document that consistent with the PRO/E is generated, after that the model is imported into PRO/E to achieve three-dimensional modeling of the cam. The method in this paper effectively and accurately solve the swing cam problems...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{continued}} rapid {{development in the}} increasingly competitive international voiturette class, {{and the introduction of}} the Alfa Romeo 158 and ERA B- and C-type models, forced the Maserati brothers into designing a new, square-bore, inline-4-cylinder engine. This new engine developed 30–50bhp more than the previous inline-6, the increase mostly achieved through an increase to four valves per cylinder, coupled to the use of a more powerful supercharger and a small increase in the compression ratio. Following customary Maserati practice, the engine was mounted into a chassis design almost identical to that of the 4CL's predecessor: the Maserati 6CM. Conventional in its architecture, twin box-section spars ran the length of the car joined, ladder-fashion, by smaller cross members, although the 4CL design did incorporate more aluminium componentry than its forebear.

40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of piping system installed in industrial facilities {{have to be}} {{recognized as one of the}} significant issues in economic and safety design consideration. Piping systems are generally connected to supporting structures at several points by means of devices such as guides, <b>spring</b> <b>hangers,</b> hydraulic or mechanical snubbers and certain energy absorbers. When friction damper attracts attention, the amount of energy dissipation at contact surface is restricted, because the maximum displacement of sliding motion is limited by the clearance of the equipment. In order to increase the amount of energy dissipation, the ball screw type magnetic friction damper is proposed. This damper is expected to increase the energy dissipation by converting one directional motion to rotating motion by ball screw. In this work, the fundamental characteristics of proposed damper are clarified. The numerical model is made considering parameters obtained from testing, and the results from simulation are compared with the results from testing...|$|R

5000|$|... "The {{most radical}} feature {{of his car}} was the novel {{suspension}} of its six-cylinder engine so as to cut down vibration. The engine was supported on three points and rested on rubber mounts. Noise and vibration were much less. There was {{still a lot of}} movement of the engine when idling, but under a load it settled down. Although it was a great success in the Plymouth, Henry Ford did not like it. For no given reason, he just didn't like it, and that was that. I told Walter that I felt it was {{a step in the right}} direction, that it would smooth out all noises and would adapt itself to axles and springs and steering-gear mounts, which would stop the transfer of road noises into the body. Today rubber mounts are used on all cars. They are also found on electric-motor mounts, in refrigerators, radios, television sets—wherever mechanical noises are apparent, rubber is used to eliminate them. We can thank Walter Chrysler for a quieter way of life. Mr. Ford could have installed this new mount at once in the V&#8209;8, but he missed the value of it. Later Edsel and I persuaded him. Rubber mounts are now found also in doors, hinges, windshields, fenders, <b>spring</b> <b>hangers,</b> shackles, and lamps—all with the idea of eliminating squeaks and rattles." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Ford {{automobile}} lubrication instructions, Southern California, 1930. "Lubricating the Transmission, About {{once every}} five thousand miles the gear lubricant should be drained from the transmission {{by removing the}} drain plug {{at the bottom of}} transmission case. The interior of the trans-mission case should then be thoroughlt flished with kerosene and refilled with fresh gear lubricant. The new lubricant is poured into the transmission through the filler hole, located at the right hand side of the transmission tcase. Pour sufficient lubricant in unti lit reaches the level of the filler hole.; Lubricating the Differential, Every 5000 miles the lubricant in the differential should be drained and the housing flushed with kerosene. New lubricant should then be added until it reaches the level of the oil filler hole in the housing. In the truck the lubricant in the differential must be kept up {{to the level of the}} filler plug oppening at all times.; Engine Lubrication, All parts of the engine are lubricated from the oil reservoir in the oil pan by the Ford Pump, Splash and Gravity Feed. Only high grade engine oil should be used in the engine. Oil of this kind reaches the bearing surfaces with greater east and cuts down frictional heat. It should have sufficient body so that the pressure between the two bearing surfaces will not force out the oil and allow the metal to come in actual contact. Inferior oils have a tendency to carbonize quickly, also "gu m up" the piston rings, valve stems and bearings. In cold weather a light grade of oil having a low cold test is absolutely essential for the proper lubrication of the car. In general an oil having the body S. A. E. viscosity No. 40 will prove satisfactory for summer use. While for winter use oil having specifica-tions of S. A. E. No. 20 should be used. It is essential, however, that this winter oil have a low cold test.; Draining the Oil Pan, It is advisable to clean out the oil pan by draining off the old oil when the new car has been driven five hundred miles, and thereafter to repeat this operation every 500 miles. The oil should be warm before draining.; Lubricating Shock Absorber Connections, The ball joints are made in unit with the instrument arm and spring perches. They are hardened and ground. The ball joint seats are enclosed in the shock absorber connecting links, which should be lubricated every 500 miles with the compressor gun. In order to secure maximum riding comfort, it is important that the <b>spring</b> <b>hangers</b> be free in the bushings and kept well greased. " [...] on instructions...|$|R
50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower <b>spring</b> beam. A <b>hanger</b> block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|R
