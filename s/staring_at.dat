5|$|A later {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} during the moment Dr. Brooks took the picture of Hurley and Dave, another patient was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Hurley from across the room, Libby (Cynthia Watros), which explains why Hurley has had this faint recognition of Libby while on the island.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{where the}} {{previous}} episode left off, Buffy arrives home {{and sees the}} flowers sent from Joyce's suitor. She calls out {{to her mother and}} hears no answer. Buffy sees Joyce lying lifeless on the sofa, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling.|$|E
50|$|The Siren is a {{painting}} by John William Waterhouse. The painting depicts a siren sitting {{at the edge of}} a cliff, lyre in hand, <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> a shipwrecked sailor floating in water, who in turn is <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{he commented}} {{on his new}} feat, {{but it was also}} a {{reminder}} to me, a trifle cruel, that he was not my boy. After all, you see, Mary had not given him the whole of his laugh. The watch said that five and twenty minutes had passed, and looking out I saw Irene at one end of the street <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> my window, and at the other end Mary's husband <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> my window, and beneath me Mary <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> my window. They had all broken their promise.|$|R

5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle to the building.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend's first self-developed game. The game idea came from <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling, and Wohlwend applied a grayscale color palette from {{his first year in}} art school. When Flash game sites did not purchase the title, he open sourced the code. Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad, which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company's Adam Saltsman, who became the primary puzzle designer.|$|E
5|$|The {{first task}} is to polish Howard's belt buckles. Howard tends to stand {{too close to the}} urinal and urine often {{splashes}} back onto the buckles. Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E

5|$|There is no perspectival {{order in}} the foreground; instead it {{comprises}} {{a series of small}} motifs wherein proportion and terrestrial logic are abandoned. Bosch presents the viewer with gigantic ducks playing with tiny humans under the cover of oversized fruit; fish walking on land while birds dwell in the water; a passionate couple encased in an amniotic fluid bubble; and a man inside of a red fruit <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a mouse in a transparent cylinder.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis {{of the story of}} her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E

5|$|Murasaki {{became a}} popular subject of {{paintings}} and illustrations highlighting {{her as a}} virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishimyama Temple, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century. The Tale of Genji became a favorite subject of Japanese ukiyo-e artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, {{by the middle of}} the Edo period the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, while {{reviewing the}} station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo {{for a company}} called Polarity Magnetics on Banton's jacket. The agents visit Polarity Magnetics, where they meet scientist Christopher Davey (Kevin McNulty). He identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory {{in which he was}} locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of subatomic particles. His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E

5|$|At the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who {{provides}} {{a room where}} Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd finds them in their room, and informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees, including the Fishes. Having learned {{that they have a}} bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Marichka and Theo fight him off and escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is then killed by a tank shell, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting; <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the screaming baby, they allow the group to leave. Marichka leads Theo, Kee, and the baby to a boat in a sewer, and Theo rows away whilst Marichka stays behind.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-plot, Lisa {{discovers that}} the senior {{citizens}} at Grampa's nursing home {{do not have}} any entertainment, and decides to buy them a digital TV converter. However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> TV static.|$|E

5|$|Sihanaka culture {{traditionally}} {{adhered to}} a wide variety of fady, some of which are still respected to varying degrees by more traditional families to the present day. Many of their fady in the early 1900s were documented by historian Van Gennep. The most absolute fady and the only one that was seemingly practiced by all Sihanaka was a prohibition against working in a paddy field on Tuesdays; sub-groups among the Sihanaka also practiced other taboos associated with particular days of the week, such as not leaving the house or not cleaning floor mats on certain days. A fady was placed on consumption of any new or foreign products, including Western medicines. Another common fady was a taboo against watching the rising or setting of the sun, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> anything red, or falling asleep at sunset.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E
