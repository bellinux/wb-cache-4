William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what {{is still one of}} the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever.

The BBC gave her her own radio show in 1947 dubbed Our Gracie's Working Party in which 12 towns were visited by Fields, and a live show of music and entertainment was broadcast weekly with Fields compering and performing, and local talents also on the bill.

25|$|The {{programme}} was {{a success}} and a full series followed, continuing, with breaks, until 1974, when the Christmas special became the final episode. Although the popularity of Steptoe and Son made Corbett a star, it ended his serious acting as he became irreversibly associated with Harold Steptoe in the public eye. Before the series began, Corbett had played Shakespeare's Richard II to great acclaim; however, when he played Hamlet in 1970, he felt both critics and audiences alike were not taking him seriously and could only see him as Harold Steptoe. Corbett found himself receiving offers only for bawdy comedies or loose parodies of his alter-ego Harold. Production of the sitcom was {{in the last few}} years stressful as Brambell was an alcoholic, often ill-prepared for rehearsals and forgetting his lines and movements. A tour of a Steptoe and Son stage show in Australia in 1977 proved a disaster due to Brambell's drinking. During the tour, the pair appeared in character in an advert for Ajax <b>soap</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|E
