Members of non-Western ethnic {{minorities}} {{are in a}} disadvantaged position on <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> labour market compared with the indigenous population. They are more at risk of unemployment and are more frequently dependent on temporary work. How big a role does discrimination play here? Are members of ethnic minority groups systematically turned down more often for (permanent) jobs? To what extent do members of non-Western {{ethnic minorities}} {{feel that they are}} discriminated against in job applications or contacts with colleagues, and what consequences does this have for their labour market behaviour? Based on a literature <b>survey,</b> information <b>from</b> opinion polls and population <b>surveys,</b> opinions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Equal Treatment Commission, an inventory of complaints registered with antidiscrimination bureaus and interviews with various groups of non-Western ethnic minorities, this study attempts to ascertain {{the nature and extent of}} labour discrimination in the Netherlands. The Discrimination Monitor was compiled at the request of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. It was written jointly by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP and <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> national association against discrimination, Art. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} 3 D-seismic <b>survey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> offshore {{sector has}} been interpreted and subsequently correlated with existing regional seismo-stratigraphic concepts derived from conventional 2 D-seismic data sets. The interpreted 13 seismic units have been related to a newly established chrono-stratigraphic framework [Kuhlmann et al., 2006 a, b. Chronostratigraphy of Late Neogene sediments in the southern North Sea Basin and paleoenvironmental interpretations. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 239, 426 - 455; Integrated chronostratigraphy of the Pliocene-Pleistocene interval {{and its relation to}} the regional stratigraphical stages in the southern North Sea region. Netherlands Journal of Geosciences-Geologie en Mijnbouw, 85 (1), 19 - 35] resulting in up-dated age control for the seismic units. The generation of amplitude maps, time slices and isopach maps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 3 D-seismic data enabled detailed spatial and temporal reconstruction regarding the paleoenvironmental and climatological development as depicted by Kuhlmann et al. [2006 a. Chronostratigraphy of Late Neogene sediments in the southern North Sea Basin and paleoenvironmental interpretations. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 239, 426 - 455]. The lowermost seismic units S 1 -S 4 comprise condensed Middle Miocene to Piacencian sediments, deposited under warm open marine conditions. These sediments show a uniform seismic facies of low-amplitude reflectors. The boundary of seismic unit S 4 -S 5 (around 2. 6 Ma) delineates a shift towards generally colder climate conditions that are connected to the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Seismic unit S 5 includes alternations of warmer and colder periods. During warmer periods, bottom currents generated elongated structures (2. 5 - 4 km long, 300 - 500 m wide) on the horizon display. These layers show as well shallow gas accumulations with a more regional extent and are related to coarser-grained sediments sealed by clayey sediments of the cold phases. A homogenous seismic facies is characteristic for the colder periods. Within seismic units S 6 and S 7, internal fore set structures display the regressional trend related to the cooling of this interval. Seismic units S 8 -S 11 display a pattern of unoriented lineaments which was probably caused by icebergs drifting into the North Sea and souring the sea floor. This finding is in accordance with the shallow marine, arctic conditions of this interval. Within these units a bright spot of 3 by 7 km in size, is interpreted to result from shallow gas accumulation related to a grounded iceberg. This feature represents another, more local area of gas accumulation that is closely related to iceberg activity within the study area. The uppermost seismic units S 12 and S 13 belong to a fluvial, paralic paleo-environment, that is characterised by aggradational seismic reflectors. Pleistocene glacial valleys were recognised in the upper 200 m below sea floor. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The rise {{of online}} {{communication}} possibilities has revived {{the debate on}} the impact of media on political participation, and this especially with respect to young people who are considered prime users of online communication technologies. On the one hand, new media are thought to facilitate innovative and more accessible forms of political participation. More pessimistic views, however, hold that new media contribute to personal isolation, loss of social capital and an endorsement of existing individual prejudice and delusions. Not surprisingly, then, the relationship between new media and political participation has already been the topic of several empirical studies. This paper improves upon the existing literature in two ways. First, although it is argued that new media have primarily created new opportunities for non-institutional forms of political participation, most studies use one single indicator for offline political participation. In this paper we distinguish between institutional forms of participation and alternative or less institutional forms of participation. Secondly, among young people important differences can be found with regard to the purposes of internet use. In this paper we related these different patterns of internet use to more traditional media (radio, tv, magazines) and compare their mutual effects on the two forms of political participation. For our analysis, we rely on <b>survey</b> data <b>from</b> Flanders (<b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> speaking part of Belgium) gathered in 2013, containing questionnaires of 3133 adolescents aged 14 - 30...|$|R
