50|$|The Feminine Monarchie, {{originally}} published by Joseph Barnes, Oxford, in 1609, {{is the first}} full-length English-language book about beekeeping. It remained a valid and practical guide for beekeepers for two hundred fifty years, until Langstroth and others developed and promoted moveable comb hives. Butler revised The Feminine Monarchie in 1623 and 1634. It was translated into Latin in 1678 and 1682, then from Latin back to English again in 1704. The title expresses Butler's main idea that the colony is governed, not by a king-bee, as Aristotle claimed, but by a queen-bee. The last edition written by Butler contains ten chapters, including sections regarding bee gardens, hive-making materials, <b>swarm</b> <b>catching,</b> enemies of bees, feeding bees, {{and the benefits of}} bees to fruit (pollination). The book gives an excellent account of skep beekeeping, including methods of predicting - from tone pitch of the buzzing bees - when swarming might occur. Butler even transliterated the tones and included them on a musical score in the book. He further suggested that musicians may trace the roots of music back to the sounds of the hive.|$|E
