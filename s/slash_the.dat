5|$|A path, which {{contains}} data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that {{appears as a}} sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double <b>slash.</b> <b>The</b> path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E

In June 2007, Rhodes was also joined by Mark Lawn as new joint chairman of the club. Lawn signed a deal {{to wipe out the}} club's debts.|$|E

5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or <b>slash.</b> <b>The</b> authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|Slash {{departed}} Guns N' Roses in 1996, due {{to musical}} differences {{between himself and}} singer Axl Rose. Following his departure, Slash toured Japan for two weeks with Chic, and worked on the soundtrack to the film Curdled. He later began touring in a cover band that eventually became Slash's Blues Ball. Aside from <b>Slash,</b> <b>the</b> band consisted of Teddy Andreadis, guitarist Bobby Schneck, bassist Johnny Griparic, saxophonist Dave McClarem and drummer Alvino Bennett. The band toured on and off until 1998, which included a headline slot at a jazz festival in Budapest. They covered various artists and bands such as B.B. King, Steppenwolf, Otis Redding, as well as Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit material.|$|E
5|$|State {{auditors}} Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) soon arrive, and {{the extremely}} cheerful Chris paints an optimistic {{picture of how}} they will fix the budget, but leaves the details to the more serious Ben. When Ben explains {{they will need to}} <b>slash</b> <b>the</b> budget of every department by nearly 40 or 50 percent, Leslie angrily lashes out at Ben, who responds to her that the poorly managed government is to blame. Later, at April's party, Tom desperately tries to pick up women, but to no avail, while Leslie and Ann get extremely drunk together. Andy and April appear to be getting along, but when he goes to the bar to get a drink for April, a drunken Ann flirts with him. An upset April flirts with Tom's annoying friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) to make Andy jealous. Andy gets upset, believing he misread April's signals all along, and April later regrets what she did. Ben arrives at the party and tries to smooth things out with a drunken Leslie, but she again angrily lashes out at him.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to <b>slash</b> <b>the</b> Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E
25|$|Slash is {{the debut}} solo album by Guns N' Roses guitarist and {{songwriter}} <b>Slash.</b> <b>The</b> album {{was produced by}} Eric Valentine and features multiple musicians, including {{four of the five}} members of the Appetite for Destruction-era Guns N' Roses lineup: Slash himself, Izzy Stradlin, Duff McKagan and Steven Adler.|$|E

25|$|The Shanyang Canal {{originally}} {{opened onto}} the Yangtze {{a short distance}} south of Yangzhou. As {{the north shore of}} the Yangtze gradually silted up to create the sandbank island of Guazhou, it became necessary for boats crossing to and from the Jiangnan Canal to sail the long way around the eastern edge of that island. After a particularly rough crossing of the Yangtze from Zhenjiang, the local prefect realised that a canal dug directly across Guazhou would <b>slash</b> <b>the</b> journey time and so make the crossing safer. The Yilou Canal was opened in 738 AD and still exists, though not as part of the modern Grand Canal route.|$|E

In the book, the assailants are not precisely identified, but Tolkien implies that the attack {{was carried out by}} agents of the Nazgûl, possibly including one Bill Ferny, rather than the Nazgûl themselves (though they were present in the town). Another thing to note is that after the beds are destroyed, the Ringwraths remove their hoods, revealing hideous black masks and the armour they wear beneath their cloaks. They remain unhooded, but masked, throughout the remainder of the film.|$|E

25|$|A DOI {{is a type}} of Handle System handle, {{which takes}} the form of a {{character}} string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a <b>slash.</b> <b>The</b> prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier, and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is a series of at least 4 numbers greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants. The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Jays' struggles {{were further}} aggravated by an {{extremely}} unfavourable currency exchange rate. In the early 2000s, the Canadian dollar traded for {{as low as}} 62 U.S. cents, resulting in massive losses for the Blue Jays who collected most of their revenues in Canadian dollars but paid player salaries in U.S. dollars. When J. P. Ricciardi, then director of player development under Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, was named the Blue Jays' General Manager {{he was expected to}} <b>slash</b> <b>the</b> payroll immediately in order to stem the tide of red ink.

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to <b>slash</b> <b>the</b> budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

500|$|Battles {{take place}} in {{real-time}} within the same space as exploration, which include overworld environments and dedicated dungeons. Using a style similar to hack and <b>slash,</b> <b>the</b> three characters attack targeted enemies in the field. Abilities, including standard attacks and special moves related to a character, are mapped to the Nintendo DS (DS) face buttons. Attacks can be chained together into combinations for higher damage. Continually attacking an enemy will cause a [...] "Break", a period where the enemy is stunned and attacks cause more damage. Gameplay is not paused when the separate item menu is opened, which contains items such as regenerative potions. Character health is automatically replenished when they move into a new area, otherwise needing items to restore.|$|E
5000|$|Intermediate results (reflected by a slash {{separating}} two values): {{the number}} {{to the left of}} <b>the</b> <b>slash</b> represents <b>the</b> losses suffered by the attacking force, {{the number to}} the right of <b>the</b> <b>slash</b> represents <b>the</b> losses the defenders might suffer (losses may result in the dissolution or destruction of sub-units and/or the overall distance a force may retreat).

50|$|In {{addition}} to the stab standards, HOSDB has developed a standard for slash resistance (2006). This standard, like the stab standards, is based on drop testing with a test knife in a mounting of controlled mass. <b>The</b> <b>slash</b> test uses <b>the</b> Stanley Utility knife or box cutter blades. <b>The</b> <b>slash</b> standard tests <b>the</b> cut resistance of the armor panel parallel to the direction of blade travel. The test equipment measures the force at the instant the blade tip produces a sustained <b>slash</b> through <b>the</b> vest. The criteria require that <b>slash</b> failure of <b>the</b> armor be greater than 80 newtons of force.|$|R
