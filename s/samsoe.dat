25|$|During his incarceration {{between the}} second and third trials, Alcala wrote and self-published a book, You, the Jury, in which he claimed innocence in the <b>Samsoe</b> case and {{suggested}} a different suspect.

2500|$|Alcala {{was arrested}} in late 1979 and held without bail. [...] In 1980 he was tried, convicted, {{and sentenced to death}} for <b>Samsoe's</b> murder, but the verdict was {{overturned}} by the California Supreme Court because jurors had been improperly informed of his prior sex crimes. In 1986, after a second trial virtually identical to the first except for omission of the prior criminal record testimony, he was again convicted and sentenced to death. A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel nullified the second conviction, in part because a witness was not allowed to support Alcala's contention that the park ranger who found <b>Samsoe's</b> body had been [...] "hypnotized by police investigators".|$|R

The British tried to take out Laaland and Kiel but abandoned them when they grounded. The British did not set fire to either as the Norwegian vessels still had their crews and wounded aboard.|$|E

Detectives circulated a sketch of the photographer, and Alcala's parole officer recognized him. During a search of Alcala's mother's house in Monterey Park, police found a rental receipt for a storage locker in Seattle; in the locker, they found Samsoe's earrings.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 {{prosecutors}} {{entered a}} motion to join the <b>Samsoe</b> charges {{with those of the}} four newly discovered victims. Alcala's attorneys contested it; as one of them explained, [...] "If you're a juror and you hear one murder case, {{you may be able to}} have reasonable doubt. But it's very hard to say you have reasonable doubt on all five, especially when four of the five aren't alleged by eyewitnesses but are proven by DNA matches."

2500|$|For {{the third}} trial Alcala elected {{to act as}} his own attorney. He took the stand in his own defense, and for five hours played the roles of both {{interrogator}} and witness, asking himself questions (addressing himself as [...] "Mr. Alcala" [...] in a deeper-than-normal voice), and then answering them. During this bizarre self-questioning and answering session he told jurors, often in a rambling monotone, {{that he was at}} Knott's Berry Farm applying for a job as a photographer at the time <b>Samsoe</b> was kidnapped. He showed the jury a portion of his 1978 appearance on The Dating Game in an attempt to prove that the earrings found in his Seattle locker were his, not Samsoe's. Jed Mills, the actor who competed against Alcala on the show, told a reporter that earrings were not yet a socially acceptable accoutrement for men in 1978. [...] "I had never seen a man with an earring in his ear", he said. [...] "I would have noticed them on him".|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the estate goes back to 1120 when it was the king's {{property}} {{on the island of}} Samsø.
