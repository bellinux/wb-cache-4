SDO AND HELPING 2 Previous research suggests that people high in social dominance orientation (SDO) have low commitment to human rights, are less inclined to aid members of an out-group, and are less disposed to cooperate with members of an out-group. In the current research, we examined the relation between SDO and prosocial behavior. Participants were given questionnaires to measure SDO as well as {{the extent to which they}} would be willing to volunteer for two fictitious organizations, one promoting social equality and one promoting social inequality. Participants high in SDO were more likely to dislike the organization promoting social equality. Surprisingly, however, there was no association between SDO and attitudes toward the organization promoting social inequality. The research therefore provides evidence that, as prior research has shown SDO to predictive of harmful behaviors, SDO may also predict helpful behaviors as well...|$|E

40|$|Pore dilation, the {{compaction}} of humic acids on peat fibres due to {{the process}} of flocculation, causes the hydraulic conductivity of peat to increase with increasing pore water electrical conductivity. This is a reversible process and a reduction in the pore water conductivity produces a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity {{due to the}} constriction of pores. We verify how this dilation and constriction of pores, resulting from the application of artificial pore water (primarily deionized water), affects laboratory measurements of the hydraulic conductivity of peat. Repeat measurements of the hydraulic conductivity were performed on samples of Sphagnum peat. It is shown that the application of deionized water during constant head permeameter tests causes a significant decrease in the hydraulic conductivity. Between tests, the hydraulic conductivity of the peat continues to decline without an associate decrease in the pore water electrical conductivity because of a lagged pore constriction effect. We suggest that the use of artificially high or low pore water electrical conductivities, during laboratory hydraulic conductivity measurements, is likely to lead to significant errors. Experimental protocols must, therefore, be revised to take better account of the pore water chemistry. The ionic concentrations of the natural pore fluid <b>should</b> <b>be</b> replicated during hydraulic conductivity tests, either by using pore fluid extracted from the study site or by artificially replicating the major ionic composition of the natural pore fluid.
