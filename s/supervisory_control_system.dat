Such a system may have hundreds of individual alarms that up until very recently have probably been designed with only limited consideration of other alarms in the system. Since humans can only do {{one thing at a}} time and can pay attention to a limited number of things at a time, there needs to be a way to ensure that alarms are presented at a rate that can be assimilated by a human operator, particularly when the plant is upset or in an unusual condition. Alarms also need to be capable of directing the operator's attention to the most important problem that he or she needs to act upon, using a priority to indicate degree of importance or rank, for instance. To ensure a continuous production, a seamless service, a perfect quality at any time of day or night, there must be an organisation which implies several teams of people handling, one after the other, the occurring events.|$|E

40|$|Approach, {{avoidance}} and the <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{are fundamental}} to human behavior. Much past research {{has examined the}} neurophysiological models relating trait approach and avoidance.

However, traits related to the <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> have not been previously associated with frontal asymmetry. The current study sought to test whether trait positive urgency, measuring the tendency towards rash action in response to extreme positive emotional states, would relate to frontal alpha asymmetry. One hundred twenty-six individuals completed a measure of positive urgency and resting EEG recordings. Greater positive urgency was associated with greater relative left-frontal EEG activity. Source localization revealed that this relationship appeared to originate from reduced right-frontal activity in the inferior frontal gyrus. These results clarify that the link between frontal asymmetry and positive urgency is related to reduced right-frontal activity. Reduced right-frontal activity may be a potential neurobiological trait related to the <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

This project attempts to approach the design of supervisory controllers using the structure of continuous and sampled systems.

This paper studies the problem of supervisory control of autonomous intersections {{in the presence of}} sensor attacks.

We show that the <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is vulnerable to sensor attacks that can cause collision or deadlock among vehicles. To improve the system resilience, we introduce a detector in the control architecture and focus on stealthy attacks that cannot be detected but are capable of compromising safety.
