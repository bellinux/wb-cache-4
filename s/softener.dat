Some reviewers also commented upon the timeliness of her previous books, like her novel in which society is devastated by a genetically engineered virus, Oryx and Crake, which coincided with the SARS outbreak. Playing off this theme Canadian magazine The Walrus, at a fund-raiser gala for its charitable foundation, auctioned a crystal decanter with five predictions written by Atwood sealed inside. Journalist Rebecca Eckler was the winning bidder and wrote about the predictions, which include the diminished use of fabric <b>softener</b> and the rise in use of industrial hemp, in an article for Maclean's magazine.|$|E
5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water <b>softener</b> salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E

Besides, the contribution of <b>softening</b> mechanisms such as dynamic recovery, dynamic recrystallization and deformation heating to flow <b>softening</b> was discussed.

40|$|In N-body {{simulations}} {{the force}} calculated between particles representing a given mass distribution is usually <b>softened,</b> {{to diminish the}} effect of graininess. In this paper we study the effect of such a smoothing, {{with the aim of}} finding an optimal value of the <b>softening</b> parameter. As already shown by Merritt (1996), for too small a <b>softening</b> the estimates of the forces will be too noisy, while for too large a <b>softening</b> the force estimates are systematically misrepresented. In between there is an optimal <b>softening,</b> for which the forces in the configuration approach best the true forces. The value of this optimal <b>softening</b> depends both on the mass distribution and on the number of particles used to represent it. For higher number of particles the optimal <b>softening</b> is smaller. More concentrated mass distributions necessitate smaller <b>softening,</b> but the <b>softened</b> forces are never as good an approximation of the true forces as for not centrally concentrated configurations. We give good estimates of the optimal <b>softening</b> for homogeneous spheres, Plummer spheres, and Dehnen spheres. We also give a rough estimate of this quantity for other mass distributions, based on the harmonic mean distance to the $k$th neighbour ($k$ = 1, [...] , 12), the mean being taken over all particles in the configuration. Comparing homogeneous Ferrers ellipsoids of different shapes we show that the axial ratios do not influence the value of the optimal <b>softening.</b> Finally we compare two different types of <b>softening,</b> a spline <b>softening</b> (Hernquist & Katz 1989) and a generalisation of the standard Plummer <b>softening</b> to higher values of the exponent. We find that the spline <b>softening</b> fares roughly as well as the higher powers of the power-law <b>softening</b> and both give a better representation of the forces than the standard Plummer <b>softening.</b> Comment: 16 pages Latex, 19 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS, corrected typos, minor changes mainly in sec. ...|$|R
40|$|Pairwise forces between {{particles}} in cosmological N-body simulations are generally <b>softened</b> to avoid hard collisions. Physically, this <b>softening</b> corresponds to treating the particles as diffuse clouds rather than point masses. For particles of unequal mass (and hence unequal <b>softening</b> length), computing the <b>softened</b> force involves a nontrivial double integral over the {{volumes of the}} two particles. We show that Plummer force <b>softening</b> is consistent with this interpretation of force <b>softening</b> while spline <b>softening</b> is not. We provide closed-form expressions and numerical implementation for pairwise gravitational potential and force laws for pairs of particles of general <b>softening</b> scales ε 1 and ε 2 assuming the commonly used cloud profiles: NGP, CIC, TSC, and PQS and relate them to gaussian, Plummer and spline force <b>softening.</b> Our expressions allow possible inclusions of pointlike objects such as stars or supermassive black holes.

After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in Newcastle upon Tyne, until quite recently. Numerous new products and brand names were introduced over time, and Procter & Gamble began branching out into new areas. The company introduced Tide laundry detergent in 1946 and Prell shampoo in 1947. In 1955, Procter & Gamble began selling the first toothpaste to contain fluoride, known as Crest. Branching out once again in 1957, the company purchased Charmin paper mills and began manufacturing toilet paper and other tissue paper products.

The interrupted deformations were conducted with delay times varying between 30 and 120 seconds after achieving a strain of approximately 0. 4 in the first stage. It was indicated that the considerable dynamic <b>softening</b> and exceptional <b>softening</b> associated with a structure <b>softening</b> exist in alloy deformation at 400 ºC, leading to an initial flow stress value at the second deformation lower than that at the first deformation.
