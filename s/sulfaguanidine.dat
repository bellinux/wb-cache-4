40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper the {{therapeutic}} effectiveness of sulfathiazole {{used during the}} acute stages of Sonne bacillary dysentery was demonstrated. 5 However, it was shown also that sulfonamide therapy did not curtail the period during which the Sonne organism could be recovered by rectal cultures.

Another outbreak of Sonne bacillary dysentery occurring two years later afforded us the opportunity to test the value of <b>sulfaguanidine,</b> administered for varying periods during convalescence, for reducing the length of the carrier state.

40|$|<b>Sulfaguanidine</b> (1) {{is unusual}} {{compared}} to the many derivatives of sulfanilamide (4 -aminobenzenesulfonamide) that contain the grouping -SO_ 2 HN- in being insoluble in aqueous alkali. Its 4 -amino group is comparably basic to the other sulfanilamides (pK_B = 11. 25) but its guanidino group is only very weakly basic (pK_B = 13. 52). The nonacidic character of the compound caused Schwenker to investigate its infrared and ^lH NMR spectra and, by comparison of the infrared spectra in KBr pellets with those of several model compounds, it appeared that 1 had no infrared absorption which could be ascribed to the N-H bond of an -SO_ 2 NH- group. The ^ 1 H NMR spectrum in dimethyl sulfoxide solution was less decisive because of serious overlap of the downfield N-H resonances with the resonances of the aromatic ring, but nonetheless, {{there appeared to be}} no evidence for the three different kinds of -SO_ 2 NHC(=NH) NH_ 2 proton resonances predicted for the conventional guanidine structure. It was concluded therefore that the correct structure for <b>sulfaguanidine</b> is not 1 a, but instead the tautomer 1 b.

Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry.

Indication of temporary protection was shown by <b>sulfaguanidine,</b> whereas chloromycetin, polymyxin, and penicillin were not protective. B 12, added alone, or in combination with aureomycin, to the basal experimental diet had no influence {{on the development of}} hepatic necrosis.

In contrast to control animals showing the usual combination of cirrhosis and renal changes, the rats receiving supplements of aureomycin were free of both cirrhosis and renal changes. The rats receiving aureomycin took more food in and gained weight. No microscopic alterations were seen in the pancreas of the control rats with cirrhosis.

40|$|Probably the {{greatest}} {{contribution to the}} field of chemotherapy was Domagk's introduction of prontosil (chrysoidin) in 1935. Trefouel et al.

The introduction of prontosil and its active principle, sulfanilamide, opened the way for successful treatment of streptococcal, gonococcal, and meningococcal infections. Inasmuch as pneumo-coccus infections did not respond to sulfanilamide therapy, it remained for Whitby (1938) to introduce sulfapyridine, a sulfonamide effective in the treatment of pneumococcus infections as well as those previously mentioned.

40|$|Abstract: An {{economical}} {{mass production}} system of bacterial cellulose (BC) on agitated culture was constructed. We frst conducted screening of BC producers in agitated culture. A total of 2096 strains were isolated from natural sources {{and the best}} BC producing strain, BPR 2001, was selected. According to the taxonomic examination, we concluded that the strain belongs to a new subspecies, Acetobacter xylinum subsp. sucrofermentans subsp. nov. Of the several organic nitrogen sources used to supplement the culture medium, corn steep liquor (CSL) {{was found to be}} the most suitable for BC production. A mutant strain derived from BPR 2001, BPR 3001 E, resistant to an analogue of PABA, <b>sulfaguanidine,</b> showed increased cell growth and 40 % higher BC productivity than BPR 2001. A host-vector system for the BC producing Acetobacter strain was then developed using an indigenous plasmid, pAH 4, detected in BPR 2001. The complete nucleotide sequence of pAH 4 was determined and the shuttle vector pSA 19 was constructed by connecting pAH 4 to pUC 18. pSA 19 was found to be very stable and the system was suitable for introducihg genes into the BC producer in order to increase the yield of BC. Effective agitation culture systems essential for the BC ferementation with high yields were also developed. When the BC produced in this system was examined as a wet-end additive for papermaking processes, both the tensile strength and filler-retention of the resulting handsheets were found to be distinctly improved...|$|E
40|$|The aquatic {{toxicity}} of sulfaquinoxaline (SQO) and <b>sulfaguanidine</b> (SGD) was evaluated {{on the following}} test organisms: Daphnia magna (reproduction test), Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Scenedesmus dimorphus, Synecococcus leopoliensis (algal growth inhibition test) and Lemna gibba (duckweed growth inhibition test). Furthermore, the additivity of the two compounds was measured on D. magna (acute immobilisation test) and P. subcapitata (algal growth inhibition test) using the isobologram method. Results show that SQO and SGD are more toxic to green algae and daphnids, respectively, than other veterinary sulfonamides (SAs) and that their mixtures have a less then additive interaction. Taking into account the highest concentrations detected so far in surface waters for SQO (0. 112 lg L_ 1) and for SGD (0. 145 lg L_ 1) and the lowest NOECs obtained with the five test organisms, divided by an assessment factor of 10, the following PNECs and risk quotients (RQs) were calculated. SQO: PNEC 2 lg L_ 1; RQ 0. 056. SGD: PNEC 39. 5 lg L_ 1; RQ 0. 004. Consequently, at the concentrations actually detected in the aquatic environment, the two SAs alone should not harm the freshwater organisms. However, it seems advisable, for veterinary mass treatments, the use of other SAs that have a lesser impact on the aquatic environment. Furthermore, considering the high probability of having complex mixtures of different SAs residues in water, each individual contamination should be evaluated by applying to the SAs mixtures the conservative criteria of additivity...|$|E

40|$|Although the sulfonamide {{drugs are}} ubiquitously {{distributed}} throughout the entire body water, a property important for their wide chemotherapeutic value, quantitative differences do exist {{with regard to the}} concentrations attained in certain compartments of the extracellular fluid after equilibrium is established. Perhaps most striking is the failure of sulfathiazole to reach a concentration in the spinal fluid of more than one-third of that in the blood (Sadusk, Blake, and Seymour," 5 Strauss, Lowell, Taylor, and Finland, 17 and others). The fact that cerebrospinal fluid may not be formed wholly by a process of diffusion presents the possibility that the concentrations of sulfonamides in secretory fluids may depend upon factors other than those operative in simple diffusion and may vary with each particular drug and with each particular secretory membrane. Some indirect evidence for this hypothesis is afforded {{by the fact that the}} epithelial cells of the renal tubules selectively reabsorb sulfonamides from the tubular urine in such a manner that the renal excretion of sulfanilamide, sulfathiazole, and <b>sulfaguanidine</b> is more rapid than that for sulfapyridine and sulfadiazine, and that the renal clearances of acetylated sulfonamides are uniformly higher than those for the corresponding free forms. More direct evidence that secretory activity may influence the concentration of sulfonamide drugs can be obtained from the gastric juice. Thus, Carryer and Ivy 3 found in Pavlov-pouch dogs that the concentration of sulfanilamide was higher in the gastric juice than in the other digestive secretions examined, and peak concentrations approaching 50 mgm % were obtained. However, simultaneousl...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the suitability of Daphnia curvirostris for the acute toxicity test usually performed on Daphnia magna, and to compare the sensitivity of the two species toward 10 antibacterials [enrofloxacin (EFX), ciprofloxacin(CPX), <b>sulfaguanidine</b> (SGD), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQO), sulfaclozine (SCZ), sulfamerazine (SMA), sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and trimethoprim (TMP) ] and some of their binary mixtures. Furthermore, a tentative prolonged-toxicity test (lasting 13 d) was settled up in order to evidence toxic responses with drug concentrations that were uneffective in the classic 48 h immobilization test. Results showed that D. curvirostris was more sensitive than D. magna to the majority of compounds (6 out of 10). Lowest 48 h EC 50 s were obtained with EFX (4. 3 mg L 1 in D. curvirostris) and SGD (6. 2 mg L 1 in D. magna). The toxicity of paired compounds was always concentration- additive or less than concentration-additive. In the prolonged-toxicity test mortality and/or reproduction inhibition were constantly observed. It was concluded that: (1) D. curvirostris could be a suitable model for the evaluation of acute toxicity of antibacterials since its sensitivity was generally greater than that of D. magna; (2) the toxicity of EFX and SGD should be given special attention as the two compounds, in the prolonged test, showed to be active at concentrations of 0. 9 mg L 1 and 2. 5 mg L 1, respectively; (3) the concentration addition is usually a reasonable worst case estimation of the environmental impact of antibacterial mixtures...|$|E
