40|$|Abstract—State-of-the-art radomes exploit {{frequency}} selective media {{so as to}} be transparent for {{the frequencies}} of the antenna protected by them and opaque to other frequencies. This feature helps in reducing the radar cross section of the antenna and in protecting it from interference. The study of a frequency selective radome is a daunting task, since the radome is usually large in terms of wavelengths, hence full wave analyses are prohibitive. In this paper an approximate technique, based on the physical optics concept, is proposed to attain an estimation of the behavior of a radome <b>shielded</b> <b>antenna</b> in a short time with a commonly available computer. Results are validated against a full wave technique over a relatively small radome. 1...|$|E

A major asset of the experiment is the use of a wire mesh fence around the rim-halo <b>shielded</b> <b>antenna</b> with the purpose of levelling out and reducing this source of stray radiation for zenith-centered 1 -rpm circular scans. We investigate the shielding performance of the experiment by means of a geometric diffraction model in order to predict the level of the spillover and diffraction sidelobes {{in the direction of the}} ground. Using 408 MHz and 1465 MHz feed measurements, the model shows how a weakly-diffracting and unshielded antenna configuration becomes strongly-diffracting and double-shielded as far-field diffraction effects give way to near-field ones. Due to the asymmetric response of the feeds, the orientation of their radiation fields with respect to the secondary must be known a priori before comparing model predictions with observational data. By adjusting the attenuation coefficient of the wire mesh the model is able to reproduce the amount of differential ground pick-up observed during test measurements at 1465 MHz.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 - IntroductionThe engraved {{remains on}} stony parapets of cultural heritage {{of this country}} show rich civilization of Iran that protection and reparation {{of them is a}} duty of scientific teams with cooperation of related specialist. Geomorphology, geology and geophysics are including of this science. Bistoon inscription is located on long wall (famous broken part) of broken zagros on rough part which is called same name. Broken part, fissure, and thick lime of previous region (Paleoclime) pave way for destruction of engrave figure, which leads to solving process and to make solving holes. This study has been done with the following tools: GPS, topography maps and satellite images. In order to obtain a good quality data and radar images as well as maximum penetration of radar waves, GPR has been used three times on summer 1387 (dry season) with 500 MHz <b>shielded</b> <b>antenna</b> on five profiles from which three of them are parallel to the longitudinal part of the inscription while two of them are perpendicular to the first ones. The Ramac GPR system of a Swedish company, Mala has been used for data acquisition. GPR is a geophysics method which uses electromagnetic high frequency waves (at MHZ range) to get a precise image from underground anomalies which are situated at shallow depths. The principles of data processing and data acquisition are very similar to reflection seismic. The propagation velocity of radar waves depends on electric conductivity and magnetic permeability of the medium while reflection and refraction of radar waves depend on the contrast between dielectric constants of the mediums at both sides of the contact between them. As conductivity increases, the depth of investigation decreases which is an obstacle for radar application for high depth investigation. Therefore a good environmental condition from point view of conductivity and a proper central frequency must be provided for radar work. The dry season for the former one and 500 MHZ for the latter one were the best for the field work. The common offset method has been used for radar data acquisition. The radar grams are processed with REFLEX 2 W software. The radar images after filtering such noise reduction, diffraction removal and gain show a hole at 3 m depth that is a path for rain water passage and karstification of the surrounding area. This defect is on those profiles which intersects the anomaly and is {{on the right side of}} the profiles (north end). The GPR results confirm the other findings which are based on other methods than geophysics such as geomorphology, geology field observations and archeology prospect ion. This study shows that there are effects of fissure, broken parts, solved hole and karset process at the right side of the inscription in three meters depth. Regarding to destructive agents, it is better to save, and to repair the inscription by appropriate ways.

We first use extensive real-life experiments to evaluate the performance of closely located 802. 11 n radios. We discover that even when tuned to orthogonal channels, co-located 802. 11 n radios interfere with each other and achieve significantly less throughput than expected. Our analysis reveals that the throughput degradation is caused by three link-layer effects: (i) triggering of carrier sensing, (ii) out of band collisions and (iii) unintended frequency adaptation. Using physical layer statistics, we observe that these effects are caused by fundamental limitations of co-located radios in achieving signal isolation. We then consider the use of beamforming <b>antennas,</b> <b>shielding</b> and <b>antenna</b> separation distance to achieve better signal isolation and to mitigate these problems. Our work profiles the gains of different physical isolation approaches and provides insights to network designers to realize high-performance wireless networks without requiring synchronization or protocol modifications.

This kind of geological formation contains {{a large part}} of the fresh underground water resources of the world and is also considered as an analogue of Middle East oil reservoirs.

However, rock fractures, exfoliated rocks and soil pockets potentially permit downward water percolation and root growth. With ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), two geophysical methods advocated by Jayawickreme et al.  (2014) to advance root ecology, we advanced in the method development studying root and water distribution in shallow rocky soils and rock fractures in a semiarid forest.

40|$|The {{concept for}} a novel new antenna design is {{presented}} and investigated for application to {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR). The proposed new antenna design is called the <b>shielded</b> magnetic bowtie <b>antenna</b> (MBA). As the name suggests, it is predominately constructed from a bowtie-shaped volume of magnetic material that is fed from {{the centre of the}} structure by a small magnetic loop antenna. This thesis develops the magnetic antenna concept and investigates its potential for GPR predominately through numerical modelling. However, {{a significant part of the}} investigation concentrates on validating the numerical modelling technique developed to study the shielded MBA by comparing the results with measurements obtained from a scale model constructed to operate in the watertank antenna test facility, a controlled environment for GPR antenna research. The broadband properties required for GPR antennas are achieved uniquely with the shielded MBA design by a combination of the antenna shape being defined in terms of angles and an inherent magnetic loss mechanism within the antenna material structure. The design also affords an intrinsically placed <b>antenna</b> <b>shield</b> that has the potential for mitigating problems typically experienced with <b>shielding</b> electric dipole <b>antennas.</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>shielding</b> is an important consideration for GPR antenna designers, especially given the recent US government (FCC) changes that restrict radiated energy emissions within the regulated spectrum used by GPR systems. In addition to providing the intended directional radiation properties, the magnetic <b>antenna</b> <b>shield</b> also provides an elegant solution for a low-loss wideband balun, allowing the antenna to be effectively fed from an unbalanced coaxial transmission line. Other important aspects of the proposed design are discussed in relation to the requirements for GPR antennas. Numerical models of the magnetic antenna concept show encouraging bandwidth results. For example, from a simple comparison with an equivalent sized electric bowtie antenna model, the effective gain bandwidth of the magnetic antenna is found to be at least 3 -octaves compared to approximately 2 -octaves for the electric bowtie. The <b>shielded</b> magnetic <b>antenna</b> achieves a gain of approximately 2 dB, compared to 5 dB for the unshielded electric bowtie antenna. However, it is noted that the magnetic antenna models contain significantly more loss compared to the electric bowtie model. The shielded MBA design emerged from a theoretical investigation of electrically small GPR antennas, given that the initial thesis objective was to investigate ways of improving low frequency GPR antennas. In general, GPR systems are operated with electric dipole antennas, such as the electric bowtie. Interestingly, the electrically small antenna investigation revealed that only the small magnetic loop (i. e., magnetic dipole) antenna can be constructed to approach, arbitrarily closely, the fundamental bandwidth limit for small antennas. This surprising and counter intuitive result is shown to be theoretically achievable with the use of magnetic materials. For the small loop antenna, energy stored within the antenna structure can be avoided by filling the antenna sphere with a perfect magnetic material. This theoretical argument is discussed and supported by numerically modelled results. The electrically small antenna investigation presented in this thesis extends to include the influence that proximity to a lossy dielectric half-space has, on improving the antenna impedance bandwidth. This investigation is of general interest for GPR; it is performed numerically and supported by measurements conducted on an experimental loop antenna situated at various heights above the ground. These results provide support for the hypothesis that a magnetic antenna may experience less influence from near-field changes in the dielectric properties of the ground compared to the equivalent sized electric field antenna...|$|R

The following parameters were then adopted {{for use in the}} processing of the subsurface data acquired; Data collection mode: continuous; range: 300  ns; samples per scan: 1024. From this survey, eight radargrams were generated and subjected to processes of dewowing, filtering by distance, AGC (automatic gain control) and NMO (normal moveout).|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Monitoring of {{soil water}} content (volumetric water content, VWC) is an {{important}} process in agricultural and ecological programs, and a vital process in flood and water resource management. There are several methods in estimating VWC but often these are time consuming, invasive and expensive. This paper investigates the applicability of a surface based geophysical technique, Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR), for estimating the VWC in shallow soil (top 0. 30 m of soil subsurface). The guided wave sounding, GWS, technique (an invasive application of the GPR technique) was used on a vegetable garden located at latitude 6. 67 and longitude- 1. 56, south of the College of Engineering, KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana. The MALÅ ProEx GPR equipment using <b>shielded</b> <b>antennae</b> with a central frequency of 800 MHz {{was used for the}} measurements. The result showed that, on the average, the VWC at the top soil (0. 065 m) containing humus was high (0. 12 m 3 m- 3) as compared to depth 0. 295 m (0. 10 m 3 m- 3). Thus, the topsoil held more water than the soil beneath due to the presence of the organic humus layer. The cabbage planted which had an average root depth of 0. 30 m was found to be good for the area. Comparing GWSderived soil water content data with the gravimetric soil water sampling yielded a root mean square deviation of ± 5 %. Our research shows that the GWS technique offers a good, reliable, and relatively easy to use geophysical approach for estimation of shallow soil water conten...|$|R

40|$|Metallic {{materials}} {{are in a}} peculiar position for realization of electromagnetic <b>shielding</b> and <b>antennas.</b> Implanted devices, sometimes also responsible for vital functions of the hosting human body, should present reduced response to external electromagnetic interferences. In case transmission of data between the device and external environment is additionally required, the device should also be equipped with an antenna. The biocompatibility of such metallic parts is of fundamental importance: being them positioned on the external part of the device, {{they are the most}} exposed to be in close contact with the body environment. Investigations on the timely interaction between the metal based materials and the simulated hosting body by standardized physiological solution is described and quantifie...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGround {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) is a non-destructive method which, {{over the}} past 10 years, has been successfully used not only to estimate the water content of soil, but also to detect and monitor the infiltration of pollutants on sites contaminated by light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL). We represented a model water table aquifer (72 cm depth) by injecting water into a sandbox that also contains several buried objects. The GPR measurements were carried out with <b>shielded</b> <b>antennae</b> of 900 and 1200 MHz, respectively, for common mid point (CMP) and constant offset (CO) profiles. We extended the work reported by Loeffler and Bano by injecting 100 L of diesel fuel (LNAPL) {{from the top of}} the sandbox. We used the same acquisition procedure and the same profile configuration as before fuel injection. The GPR data acquired on the polluted sand did not show any clear reflections from the plume pollution; nevertheless, travel times are very strongly affected by the presence of the fuel and the main changes are on the velocity anomalies. We can notice that the reflection from the bottom of the sandbox, which is recorded at a constant time when no fuel is present, is deformed by the pollution. The area close to the fuel injection point is characterized by a higher velocity than the area situated further away. The area farther away from the injection point shows a low velocity anomaly which indicates an increase in travel time. It seems that pore water has been replaced by fuel as a result of a lateral flow. We also use finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical GPR modelling in combination with dielectric property mixing models to estimate the volume and the physical characteristics of the contaminated sand...|$|R
40|$|The {{bottleneck}} for realizing {{high efficiency}} System-on-Chip is integrating the antenna on the lossy silicon substrate. To <b>shield</b> the <b>antenna</b> from the silicon, a ground plane can be used. However, the ultra-thin oxide {{does not provide}} enough separation between the antenna and the ground plane. In this work, we demonstrate {{one of the highest}} reported gains to date for low profile 94 GHz on-chip dipole antenna while the ground plane is in the lowest metal in the oxide (M 1). This is achieved by optimizing an Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) structure midway the antenna and M 1. The dipole antenna without the AMC has a gain of − 11 dBi while with the AMC structure a gain of + 4. 8 dBi and hence achieving a gain enhancement of + 15. 8 dB...|$|R
