The nonlinear dynamic equation is developed under the foundation displacement excitation and the resonance {{frequency of the}} system is also analyzed. Furthermore, different <b>support</b> <b>angles</b> affecting the vibration amplitude and the natural frequency of the system are researched. The model of the tilted support spring damping system is analyzed by ANSYS, and modal analysis and harmonic response analysis are made under harmonic excitation. The study shows that the <b>supporting</b> <b>angle</b> makes a great impact on the amplitude of the system and the response amplitude {{of the system is}} also reduced with the decrease of <b>support</b> <b>angle.</b> Through the analysis and comparison of the example, it provides a theoretical basis of the analysis for the tilted support spring damping system <b>support</b> <b>angle’s</b> optimal design...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a welding nozzle position manipulator. The manipulator consists of an <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> to which the remaining components of the device are attached either directly or indirectly. A pair of pivotal connections attach a weld nozzle holding link to the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> and provide a two axis freedom of movement of the holding link {{with respect to the}} <b>support</b> <b>angle.</b> The manipulator is actuated by a pair of adjusting screws angularly mounted to the <b>angle</b> <b>support.</b> These screws contact a pair of tapered friction surfaces formed on the upper portion of the welding nozzle holding link. A spring positioned between the upper portions of the <b>support</b> <b>angle</b> and the holding link provides a constant bias engagement between the friction surfaces of the holding link and the adjustment screws, so as to firmly hold the link in position and to eliminate any free play in the adjustment mechanism. The angular relationships between the adjustment screws, the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> and the tapered friction surfaces of the weld nozzle holding link provide a geometric arrangement which permits precision adjustment of the holding link with respect to the <b>angle</b> <b>support</b> and also provides a solid holding link mount which is resistant to movement from outside forces...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:A ghani is {{a machine}} and pestle device which grinds oilseed into fine {{particles}} and extract oil from it. The oilseeds and subsequently the expressed oil {{are held in}} a scooped circular pit in the exact centre of a circular mortar made of stone or wood. In it works a stout, upright pestle which descends from a top curved or <b>angled</b> <b>piece,</b> in which the pestle rests in a scooped-out hollow that permits the pestle to rotate, eased by some soapy or oily lubricant. Today the single <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> {{takes the form of}} two shorter pieces pinioned or chained together. The bottom of the lower <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> is attached to a load-beam; one end of the load-beam rides around the outside of the barrel, while the other is yoked to the animal. The load-beam is weighted down with either heavy stones or even the seated operator. As the animal moves in a circular ambit, the pestle rotates, exerting lateral pressure on the upper chest of the pit, first pulverizing the oilseed and then crushing out its oil. But with the advent of oil expeller technology, almost all ghani were closed down. But still some ghani are running which are now made of iron and steel and it is driven by 2 HP motor. In India, oil extraction machine for extracting oil from seeds was designed and fabricated for market oriented production. The procedures employed include the design stage, construction and testing. The machine components are: Wooden hopper, wooden crusher, Connecting Rod, The reduction gear, the electric motor (2 hp, 3 -phase), the frame, the belt. oil are produced on a large scale which is used for various purposes such as Edible etc...|$|R

50|$|If a {{sheet of}} glass {{is placed in the}} tank, the depth of water in the tank will be {{shallower}} over the glass than elsewhere. The speed of a wave in water depends on the depth, so the ripples slow down as they pass over the glass. This causes the wavelength to decrease. If the junction between the deep and shallow water is at an angle to the wavefront, the waves will refract. In the diagram above, the waves can be seen to bend towards the normal. The normal is shown as a dotted line. The dashed line is the direction that the waves would travel if they had not met the <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of glass.|$|R

Wedged between the Stadtbahn railway viaduct and the firewall of the building nextdoor, it made for a difficult design of a prestigious building. The architects designed a cupola above the podium that covered up the firewall, and the front facade with its portico turned the street corner into a kind of vestibule. The remaining triangular outside areas were set off from the street with lattice work and gates and functioned as gardens; the remaining area in the back served as delivery courtyard.|$|R

50|$|To allow {{a soldier}} to {{see out of}} the trench without exposing his head, a {{loophole}} could be built into the parapet. A loophole might simply be {{a gap in the}} sandbags, or it might be fitted with a steel plate. German snipers used armour-piercing bullets that allowed them to penetrate loopholes. Another means to see over the parapet was the trench periscope—in its simplest form, just a stick with two <b>angled</b> <b>pieces</b> of mirror at the top and bottom. A number of armies made use of the periscope rifle, which enabled soldiers to snipe at the enemy without exposing themselves over the parapet, although at the cost of reduced shooting accuracy.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the performance of}} roof ridge vents {{in regard to the}} possible entry of snow into the attic space under strong wind conditions. A total of 11 vent configurations made available by Air Vent Inc. were tested for snow infiltration. Additionally, attic pressures and flow rates were measured for 13 ridge vent arrangements, including the 11 tested for snow infiltration. For reasons of expense, time, and ease of execution, wind tunnel models of snow blowing and drifting have been used for many years in design and in specific problem solutions. A fairly large number of modelling materials have been employed, e. g. sawdust, mica, gypsum, peat, sand, borax, magnesium carbonate, glass beads, activated clay, expanded polysterene, wheat bran, and semolina. (A recent study of snow loads on the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis was carried out for example using glass beads with a diameter of 0. 1 mm, at a scale of 1 : 384.) In the present study, however, to simulate field conditions as closely as possible, actual natural dry snow was used. The tests were conducted during winter months using the open circuit mode of operation of the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. The results of the study offer a comparison of the effectiveness of various ridge vent designs, valid of course under the conditions under which the tests were carried out, as described in detail in this report.

The method of collection—tapping the trees—vaguely resembles that used on a rubber plantation or in a maple sugar grove.

An <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of galvanized tin is then placed below the eight-inch-long, one-inch-wide gash (also known as “the streak”) to direct the oozing sap into a quart-sized rectangular cup fixed to the tree. Each new “streak” is put onto the tree above the preceding one, and gradually a vertical “cat face” more than thirty inches in height is formed.
