In 2010, EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break-even could be achieved by 2015 when 200 deliveries were projected. In 2012, Airbus clarified that the aircraft production costs would be less than its <b>sales</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{this entire}} period, BE1 was insolvent. The bank {{therefore}} {{required that the}} entire <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> of Hamar stadion be transferred to BG, even though NOK50 million {{was to go to}} the construction of Børstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK3.4 million in compensation to Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the construction time and for the club house, which would be demolished.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The {{company now}} maintained its full inventory, making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on <b>sales</b> <b>price.</b> This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.|$|E
5|$|Construction was financed {{through a}} loan of NOK218 million from Handelsbanken, which was secured on the revenue {{which would be}} {{generated}} {{from the sale of}} Hamar stadion and Fuglsetmyra. However, the bank was not willing to lend money secured on the basis of <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> of Hamar stadion being based on the re-regulation of the lot. The municipality was pressed on time by the possibility of NFF denying Ham-Kam the right to play at Briskeby. Hamar Energi Holding AS (HEH), which owns Hamar Municipality's share of Eidsiva Energi, had large assets. Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK75 million for BG and BE1—which was issued in September 2007. This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK58.75 million. Because of delays in the regulation work, HEH issued another two guarantees, NOK60 million in March and NOK25 million in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was {{established}} in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 percent each by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater. A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK6 million, while the <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> of the lot was estimated at NOK30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam rented the venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit {{for the first four}} years being covered by the municipality. Of the NOK20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation to build a new athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed, and NOK5 million was debt.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, McCaw started {{attempts}} to sell either Orca Bay or the Grizzlies, {{and at first}} negotiated an agreement with Dennis Washington, owner of Seaspan, who had {{a large portion of}} his operations in Vancouver. Washington initially agreed to purchase 50% of Orca Bay, with the intent of keeping the teams in Vancouver. Instead, McCaw used Washington's bid to leverage a higher <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> with Bill Laurie, who offered US$148million for the Grizzlies, and a US$52million bonus if the team ultimately relocated to St. Louis. The announcement was made in September1999, one month after Laurie had bought the NHL team St. Louis Blues and their home venue Kiel Center (now Scottrade Center). St. Louis had not been the home of an NBA franchise since the Hawks franchise relocated to Atlanta in 1968.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> and its proximity to different open spaces types is explored using a data set comprised of single-family home sales {{in the city of}} Portland, within Multnomah County, between 1990 and 1992. Homes located within 1, 500 feet of a natural area park, where more than 50 % of the park is preserved in native and/or natural vegetation, are found to experience, on average, the largest increase in <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> The open space size that maximizes a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> is calculated for each open space type. Natural area parks require the largest acreage to maximize <b>sale</b> <b>price,</b> and specialty parks are found to have the largest potential effect on a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> A zonal approach is used to examine the {{relationship between}} a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> and its distance to an open space. Natural area parks and specialty parks are found to have a positive and statistically significant effect on a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> for each zone studied. Homes located adjacent to golf courses (within 200 feet) are estimated to experience the largest increase in <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> due to open space proximity although the effect drops off quickly as distance from the golf course increases.
