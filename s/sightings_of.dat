5|$|In Washington, sea otters {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend has}} now been largely forgotten, {{and there have been}} no {{reported}} <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> the ghost in recent times.|$|E
50|$|The manor is {{reportedly}} haunted. There has been speculation <b>of</b> <b>sightings</b> documented <b>of</b> a homosexual priest who {{was believed to}} have been crucified in the dining room, the figure of a lady in the red room and cemetery and the ghost of a strong tobacco smoker who is smelled but not seen.The manor has been subject to an investigation by Most Haunted.|$|R

50|$|Antarctic minke {{whales are}} more gregarious than their smaller counterparts, the common and dwarf minke whale. The average group {{size in the}} Antarctic was about 2.4 (adjusted {{downwards}} for observer bias), with about a quarter <b>of</b> the <b>sightings</b> consisting <b>of</b> singles and one-fifth of pairs; the largest aggregation consisted of 60 individuals. Off South Africa, the average group size was about two, with singles (nearly 46%) and pairs (31%) being the most common - the largest was 15. Off Brazil, most <b>sightings</b> were <b>of</b> singles (32.6%) or pairs (31.5%), with the largest group consisting of 17 individuals.|$|R
5|$|Otters were {{observed}} twice in Southern California in 2011, once near Laguna Beach and once at Zuniga Point Jetty, near San Diego. These {{are the first}} documented <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> otters this far south in 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Campbell of Islay has {{speculated that}} {{descriptions}} of the boobrie may be based on <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, more like a bull than a bird, may have its origin in the strange call of the common bittern, which was a rare visitor to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In his Natural History 9.4.9-11, Pliny the Elder {{describes}} numerous <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> mermaids off {{the coast}} of Gaul, noting that their bodies were covered all over in scales and that their corpses frequently washed up on shore. He comments that the governor of Gaul even wrote a letter to Emperor Augustus to inform him.|$|E
50|$|It {{was home}} to three RAF Liberator squadrons (53, 224, 547). Many of these were {{equipped}} with the highly successful Leigh Light. In April, a fourth squadron arrived, giving the station {{one of the most}} powerful anti-submarine forces in the RAF. This force flew thousands of hours of patrols each month and was rewarded with a number <b>of</b> <b>sightings,</b> many <b>of</b> which were converted into attacks, with at least three confirmed U-boat kills in June alone.|$|R

50|$|Part of {{the purpose}} of the {{challenge}} was to force participants to discern actual pertinent information from potential noise. Many teams came across false reports <b>of</b> <b>sightings,</b> both accidental and purposeful. One valid strategy was spamming social networks with false reports to throw competitors off the trail <b>of</b> real <b>sightings.</b> The verification <b>of</b> balloon <b>sightings</b> was paramount to success.|$|R
5|$|Since his death, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} alleged <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> Presley. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death. Fans have noted alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin and numerous accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-one {{species of}} mammals have been {{recorded}} in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> cougar, Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied marmot, least chipmunk, muskrat, beaver, Uinta ground squirrel, pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.|$|E
5|$|The British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC), {{established}} in 1959, {{is the national}} bird rarities committee for Britain. It assesses claimed <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> bird species that are rarely seen in Britain, based on descriptions, photographs and video recordings submitted by observers. Its findings are published in an annual report in the journal British Birds.|$|E

40|$|Until recently, it {{was thought}} that dugongs (Dugong dugon) were extinct in the Seychelles. However, a {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>sightings</b> at Aldabra Atoll, a World Heritage Site in the Seychelles, has renewed interest in dugong distribution in the western Indian Ocean. This article consolidates the records <b>of</b> dugong <b>sightings</b> held in the Aldabra Research Station library and explores their spatial patterning. The locations <b>of</b> <b>sightings</b> (2001 - 2009) are plotted onto a high-resolution benthic habitat map of the Aldabra lagoon created by classifying a QuickBird satellite remote-sensing image in January 2009. A spatial cluster detection procedure is applied to point records <b>of</b> <b>sightings</b> to reveal a statistically significant cluster <b>of</b> <b>sightings</b> in the north-west of the lagoon, at Bras Monsieur Clairemont, suggesting a mutual co-existence of dugongs and seagrass beds. A habitat suitability model combines the point data set <b>of</b> dugong <b>sightings</b> within the continuous benthic habitat map and identifies the central western area as containing the most suitable habitat for dugong inside the Aldabra lagoon...|$|R
5|$|The finless {{porpoise}} {{is known to}} also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations {{in the mouth of}} the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{legend of}} the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, {{may be related to}} similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest {{that at least some of}} the tales of horned hares were inspired by <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus. It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.|$|E
5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura {{to search for the}} bird. In 1977, <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.|$|E

5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps {{on the road to}} the pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{to improve}} {{the image of the}} town {{continues}} with the latest Central Basingstoke Vision project coordinated by the Borough Council. In the mid-1990s, numerous reports described <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> the Beast of Basingstoke, a big cat believed to be a lion or a puma, possibly two. Local legend suggests the animal was shot and killed, although no official news sources document any capture or killing of the beast.|$|E
5|$|In modern fiction, {{the vampire}} {{tends to be}} {{depicted}} as a suave, charismatic villain. Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> vampires are reported. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons. Allegations of vampire attacks swept through Malawi during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor Eric Chiwaya, {{based on the belief}} that the government was colluding with vampires.|$|E
5|$|The Tora {{hartebeest}} {{is listed}} as Critically Endangered; the IUCN has ascertained that fewer than 250 mature individuals survive as of 2008.

5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and {{his companion}} Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) travel to Victorian Cardiff on Christmas, 1869 where {{there have been}} <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> strange gas-like creatures. The Doctor and Rose team up with Charles Dickens (Simon Callow) to investigate Mr Sneed (Alan David), a man who runs a funeral parlour where it seems that corpses have come to life. It is revealed that the gaseous Gelth (voiced by Zoe Thorne) have entered Cardiff through a Rift, and wish to survive by taking over the corpses.|$|E
5|$|Lysurus mokusin is saprobic, {{and grows}} solitarily {{or in small}} groups in forest litter, and wood chip mulch used in landscaping, and compost. Documented <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> L.mokusin include Australasia, the Canary Islands, Korea, Japan, China (Fujian Province), and the Bonin Islands. The species was unknown in Europe until it was {{reported}} in Italy in 1979; it is considered an alien species in that continent. In the United States, it has been collected from the states of California, Texas, and Washington, D.C..|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, Colonel David E. Lownds {{took over}} as {{commander}} of the 26th Marine Regiment. There were sporadic actions in the vicinity during the late summer and early fall, the most serious {{of which was the}} ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March. During December and early January there were numerous <b>sightings</b> <b>of</b> NVA troops and activities in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.|$|E
