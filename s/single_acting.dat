At the same time, Taare Zameen Par (Like Stars on Earth), India's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, failed to make the short list of nominations and was frequently compared with Slumdog Millionaire in the Indian media.|$|E

2500|$|The Franchot {{engine is}} a double acting engine invented by [...] in the nineteenth century. A double acting engine {{is one in which}} both sides of the piston are acted upon by the {{pressure}} of the working fluid. One of the simplest forms of a double acting machine, the Franchot engine consists of two pistons and two cylinders and acts like two separate alpha machines. In the Franchot engine, each piston acts in two gas phases, which makes more efficient use of the mechanical components than a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> alpha machine. However, a disadvantage of this machine is that one connecting rod must have a sliding seal at the hot side of the engine, which is difficult when dealing with high pressures and temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the 1970s that Glynne Wickham, first in an essay and then in his edition of the play, {{challenged}} this conception, arguing that the three stations had taken the form either of mobile [...] "pageants" [...] or fixed [...] "mansions" [...] grouped together on a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> area, or [...] "platea". As William Tydeman points out, much hinges on how one interprets [...] "processyon" [...] in line 157 – as referring to a physical procession, or to the procession of the stage action. As this line is part of a passage marked [...] "si placet" [...] (i.e. optional) in the text, Wickham believes it hardly likely to have been a direction to the audience, and that it should be interpreted, along with [...] "proces" [...] in line 9 and 14, as signifying the thrust of an argument, and not physical movement. In his edition of 1993, Coldewey takes up a revisionist stance, believing that the play was processional in nature and clearly unconvinced by Wickham's argument.|$|E

25|$|One can generalize the {{algebraic}} {{object that}} is {{acting on the}} vector space, replacing a <b>single</b> operator <b>acting</b> on a vector space with an algebra representation – an associative algebra acting on a module.

50|$|As all the {{projective}} {{spaces of}} the same dimension over the same field are isomorphic, {{the same is true}} for their homography groups. They are therefore considered as a <b>single</b> group <b>acting</b> on several spaces, and only the dimension and the field appear in the notation, not the specific projective space.|$|R
50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} cylinders are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> rod style cylinder, the <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinder is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but retracts using external forces when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir. This external retraction force is usually gravity acting on {{the weight of the}} load. This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|E
50|$|In some applications, a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} cylinder is adequate {{to accomplish the}} work except for one stage that is required to be double acting.|$|E
