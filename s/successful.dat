5|$|Cardiff won {{the coin}} toss and elected to kick first. Ben Blair and Julien Dupuy, the goal-kickers {{used during the}} match {{were the first to}} attempt kicks for their {{respective}} sides, were both <b>successful.</b> The teams then nominated other players on their team who had experience at goal-kicking, both teams being <b>successful</b> with their second and third kicks. Cardiff's fourth player Ceri Sweeney, was also an experienced goal-kicker and was successful; however, Leicester selected Johne Murphy, who was not a regular kicker, and he missed to make the score 4–3 after four of the five rounds. This meant if Cardiff were <b>successful</b> with their next kick, they would have an unassailable lead and would win the match. With no more experienced goal kickers to choose from, winger Tom James stepped up to take the kick, but missed, allowing Leicester the chance to draw level. Scott Hamilton scored with his kick to bring the scores to 4–4 after five kicks and take the shoot-out to sudden death. The teams were both <b>successful</b> with their next two kicks, including Craig Newby for Leicester who was the first forward to take a kick in the shoot-out. With all seven backs having already attempted a kick, Cardiff were required to select a forward player for their eighth kick, and chose flanker Martyn Williams. He missed, giving Leicester the chance to win the match if they were <b>successful</b> with their eighth kick. Number 8 Jordan Crane was selected for the attempt and was <b>successful,</b> resulting in Leicester winning the shoot-out 7–6 and advancing to the 2009 Heineken Cup Final.|$|E
