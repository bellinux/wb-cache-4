40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{homelessness}} {{has become}} an increasingly visible and seemingly intransigent part of American society. It affects not only those who experience it directly, as a condition in their own lives, but also {{a broad spectrum of}} interests that deal with its effects. One such interest is owners and managers <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>land,</b> where homeless individuals commonly seek refuge, sometimes forming communities. Although their business may be transportation, natural resources management, recreation or some other <b>public</b> <b>service,</b> managers <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>land</b> are called upon to deal with this complex environmental, legal and human problem. This is a case study of the Baldock Restoration Project, in which a team of people from the travel, transportation, law enforcement and social services professions came together to help homeless individuals leave their long-standing community located in an Oregon highway rest area, thus restoring the rest area to its original function. This case study {{is part of a larger}} project to analyze ways in which transportation agencies address the challenge of homeless encampments on public right-of-way. A best practices guide of potential strategies and interventions for a variety of contexts will also be prepared...|$|R
50|$|National parks {{began to}} be {{designated}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, and national monuments in the early part of the 20th century. Each park or monument was managed individually or, alternately in some cases, by the United States Army, each with varying degrees of success. Beginning in 1911, Senator Reed Smoot of Utah and Representative John E. Raker of California had submitted bills to establish the National Park Service to oversee the management of all these holdings. The bills were opposed by the director of the U.S. Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot, and his supporters. The Forest Service believed that a National Park Service would be a threat to continued Forest <b>Service</b> control <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> that had been set aside for the timber trade. Beginning in 1910 the American Civic Association with the support of the General Federation of Women's Clubs and the Sierra Club had led the call for a federal service to manage the parks. The noted landscape architect and planner Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. was also a booster of a single national organization to manage the National Parks.|$|R
40|$|The outdoor enthusiast’s dream bucket list is {{embodied}} in this illustrated celebration {{of our greatest}} national forests, from Alaska to Florida. For more than a century, America’s national forests have proved an environmental gift and cultural treasure, our spectacular backyard. Under {{the management of the}} U. S. Forest <b>Service,</b> this system <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> encompasses 193 million acres of mountains, prairies, rivers, and canyons—much of it undiscovered, but accessible for hiking, kayaking, fishing, and winter sports. Officially published with the U. S. Forest Service, this book features the thirty most notable national forests—while also celebrating more than one hundred different national forests in forty-four states—from the White Mountains of New Hampshire to the Olympics of Washington. Unlike the national parks, Americans can use these lands for all manner of recreation, truly earning these tremendous resources the moniker of 2 ̆ 2 America’s backyard. 2 ̆ 2 This book is a treasure for all readers who use and cherish these lands.
