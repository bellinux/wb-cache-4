40|$|The {{object of}} the article are the {{questions}} concerning the „ethical aspects” of functioning of <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>law</b> during partitions of Poland {{and in the first}} years of independent Poland. The analysis covers the period from 1817 (when in Warsaw the first official stock exchange on Polish territory was created) to 1921 when the first in independent Poland Act about the Organization of Stock Exchanges was passed. In the 19 th century, several stock exchanges were created on Polish territory, from which the most essential were those in: Warsaw, Lvov and Lodz. The stock exchange was (and still is) regarded as one of the key institutions of market economy. Already, even on this account, the <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>law</b> constituted the essential reference to economic law. On its basis the important institutions functioned, not only in the area of economy. In this article, the basic records of laws and exchange charters were traced, as well as different – essential for stock exchanges – documents (for instance, ministerial instructions), which set the principles of functioning of those institutions. The principles were considered from ethical norms’ point of view, which established ethics of economic life of that time. I have especially focused my attention on the principles of functioning of stock exchanges, which related to: the main stock organs, members of exchanges, as well as the so-called clientele. The <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>law</b> also related to realities of that time, where-for different reasons – common cases of disobedience of the law occured. It should be stressed here, that <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>law</b> was shaped on basis of economic legislation of the partitioners and that it was subject to changes along with political, economic and social transformations, which took place on Polish territory in the discussed period...|$|E

40|$|Starting with {{an outline}} {{of the way in}} which Swiss <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Law</b> treats «the group», this paper {{analyzes}} the announcement effects of major shareholdings in the Swiss stock market as reported by the SIX Swiss Exchange database in the time period from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. This includes a total of 3, 617 announcements. By applying specific selection criteria, a sample of 218 announcements was collected for use in the empirical analysis, covering 61 individual investors and 32 groups of investors acting in concert. We test the hypothesis that the disclosure notifications of major shareholders have a significant impact on equity pricing for the validity of its proposition. In particular, we test whether information related to groups acting in concert is priced differently from information related to individual investors. We analyze the (cumulative) abnormal returns occurring around official announcements to investigate these issues. Our empirical results reveal that the announcement effects of group-related disclosures are statistically and economically significant; the significance of the results strongly increases after January 2009, when the SIX Swiss Exchange launched a new electronic publication platform, thereby enabling a more immediate release of information. In the preceding sample period, the price effects are scattered over the days prior to the announcement date, which makes it difficult to identify the effects. With the introduction of the new publication platform, the pre-announcement effects virtually disappear. Also, the difference between the stock price reactions between announcements related to single individuals and to groups is striking in the post- 2009 sample. We, furthermore, find rather heterogeneous price patterns within both the «purchase» and the «sale» announcement categories. For example, the price effects of the «sale» sample are largely dominated by the valuation effects caused by the breakup (dissolutions) of controlling groups...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. (Banking and <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Law)</b> Abstract: Money {{laundering}} {{and terrorist}} financing {{is a global}} issue. The advent of new technologies such as {{the internet and the}} impact of globalisation have forced businesses including banks to re-evaluate their business models. One of the key strategies currently being employed by South African banks is diversification of business interests through the establishment of subsidiary banks throughout the African continent. It is precisely this strategic shift which has exposed weaknesses in the management of money laundering risks as the South African banks are expected to ensure that the home country anti-money laundering standards are imposed on the subsidiary banks. The South African anti-money laundering regime is considered to be strong within the global context. However, the current Financial Intelligence Centre Act was not developed, and does not cater, for the position where home country anti-money laundering standards are to be imposed on subsidiaries. Even if the Act did cater for this position there would need to be intergovernmental agreements in place to give effect to the South African provisions on the subsidiary banks. Additional legislation such as the Banks Act provides for oversight and attempts to ensure that the standards are met to a degree. However, the Banks Act is applicable to the South African banks, and not to the subsidiaries due to sovereignty of state. It does to a degree require agreement between the various regulators of the countries involved. The countries involved in these cross-border acquisitions are often at different phases of their social, political and economic development and may not have the same resources that South Africa has at its disposal. What occurs when there is a conflict between the legislation of the subsidiary and the home country or if it is simply impractical to impose the standards of the home country to the subsidiary? The risk to South African banks and the South African economy are great as apart from a fine from the South African regulator, there could be a perception that the South African banks’ anti-money laundering framework is not as strong as perceived. The South African banking sector is viewed as a first-world sector. A perception that the banking sector has been weakened through cross-border subsidiary bank acquisitions could lead to a loss of international investments, international business or could even be a determining factor in a ratings downgrade to the South African economy. The dissertation was compiled reviewing all applicable legislation of South Africa as well as that countries where banks were acquired as subsidiaries, the letters of approval from the South African Reserve bank together with conditions and duties imposed on the approval, as [...] ...|$|E

We {{argue that the}} transfer of French legislation in the 1830 s provoked a “transplant effect”, which generated serious distortions in Spanish financial markets. As a result, Spain developed a unique system in which official French style stock markets coexisted with Anglo-Saxon style free markets and small traditional markets, reminiscent of the ancien regime. This unique schism of systems reflects the result of multiple natural experiments whereby each region constituted its own stock market system.
