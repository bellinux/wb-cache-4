5|$|Blackburn's {{primary focus}} was on reforms to the state's penal system. According to Blackburn, 953 prisoners were being held at the <b>state</b> <b>penitentiary,</b> {{although}} the structure only contained 780 cells. Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state's prisoners suffered from pneumonia in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the almost one thousand inmates in the <b>state</b> <b>penitentiary</b> was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Martin served {{briefly as}} the {{athletic}} director of the Oklahoma <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary</b> at McAlester, Oklahoma. He died on March 5, 1965, after suffering a heart attack. His wife, Ruby, survived him by over four decades, dying just after her 99th birthday in 2009.|$|E

5|$|You's was {{the first}} and only {{official}} execution ever to take place in Pacific County. A month after his arrest, a new act of the Washington State Legislature took effect which required executions for any future crimes to be carried out at the Washington <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary</b> in Walla Walla.|$|E
5|$|Knott's major {{shortcomings}} were in deterring crime. Despite the feuds {{that continued}} to rage in the state, {{including one that}} lasted several years in Rowan County, Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem. Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally. The legislature approved {{the construction of the}} Kentucky <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary</b> at Eddyville, but it was Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn, who laid most of the groundwork for this project.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{were not}} allowed the luxury of sound stages; thus, they had to find {{abandoned}} buildings or landmarks to use. The exteriors of the climactic airport scene were shot at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport, while the interior scenes were shot at the Pennsylvania Convention Center (formerly, Reading Terminal). Filming at the psychiatric hospital was done at the Eastern <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary.</b>|$|E

Lawson. Copperfield, located on the Snake River in Baker County, had grown up around construction projects for a railroad tunnel and power plant. Fifteen-hundred jobs in the area came from the railway project of E. H. Harriman or the power generation facility.|$|E

Mahone continues to pursue Michael and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), {{who are able to}} avoid him on several occasions. While investigating a car explosion Mahone is shown to have a drug problem, swallowing pills concealed in a pen.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{became a}} dentist after {{retiring}} from football.

His jersey number 20 was retired by LSU football in 1960, and he was inducted into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1975, the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1976, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Lucretia and James Mott visited {{central and}} western New York {{in the summer}} of 1848 for a number of reasons, {{including}} visiting the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation and former slaves living in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the Hicksite Quakers. They also visited Lucretia's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn, NY, where Mott also preached to prisoners at the Auburn <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary.</b> Lucretia Mott's skill and fame as an orator drew crowds wherever she went.|$|E
5|$|Marvin {{spent five}} months {{scouting}} prisons across the United States and Canada, {{looking for a}} site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio {{to serve as the}} fictional Shawshank <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary</b> in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.|$|E

5|$|Prison Break {{maintains}} an ensemble cast for each season {{along with many}} recurring guest stars. The first season features a cast of ten actors who receive star billing, who were based in Chicago or at Fox River <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary.</b> The second season features a cast of nine actors who receive billing; three characters are downgraded from series regular to recurring status, another is upgraded, and a new character is introduced. The third season introduces four new characters; two of whom are prisoners at Penitenciaría Federal de Sona.|$|E
5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary</b> in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, {{reaching}} it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the <b>state</b> <b>penitentiary.</b> Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} of the <b>state</b> <b>penitentiary,</b> {{which had been}} damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|From August 29 to September 1, 2013, {{a series}} of events were held in Mansfield, Ohio, to {{celebrate}} the 20th anniversary of the film. The events included a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, where it originally premiered, tours of some of the filming locations, and a cocktail at the Ohio State Reformatory which served as Shawshank <b>State</b> <b>Penitentiary</b> for the film. The cocktail party was attended by Gunton, Scott Mann and James Kisicki, who signed autographs and shared stories with the fans. Darabont sent a video greeting the fans who celebrated the anniversary. More than 6,000 fans of the film attended these events.|$|E
5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, {{to be used as}} the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the <b>state</b> <b>penitentiary.</b> Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E
