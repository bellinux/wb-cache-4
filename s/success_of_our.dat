2500|$|On April 28, 1967, Westmoreland {{addressed}} {{a joint session}} of Congress. [...] "In evaluating the enemy strategy," [...] he said, [...] "it is evident to me that he believes our Achilles heel is our resolve. ... Your continued strong support is vital to the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> mission. ... Backed at home by resolve, confidence, patience, determination, and continued support, we will prevail in Vietnam over the communist aggressor!" [...] Westmoreland claimed that under his leadership, United States forces [...] "won every battle". The turning point of the war was the 1968 Tet Offensive, in which communist forces attacked cities and towns throughout South Vietnam. At the time, Westmoreland was focused on the Battle of Khe Sanh and considered the Tet Offensive to be a diversionary attack. It is not clear if Khe Sanh was meant to be distraction for the Tet Offensive or vice versa; sometimes this is called the Riddle of Khe Sanh. Regardless, U.S. and South Vietnamese troops successfully fought off the attacks during the Tet Offensive, and the communist forces took heavy losses, but the ferocity of the assault shook public confidence in Westmoreland's previous assurances {{about the state of the}} war. Political debate and public opinion led the Johnson administration to limit further increases in U.S. troop numbers in Vietnam. Nine months afterward, when the My Lai Massacre reports started to break, Westmoreland resisted pressure from the incoming Nixon administration for a cover-up, and pressed for a full and impartial investigation by Lieutenant General William R. Peers. However, a few days after the tragedy, he had praised the same involved unit on the [...] "outstanding job", for the [...] "U.S. infantrymen had killed 128 Communists [...] in a bloody day-long battle". Post 1969 Westmoreland also made efforts to investigate the Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất massacre a year after the event occurred.|$|E

Without affecting the basic design, the shield was divided into four with the coats of arms of Castille, León, Aragon and Navarre, plus the «enté en point» of Granada.

40|$|We study {{monetary}} and exchange-rate policies around successful and unsuccessful fiscal adjustments {{and find that}} successful adjustments are preceded by large nominal exchange rate depreciations, whereas unsuccessful adjustments are preceded by appreciations.

Monetary policy does not affect the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> fiscal adjustments. This result is confirmed when the sample is divided into countries that follow a fixed exchange rate policy and those that do not: for both cases it is exchange rate depreciations that affect the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>success.</b> <b>Our</b> results suggest that the adoption of a single currency will make successful fiscal adjustments more difficult to attain within EMU.
