500|$|TV Fanatic {{said the}} episode {{was not as}} strong as {{previous}} seasons, but an improvement over [...] "Sexual Healing". The site praised the emphasis on Butters and the pop culture references to The Catcher in the Rye, John Lennon, <b>Sarah</b> <b>Jessica</b> <b>Parker</b> and [...] "the useless Kardashian Klan". The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said he [...] "chuckled a few times", but found the vomit jokes acted like a substitute for [...] "actual dialogue". However, O'Neal praised the satire of people looking too deeply into the meaning of meaningless art, and how easily that theme can be applied to South Park itself. Not all reviews were entirely positive. Ramsey Isler of IGN said Butters was [...] "awesome, as usual", and thought the jokes about the Kardashians were funny, but that the positive elements of the episode were [...] "not enough to balance out the failures". He particularly criticized the <b>Sarah</b> <b>Jessica</b> <b>Parker</b> jokes as [...] "flat and random", and the constant vomiting as [...] "just one long-running 'joke' that was just plain awful".|$|E

[...] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was unimpressed, referring to Beckinsale as [...] "the reigning queen of the bland B's." [...] The film was profitable, grossing $35million worldwide from a production budget of $19 million.|$|E
