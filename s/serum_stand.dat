40|$|Introduction:Many {{items are}} needed for {{dressing}} including sterile dressing set, antiseptic and washing solutions, leucoplast tape, waste bin for infectious garbage, waste bin for noninfectious garbage, safe disposal trash for sharp cutting instruments, bedpan and sometimes drugs. All the items are laid out on a simple wheeled trolley. The multiplicity of items together with problems in placing tools on trolley, forgetting some items, disturbing sterile condition, falling and damaging equipment {{and the need for}} at least two people for each procedure, all are the reasons to design and develop Automatic Trolley for Washing and Dressing the Wounds. Material and Method: To develop a mobile unit which meets our needs for dressing, the trolley patents registered in America and different companies were evaluated as well as the materials and methods used while dressing were considered. Results: Automatic Trolley for Washing and Dressing the Wounds was designed and developed. It comprises the followings: drawer, waste bin for infectious garbage, waste bin for noninfectious garbage, shelves for serum and betadine solution, <b>serum</b> <b>stand,</b> peristaltic pump, flexible tube for connecting serum, a place for bedpan, foot pedal for serum flow, two eye-sensor chambers for solution betadine and scrub, an auxiliary work surface. Conclusion: Due to the usual requirements for dressing, we have designed an equipped mobile unit which covers all the objectives of dressing and increases the speed of procedure. Moreover, due to the contrived equipment on the trolley, procedures are done quickly and second person is not required to assist. Automatic Trolley for Washing and Dressing the Wounds is made up of stainless steel which could be mass housing and commercializing which would play a deserving role in improving the fundamentals of health care and wound treatment. ...|$|E

40|$|Immunoglobulin G (IgG) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} proteins present in human serum and a fundamental component of the immune system. IgG 3 represents ∼ 8 % of the total amount of IgG in human <b>serum</b> and <b>stands</b> out from the other IgG subclasses because of its elongated hinge region and enhanced effector functions. This study reports partial O-glycosylation of the IgG 3 hinge region, observed with nanoLC-ESI-IT-MS(/MS) analysis after proteolytic digestion. The repeat regions within the IgG 3 hinge were found to be in part O-glycosylated at the threonine in the triple repeat motif. Non-, mono- and disialylated core 1 -type O-glycans were detected in various IgG 3 samples, both poly- and monoclonal. NanoLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS with electron transfer dissociation fragmentation and CE-MS/MS with CID fragmentation were used to determine the site of IgG 3 O-glycosylation. The O-glycosylation site was further confirmed by the recombinant production of mutant IgG 3 in which potential O-glycosylation sites had been knocked out. For IgG 3 samples from six donors we found similar O-glycan structures and site occupancies, whereas for the same samples the conserved N-glycosylation of the Fc CH 2 domain showed considerable interindividual variation. The occupancy of each of the three O-glycosylation sites was found to be ∼ 10 % in six serum-derived IgG 3 samples and ∼ 13 % in two monoclonal IgG 3 allotype...|$|R
40|$|Sera and ascites were {{gained from}} 72 cases of gastric canser and their protein {{fractions}} were estimated. The relationship {{between them and}} the grade of metastasis which settled during laparotomy was studied. 1) The protein fraction of serum in gastric cancer patients treated in surgery clinic showed no significant difference from that of normal ones. Albumin decreased its density and ratio as metastasis proceeded. γ- and β-globulin showed an increasing tendency with the proceeding of metastasis. The former increased markedly with the proceeding of peritoneal metastasis. The γ/A ratio showed the proceeding of gastric cancer most strikely. 2) The protein fractions of ascites increased and decreased in proportion to that of <b>serum.</b> Albumin <b>stood</b> always about 10 % higher than serum. γ-globulin increased with the proceeding of peritoneal metasis, while γ-globulin decreased if the metastasis advanced. In the ascites the A/G ratio never reversed. 3) The most permeable fraction was albumin and it descended in the order of γ-, β- and γ- globulin. In the advanced peritoneal metastasis, and γ-globulin were very permeable. 4) Cases in which liver metastasis was found showed high protein, low albumin and high γ-globulin. In ascites it was also similar. 5) In patient with gastric cancer, peritoneal metastasis played the leading part in fluctuation of protein fractions. There {{was no significant difference between}} lymphnodes and infilatration on the serosa of stomach and protein fractions...|$|R
40|$|O vírus linfotrópico de células T humanas do tipo I (HTLV-I) pode causar uma doença neurológica inflamatória, crônica e incapacitante, que acomete a medula espinhal, denominada mielopatia associada ao HTLV-I/paraparesia espástica {{tropical}} (PET/MAH). A verificação de anticorpos da classe G (IgG) anti-HTLV-I no soro e no líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR) representa importante parâmetro para o diagnóstico laboratorial da PET/MAH. OBJETIVO: Avaliação crítica dos métodos utilizados para verificação da presença e da produção intratecal de anticorpos totais e anti-HTLV-I no LCR para o diagnóstico de PET/MAH. MÉTODO: Realizou-se uma revisão sistemática de artigos da literatura médica, usando-se palavras-chave da língua inglesa como cerebrospinal fluid, intrathecal {{synthesis of}} antibodies, HTLV-I, HAM/TSP. As bases de dados utilizadas incluíram Pubmed, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (Lilacs), MEDlars onLINE (Medline) e Cochrane Library. RESULTADO: Foram selecionados 14 artigos: cinco relacionados com a presença do anticorpo IgG específico no LCR; nove sobre síntese intratecal de anticorpos totais (IgG ou IgG/IgA/IgM) e específicos anti-HTLV-I (IgG ou IgM). DISCUSSÃO: O estudo isolado da presença de anticorpo IgG anti-HTLV-I no LCR não discrimina a fração produzida no sistema nervoso central (SNC), possui baixa especificidade (40 %) para o diagnóstico de PET/MAH. A demonstração da síntese intratecal de anticorpos IgG anti-HTLV-I possui maior relevância por suas elevadas especificidade (89 %) e sensibilidade (83 %). Entre os métodos para a avaliação da síntese intratecal de anticorpo específico, destaca-se o índice de IgG anti-HTLV-I, segundo Reiber e Felgenhauer(18), o qual se baseia no teste do ensaio imunossorvente ligado à enzima (ELISA), com análise simultânea do LCR e do soro. Outros estudos utilizam pequenas amostragens e não demonstram sensibilidade e especificidade no teste do LCR. Apenas um trabalho possui análise estatística. CONCLUSÃO: Existe a necessidade da padronização de métodos para o diagnóstico imunológico do LCR na PET/MAH, com base em testes de elevadas sensibilidade e especificidade. The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) may cause HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), an incapacitating chronic inflammatory {{disease of the}} spinal cord. The detection of IgG anti-HTLV-I antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{has been an important}} parameter for the laboratorial diagnosis of HAM/TSP. OBJECTIVE: critical evaluation of the methods applied to detect the presence and intrathecal production of total antibodies and anti-HTLV-I in the CSF for the diagnosis of HAM/TSP. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of medical articles by using the key words: "cerebrospinal fluid, intrathecal synthesis of antibodies, HTLV-I associated myelopathy, HTLV-I, HAM/TSP". The used databases included: PubMed, Lilacs, Medline and Cochrane Library. RESULTS: A total of 14 articles were selected: five studies were related to the presence of specific IgG antibody in the CSF and nine studied the intrathecal synthesis of total antibodies (IgG or IgG/IgA/IgM) and specific anti-HTLV-I (IgG or IgM). DISCUSSION: The isolated study of the presence of IgG antibody anti-HTLV-I in the CSF does not show the fraction produced in the central nervous system, which represents low specificity (40 %) for the diagnosis of HAM/TSP. The demonstration of the intrathecal synthesis of IgG anti-HTLV-I antibodies is more relevant due to its high specificity (89 %) and sensibility (83 %). According to Reiber & Felgenhauer (1987), the index IgG anti-HTLV-I, which is based on ELISA test with simultaneous CSF and <b>serum</b> analysis, <b>stands</b> out from the other methods applied to evaluate the intrathecal synthesis of specific antibody. Other studies use small samples and do not demonstrate the sensibility and specificity of the test in the CSF. Only one study shows statistical analysis. CONCLUSION: The immunological diagnosis of the CSF in HAM/TSP requires the standardization of methods, which should be based on tests of high sensibility and specificity...|$|R
