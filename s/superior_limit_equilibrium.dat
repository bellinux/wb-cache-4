All {{of them are}} based on <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> when the foundation starting to failure by applying maximum load.

50|$|In mathematics, {{the limit}} {{inferior}} and <b>limit</b> <b>superior</b> of a sequence {{can be thought}} of as limiting (i.e., eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence.

40|$|During {{the spring}} of 2003, the {{downstream}} slope of an embankment dam began to move during an extreme flooding event. The current study was implemented to evaluate the slope stability of the embankment and as a case-study to compare the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and continuum modeling methods. Initially, stability analyses were performed using conservative shear strength of soils estimated from both boring log data and an infinite slope back analysis. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was employed in the computer simulations. The computer program UTEXAS 4 and Spencer method of solution {{was used to evaluate}} the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> factors of safety and the critical failure surface. The computer program FLAC 4. 0 was used to evaluate the stress/strain behavior of the slope and determine factors of safety using the strength reduction method. Both these <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and continuum models yielded slip surfaces that were close in geometry and location to the actual slip surface observed in the field. The factor of safety for the pre-failure embankment geometry was lower utilizing the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> approach than that estimated by the continuum approach; however, the continuum approach appeared to yield more accurate results when using the best estimate of the shear strength. Back-analyses performed based on the observed failure surface in the field after flooding event provided estimates of shear strength of the embankment soil. The back calculated shear strength utilizing the continuum model fell within acceptable ranges as determined from the boring log data, with the continuum model yielding the more conservative (lower) back calculated shear strength. Back calculated shear strength using the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> method was higher and its use may result in unconservative designs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{observation}} of 12 rock fall scars in steep limestone cliffs {{has shown that}} the fallen masses were stable as a result of relatively small rock bridges. These results demonstrate that consideration of rock bridges is necessary for a realistic evaluation of stability. <b>Limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> methods of analysis are presented for sliding and toppling, for both isostatic and hyperstatic conditions. These methods are illustrated with four case histories. The results of nine back-analyses of rock falls with volumes between 24 and 3500 m 3 are presented. The rock cohesion obtained from back-analysis appears to be significantly lower than the cohesion obtained from classical laboratory tests. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors including: a spatial and temporal scale effect, the oversimplified modelling (two-dimensional <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium)</b> and some uncertainties affecting the geometrical data.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} types of {{strength}} calculations is the calculation of <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of constructions. This report describes new method for solving the problem of <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The rigid-plastic system in this method is substituted with an «equivalent» elastic system with specially constructed rigidities. This {{is why it is}} called the method of pseudorigidities. An iteration algorithm was developed for finding pseudorigidities. This algorithm is realized in a special software procedure. Conjunction of this procedure with any elastic calculation program (base program) creates a program solving rigid-plastic problems. It is proved, that iterations will be converge to the solution for the problem of <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The solution of tests show, that pseudorigidity method is universal.
