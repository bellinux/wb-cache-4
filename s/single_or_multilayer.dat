40|$|This article briefly {{describes}} two {{recently developed}} soft-lithographic techniques {{that can be}} used to fabricate complex, well-defined three-dimensional (3 D) nanostructures. The first relies on the <b>single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> transfer of thin solid 'ink' coatings from high-resolution rubber stamps. The second uses these stamps as conformable phase masks for proximity field nanopatterning of thin layers of transparent photopolymers. Although both techniques use the same pattern-transfer elements, they rely on completely different physical principles and they provide complementary patterning capabilities. The operational simplicity of the techniques, their ability to pattern large areas quickly, and the flexibility in the geometry of structures that can be formed with them suggest general utility for 3 D nanomanufacturing. close 626...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a study on}} the {{corrosion}} and wear protection of AM 60 B magnesium alloy, by means of multilayer coating, is described. The coating mainly consists of a porous oxide layer MgO, produced by oxidation in microarc regime, and a <b>single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> top coat of SiOx produced by sol-gel technique and deposited by either a dip or spray coating method. The anodic oxidation pretreatment improves the adhesion of the sol-gel layers, which seal the porosity of MgO and improve corrosion protection. Furthermore, the multilayer coating significantly improves AM 60 B wear resistance. Scanning electron microscopy and radiofrequency glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy were used to assess surface morphologies and in depth elemental profiles of the coatings.

The hydrophilic molecules can be encapsulated within the aqueous internal space and the hydrophobic molecules are entrapped within the phospholipid bilayer membranes. To prepare the liposome suitable for therapeutic applications, their size distribution has to be controlled that can be achieved by passing them continuously under elevated pressure through membranes with definite pore size.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mono- or multi-layered coated {{compounds}} {{are powerful}} alternatives of conventional bulk materials, which normally illustrate a restricted surface performance. Nowadays, advanced and complicated techniques are induced in film production devices, leading {{in this way}} {{to the development of}} an extended variety of different coating types. Herewith, soft, hard or super-hard films can be produced in <b>single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> textures, serving in this way demanding applications, which require advanced surface attitude. Taking into account the growing industrial and manufacturing demands, a well-organized contest of characterization processes for such coatings is required. This paper describes the methodology and typical results of a fast, reliable and cost effective quality test, which is based on the Rockwell Cone indentation on planar surfaces of coated compounds. This destructive test, may rigorously exhibit two distinctive properties of the coated compound, i. e. the interfacial adhesion as well as the film brittleness and cohesion. The stress strain field, which occurs during the indentation and the relaxation stages respectively, must be thoroughly considered in order to obtain secure conclusions, regarding the quality of the coating substrate system...|$|E
40|$|Guided-mode {{resonances}} {{arise in}} <b>single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> waveguides where {{one or more}} homogeneous layers are replaced by diffraction gratings (Fig. 1.) The diffractive element enables an electromagnetic wave incident on a waveguide grating to be coupled to the waveguide modes supportable by the structure {{in the absence of}} the modulation (i. e. the difference between the high and low dielectric constants of the grating) at specific values of the wavelength and incident angle. The periodic modulation of the guide makes the structure leaky, preventing sustained propagation of modes in the waveguide and coupling the waves out into the substrate and cover. As the wavelength is varied around resonance a rapid variation in the intensities of the external propagating waves occurs. By selecting a grating period small enough to eliminate the higher-order propagating waves, an increase in the zero-order intensities up to 100 % can result. The pronounced frequency selectivity of guided-mode resonances in dielectric waveguide gratings can be applied to design high-efficiency reflection and transmission filters [1 - 3]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As an {{acoustic}} wave travels in a <b>single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> plate it reflects multiple {{times with the}} plate’s outermost boundaries and any internal interfaces. Due to the coupling between the longitudinal and transverse (shear vertical) waves the number of waves to track, and in turn the number of reflection and transmission calculations, increases exponentially with each internal reflection (or the distance traveled through the plate). By utilizing a ray technique and considering some basic properties of physics, mathematics, acoustics, and computing {{it is possible to}} simplify the process of tracking the acoustic waves, and reduce the number of calculations which determine the multiple reflections in the plate, and the transmissions of leaky waves outside of the plate. This allows the leaky waves to be calculated in a more efficient manner, especially as the distance from the acoustic source increases (or the number of internal reflections increase). By extending the ray to a plane wave (or wave of finite size) and considering the properties of acoustic waves (such as frequency, pulse shapes, and superposition effects) more realistic leaky waves can be calculated.

30|$|ALD {{films have}} been {{demonstrated}} to be effective diffusion barriers for corrosion protection [25 – 29]. The density of Al 2 O 3 ALD films (3.0 – 2.5  g/cm 3, depending on deposition temperature) is at least 1.5 {{times greater than the}} density of nitrocellulose (1.6  g/cm 3, depending on the nitrogen content), creating better barriers that slow the rate of gas diffusion [30, 31]. For applications in cultural heritage, the thickness of a barrier film involves a tradeoff; a thick barrier film results in a long diffusion path for corrosive gases, while thicker films tend to more profoundly affect the optical properties and visual appearance of the film. The visual appearance of the ALD films can be tuned by varying the thickness and refractive index of the ALD film structures used on a substrate [32]. <b>Single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> ALD films consisting of multiple materials or film thicknesses can be deposited with sub-nanometer control over the coating thickness. Optical modeling techniques, adopted from high precision optical coatings for devices like telescopes and spectrometers, can be used to predict, optimize, and minimize surface coloration [33, 34]. This flexibility allows for the creation of nearly invisible ALD films on both coated silver and sterling silver substrates [18].|$|E

The subvertical veins and complex stockwork zones follow the tectonic boundaries of the NNW striking structures, cutting the various gneisses, amphibolites and marbles of the host metamorphic complex. Veins represent regularly-shaped, simple, steeply-dipping mineralized sections of the ore-bearing faults. Apophyses are common, generally joining the main vein in depth. Irregular in shape complex stockwork bodies are represented by sulphide veinlets and impregnations in deeper levels of the deposits and formed in zones with intensive hydrothermal alteration. Complex replacement metasomatic ore bodies are developed at the intersections of the ore-controlling faults with the marbles.

Results of SPM characterization showed that {{at the lower end}} of the growth temperature range, the as-grown films were polygranular with grain size increasing with temperature.

30|$|API- 5 L X-type {{grade steel}} {{is one of}} the most common {{pipeline}} materials in the oil industry. They are usually considered as more cost-effective and safer than any other types of steel. However, such pipelines used for the exploitation and transport of oil and gas are usually buried underground, undersea, or immersed in marine salty water, where they can get severely corroded [4 – 7]. Thus, <b>single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> protective coatings are generally used for external and internal corrosion protection of pipelines in gas/oil transmission and distribution. The key aspects for corrosion protection are adhesion of the coating to the steel surface, and resistance of the coating to permeation of water, oxygen, and/or ions. Hence, fusion-bonded epoxy (FBE) coatings or a combination of FBE with other materials forming multilayers are widely used for corrosion protection of gas/oil pipelines [8 – 10]. Epoxy-based polymers such as FBE are the widely used for gas/oil pipelines because they exhibit high chemical resistance, very low permeability to chloride ions, good mechanical flexibility, strong adhesion to steel, and suitable processing characteristics, leading to improved corrosion protection and operational lifetime of the pipelines. However, epoxy coatings can easily absorb moisture, and the diffusion of absorbed water into the epoxy-steel interface owing to the presence of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in the cured network (epoxy/amine reaction) weakens the interfacial adhesion strength between the epoxy and steel in a corrosive environment, causing system failure [11, 12]. Thus, the improvement of the adhesion at the steel-epoxy interfaces by using organosilanes primers can be considered an important strategy for inhibiting the corrosion mechanisms. Surprisingly, although there have been a few studies on the use of steel that is chemically modified by silanes for improving the adhesion with epoxy coatings [13, 14], no report was found in the consulted literature in which a system composed of steel-primer-FBE was systematically and extensively characterized by considering each individual component and the interfaces between them. Hence, the main goal of this study was to prepare hybrid organic–inorganic FBE coatings using sol–gel chemistry for the functionalization of the steel surfaces to improve the interfacial properties for improved adhesion and protection against corrosion.|$|E

40|$|Boundary layer- and low {{altitude}} clouds over {{open ocean}} and continent {{areas have been}} studied during several field campaigns since mid- 1990 using the French airborne backscatter lidar LEANDRE in conjunction with on-board IR and visible radiometers. LEANDRE is an automatic system, and a modification of the instrumental parameters, when airborne, is computer controlled through an operator keyboard. The vertical range squared lidar signals and instrument status are displayed in real time on two dedicated monitors. The lidar is used either down- or up-looking while the aircraft is flying above or below clouds. A switching of the viewing configuration takes about a minute. The lidar measurements provide a high resolution description of cloud morphology and holes in cloud layers. The flights were conducted during various meteorological conditions on <b>single</b> <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> stratocumulus and cumulus decks. Analysis on a single shot basis of cloud top (or bottom) altitude and a plot of the corresponding histogram allows one to determine a probability density function (PDF). The preliminary results show the PDFs for cloud top are not Gaussian and symmetric about the mean value. The skewness varies with atmospheric conditions. An example of results recorded over the Atlantic ocean near Biarritz is displayed, showing: (1) the range squared lidar signals {{as a function of}} time (here 100 s corresponds to about 8 km, 60 shots are averaged on horizontal); the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) - up to 600 m - is observed {{at the beginning of the}} leg as well as on surface returns, giving an indication of the porosity; (2) the cloud top altitude variation between 2. 4 to 2. 8 km during the 150 to 320 s section; and (3) the corresponding PDF. Similar results are obtained on stratocumulus over land. Single shot measurements can be used also to determine an optical porosity at a small scale as well as a fractional cloudiness at a larger scale. A comparison of cloud top altitude retrieved from lidar and narrowbeam IR radiometer is conducted to study the scale integration problem. A good agreement within less than 100 m relies on spatial uniformity and an optically thick layer. In the presence of holes, a discrepancy is observed. This is illustrated in figure 2, displaying as a function of time (1) the lidar signals; (2) the target temperature (either clouds or sea surface) retreived from a narrowbeam IR radiometer, 17 C is the sea surface temperature on that day; and (3) the visible flux, linked to cloud albedo, measured by a pyranometer.

40|$|Abstract. Carbon {{in dense}} {{as well as}} porous solid form is used {{in a variety of}} applications. Activated porous carbons are made through {{pyrolysis}} and activation of carbonaceous natural as well as synthetic precursors. Pyrolysed woods replicate the structure of original wood but as such possess very low surface areas and poor adsorption capacities. On activation, these exhibit increased adsorption volumes of 05 – 08 cm 3 =gm and surface areas of 700 – 1800 m 2 =gm depending on activation conditions, whether physical or chemical. Former carbons possess mixed pore size distribution while chemically activated carbons predominantly possess micropores. Thus, these carbons can be used for adsorption of wide distributions of molecules from gas to liquid. The molecular adsorption within the pores is due to <b>single</b> layer <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> molecule deposition at the pore walls and hence results in different types of adsorption isotherm. On the other hand, activated carbon fibres with con-trolled microporous structure and surface area in the range of 2500 m 2 =gm can be developed by controlled pyrolysis and physical activation of amorphous carbon fibres. Active carbon fibres with unmatchable pore structure and surface character-istics are present and futuristic porous materials for a number of applications from pollution control to energy storage...|$|R
40|$|The photon {{absorption}} in Si quantum dots (QDs) embedded in SiO 2 has been systematically investigated by varying several {{parameters of the}} QD synthesis. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or magnetron cosputtering (MS) {{have been used to}} deposit, upon quartz substrates, <b>single</b> layer, <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> structures of Si-rich- SiO 2 (SRO) with different Si content (43 - 46 at. %). SRO samples have been annealed for 1 h in the 450 - 1250 °C range and characterized by optical absorption measurements, photoluminescence analysis, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and x-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. After annealing up to 900 °C SRO films grown by MS show a higher absorption coefficient and a lower optical bandgap (∼ 2. 0 eV) in comparison with that of PECVD samples, due to the lower density of Si-Si bonds and to the presence of nitrogen in PECVD materials. By increasing the Si content a reduction in the optical bandgap has been recorded, pointing out the role of Si-Si bonds density in the absorption process in small amorphous Si QDs. Both the {{photon absorption}} probability and energy threshold in amorphous Si QDs are higher than in bulk amorphous Si, evidencing a quantum confinement effect. For temperatures higher than 900 °C both the materials show an increase in the optical bandgap due to the amorphous-crystalline transition of the Si QDs. Fixed the SRO stoichiometry, no difference in the optical bandgap trend of <b>multilayer</b> <b>or</b> <b>single</b> layer structures is evidenced. These data can be profitably used to better implement Si QDs for future PV technologies. © 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters determining the sensitivity of X-ray telescopes is their effective area {{as a function of the}} X-ray energy. The computation of the effective area of a Wolter-I mirror, with either a <b>single</b> layer <b>or</b> <b>multilayer</b> coating, is a very simple task for a source on-axis at astronomical distance. Indeed, when the source moves off-axis the calculation is more complicated, in particular for new hard X-ray imaging telescopes (NuSTAR, ASTRO-H, NHXM, IXO) beyond 10 keV, that will make use of multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity band in grazing incidence. Unlike traditional single-layer coatings (in Ir <b>or</b> Au), graded <b>multilayer</b> coatings exhibit an oscillating reflectivity as a function of the incidence angle, which makes the effective area not immediately predictable for a source placed off-axis within the field of view. For this reason, the computation of the off-axis effective area has been so far demanded to ray- tracing codes, able to sample the incidence of photons onto the mirror assembly. Even if this approach should not be disdained, it would be interesting to approach the same problem from an analytical viewpoint. This would speed up and simplify the computation of the effective area as a function of the off-axis angle, a considerable advantage especially whenever the mirror parameters are still to be optimized. In this work we present the application of a novel, analytical formalism to the computation of the off-axis effective area and the grasp of the NHXM optical modules, requiring only the standard routines for the multilayer reflectivity computation...|$|R
40|$|First {{results in}} the field of {{synthesis}} and research of the multicomponent (Ti-Zr-Hf-V-Nb) N nanostructured coatings are presented in the paper. Influence of processes of spinodal segregation and mass-transfer on <b>single</b> [...] layered <b>or</b> <b>multilayered</b> crystal boundary (second phase) forming were explored. Superhard nanostructured coatings were investigated before and after annealing at the temperature 600 C using unique methods (slow positron beam, proton microbeam particle induced X-ray emission, Rutherford backscattering-analysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis was performed using DRON- 4 and nanoindentor). Di raction spectra were taken point-by-point, with a scanning step 2 = 0. 05 to 0. 1. We detected that positron trapping by defects was observed on the nanograins boundaries and interfaces (vacancies and nanopores which are the part of triple and larger grain's boundary junction). The 3 D distribution maps of elements obtained by the proton microbeam (particle induced X-ray emission-) together with the results obtained by slow positron microbeam gave us comprehensive information about physical basis of the processes, connected with diffusion and spinodal segregation in superhard coatings.
