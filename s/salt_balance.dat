50|$|The median preoptic nucleus {{is highly}} {{involved}} in three main areas. These include osmoregulation, thermoregulation, and sleep homeostasis. Within each area are many functions. The {{role that the}} median preoptic nucleus plays in osmoregulation is in blood composition and volume, including fluid and <b>salt</b> <b>balance,</b> and produces responses ranging from behavioral to endocrine. Thermoregulation includes both responses to infection and to decreased core temperature upon cutaneous exposure to cold, both of which involve the median preoptic nucleus as an important mediator of sensory input and regulatory output.

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{therapeutic}} strategies for those already {{in an attack}} are maintenance of <b>salt</b> <b>balance</b> by appropriate intravenous fluids and, in some cases, sedation. Having vomited {{for a long period}} prior to attending a hospital, patients are typically severely dehydrated. For a number of patients, potent anti-emetic drugs such as ondansetron (Zofran) or granisetron (Kytril), and dronabinol (Marinol) may be helpful in either preventing an attack, aborting an attack, or reducing the severity of an attack. Lifestyle changes may be recommended, such as extended rest and reduction of stress. [...] Because the symptoms of CVS are similar (or perhaps identical) to those of the disease well-identified as [...] "abdominal migraine", treatment of CVS with a regimen of anti-migraine drugs, such as topiramate and amitriptyline, is showing promise in preventing recurrent attacks.|$|E
