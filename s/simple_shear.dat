25|$|As {{extension}} {{continued in}} the mid to late Jurassic, multiple pull-apart basins and oblique right-lateral strike-slip faulting in the eastern margin of the Exmouth Plateau continued to dominate. The <b>simple</b> <b>shear</b> stress of the Exmouth detachment fault between the base of the upper crust, and the lower crust had been reduced in the east plateau. This reduction in <b>simple</b> <b>shear</b> was in part caused by the deformation that developed series negative flower structures and half-graben systems in the west plateau. By this time, the lithospheric thinning that had been initiated in during the early Jurassic was now considerably thinner. At this period, a magmatic intrusion between the lower crystalline crest and the lithosphere been introduce, underplating this region.|$|E
25|$|Shear zones that {{approximate}} to <b>simple</b> <b>shear</b> typically contain minor asymmetric folds, {{with the}} direction of overturning consistent with the overall shear sense.

25|$|During {{the early}} Jurassic, {{extension}} {{at the west}} Australian margin initiated <b>simple</b> <b>shear</b> mechanics creating a system of listric normal faults near the eastern region of the Exmouth Plateau. These listric faults were a product from {{the development of a}} major low angle detachment fault between a sedimentary base of Permian-Triassic upper crust and the mid-crustal horizon. As a result, brittle deformation and crustal thinning in the upper crust of the eastern Exmouth Plateau occurred, while in the west, the lower crystalline crust and lithosphere experienced shear stress and thinning. The formation of the fault system closer to the coast caused the initial development of the Exmouth, Barrow, and Dampier sub-basins of the Northern Carnarvon Basin. Carbonate marine sediment, primarily marls, continued to be deposited at this time on the central and western portions of the plateau. Closer to the shoreline siliciclastic mud and silt were deposited from marine and deltaic environments.|$|E

40|$|A {{measure of}} the non-coaxiality {{involved}} in progressive deformation histories is proposed {{in the form of}} the kinematical vorticity number, Wk. This number is a {{measure of the}} relative effects of rotation of material lines (relative to the instantaneous stretching axes) and of stretching of these material lines. As such, Wk, is a measure of the instantaneous degree of non-coaxiality. A detailed example is first presented in the form of a progressive <b>simple</b> <b>shearing</b> in which the shear plane rotates relative to an external coodinate system. This is followed by examples of more complicated deformation histories. Three specific types of progressive, isochoric (constant volume) deformation histories are recognized. Those for which 0 ≤ Wk 0 is a special case of these corresponding to a coaxial history. Histories with Wk > 0 are non-coaxial. Those histories with Wk = 1 correspond to progressive <b>simple</b> <b>shearing.</b> Those histories with 1 < Wk < ∞ are pulsating and lines that have been extended may be shortened in future increments...|$|R
40|$|In a z-blade mixer, both shear and extensional {{deformations}} {{contribute to}} the development of dough structure. I effect of <b>simple</b> <b>shearing</b> versus z-blade mixing at similar levels of work input, on the microstructure and uniaxial extensional properties of two doughs prepared from flours of different strengths. With respect to microstructure, mixing initially increased the formation of coarse protein patches, leading to a heterogeneous dough structure with a high fracture stress (¿max) and significant strain hardening. These parameters decreased with prolonged mixing. This was accompanied by loss of glutenin macro polymer (GMP) wet weight and formation of a more homogenous microstructure. Prolonged mixing typically led to an over-mixed state. In contrast, prolonged <b>simple</b> <b>shearing</b> did not affect GMP content or strain hardening and gave enhanced shear banding. Confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that short-term <b>simple</b> <b>shearing</b> induced structure formation in the direction of the shear flow for both flour types, followed by formation of shear-banded gluten structures both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of shear flow. Uniaxial extension of dough oriented parallel or perpendicular to the shear field did not reveal anisotropy. Apparently, the observed heterogeneity on a scale of 'mm' was not relevant for this type of rheology. Nevertheless, a relative weakening of dough strength (reduced fracture stress) was observed as a function of long-term shearing. This seems to be related to a local segregation effect caused by differences in visco-elasticity between the gluten phase and the starch granules. The results of this study reveal important features of the dough processing and underline the importance of not only work input, but also the type of deformation applied...|$|R

The former flow is predicted to produce highly stretched adsorbed molecules due to the prevalence of end‐sticking, following by regular unraveling from one end to the other and laying down of the molecule onto the surface.

40|$|AbstractAn {{improved}} <b>simple</b> third-order <b>shear</b> deformation {{theory for}} the analysis of shear flexible plates is presented in this paper. This new plate theory is composed of three parts: the simple third-order kinematics of displacements reduced from the higher-order displacement field derived previously by the author; a system of 10 th-order differential equilibrium equations in terms of the three generalized displacements of bending plates; five boundary conditions at each edge of plate boundaries. Although the resulting displacement field is the same as that proposed by Murthy, the variational consistent governing equations and the associated proper boundary conditions are derived and identified in this work {{for the first time in}} the literature. The applications and accuracy of the present shear deformation theory of plates are demonstrated by analytically solving the differential governing equations of a twisting plate, a bending beam and two bending plates to which the 3 -D elasticity solutions are available, and excellent agreements are achieved even for the torsion of a plate with square cross-section as well the local effects of stresses at plate boundaries can be characterized accurately. These analytical solutions clearly show that the <b>simple</b> third-order <b>shear</b> deformation theory developed in this work indeed gives better results than the first-order shear deformation theories and other <b>simple</b> higher-order <b>shear</b> deformation theories, since the present third-order shear flexible theory is based on a more rigorous kinematics of displacements and consists of not only a system of variational consistent differential equations, but also a group of consistent boundary conditions associated with the differential equations. The present <b>simple</b> third-order <b>shear</b> deformation theory can easily be applied to the static and dynamic finite element analysis of laminated plates just like the applications of other popular shear flexible plate theories, and improved results could be obtained from the present <b>simple</b> third-order <b>shear</b> deformable theories of plates...|$|R
