5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries fleets had relied on {{two types of}} major warship, the ship {{of the line and}} the frigate. The first major change to these types was the {{introduction}} of steam power for propulsion. While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the <b>screw</b> <b>propeller</b> in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of John Moncure Robinson's {{retirement}} {{as president of the}} company in 1893, the Old Bay Line had upgraded its fleet with propeller-driven, steel-hulled steamers equipped with modern conveniences such as electric lighting and staterooms with private baths. The Georgia introduced in 1887 was the first Old Bay Line boat to have a modern <b>screw</b> <b>propeller</b> instead of old-fashioned side paddlewheels and the Alabama launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old Bay Line as president for 26years (1867–1893), longer than any other person in the company's history.|$|E
40|$|Propulsion {{characteristics}} of wing-in-ground effect propulsors were investigated using a comparative analysis of thrust and powering characteristics between wing-in-ground (WIG) effect thrusters and traditional <b>screw</b> <b>propellers.</b> WIG thrusters {{were found to}} have constant thrust production and efficiency, nearly independent of speed of advance, as contrary to <b>screw</b> <b>propellers,</b> whose optimum efficiency occurs at only one speed point. To produce the same amount of thrust as equivalent <b>screw</b> <b>propellers,</b> WIG thrusters have to work under heavily loaded operating conditions. WIG thrusters were also found to produce a relatively lower but nearly constant efficiency and thrust, independent of speed. Another distinguishing propulsion characteristic revealed for WIG thrusters is that they are capable of operating at much higher speeds, in a range of three to six times that of <b>screw</b> <b>propellers</b> of the same size. While the speed range of <b>screw</b> <b>propellers</b> is mainly limited by their geometric pitch, the speed range of WIG thrusters has no speed limit in ideal fluid. In reality, the speed range is only limited by viscous drag and cavitation, or compressibility, in water or air, respectively. This suggests a potential for WIG thrusters of higher speed application than <b>screw</b> <b>propellers.</b> An experimental investigation and validation of the propulsion system is warrantedPeer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|There the {{connections}} between the implantation modes, the microhardness values and the corrosion-fatigue characteristics of main materials of <b>screw</b> <b>propellers</b> have been ascertained. The opportunity to apply the ion implantation for rise of corrosion-fatigue strength of <b>screw</b> <b>propellers</b> has been substantiated by science. The computing-economic technique of determination of process modes has been offered, the equipment has been chosen, the inspection manners of ion hardening process of small-sized propellers have been formed.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of modern computer-aided design system (CAD system) of <b>screw</b> <b>propellers</b> {{is given in}} the paper.

The application technique of CAD systems is developed, allowing to design three-dimensional parametrical models of the blade of compound <b>screw</b> <b>propellers</b> and the drawing documentation {{to it in the}} environment "COMPASS", and also to develop the managing program for the machine tool with programmed numerical control (in the environment of personal computer GeMMa).

5|$|SS Great Britain is {{a museum}} ship and former {{passenger}} steamship, which was advanced for her time. She {{was the longest}} passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Steamship Company's transatlantic service between Bristol and New York. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a <b>screw</b> <b>propeller,</b> Great Britain {{was the first to}} combine these features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic, which she did in 1845, in the time of 14 days.|$|E

25|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>propeller</b> {{was tested}} on Lake Ontario in 1841 before being used on ocean ships. Propellers began being used on Great Lakes ships in 1845. Propellers caused {{vibrations}} which were {{a problem for}} wooden ships. The SS Great Britain, launched in 1845, was the first iron ship with a <b>screw</b> <b>propeller.</b> Iron ships became common and more efficient multiple expansion engines were developed. After the introduction of iron ships, Britain became the leading shipbuilding country. The U.S. tried to compete by building wooden clipper ships, which were fast, but too narrow to carry economic volumes of low value freight.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{adoption}} of the <b>screw</b> <b>propeller</b> was an historical inevitability given the work of John Ericsson and others, Archimedes considerably hastened acceptance of the technology. The Dover trials, carried out in April–May 1840, persuaded the Royal Navy to build a 900-ton steam sloop-of-war, , which was trialled from 1843-45 against HMS Alecto, a sister ship fitted with paddle propulsion. As a result of these trials, the Navy adopted the <b>screw</b> <b>propeller</b> as its preferred propulsion method. By 1855, 174 ships of the Royal Navy had been fitted with screw propulsion, including 52 ships-of-the-line, 23 frigates, 17 corvettes, 55 sloops, and various other vessels.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the source, {{the vessels}} of the Pawtuxet class were each powered by either one double- or two single-cylinder {{oscillating}} engines; {{the distinction is}} probably semantic. The engine (or engines) operated a single 8-foot diameter <b>screw</b> <b>propeller.</b> The only available machinery specifications are for the cutter Kankakee, but specifications for the others were probably similar if not identical. The oscillating cylinders for Kankakee had a 36 inch bore, 30-inch stroke and 10-inch steam cut-off. Steam, at a pressure of about 22 psi, was supplied by a single tubular boiler.
