Gotye himself is an {{engaging}} character for sure... his solemnly expressive eyes finish a journey his lyrics only begin. 'Told myself that you were right for me but felt <b>so</b> <b>lonely</b> in your company' – simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the title line when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality: 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice. Oh, and Kimbra... my poor heart..." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1925, the spectre of {{deportation}} loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named James Colton {{offered to}} marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: [...] "I am awfully tired and <b>so</b> <b>lonely</b> and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling {{to come back here}} from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive." [...] She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were [...] "awful," [...] and she never finished her second book on the subject.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{grandeur}} of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5October that [...] "I feel <b>so</b> <b>lonely,</b> {{it is impossible for}} me to be happy" [...] and complaining of [...] "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" [...] which he considered [...] "such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|E

Never had she felt <b>so</b> pitiably <b>lonely,</b> <b>so</b> bitterly in want of comfort and of sympathy.

2500|$|Roma {{is furious}} at Williamson, who has blown a big sale. Levene picks up where Roma left off, and begins {{insulting}} Williamson. Mid-rant, Levene accidentally reveals his knowledge that Williamson {{made up the}} claim about the check being cashed, information {{he could not have}} known unless he had been in Williamson's office. Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just like talking to salesmen because they're <b>so</b> <b>lonely.</b> Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. The door opens and the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him into the back room.|$|E
2500|$|Gord {{has worked}} in his watch tower for more than {{eighteen}} years without a paycheck and claims {{to have been a}} forest ranger his entire life. His apparent reason for becoming a ranger was that he thought Smokey Bear was talking directly to him in one of his famous public service announcements ("Only you can prevent forest fires"). He frequently breaks out in tears during Red's visits as he talks about how lonely he is and/or how much of a sacrifice he makes at his job. During one visit, Gord claimed to have gotten <b>so</b> <b>lonely</b> that he ate the watch tower and then later moved on to another tower in season 7. Gord sometimes laments his lack of recognition. Once, he thought that someone had left him some honorary medallions only to learn from Red that they were beer bottle caps (Gord thought that a Budweiser cap was for being a [...] "bud of the forest"). On another occasion, Gord justified his lack of communication with his superiors as a sign that he was doing a [...] "good job protecting the forest," [...] to which Red suggested that his superiors most likely forgot about him. In truth, it turned out that he had been dismissed many years ago, but the message had never reached him.|$|E

2500|$|Actress Eliza Dushku {{describes}} Faith as the [...] "working class" [...] Slayer, {{a reason}} she feels {{so many people}} identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's <b>so</b> <b>lonely</b> and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E
