40|$|The {{concentration}} of hydrogen peroxide {{is an important}} parameter in the azo dyes decoloration process through the utilization of advanced oxidizing processes, particularly by oxidizing via UV/H 2 O 2. It is pointed out that, from a specific concentration, the hydrogen peroxide works as a hydroxyl radical <b>self-consumer</b> and thus a decrease of the system`s oxidizing power happens. The determination of the process critical point (maximum amount of hydrogen peroxide to be added) was performed through a ""thorough mapping"" or discretization of the target region, founded on the maximization of an objective function objective (constant of reaction kinetics of pseudo-first order). The discretization of the operational region occurred through a feedforward backpropagation neural model. The neural model obtained presented remarkable coefficient of correlation between real and predicted values for the absorbance variable, above 0. 98. In the present work, the neural model had, as phenomenological basis the Acid Brown 75 dye decoloration process. The hydrogen peroxide addition critical point, represented by a value of mass relation (F) between the hydrogen peroxide mass and the dye mass, {{was established in the}} interval 50 < F < 60.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the impact of independent and interdependent self-construal on consumers in a retail setting. To achieve this, the participants are compared under two parameters: (1) their preferred amount of contact with sales associates and (2) whether they prefer to make decisions independently or by consulting others. This research employs samples of two homogenous groups of college students in the United States. A version of the experiment {{will be given to}} each of the two groups asking them to imagine shopping for either a high self-identity product (e. g. music CD) or a low self-identity product (e. g. power tools). The survey instrument is designed to evaluate their self-construal in relation to: their preferences for minimizing contact with sales associates, preferences to keep retail sales people in close distance, preferences for making purchase decisions independently, and preferences for consulting others on decision making. The results of this study are expected to indicate that consumers with independent self-construal prefer to minimize contact with sales associates more so than consumers with interdependent self-perspectives. These results would most likely imply that independent <b>self-consumers</b> prefer to make decisions independently while interdependent <b>self-consumers,</b> who would presumably prefer to consult others, prefer to have sales associates nearby in retail stores. The limitations of these results and possibilities for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of solar power technology and inverter technology and {{the reduction of the}} prices for PV installations, the number of <b>self-consumers</b> or prosumers connected to the distribution network is increasing. The distributed renewable generation has been connected to the grid but not integrated into it properly and the impacts of the interconnected distributed resources need to be studied and measure {{in order to maintain the}} power supply within its power quality, security and economical limits. In order to integrate successfully the distributed generation into the grid, advanced in the regulations, interconnection rules, communications and standards as well as a new method for distribution network planning are needed. The different potential benefits and costs of distributed generation have been revised and the requirements stablished by the main different national regulations and international standards have been compared in this project...|$|R
