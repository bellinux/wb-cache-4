5|$|As planned, the {{exposition}} {{left behind}} a fairground and numerous public buildings and public works; <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> it with revitalizing Seattle's economic and cultural life (see History of Seattle since 1940). The fair saw {{the construction of the}} Space Needle and Alweg monorail, as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now KeyArena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the Cornish Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{tenure in}} Dalian {{was marked by}} the city's phenomenal {{transformation}} from a drab port city to a modern metropolis, a 'showcase' of China's rapid economic growth. In the early 1990s, Bo took <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> {{for the construction of}} the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway, China's first controlled-access freeway, winning accolades for the rapid expansion of infrastructure and for environmental work. Since Bo's time in office, Dalian became {{known as one of the}} cleanest cities in China, having won the UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award in 1999. In addition, Bo was an advocate for free enterprise and small businesses, and successfully courted foreign investment from South Korea, Japan, and Western countries. In contrast to his colleagues, he held press conferences at Chinese New Year, and developed a reputation among foreign investors for 'getting things done'.|$|E

5|$|Operation Kugown was {{the name}} given to the {{psychological}} warfare operation that had played {{an important part in}} the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the Comite, so that the local agency could receive <b>some</b> <b>credit.</b> The Comite also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad ("Later We Discover the Truth"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{disagree}} about who initiated {{the idea of}} organizing a national assembly. <b>Some</b> <b>credit</b> Jonas Basanavičius, while others argue for Jonas Kriaučiūnas. The organizational activities were largely taken on by the Lithuanian Christian Democrats and by Vilniaus žinios, a moderate newspaper owned by Petras Vileišis. Vilniaus žinios was the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper to appear after the Lithuanian press ban was lifted on May 7, 1904; it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6,000 copies. On October 31 (October 18 O.S.), 1905 a fifteen-member organizational committee, chairman Jonas Basanavičius and secretary Jonas Kriaučiūnas, was given the task of convening the assembly. They published an appeal or a manifest to the Lithuanian people on November 11 (October 29 O.S.) in Vilniaus žinios. The appeal, signed by the chairman and the secretary, aroused much interest in the public. Invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts, and to all other educated people interested {{in the future of}} the Lithuanian state. At the end of the appeal there was an eight-point agenda to be discussed at the Seimas. It did not include the question of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E

25|$|In February, 2010, Hayworth {{announced}} that he was indeed running against McCain. By mid March, Rasmussen reported only 7 points separating the two. <b>Some</b> <b>credit</b> was given to other McCain challengers' dropping out, thereby allowing Hayworth to pick up their support.|$|E
25|$|A {{credit card}} knife {{is a very}} thin knife that is the shape and size of a credit card. It is {{designed}} to be carried in the wallet along with regular credit cards. <b>Some</b> <b>credit</b> card knives can contain other small tools, such as tweezers, or toothpicks.|$|E
25|$|His {{other major}} innings was 115 against England in 1951/52. When India lost disastrously in England in 1952, {{he was one}} of the few players to come out with <b>some</b> <b>credit.</b> At Headingley where India lost the first four wickets before scoring a run, Phadkar and Hazare added 105 for the sixth wicket.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of tax credits may reduce income tax at {{the federal and state}} levels. <b>Some</b> <b>credits</b> are {{available}} only to individuals, such as the child tax credit for each dependent child, American Opportunity Tax Credit for education expenses, or the Earned Income Tax Credit for low income wage earners. <b>Some</b> <b>credits,</b> such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, are available to businesses, including various special industry incentives. A few credits, such as the foreign tax credit, are available to all types of taxpayers.|$|R

25|$|Some {{members of}} Congress {{have tried to}} create a federal usury statute that would limit the maximum {{allowable}} interest rate, but the measures have not progressed.

The act provides for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> practices but has no interest rate limit.|$|E
25|$|Usually, if a {{cardholder}} is late {{paying the}} balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred {{depend on the}} grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period {{if there is any}} outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} innings at Headingley, Panesar picked up three wickets {{including}} that of Inzamam-ul-Haq, who overbalanced and dislodged the bails with his stomach to be dismissed hit wicket. In the second innings Panesar had figures of 3 for 39. Panesar was given <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> for responding to criticism from England coach Duncan Fletcher. Despite his performances in the Test arena against Pakistan {{in the summer of}} 2006, Panesar was overlooked for the 30 man ODI squad for the 2006 ICC Champion's Trophy in India.|$|E

25|$|March 2006 saw Scotland {{embark on}} a {{pre-season}} tour to Barbados. They performed with <b>some</b> <b>credit,</b> although they only won one of their 6 games, against a Barbados XI. They owed much of their success to Dougie Brown, who re-qualified to represent Scotland internationally in 2004. They competed in the C & G Trophy in English domestic cricket {{in the early part}} of the 2006 English cricket season. They performed better than expected, winning three of their nine games, and finishing eighth in the Northern conference.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 the Netherlands {{hosted the}} ICC Trophy, {{the first such}} tournament outside England, and again {{finished}} runners-up to Zimbabwe. In 1991 they achieved a five-wicket win over a West Indies XI, followed in 1993 by a seven-wicket win over an England XI and in 1994 a nine-wicket win over a South Africa XI. In 1994 the Dutch finally qualified for the World Cup, after finishing third in that year's ICC Trophy. In the World Cup itself in 1996, they were eliminated in the first round, but performed with <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> in their game against England.|$|E
25|$|India liberalised its FDI {{policy in}} 2005, {{allowing}} up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated {{easy access to}} foreign technology and investment. The upward growth curve of the real-estate sector owes <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> to a booming economy and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100% FDI in the construction sector, including built-up infrastructure and construction development projects comprising housing, commercial premises, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2014, India extended these reforms to defence, telecom, oil, retail, aviation, and other sectors.|$|E

25|$|North Hobart won the toss kicked to {{the eastern}} end of the ground. With the aid of a {{westerly}} wind, North Hobart was the dominant team in general play. The Robins managed eleven scoring shots to Wynyard's two, but led by only 19 points at quarter time, 3.8 (26) to 1.1 (7). <b>Some</b> <b>credit</b> for North Hobart's inaccuracy in front of goal is given to strong defensive work by Wynyard's Phillip Dell and David Cox. John Devine was instrumental as ruck-rover around the ground. Late in the quarter, the Cats finally managed a goal against the wind, courtesy of a downfield free kick to West.|$|E
25|$|James Buchanan, Jr. (April 23, 1791 – June 1, 1868) was the 15th President of the United States, serving from 1857 until 1861.

Opinions by historians of Buchanan's presidency vary, as <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> him for keeping a divided nation together for so long while others fault him for failing to avert a civil war.
