The storekeepers usually expand their goods on the street. The street space creates more chance of communication for both storekeepers and consumers. The business is not just commercial, but social.

5000|$|<b>Street</b> <b>marketing</b> uses {{unconventional}} {{means of}} advertising or promoting products and brands in public areas with the main goal to encourage consumers to remember and recall the brand or product marketed.

For example, certain psychological areas study how people’s brains are divided: 45% of people are left-brained, 45% are right brained, and 10% are balanced. Left-brained persons tend to be logical, right-brained ones tend to be emotional, and the rest combine the two. Then, according to the product or service that enterprises provide, and also the kind of customer, businesses decides {{the way they are}} going to manage their <b>street</b> <b>marketing</b> campaigns.

Guerrilla marketing is {{about the use of}} investing time, energy and imagination into a business campaign, Guerrilla marketing is very popular among large businesses as it uses tactics such as unconventional communications which allows the businesses to focus on low cost strategies and make a higher impact. The use of viral marketing and Engagement marketing help make this higher impact. Guerrilla marketing uses services which already exist such as social networking sites to try to help businesses increase in brand awareness, this could be spread by the technique of Word of mouth or by the internet/social media. By creating these viral messages it appeals to individuals who already have a use of high social networking skills. Guerrilla marketing selects their target market by targeting groups who already engage with different types of products. This will create a quicker and easier way of consumers seeing and responding to a product, and they will also be likely to share this experience with friends and family so it will spread faster.Like guerrilla marketing, <b>street</b> <b>marketing</b> has the characteristic of being non-conventional. However, it is limited to the streets or public places. Other forms of guerrilla marketing use other media and processes, such as the Internet, to establish communication with the customers. Some other examples of guerrilla marketing are viral marketing and experiential marketing. The goal of <b>street</b> <b>marketing</b> is to create experiences that meet the expectations for advertising. <b>Street</b> <b>marketing</b> uses different ways of trying to engage with their audiences. Some of the things they do to show this is by placing advertisements such as billboards and static ads in different locations where the public wouldn't expect to see them such as down manholes or behind large buildings. The good thing about placing these ads in random places is that when the public get around to seeing them they would be extremely intrigued and would take an extra moment to read what the ad is about. <b>Street</b> <b>marketing</b> doesn't just use ads but also uses young and enthusiastic brand ambassadors who give out samples and coupons to customers who stop and take time to answer questions. Giving these customers a choice of interacting with the products of brands makes a stronger impact on deciding to buy a certain item than passive advertising. <b>Street</b> <b>marketing</b> is available to a variety of different businesses due to its low costs and also because it is limited by a marketer's ambition and creativity. However, <b>Street</b> <b>marketing</b> is only available to businesses which are willing to put effort.|$|E
