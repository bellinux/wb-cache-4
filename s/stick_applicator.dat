25|$|The {{catalase}} test {{is one of}} {{the three}} main tests used by microbiologists to identify species of bacteria. If the bacteria possess catalase (i.e., are catalase-positive), when a small amount of bacterial isolate is added to hydrogen peroxide, bubbles of oxygen are observed. The catalase test is done by placing a drop of hydrogen peroxide on a microscope slide. An <b>applicator</b> <b>stick</b> is touched to the colony, and the tip is then smeared onto the hydrogen peroxide drop.|$|R
50|$|Immediately after World War II, {{the company}} {{expanded}} into synthetic resin glues and, in 1947, the first multipurpose consumer white glue, known as Elmer’s Glue-All, was introduced. The glue was packaged {{in a glass}} bottle with a popsicle <b>stick</b> type wooden <b>applicator</b> attached with a rubber band. Consumer feedback confirmed a need for an easier to use delivery method, which prompted the company to develop easy to squeeze bottles featuring a twistable orange cap, introduced in 1962. This innovation remains in use and is a trademark of Elmer's Products.|$|R

30|$|Nasopharyngeal swab {{specimens}} {{were collected}} by trained laboratory technicians from 540 patients with influenza like illness who were nutritionally deprived and reported to physician during September–February, 2015 from different slums in Dhaka city with their written consent. All participants of this study had ILI with symptoms like cough, fever, running nose, sore throat, and/or headache. The study {{was approved by the}} ethical committee of Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka- 1000, Bangladesh (reference number: DMC-MEU/ECC/ 2014 / 17). All the patients participated in this study were asked to fill a questionnaire, which includes the ages, socio-economic status, occupation, practice of hygienic condition, nutrition status of their family along with the environmental condition. For the collection of samples of nasal swab, a dry cotton tipped swab was inserted into the nostril parallel to the palate and left in place for a few seconds before being slowly withdrawn using a rotating motion. Specimens from both nostrils were obtained with the same swab. The tip of the swab was placed into a collection vial containing 2  ml of viral transport medium (VTM) and the <b>applicator</b> <b>stick</b> was then broken off. Samples were then placed at 4  °C immediately after collection and promptly transported to the laboratory.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{collecting}} epithelial {{cells from the}} oral mucosa for the determination of ion concentration is discussed with application {{to the study of}} man's adaptation to microgravity. A number of characteristics of these cells influenced the choice for clinical testing. They are non-cornified epithelial cells located on the inferior aspect of the tongue; therefore, they are well protected from trauma. They have the capability of reflecting relatively recent physiologic changes since they are renewed every three days and have aerobic metabolism. Most importantly, they are easily accessible and can be removed by a wooden <b>applicator</b> <b>stick</b> with minimum discomfort. Smears of cells removed in this manner show predominantly individual cells rather than sheets of contiuous cells. This facilitates the visual isolation of single cells with the electron microscope for analysis. NASA's principle effort {{in the development of a}} test to measure the ion concentration in sublingual cells has been research by the biomedical program carried out by scientists with expertise in skeletal metabolism. These efforts were directed toward determining the biological meaning and deviations in interacellular ions in nonhuman primates and in male volunteers for experiments in a model for weightlessness.

40|$|METHOD 1. Place 2 mL of the {{appropriate}} sterile medium in a 13 mm yellow-capped culture tube. If more culture is needed, place up to 5 mL in a 16 mm green-capped culture tube. Large amount of culture should be made in growth flasks, using up to 25 % flask volume in medium (e. g., no more than 30 mL in a 125 mL flask, or 250 mL in a 1000 mL flask). - Touch a single colony {{with the end of}} an <b>applicator</b> <b>stick</b> and hold it in your primary hand (right hand if right-handed). - Holding the test tube in you other hand with palm and lower fingers, remove the cap of the test tube with your thumb and index finger. Dip the inoculated end of the applicator into the sterile medium and, if necessary, wipe the end onto the side of the tube. - Briefly flame the end of the test tube and replace the cap. - Always inoculate a dummy tube with no cells to verify that the medium, tubes, and sticks were sterile. - If inoculating large cultures, dilute an existing culture 1 : 100. - Grow culture for 12 to 18 hours. After 24 - 30 hours, cells have entered stationary phase and should not be used for critical procedures. - "Quicky" overnights can be made by rescuing a 2 or 3 day culture. Dilute culture 1 : 10 in sterile medium and grow for 3 hours. [![DOI]([URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the need to use heparin when preparing an UltraTag red blood cell (RBC) kit for a nuclear medicine study. Methods: Nonheparinized blood samples (n = 15) and heparinized blood samples (n = 15) were added to UltraTag RBC kits. The samples were examined for macroscopic blood clotting and microscopic platelet clumping. As a control, samples with heparin (n = 15) and without heparin (n = 15) were used to help evaluate the effectiveness of the anticoagulant properties within the UltraTag RBC kit (sodium citrate) and whether those properties played a role in preventing clots or clumps. To detect clotting, the wooden <b>applicator</b> <b>stick</b> method was used. To detect clumping, blood smears were evaluated using a light microscope. The two samples were compared for presence of clots and clumps. Fisher exact testing was used to evaluate the significance of the data. Results: For the UltraTag RBC group, 2 of the 15 nonheparinized samples clotted and none of the 15 heparinized samples clotted; for the control group, 2 of the 15 nonheparinized samples clotted and none of the 15 heparinized samples clotted. For the Ultra-Tag RBC group, 3 of the 15 nonheparinized samples clumped and 3 of the 15 heparinized samples clumped; for the control group, 15 of the 15 nonheparinized samples clumped and 10 of the 15 heparinized samples clumped. Conclusion: When heparin is not used, the Ultra-Tag RBC kit is more likely to form clots. Heparin should always be used when preparing an Ultra-Tag RBC kit for a nuclear medicine study...|$|R
30|$|The disk {{diffusion}} {{test was used}} to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the confirmed bacterial isolates against panels of antimicrobial agents. This test was performed on the E. coli and S. aureus isolates recovered in the present study. The antimicrobial agents tested were Amoxycillin (25 [*]μg), Ampicillin (10 [*]μg), Amoxycillin-Clavulanate (30 [*]μg), Cephalexin (30 [*]μg), Ciprofloxacin (10 [*]μg), Clindamycin (10 [*]μg) and Co-trimoxazole (25 [*]μg). Others include Erythromycin (5 [*]μg), Gentamycin (30 [*]μg), Nalidixic acid (30 [*]μg), Norfloxacin (10 [*]μg), Ofloxacin (5 [*]μg), Pefloxacin (5 [*]μg) and Streptomycin (10 [*]μg). The antimicrogram pattern was determined according to the Kirby Bauer procedure described by Demissie (2011). Briefly, pure colonies of bacterial growth were suspended in tubes containing 5 mls of Brain Heart infusion broth (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards. 10 μl of the diluted bacterial suspensions were transferred to Mueller Hinton agar plates (BBL®, Becton Dickinson, USA) using sterile cotton swab <b>applicator</b> <b>sticks.</b> Excess fluid was squeezed out by rotating the swabs against the sides of the tubes. The plates were then inoculated uniformly by rubbing the swabs against the entire agar surfaces and allowed to dry. The impregnated antimicrobial discs (Optun Laboratories Nig Ltd., Lagos, Nigeria) were applied to the surfaces of the inoculated plates using sterile forceps. All the discs were gently pressed with forceps to ensure complete contact with the agar surface. The discs were placed 1.5 cm away from the edges of the plates and 3 cm away from each other with the guide of a template placed under the petri-dish. The plates were then inverted and incubated aerobically for 24 hr at 37 °C. The zones of inhibition of bacteria by the antimicrobial discs were measured in millimeters using a caliper {{on the underside of the}} plates. The susceptibility of the bacteria was determined based on the breakpoints recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2011).|$|R
40|$|Post-traumatic {{morbidity}} {{reduces the}} quality of life for traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors by altering neuropsychological function. After midline fluid percussion injury (FPI), diffuse pathology in the ventral posterior thalamus suggests that somatosensory whisker function may be impaired post-injury. The goals of the present study were to design and validate a task to detect injury-induced somatosensory morbidity (Experiment 1), and to evaluate preliminary applications of the task (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to moderate FPI (∼ 1. 9 [*]atm) or sham injury. Over an 8 -week time course, the whiskers on both mystacial pads were stimulated manually with an <b>applicator</b> <b>stick</b> in an open field for three 5 -min periods. Behavioral responses in this whisker nuisance task were recorded using objective criteria (max score[*]=[*] 16). Sham animals were ambivalent or soothed by whisker stimulation (4. 0 [*]±[*] 0. 8), whereas brain-injured rats showed aggravated responses at 1 week (6. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 9), which became significant at 4 weeks (9. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 5) and 8 weeks (8. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 1) compared to sham injury, indicating chronic injury-induced sensory sensitivity. Total free serum corticosterone levels indicated a significant stress response in brain-injured (125. 0 [*]±[*] 17. 7 [*]ng/mL), but not uninjured animals (74. 2 [*]±[*] 12. 2 [*]ng/mL) in response to whisker stimulation. In Experiment 2, to evaluate applications of the whisker nuisance task, four additional uninjured and brain-injured groups were subjected to mild brain injury only, shaved whiskers after moderate brain injury, repeated whisker nuisance task stimulation after moderate brain injury, or regular opportunities for tactile exploration of an enriched environment after moderate brain injury over 4 weeks post-injury. The whisker nuisance task has the sensitivity to detect mild brain injury (7. 7 [*]±[*] 1. 0), but morbidity was not mitigated by any of the neurorehabilitative interventions. Following diffuse brain injury, the whisker nuisance task is a promising tool to detect post-traumatic morbidity and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions that may restore discrete circuit function in brain-injured patients...|$|R
