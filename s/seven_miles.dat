5|$|In 1846, US Congress {{appropriated}} $23,000 {{to rebuild}} the Cape Florida lighthouse and work was completed in 1847. In 1861, Confederate militants sabotaged the lighthouse {{so that it could}} not guide Union sailors during the blockade of Confederate Florida. The lighthouse was repaired and re-lit again in 1866. In 1878 the Cape Florida Light was replaced by the Fowey Rocks Light, <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> (11km) southeast of Cape Florida.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, 1832, a {{detachment}} of 275 militia {{under the command}} of Majors Isaiah Stillman and David Bailey, under orders from Illinois Governor Reynolds, were encamped near Old Man's Creek, not far from its confluence with the Rock River. The militia camp was located about three miles (5km) east of the Rock River near present-day Stillman Valley, Illinois, and <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> (11km) south of the Sauk encampment. It is believed that the militia and its commanders were unaware of their proximity to Black Hawk's British Band.|$|E

5|$|The {{removal of}} the docks to Avonmouth, <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> (11km) {{downstream}} from the city centre, relieved congestion in the central zone of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour) in the late 20th century. The deep-water Royal Portbury Dock was developed opposite Avonmouth Docks in the 1970s and following privatisation of the Port of Bristol has become financially successful.|$|E
5|$|Day {{was born}} to glass factory worker Ellis Day and his wife Hattie Leet in Alexandria, Virginia, a city <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> from Washington, D.C, on October 30, 1916. His family, which {{included}} five other siblings, moved the following year to Mount Winans, a predominantly black community in a poor area of Southwest Baltimore, in a residence situated on Pierpont Street that lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. At a young age, Day became enamored with baseball, often playing local sandlot games or taking the long walk from his neighborhood to Maryland Ball Park where he watched the Baltimore Black Sox.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} junction, NY22 begins a long curve {{away from the}} state line that has it running due west {{at the end of}} NY40 in North Granville. It heads {{northwest}} a little further until, after passing between Great Meadows and Washington state prisons, it reaches US4 and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. The overlap with US4, one of the few along Route22 that pairs it with another north–south route, lasts for <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> (11km) along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and Lake George, before ending in Whitehall, where US4 leaves to assume the east–west course it takes across northern New England.|$|E

5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. Having advanced <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> to complete its objectives, the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long barrage of high explosive shells along their front to create a diversion, under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio.|$|E
5|$|Amaral {{was himself}} an arguido in {{relation}} to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later {{he was charged with}} making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> (11km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E

5|$|Circa 1930, Gabriel had an {{argument}} {{with one of the}} Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family were expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubiere. They settled in a village about <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> away, although the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home at weekends. Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of diarrhoea. In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize. Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment at Bulawayo. He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.|$|E
5|$|Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area has trails for {{hiking and}} horseback riding. A short, half mile (800m) trail leads to Silver Springs near the park's east entrance. A longer, four mile (6.4km) trail follows {{the course of}} the Fox River through the park's wooded areas. The equestrian trail is located in the {{wildlife}} management area of the park and stretches <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> (11km). A one-mile (1.6km) path travels through the prairie restoration area as well. During the winter, much of the park's trail system is open to cross-country skiing, and a four-mile (6km) trail is open to snowmobiling, weather permitting. When ice thickness permits, the lakes are opened to ice skating and ice fishing. Sledding is another popular activity; Toboggan Hill is located inside the park's east entrance.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{entered the}} war in 1761 as an ally of France. The British high command {{believed}} that capturing Havana would destroy {{the lines of communication}} from Spain to its colonial empire. On June 6, the assaulting British forces arrived <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> off the shore of Havana. The 17th Foot, including Montgomery's company, was to capture Moro Fort, the key to the Spanish defense of the city. British battleships bombarded the fort, silencing all but two Spanish guns. On July 30, Montgomery and the 17th Foot stormed and captured the fort. In late August 1762, Montgomery and the 17th Foot were sent to New York, where they remained {{for the rest of the}} war. The conflict was ended by the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.|$|E

5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Khe Sanh was {{the seat of}} {{government}} of Huong Hoa district, an area of Bru Montagnard villages and coffee plantations, situated about <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> from the Laotian frontier on Route 9, the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region, through the western highlands, and then crossed the border into Laos. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by US Army Special Forces of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village at an old French fort. The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG), whose purpose was to keep watch on NVA infiltration along the border {{and to protect the}} local population.|$|E
5|$|After embarking from Tynemouth, Harald and Tostig {{probably}} {{landed at}} the River Tees. They then entered Cleveland, and started plundering the coast. They encountered the first resistance at Scarborough, where Harald's demand for surrender was opposed. In the end, Harald resorted to burning down {{the town and}} this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. After further raiding, Harald and Tostig sailed down the Humber, disembarking at Riccall. News of the invasion soon reached the earls Morcar of Northumbria and Edwin of Mercia, and they fought against Harald's invading army two miles (3km) south of York at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September. This {{would be the last}} time a Scandinavian army defeated English forces. The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig, Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in Tadcaster, just <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall. From there, he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet, preparing a surprise attack. As Harald had left no forces in York, Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to Stamford Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Route 126 {{starts at}} the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The road travels east for around <b>seven</b> <b>miles</b> in a {{straight}} line, intersecting Route M and Route 43. Route 126 continues eastward, crossing through farmland and a few trees. After the route intersects Route J, it meets a frontage road parallel to I-49/US 71. The road crosses over North Fork Spring River and continues east. Soon, Route 126 intersects I-49/US 71 at a diamond interchange, and intersects a frontage road again. The route crosses a railroad owned by Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, and intersects Routes JJ and T. Four miles later, the route enters Golden City and becomes Main Street. It becomes concurrent with Route 37. The routes goes through downtown Golden City, and turn slightly northeast. The two routes end at US 160 at a T-intersection. US 160 continues eastward toward Lockwood. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 840 vehicles traveling east of I-49/US 71, and as few as 480 vehicles traveling west of I-49/US 71. This is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.|$|E
