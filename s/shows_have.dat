5|$|Before {{the series}} had premiered, some media critics {{stated that the}} series had {{potential}} to become a ratings hit and possibly raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five.

In {{order to make it}} more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair it up with the hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season. Also, musical <b>shows</b> <b>have</b> a known record for failures, like Cop Rock.|$|E

5|$|Kubrick {{is widely}} {{referenced}} in popular culture, and the TV series The Simpsons {{is said to}} contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. When the Directors Guild of Great Britain gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show. Pop singer Lady Gaga's concert <b>shows</b> <b>have</b> included the use of dialogue, costumes, and music from A Clockwork Orange. Several films have been made related to Kubrick's life, including the mockumentary film Dark Side of the Moon (2002), which is a parody of the pervasive conspiracy theory that Kubrick had {{been involved with the}} faked footage of the NASA moon landings during the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Colour Me Kubrick (2005), starring John Malkovich as Alan Conway, a con artist who had assumed Kubrick's identity in the 1990s. Both films were authorized by Kubrick's family. In the 2004 film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Kubrick was portrayed by Stanley Tucci, and documents their filming of Dr. Strangelove, rather than Lolita.|$|E
