40|$|AbstractThe {{field of}} {{dentistry}} lacks satisfactory tools to help visualize planned procedures {{and their potential}} results to patients. Dentists struggle to provide an effective image in their patient's mind of the end results of the planned treatment only through verbal explanations. Thus, verbal explanations alone often cannot adequately help the patients make a treatment decision. Inadequate attempts are frequently made by dentists to sketch the procedure for the patient {{in an effort to}} depict the treatment. These attempts however require an artistic ability not all dentists have. Real case photographs are sometimes of help in explaining and illustrating treatments. However, particularly in implant cases, real case photographs are often ineffective and inadequate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a mobile application with an effective user interface design to support the dentist–patient interaction by providing the patient with illustrative descriptions of the procedures and the end result. <b>Sketching,</b> <b>paper</b> prototyping, and wire framing were carried out with the actual user's participation. Hard and soft dental tissues were modeled using three dimensional (3 D) modeling programs and real cases. The application enhances the presentation to the patients of potential implants and implant supported prosthetic treatments with rich 3 D illustrative content. The application was evaluated in terms of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness through an online survey. The application helps improve the information sharing behavior of dentists to enhance the patients' right to make informed decisions. The paper clearly demonstrates the relevance of interactive communication technologies for dentist–patient communication...|$|E
40|$|Ihave {{always been}} the {{scientific}} one {{in a family of}} artists: actors,painters and illustrators. As a child I was sent for art lessons with my sis-ter, who is now an illustrator, but I was too self-conscious to express myself artistically. And if I did dare to pick up a paintbrush, my father would look at the results and say “Don’t give up your day job!” And so, I am a hematologist: a clini-cian, a laboratory physician and a teacher. I am also a wife and the mother of three children. I have a full life, and yet, in 2003, when a friend, showed me The Artist’s Way, a program for blocked artists that she was following, 1 I decided to try it. The program consists of stream-of-consciousness journaling called morning pages, and artist dates: time spent alone doing something con-cerning the arts. I persisted, even though I felt like a pretender. What came back to me in the morn-ing pages was an image from more than 20 years before. At that time my husband Hendrik and I seemed unable to start a family. This was a very stress-ful time and at a certain point, I became depressed and unable to go on with the investigations for infertility. I ended up in analysis, during which I formed an image of myself, desolate and alone in a boat on a lake. In my mind I named it “The Desolation of Infertility. ” During my artist dates, I started looking for that image in art books and at galleries, but I couldn’t find what I had in mind. Finally, I decided to paint it myself. I took out an old children’s paint box, a paintbrush and some <b>sketching</b> <b>paper,</b> and painted a primitive version of what I had in my mind. Having done that, I was surprised to see that the image, which had been sta-tic for more than 20 years, started mov-ing on in my mind. The boat moved “Into the Shallows. ” The person in the boat got out and started “Climbing the Mountain. ” The shoes, representing th...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} {{study was to examine}} high school students 2 ̆ 7 systems thinking when engaged in an engineering design challenge. This study included 12 high school students that were paired into teams of two to work through an engineering design challenge. These dyads were given one hour in their classrooms with access to a computer and engineering <b>sketching</b> <b>paper</b> to complete the design. Immediately following the design challenge, the students participated in a post hoc reflective group interview. The methodology of this study was informed by and derived from cognitive science 2 ̆ 7 s verbal protocol analysis. Multiple forms of data were gathered and triangulated for analysis. These forms included audio and video recordings of the design challenge and the interview, computer tracking, and student-generated sketches. The data were coded using Gero 2 ̆ 7 s FBS framework. These coded data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The transitions were further analyzed using measures of centrality. Additionally, qualitative analysis techniques were used to understand and interpret systems and engineering design themes and findings. Through the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it was shown that the students demonstrated thinking in terms of systems. The results imply that systems thinking can be part of a high school engineering curriculum. The students considered and explored multiple interconnected variables, both technical as well as nontechnical in nature. The students showed further systems thinking by optimizing their design through balancing trade-offs of nonlinear interconnected variables. Sketching played an integral part in the students 2 ̆ 7 design process, as it was used to generate, develop, and communicate their designs. Although many of the students recognized their own lack of drawing abilities, they understood the role sketching played in engineering design. Therefore, graphical visualization through sketching is a skill that educators may want to include in their curricula. The qualitative analysis also shed light on analogical reasoning. The students drew from their personal experience in lieu of professional expertise to better understand and expand their designs. Hence, the implication for educators is to aid the students in using their knowledge, experience, and preexisting schemata to work through an engineering design...|$|E
