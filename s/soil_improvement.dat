Animal slurries are usually treated by containment in anaerobic lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland.

25|$|Terra preta {{is defined}} as a type of latosol, having a carbon content ranging from high to very high (more than 13–14% organic matter) in its A horizon, but without {{hydromorphic}} characteristics.

As a result of these <b>soil</b> <b>improvements</b> after soybeans were added to the larch plantations, greater height and diameter growth rates were observed in larch trees. The light saturated net photosynthetic rate of larch in a 9 year-old larch-soybean plot was 8. 25 µmol m- 2 s- 1, but it was only 7. 2 µmol m- 2 s- 1 in 9 year-old pure larch plots...|$|R
