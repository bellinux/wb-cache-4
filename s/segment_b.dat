30|$|Segment C, {{where the}} {{epicenter}} of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is located, may have a potential to generate a large earthquake, as already mentioned, while its adjacent two <b>segments,</b> <b>Segments</b> <b>B</b> and D, do not. Following a recent popular term in seismology, we may call Segment C a segment with strong asperities while <b>Segments</b> <b>B</b> and D have no, or very minor, asperities. This dramatic variability among along-strike segments, including segments of weak plate coupling, is very striking. Thus, the idea that no megathrust earthquakes are likely in the Tohoku subduction zone appeared reasonable before 2011. The interaction between deep and shallow segments, Segments C and C', is considered essential for causing an M 9 earthquake; their combined slips may have triggered large slips in adjacent along-strike <b>segments</b> (<b>Segments</b> <b>B</b> and D) of relatively weak plate coupling where no large slips can happen if they fail by themselves.|$|R

50|$|DXV is a Baltimore Class III naked (non-enveloped) virus. The capsid of this protein {{contains}} an icosahedral geometry (T=13) consisting of 260 trimeric VP2 capsomeres. Specifically, DXV contains a bi-segmented dsRNA genome. Both {{segments of the}} DXV genome contain 5’ terminal GGA triplet and a 3’ terminal CCC triplet consensus, {{which is consistent with}} birnaviridae (Shwed, 2002). The segment A genome is 3360-bp in length. Segment A encodes a polyprotein sequence as follows: NH2-preVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH. This segment contains a large and small ORF. The <b>segment</b> <b>B</b> genome is 2991-bp in length. <b>Segment</b> <b>B</b> encodes a polypeptide sequence as follows: NH2-VP1-COOH. The 5’ UTR of <b>segment</b> <b>B</b> is homologous to segment A, but unlike segment A, there is only one ORF. Unusually, VP1 can be in two forms; as a free RdRp and as the genome-liked protein (VpG) that attaches to both 5’ end segments of the DXV through a Ser-5’-GMP phosphodiester bond. The replication of DXV follows the characterized dsRNA virus replication cycle.|$|E

30|$|Combining {{the seismic}} {{reflection}} and swath-bathymetry data provides {{evidence for the}} large earthquake rupture across a stable segment-boundary off the Kii Peninsula in the Nankai subduction zone. Seismic reflection profiles reveal steeply landward-dipping splay faults in the <b>segments</b> <b>B</b> and C. The splay faults, branching upward from the plate-boundary interface, almost reach the seafloor, producing the seafloor fault scarps. The swath-bathymetry map exhibits a ∼ 200 -km-long, remarkable seafloor lineament with which the seafloor fault scarps align in the <b>segments</b> <b>B</b> and C. The seafloor lineament, which may be produced by repeating slips on the splay faults, is almost laterally continuous across the B–C boundary off the Kii Peninsula. These seafloor and subsurface features {{could be due to}} multiple, simultaneous coseismic slips across the B–C boundary when subduction thrust earthquakes accompany coseismic slips on the splay fault. The splay faults are related to fluid expulsion, dynamic deformation, and tsunami generation.|$|R

The genome <b>segment</b> <b>B</b> (2.9 kb) encodes VP1, the putative viral RNA polymerase. The larger segment A (3.2 kb) encodes viral proteins VP2, VP3, VP4, and VP5. Among them, VP2 protein contains important neutralizing antigenic sites and elicits protective immune response {{and most of the}} amino acid (AA) changes between antigenically different IBDVs are clustered in the hypervariable region of VP2. Thus, this hypervariable region of VP2 is the obvious target for the molecular techniques applied for IBDV detection and strain variation studies.|$|E
