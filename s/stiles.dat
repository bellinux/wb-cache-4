5|$|Ramsey dropped Alan Ball and John Connelly {{and brought}} in Terry Paine and Martin Peters, whose {{advanced}} style of play as a midfielder matched the qualities Ramsey looked for in his system. England beat Mexico 2–0. Ramsey replaced Terry Paine with Ian Callaghan for their final group match, against France. England won 2–0, securing qualification to the knockout rounds. Two difficult situations arose from the final group match, however. After making a vicious tackle and being cautioned, midfielder Nobby <b>Stiles</b> came under fire from senior FIFA officials, who called for Ramsey to drop him from the side. Ramsey strongly disagreed, and told the FA to inform FIFA that either <b>Stiles</b> would remain in his team or Ramsey himself would resign. Another bad tackle was committed during that match, resulting in Tottenham striker (and one of England's most prolific goal-scorers) Jimmy Greaves being injured and sidelined {{for the next few}} matches. Despite having more experienced strikers in his squad, Ramsey selected young Geoff Hurst as Greaves's replacement, once again seeing potential in the young West Ham forward. The France match also marked Ramsey's final game with a winger. After it, he dropped Ian Callaghan from his side and brought back Alan Ball to strengthen the midfield.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We present <b>sTile,</b> a {{technique}} for distributing trust-needing computation onto insecure networks, while providing probabilistic guarantees that malicious agents that compromise {{parts of the}} network cannot learn private data. With <b>sTile,</b> we explore the fundamental cost of achieving privacy through data distribution and bound how much less efficient a privacy-preserving system is than a nonprivate one. This paper focuses specifically on NP-complete problems and demonstrates how sTile-based systems can solve important real-world problems, such as protein folding, image recognition, and resource allocation. We present the algorithms involved in <b>sTile</b> and formally prove that sTile-based systems preserve privacy. We develop a reference sTile-based implementation and empirically evaluate it on several physical networks of varying sizes, including the globally distributed PlanetLab testbed. Our analysis demonstrates <b>sTile’s</b> scalability and ability to handle varying network delay, as well as verifies that problems requiring privacypreservation can be solved using <b>sTile</b> orders of magnitude faster than using today’s state-of-the-art alternatives.

5|$|Various {{changes have}} been made to the basic set since the {{syndicated}} version's premiere in 1983. In 1996, a large video display was added center stage, which was then upgraded in 2003 as the show began the transition into high-definition broadcasting. In the mid-1990s, the show began a long-standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme. As a result, in addition to its generic design, the set also uses many alternate designs, which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs. The most recent set design was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss-Johnson, with later modifications by Jody Vaclav. Previous set designers included Ed Flesh and Dick <b>Stiles.</b>|$|E

5|$|During November1993, {{assembly}} of the first prototype commenced at two separate locations, these being Sikorsky's facility in Stratford, Connecticut and Boeing's manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; later on, all of the rotorcraft's sub-assemblies were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In the following year, the number of prototypes to be produced was reduced from four to two rotorcraft. On 25May1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky's production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities. On 4January1996, the prototype, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus <b>Stiles,</b> performed its 39-minute maiden flight.

40|$|Abstract—The cloud offers {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} compu-tation. However, ensuring {{the privacy of}} that computation re-mains a significant challenge. In this paper, we address the prob-lem of distributing computation onto the cloud {{in a way that}} pre-serves the privacy of the computation’s data even from the cloud nodes themselves. The approach, called <b>sTile,</b> separates the com-putation into small subcomputations and distributes {{them in a way that}} makes it prohibitively hard to reconstruct the data. We evaluate <b>sTile</b> theoretically and empirically: First, we for-mally prove that <b>sTile</b> systems preserve privacy. Second, we de-ploy a prototype implementation on three different networks, in-cluding the globally-distributed PlanetLab testbed, to show that <b>sTile</b> is robust to network delay and efficient enough to signifi-cantly outperform existing privacy-preserving approaches.

5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel <b>Stiles</b> suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching.|$|E

5|$|After their stint on Someone Like Me, Carey and Helford {{developed}} and produced the storyline for The Drew Carey Show. The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, {{as he took}} on the stresses of life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with {{having to deal with}} censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan <b>Stiles</b> (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3–9).|$|E
5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay <b>Stiles</b> Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E
