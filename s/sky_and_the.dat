Lure of the Temptress is the first game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which Revolution used in the subsequent games Beneath a Steel <b>Sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first two games in the Broken Sword series. It was received favourably by critics, a commercial success and re-released as freeware on April 1, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Vega, also {{designated}} Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is {{the brightest}} star in the constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus.

5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
5|$|The constellation's {{brightest}} member, Alpha Pavonis, is {{also known}} as Peacock and appears as a 1.91-magnitude blue-white star, but is actually a spectroscopic binary. Delta Pavonis is a nearby Sun-like star some 19.9 light-years distant. Six of the star systems in Pavo have been found to host planets, including HD 181433 with a super-earth, and HD 172555 with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in the past few thousand years. The constellation contains NGC 6752, the third-brightest globular cluster in the <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spiral galaxy NGC 6744, which closely resembles the Milky Way but is twice as large. Pavo displays an annual meteor shower known as the Delta Pavonids, whose radiant is near the star δ Pav.|$|E
5|$|The mode {{begins as}} Mario and Kirby {{face each other}} on a stadium located in the Smash Bros. world. In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they turn into a trophy form, which can be revived by {{touching}} the base. Suddenly, smoke pours from the <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Battleship Halberd flies over. It releases a stream of black purple-clouded bugs called Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, a cloak-clad, mysterious hovering General of the Subspace Army, arrives with his Army and detonates a Subspace Bomb, {{which can only be}} detonated by the sacrifice of two R.O.B.s, and which transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to progressively team up and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies, and using shadow bugs on some of them to fight the protagonists during their adventure.|$|E

5|$|The {{projector}} {{could be}} controlled by a console where an individual presenter would provide specific talks or lectures. By the mid-1970s, automation features were added, {{which led to the}} creation of prerecorded shows. Most visitors to the facility would have seen an automated 40- to 45-minute audio/visual show on a particular space-related topic. Two types of shows were typically alternated on a daily basis: one aimed at families with young children and another aimed at older children and adults. Typical shows aimed at both audience types were built around themes such as space travel, the mythical stories behind the constellations, and around Christmas-time, a show that investigated theories on stellar explanations for the Star of Bethlehem. A listing from 1970 includes shows titled The Story of Eclipses, which looked at how solar eclipses occur and their scientific importance, Man and the Zodiac which explored the history of mythology and astrology with regard to the night <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Planet Venus which surveyed the history of the planet in mythology, the planet's motion across the sky and featured imagined views from its surface.|$|E
5|$|Tycho Brahe, also {{credited}} with Coma's designation as a constellation, included {{it in his}} 1602 star catalogue. Brahe recorded fourteen stars in the constellation; Johannes Hevelius increased its number to twenty-one, and John Flamsteed to forty-three. Coma Berenices also appeared in Johann Bayer's 1603 Uranometria, {{and a few other}} 17th-century celestial maps followed suit. Coma Berenices and the now-obsolete Antinous are considered the first post-Ptolemaic constellations depicted on a celestial globe. With Antinous, Coma Berenices exemplified a trend in astronomy in which globe- and map-makers continued to rely on the ancients for data. This trend ended {{at the turn of the}} 16th century with observations of the southern <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> work of Tycho Brahe.|$|E
5|$|Captain America {{was put on}} hold {{during the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. However, in January 2008, Marvel Entertainment reached an interim {{comprehensive}} agreement with the Writers Guild of America that would put writers immediately back to work on various projects that were under the company's development. On May 5, 2008 (after the success of Iron Man), Marvel announced the film The First Avenger: Captain America (the working title) for release in May 6, 2011 (before being pushed back to July 22). Louis Leterrier, director of The Incredible Hulk, viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services, but Marvel turned him down. Johnston finally signed on in November 2008, and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite. Feige cited Johnston's directorial work on October <b>Sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy {{to explain why he}} was an appropriate choice. Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} after myth, most gods {{were said to}} be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they {{inhabited}} the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{design was}} a highly symbolic variety of sacred architecture. It was a greatly elaborated variant {{on the design of}} an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home. Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ba, or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ba came to inhabit its mummy. This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world. Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary for the Duat where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place where that order was continually renewed.|$|E
