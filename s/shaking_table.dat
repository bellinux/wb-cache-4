[...] Severn insisted on remaining involved with the teaching of students and for many years led the teaching of basic structural engineering to first-year students. [...] He was appointed chairman of the Seismic Effects Committee of the International Commission on Large Dams in 1982 and in 1984 was appointed to the Science and Engineering Research Council's Civil Engineering Committee. [...] At SERC Severn established the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team which continues to send British engineers to every major earthquake to study the effects on structures. [...] In 1984 he was able to use a SERC grant to establish a large-scale <b>shaking</b> <b>table</b> at Bristol as part of an initiative to allow earthquake-struck countries gain access to British expertise. [...] This improved table was computer-controlled and driven by six hydraulic rams operating in all [...] three rotational and three translational axes.

[...] Severn continued his focus on the effects of earthquakes upon dams, particularly embankment dams which were widespread in the hydro-electric power stations being constructed during this period and outnumbered the previously dominant arch dams by ten to one in new construction. [...] The accurate modelling of embankment dams is difficult due to their mix of rocks and soil and little work had been carried out previously on their reaction to dynamic loading, such as was exerted by earthquakes. [...] Severn was a proponent of the use of finite element analysis in the modelling of such dams and pioneered the application of early digital computers to this task. [...] In the late 1970s Severn installed a 2m by 1m <b>shaking</b> <b>table</b> at Bristol and used it to derive a set of guidelines for the design of earthquake resistance in embankment dams, they were the first of their kind in the world. [...] Severn's table was computer controlled and used a series of eccentricly-mounted weights to exert forces upon embankment dam models that he constructed of sand and wax. [...] He refined his models using real-world data collected from a dam in Wales.

However, many systems deliver variable and less than optimal performance, particularly when reproducing large near-field seismic events that require extreme table performance. Improved identification and control methods are developed for large hydraulic servo-actuated <b>shake</b> <b>table</b> systems that can exhibit unacceptable tracking response for large, near-field seismic testing. The research {{is presented in the}} context of a 5 -tonne <b>shake</b> <b>table</b> facility at the University of Canterbury that is of typical design. The system is identified using a frequency response approach that accounts for the actual magnitudes and frequencies of motion encountered in seismic testing. The models and methods developed are experimentally verified and the impact of different feedback variables such as acceleration, velocity and displacement are examined. The methods show that <b>shake</b> <b>table</b> control in testing large near-field seismic events is often a trade off between accurate tracking and nonlinear velocity saturation of the hydraulic valves that can result in severe acceleration spikes. Control methods are developed to improve performance and include both acceleration and displacement feedback to reduce the acceleration spikes, and record modification, where the reference signal is modified to conform to the <b>shake</b> <b>table’s</b> operational parameters. Results show record modification gives exact tracking for near-field ground motions, and optimal system response for reference signals with velocity components greater then the system capabilities.

In order to minimize the ill-effects due to liquefaction, various lab tests, field tests are being used which assess the liquefaction potential. In the present study the <b>shake</b> <b>table</b> test {{has been used for}} assessing soil liquefaction of loose saturated cohesionless sand by simulating earthquake conditions in the laboratory. The tests are conducted on <b>shake</b> <b>table</b> apparatus, with the varying range of relative density and maximum acceleration. This paper deals with the experimental investigations carried out to establish an unique criterion for initiation of liquefaction for <b>shake</b> <b>table</b> test, which best delineate with the initialization of liquefaction in clean uniform sand. It is observed that for the clean sand tested in <b>shake</b> <b>table</b> test liquefaction is observed to trigger at pore pressure ratios even {{less than or equal to}} one for loose and medium state of soil up to maximum shaking of 0. 32 g. For higher magnitude of shaking and for denser soils initiation of liquefaction is observed to take place for pore pressure ratios greater than one.
