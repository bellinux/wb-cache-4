5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the <b>same</b> <b>guy,</b> and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
500|$|... "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Carrie Underwood, taken from her fourth studio album, Blown Away. The song served as the album's third single on November 18, 2012 through Arista Nashville. Written by Underwood, Hillary Lindsey, and Josh Kear, [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] is a country pop song with lyrics addressing {{the story of two}} women who, when they realize they are both involved with the <b>same</b> <b>guy,</b> set aside their differences and decide to kill him.

It reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart and has been certified gold by the BPI. The accompanying music video for the song was set {{at a high school}} dance. Unbeknownst to each member of the group, they had been invited to attend by the same date after previously meeting him in different situations.

500|$|In 2005, {{commenting on}} the success American Idiot brought the band, Sam Bayer, {{director}} of all of American Idiots music videos, stated [...] "The Billie Joe that I work with {{now is not the}} <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> that walked onto the American Idiot set a year ago. Now, he's a rock star. They were famous.They had done big stuff. But it's transcended that. [...] But he hasn't changed. And they haven't changed. They're three friends who love one another". Courtney Love also commented on the success of the band, stating [...] "Billie Joe looks absolutely beautiful. You know how when people get super A-list, their face gets prettier? I think it's perception. [...] It's something that happens in your subconscious". At the time of American Idiots release, the album was not sold in Wal-Mart due to its explicit content.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007 when asked about politics he said, [...] "I'd been unemployed all my life. It {{was a big deal}} for me when they (Labour) got in. Now David Cameron is no different from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown is no different from David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the band wanted a [...] "performance video" [...] and {{that they wanted to}} go back to their [...] "rock roots". When asked the concept behind the video, Webb said: [...] "They provided the sound and I provided the lights. A whole lot of lights. We used the <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> who did the lighting setup for Lenny Kravitz's 'Are You Gonna Go My Way?' and Coldplay's 'Speed of Sound.' But it's also rough around the edges — we used a bunch of different processes when developing the film." [...] He also concluded with, [...] "...it's a big performance video. But it's them performing inside of this wind-tunnel of light. It's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a lot of camera tricks. There's a big light wall, streaks of light, xenon lighting effects and strobe lights. [...] But it's all wrapped around this very simple performance environment".|$|E

50|$|On Cityrats And Alleycats Bombshell Rocks went on {{with their}} raw, fast, and highly {{energetic}} punk rock {{but this time the}} production was quite better. Maybe a result of their decision to work with the <b>same</b> <b>guys</b> as they worked with on Street Art Gallery: Mieszko Talarczyk (Nasum) and Mathias Färm (Millencolin) as engineers and producers. Tours and support for main acts like Blink 182, Millencolin and The Offspring followed.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> producing them. [...] I had heard the Deftones more than any of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Girlfriend" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who complimented its catchiness.

The song's accompanying music video, directed by The Malloys, sees Lavigne portraying three alter-egos, {{with all of them}} fighting over the <b>same</b> <b>guy.</b> In June 2007, the song's official remix, featuring American rapper Lil Mama, was released.

Russ Breimeier of The Fish commented that [...] "With [...] "Finally Home," [...] we get another heaven song from the <b>same</b> <b>guys</b> responsible for [...] "I Can Only Imagine," [...] "Homesick," [...] and others.

5000|$|In {{selecting}} {{musicians to}} work with on the album, Sebastian likewise looked to friends from his pre-Lovin' Spoonful days as a New York session man; he would later be quoted as saying [...] "I wanted this opportunity {{to play with the}} <b>same</b> <b>guys</b> I'd been playing with when we were all broke ... Dallas Taylor, Steve Stills, Harvey Brooks, Paul Harris." [...] In particular, Harris' work as a keyboardist and arranger on John B.

Other notable musicians of the period, including David Crosby, Graham Nash, Danny Weis and Buzzy Linhart, would also contribute to the sessions.|$|R

Replays clearly showed the whistle blew before the play's onset, plus {{most of the players}} pulled up and stopped playing after a whistle sounded, but Henderson claimed, [...] "I didn't hear a whistle until after I had knocked Bradshaw down. [...] The <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> (Swearingen) made that call too. Who is that guy?" [...] " [...] Franco Harris confronted Henderson for taunting Bradshaw after the whistle, and on the next play, Bradshaw handed the ball off to Harris, who raced untouched, with help from the Umpire Art Demmas impeding Cowboys safety Charlie Waters' attempt to tackle him, up the middle for a 22-yard touchdown run. [...] The next day Waters was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't know what I could do – maybe knock him [...] flat and maybe he'd knock Franco flat? [...] Our safeties {{play a vital role in}} the run.

2500|$|In late 1992, when {{living in}} Los Angeles, Kelly {{recorded}} ten tracks {{for his next}} album, Wanted Man, at three studios: Stagg St, Clearlake and O'Henry. Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and had a book collection of lyrics published, aptly titled Lyrics. In Melbourne he recorded three more tracks at the Metropolis Studio. The album was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs (member of [...] Was (Not Was)) and David Bridie (produced My Friend the Chocolate Cake's 1991 self-titled album). Jacobs and Kelly co-wrote [...] "Ball and Chain". The first track, [...] "Summer Rain", deals with a man's yearning for his girlfriend, Kelly thought the sentiment would translate well but found a curious Belgian interviewer asked, [...] "But why would anybody long for rain in summer? ... We get enough rain in winter. We don't want the summer rain. We want the sunshine". The lead single, [...] "Songs from the Sixteenth Floor" [...] was written by Kelly with John Clifforth of Deckchairs Overboard. The next single, [...] "Love Never Runs on Time" [...] was written by Kelly. The lyrics describe a truck driver struggling to meet his commitments to work and family. [...] Kelly uses the same protagonist from [...] "To Her Door" [...] on 1987's Under the Sun and then again in 1996's [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] from the extended play How to Make Gravy. In the first song, the man moves from being newly married to having children and problems with a drug addiction and undergoing rehab to returning to the family home. By the time of [...] "How to Make Gravy", the man is in prison for assault and is writing {{a letter to his}} brother for Christmas. In 2002 Debbie Kruger of Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) interviewed Kelly and found, [...] "Kelly’s attraction to the theatrical, however unconscious, has meant occasionally a song’s character will pop up again, sometimes unintentionally". Kelly conceded the three songs were linked, [...] "'I’ve got a feeling it’s the <b>same</b> <b>guy.</b> He keeps coming back'. Maybe he’ll be in a happier place next time? 'Yeah, he’s a bit of a fuck-up, that guy', Kelly laughs".|$|E

60|$|Mr. Jarvis had not {{forgotten}} Betty. His meeting {{with her at}} the office of Peaceful Moments had marked an epoch in his life. Never before had anyone quite like her crossed his path, and at that moment romance had come to him. His was essentially a respectful admiration. He was content--indeed, he preferred to worship from afar. Of his own initiative he would never have met her again. In her presence, with those gray eyes of hers looking at him, tremors ran down his spine, and his conscience, usually a battered and downtrodden wreck, became fiercely aggressive. She filled him with novel emotions, and whether these were pleasant or painful was more than he could say. He had not the gift of analysis where his feelings were concerned. To himself he put it, broadly, that she made him feel like a nickel with a hole in it. But that was not entirely satisfactory. There were other and pleasanter emotions mixed in with this humility. The thought of her made him feel, for instance, vaguely chivalrous. He wanted to do risky and useful things for her. Thus, if any fresh guy should endeavor to get gay with her, it would, he felt, be a privilege to fix that <b>same</b> <b>guy.</b> If she should be in bad, he would be more than ready to get busy on her behalf.|$|E
