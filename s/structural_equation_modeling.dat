25|$|Statistical methods {{commonly}} used {{in other areas of}} psychology are also used in OHP-related research. Statistical methods used include <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>modeling</b> and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as multilevel modeling). HLM can better adjust for similarities between employees and is especially well suited to evaluating the lagged impact of work stressors on health outcomes; in this research context HLM can help minimize censoring and is well-suited to experience sampling studies. Meta-analyses have been used to aggregate data (modern approaches to meta-analyses rely on HLM), and draw conclusions across multiple studies.|$|E
25|$|Quantitative {{psychological}} research {{lends itself}} to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data. These include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>modeling,</b> and hierarchical linear modeling. The measurement and operationalization of important constructs {{is an essential part}} of these research designs.|$|E
25|$|Psychometricians {{have also}} {{developed}} methods {{for working with}} large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: factor analysis, a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data; multidimensional scaling, a method for finding a simple representation for data {{with a large number}} of latent dimensions; and data clustering, an approach to finding objects that are like each other. All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>modeling</b> and path analysis represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large covariance matrices. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.|$|E

2500|$|From the 1980 to 2010s {{other changes}} in i/o {{psychology}} took place. Researchers increasingly adopted a multi-level approach, attempting to understand behavioral phenomena {{from both the}} level of the organization and {{the level of the}} individual worker. There was also an increased interest in the needs and expectations of employees as individuals. For example, an emphasis on organizational justice and the psychological contract took root, as well as the more traditional concerns of selection and training. Methodological innovations (e.g., meta-analyses, <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>modeling)</b> were adopted. With the passage of the American with Disabilities Act in 1990 and parallel legislation elsewhere in the world, i/o psychology saw an increased emphasis on [...] "fairness in personnel decisions." [...] Training research relied increasingly on advances in educational psychology and cognitive science.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{different}} {{models have been}} proposed to explain the structure of organizational justice perceptions including a two factor model, a three factor model, and a four factor model. [...] Many researchers have studied organizational justice {{in terms of the}} three factor model (e.g., DeConinck, 2010; Liljegren & Ekberg, 2010) while others have used a two factor model in which interpersonal justice is subsumed under procedural justice while yet some other studies suggest a four factor model best fits the data (Colquitt, 2001). [...] Greenberg (1990) proposed a two-factor model and Sweeney and McFarlin (1993) found support for a two-factor model composed of distributive and procedural justice. [...] Through the use of <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>modeling,</b> Sweeney and McFarlin found that distributive justice was related to outcomes that are person-level (e.g., pay satisfaction) while procedural justice was related to organization-level outcomes (e.g., organizational commitment).|$|E
2500|$|Because it {{is usually}} {{impossible}} to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a sample of persons from the wider population. Social psychologists frequently use survey research when {{they are interested in}} results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of random sampling to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>modeling</b> are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data. Some psychologists, including Dr. David Sears, have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.|$|E

2500|$|Panel {{sampling}} is {{the method}} of first selecting a group of participants through a random sampling method and then asking that group for (potentially the same) information several times {{over a period of}} time.
