40|$|Aim: Despite major {{advances}} in assisted reproductive techniques, clinical pregnancy rates remain around 31 % with fresh embryo transfer and around 41 % with oocyte donations. We {{also know that}} the implantation process itself and the window period defined as the %u 2018 %u 2019 implantation phase%u 2019 %u 2019 are significantly important for successful in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. With this study we have tried to determine any differences in immunohistochemical staining for CD 56 and CD 98 within the implantation phase endometrium of patients with recurrent implantation failure and of a control group that eventually had a successful IVF cycle. Material and Method: This study was retrospectively performed on a total of 36 patients selected out of a database of 6260 patients who received their IVF cycles from 2004 to 2010. Patients were defined as implantation failure if they did not have a positive result for b-HCG testing following at least 3 IVF cycles with a total of at least 8 embryo transfers. The control group was formed with patients who had success (positive b-HCG testing) on their first IVF treatment. Results: Comparison of means for CD 56 staining percentages, CD 98 staining percentages, CD 98 <b>staining</b> <b>power,</b> and CD 98 staining score showed significant difference between the control group and the study group (...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sperm DNA {{in human}} beings and most {{vertebrates}} is packed by protamines into highly compact form of chromatin. There are many staining methods to assess sperm chromatin. Three different methods of staining were used simultaneously {{in this study and}} the goal was to determine which of these sperm tests has a relation with fertilization rate in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Materials and Methods: Thirty couples who referred to Yamagata University Hospital (Yamagata, Japan) for ICSI were included in this study. The greater part of semen was prepared for ICSI. The remaining part was used for staining with aniline blue, acridine orange, and chromomycin A 3 (CMA 3). For evaluation of abnormal morphology and abnormality of head, Papanicolaou-stained smears were used. The analysis of data was done using Spearman coefficient of correlation and logistic regression model. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used for discrimination of CMA 3 <b>staining</b> <b>power</b> to identify ICSI rates. Results: Percentage of CMA 3 positivity, unlike those of aniline blue and acridine orange, showed significant negative correlation with fertilization rate. Moreover, the percentage of CMA 3 positivity showed a positive correlation with the percentage of abnormal morphology and abnormality of head. By dividing patients into CMA 3 48 % groups, the area under the curve was 0. 646. Conclusions: CMA 3 staining (protamine deficiency) could be considered as a useful tool for evaluation of male fertility prior to infertility treatment...|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical noise {{generation}} during staining of 6061 aluminium alloy exposed to 60 to 100 % RH at 323 K has been measured. The noise power values (V 2) {{were obtained from}} the auto correlation of voltage time data. On exposure of aluminium alloy to 80 to 100 % RH, considerable staining have been observed. During <b>staining</b> the noise <b>power</b> values were found to increase from 10 - 6 (V 2) to 10 - 4 (V 2) and a considerable weight gain was also observed. However, on exposure of aluminium alloy to 60 % RH no staining was observed and the noise power value remained around 10 - 8 (V 2). After passivation treatment of aluminium alloy in 50 % HNO 3 or with chromate treatment the noise power values remained at a low level of 10 - 8 (V 2) till the protective power of the coating remained unaffecte...|$|R
40|$|Isothermal {{compression}} {{tests of}} BSTMUF 601 super-alloy in the temperature range of 950 °C– 1200 °C {{and at the}} strain rates of 0. 2 s− 1, 5 s− 1, 10 s− 1 were performed on a Gleeble- 1500 D thermo-mechanical simulator. Based on the hyperbolic sine function, the unified constitutive equations and hot processing maps during the hot deformation process were established. The flow stress predicted by the constitutive equations shows good agreement with the corrected stress. Hot processing maps for hot working conditions were established based on exploring the effect of power dissipation efficiency and the instability coefficient associated with various kinds of temperatures and <b>stain</b> rates. Subsequently, <b>power</b> dissipation efficiency and the instability coefficient were interpreted based on hot processing maps under a series of strains, temperatures and strain rates. The results show that power dissipation efficiency increases gradually with the increasing temperature and the decreasing stain rate, and instability domains reduce first, then increase {{with the increase of}} true strain. The optimum hot working condition of BSTMUF 601 super-alloy was obtained...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} the evaporation process of a water liquid droplet on the hot surface that has microstructure is presented. The microstructure is formed out of a uni-directionally solidified alloy, {{the composition of the}} alloy being exposed to the direction of heat flow by corrosion. The structure is considered as numerous micro-pin fins. The droplet instantly penetrated through the structure of which has a specific pin height after the placement of the drop. The kinetics of the penetration is described by R 2 ∝tn. In the equation R is the radius of wet <b>stain,</b> and the <b>power</b> n is typically about 0. 3. The evaporation process involved in the droplet penetration is classified into the four stages. The governing equations on each stage are solved numerically using the finite-difference procedure. The analysis is simplified by assuming the surface temperature to be constant during droplet evaporation. The simulated surface temperature is lower than 373 K. The results are compared with available experimental data indicating the outcome of the droplet lifetime and the droplet shape during evaporation. The computational model provides the additional information for the effects of the fin height and initial droplet diameter...|$|R
40|$|Since {{quality control}} for {{adulteration}} in meat is very important, the vertical plate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic technique was studied {{for the detection}} and identification of cook ed and canned species extracts. Meat samples from beef, pork, lamb and horse were heated for one hour from 65 - 75 °C at intervals of about 5 °C. Be 2 ̆ 7 cause {{most of the research}} on the effect of cooking meats on the denatured serum proteins and the resultant electrophoretic patterns were done on beef, beef cooked at 70 °C was selected as an initial trial for protein solubilization in order to choose an extraction and applying procedure for cooked meats. The beef was extracted with a variety of potential protein solubilizing agents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SOS), urea, Triton X- 100 and BOI reagent in an attempt to solubilize the proteins. A single gel containing urea or SOS in conjunction with a discontinuous buffer system was studied as the electrophoresis system. Amido black lOB and Coomassie brilliant blue R- 250 were compared as <b>staining</b> dyes. Constant <b>power</b> and constant voltage were compared as power supplies. Polyacrylamide gel electrofocusing was tried. Raw meat extracts were utilized as reference patterns. A system of tris-chloride buffer at pH 6. 7 containing 2 M urea and 10...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is an idiopathic condition affecting predominantly adult smokers. Histologically, LCH {{is characterized}} by a nodular, interstitial proliferation of Langerhans cells around the distal airways with associated eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Associated findings, such as fibrosis, emphysematous change, and bronchiolitis can be reminiscent of other interstitial lung diseases. The markers CD 1 a and S 100 have traditionally been used to distinguish LCH from other processes. Little is known about expression of the Langerhans cell-specific lectin, langerin, in pulmonary diseases. We examined the expression patterns of S 100, CD 1 a, and langerin in LCH and other interstitial, inflammatory, and infectious processes in cases retrieved from the files at Brigham and Women's Hospital Department of Pathology. Immunoreactivity was scored according to the number of cells <b>staining</b> per high <b>power</b> field (400 x) in areas of highest density, averaged over 4 fields. Cases diagnosed as LCH based on histomorphology and positive CD 1 a and S 100 staining demonstrated strong langerin positivity in lesional tissue. All cases of LCH contained greater than 30 langerin and CD 1 a positive cells per high power field (HPF), with a mean of > 100 cells per HPF, in lesional tissue. Of the other interstitial processes examined, only usual interstitial pneumonia demonstrated increased number of Langerhans cells within epithelium and interstitium (mean 14 cells per HPF) as compared with normal lung (mean 6 cells per HPF). Langerin and CD 1 a serve as specific diagnostic markers in distinguishing LCH from other interstitial and inflammatory processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between serum antibody {{and resistance to}} tumor homografts in the mouse has been investigated. Production of serum antibody in response to homografts of a transplantable sarcoma (Sarcoma 1) was demonstrated, by cytotoxic action on {{the cells of the}} tumor, and also by a hemagglutinin test. The simpler and more repeatable hemagglutinin test was further investigated. Peak hemagglutinin titres were reached after the immunizing homografts underwent breakdown. Following transfer of lymph node cells from immunized mice into hosts of the same strain, hemagglutinin could be detected in the host serum. The course of its production showed that this secondary antibody was not elicited by transferred antigen, nor could it be due to transfer of preformed antibody. The cells developed the capacity to transfer hemagglutinin production later than the power to transfer heightened graft resistance. Spleen cells also transferred hemagglutinin production, at a later stage after immunization {{and to a lesser extent}} than cells from the regional lymph nodes. Implantation of the sarcoma in mice pretreated with certain preparations of lyophilized or frozen tissue stimulated hemagglutinin production, although the tumor grew progressively. The regional lymph nodes participated in the response: they could transfer hemagglutinin production into secondary hosts, but not graft resistance, and indeed appeared to diminish resistance. Lymph node cells from immunized donors conferred protection against the tumor on pretreated mice. Lymph nodes from normal donors also appeared in some experiments to confer protection although the effect was obscured by the rapidity with which the growing tumor became immunologically invulnerable. The fate of lymph node cells stained with acriflavine was followed after transfer. No effect of the <b>staining</b> on the <b>power</b> of the cells to confer immunity could be detected. Cells transferred to the peritoneal cavity passed into various host tissues, but were not found in test homografts. The conclusion is drawn that the hemagglutinating antibody is distinct from the antibody effective in combating homografts. The similarity in this respect between the homograft reaction and sensitization is emphasized in discussion...|$|R
