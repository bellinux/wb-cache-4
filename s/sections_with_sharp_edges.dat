40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{the results of}} a {{systematic}} study of the elastic properties of nanosized single-crystal wires and beams of bcc iron. Both tensile and bending stiffnesses have been determined employing molecular statics simulations for specimens of different sizes and three different crystallographic orientations. We also analyze the influence of circular cross sections and rounded edges compared to square cross <b>sections</b> <b>with</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> for one of the crystallographic orientations. The simulations show that there is a size dependence in Young's modulus and that different crystallographic orientations display different elastic behaviors. There are bands of deviating Young's modulus over the cross sections in the direction 45 degrees from the surfaces emanating from the edges, giving the cross section a heterogeneous character. Rounding the edges, or making the cross section circular, has little influence on the average Young's modulus, but it does influence the distribution over the cross section and, consequently, the aforementioned bands...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} computational {{investigation into}} the periodic two-dimensional performance of a NACA 0012 <b>section</b> fitted <b>with</b> 2 and 4 percent h/c Gurney flaps operating at a Reynolds number of 0. 85 × 106 is presented. The aim of the work {{was to determine the}} suitability of the incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formulation in modeling the vortex shedding experienced by lifting <b>sections</b> <b>with</b> blunt, <b>sharp</b> <b>edged</b> features. In particular, whether under-converged steady state calculations could be used for section design performance evaluation in place of the computationally intensive time accurate flow simulations. Steady, periodic, and time-averaged two-dimensional lift and drag coefficients, as well as vortex shedding frequency, were predicted and compared with the available experimental data. Reasonable agreement was found, once sufficiently fine grids had been generated, and the correct time step determined for the time accurate simulations...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} studies are described which were {{conducted for the}} purpose of developing a new generalized method for the prediction of profile drag of single component airfoil <b>sections</b> <b>with</b> <b>sharp</b> trailing <b>edges.</b> This method aims at solution for the flow in the wake from the airfoil trailing edge to the large distance in the downstream direction; the profile drag of the given airfoil section can then easily be obtained from the momentum balance once the shape of velocity profile at a large distance from the airfoil trailing edge has been computed. Computer program subroutines have been developed for the computation of the profile drag and flow in the airfoil wake on CDC 6600 computer. The required inputs to the computer program consist of free stream conditions and the characteristics of the boundary layers at the airfoil trailing edge or at the point of incipient separation in the neighborhood of airfoil trailing edge. The method described is quite generalized and hence can be extended to the solution of the profile drag for multi-component airfoil sections...|$|R

50|$|Crocodilian {{material}} found from Miocene {{deposits in}} the eastern United States has often been attributed to Thecachampsa, even isolated teeth with few distinguishable features. In 1867, Cope named two new species of Thecachampsa: T. contusor (occasionally misspelled T. contusa) and T. sericodon. T. sericodon was distinguished from T. antiqua by its slender, curved teeth, each <b>with</b> a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> near {{the base of the}} posterior margin (T. antiqua only possessed <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> along a small area near the tip of the posterior margin). In 1869, Cope named a fourth species, T. sicaria, from a jaw fragment and a dorsal vertebra. Unlike those of other species, the teeth of T. sicaria were lenticular (lens-shaped) in cross <b>section</b> <b>with</b> <b>sharp</b> cutting <b>edges.</b> That year, Othniel Charles Marsh named another species of Thecachampsa, T. squankensis, after the place of its discovery, Squankum, New Jersey. Cope named a new species, T. fastigiata, in 1870 as a reassignment of Crocodylus fastigiatus, named by Leidy in 1852. American geologist William Bullock Clark of the Maryland Geological Survey named a fifth species, T. marylandicus, in 1895. These species were distinguished from one another primarily by differences {{in the shape of the}} teeth, the most common material found. The genus was synonymized with Crocodylus in 1973, but has since been regarded as valid.|$|R

40|$|This work {{considers}} the adhesion of cells to a nanorough titanium implant surface <b>with</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b> The basic {{assumption was that}} the attraction between the negatively charged titanium surface and a negatively charged osteoblast is mediated by charged proteins with a distinctive quadrupolar internal charge distribution. Similarly, cation-mediated attraction between fibronectin molecules and the titanium surface {{is expected to be}} more efficient for a high surface charge density, resulting in facilitated integrin mediated osteoblast adhesion. We suggest that osteoblasts are most strongly bound along the <b>sharp</b> convex <b>edges</b> or spikes of nanorough titanium surfaces where the magnitude of the negative surface charge density is the highest.

40|$|Understanding of the {{mechanism}} of the vibration needed to fill thin <b>section</b> or one <b>with</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> in profile shapes and clarifying the dominant control parameters of the vibration in thin wall investment casting is key to producing sound casting (one free of misrun defects). It's also a central issue for study in this thesis. The filling capability in thin wall investment casting method was assessed in relation to metal head. It {{was found that the}} effect of the vibration on the metal head is markedly dependent on acceleration. Generally, it was observed that the metal head required to force the metal in thin sections in the casting vibrated at (1 g) acceleration is approximately half that used in castings made without vibration. Two potential mechanisms were observed from the experimental result during the filling process in thin wall casting i] discontinuous propagation flow in vibration conditions; and ii] continuous propagation flow without vibration. These mechanisms may be acting to modify the contact angles between liquid metal and a wall of the mould. Experiments also showed that two features of the transition can be observed {{from the front of the}} morphology; i] a coherent liquid metal front - this occurs in thin wall investment casting when the acceleration due to vibration is less than (1 g); and ii] jetting at the free surface - this occurs in thin wall investment casting when the acceleration due to vibration exceeds 1 g. This is present in terms of a unifying concept, using a frequency and amplitude (f - a) map. The time of the vibration operation has a moderate effect on the relative filling area when the acceleration is less than 1 g. However, it is more effective when the acceleration of the vibration is greater than 1 g. The mathematical models comprised one-dimensional heat transfer with phase change and had an established flow field for molten A 356 alloys flow in the thin section ceramic channel mould. The work was concerned with the fluidity of A 356 alloys in thin wall investment casting with and without vibration in two type of filling (flowability and fillability filling types), combining heat and metal flow in addition to the simultaneous solidification stage. The results of the mathematical model, produced agreement with the experimental test carried out in the foundry and also agreed with other published data. The results on fluidity indicated that the fluidity of the molten metal was affected by mould temperature, pouring temperature, the velocity of the molten metal flow relative to the surface tension and the channel thickness. The data used in the mathematical model of the fluidity in thin section under vibration condition were deduced experimentally; namely, velocity of the molten metal and the heat transfer coefficient between the liquid metal and the chilled surface of the mould. This model was used to estimate the fluidity characteristics in thin wall investment casting with and without vibration. Real-time X-ray observation and computer modelling of the metal head-driven mould filling sequences reveal that no surface turbulence occurred when the liquid metal flowed into the thin section and the advance metal front continued to flow under surface tension control. X-ray was also used to measure the flow time and the velocity of the metal inside the thin channel and confirm the modification on Bernoullis Equation (kinetic energy+ potential energy = constant) to estimate the velocity relative to surface tension in the fluidity mathematical model. Flow- 3 D software was used to calculate the velocity of the liquid metal in the flowability filling type and the fluidity characteristics. Weibull analysis identifies the acceleration vibration as practical criterion to judge the reliability of casting. A vibration mould with vertical direction in the thin wall investment casting after filling can make the liquid metal flow into the thin section under surface tension control. This technique is used to achieve mould filling free from misrun defects and surface turbulence and this makes vibration casting a promising technique for producing high quality castings. On the basis of these findings, an operation window for the production of reliable castings has for the first time been developed in this research.
