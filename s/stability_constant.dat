25|$|The {{similarity}} in ionic radius between adjacent lanthanide elements {{makes it difficult}} to separate them from each other in naturally occurring ores and other mixtures. Historically, the very laborious processes of cascading and fractional crystallization were used. Because the lanthanide ions have slightly different radii, the lattice energy of their salts and hydration energies of the ions will be slightly different, leading to a small difference in solubility. Salts of the formula Ln(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O can be used. Industrially, the elements are separated from each other by solvent extraction. Typically an aqueous solution of nitrates is extracted into kerosene containing tri-n-butylphosphate. The strength of the complexes formed increases as the ionic radius decreases, so solubility in the organic phase increases. Complete separation can be achieved continuously by use of countercurrent exchange methods. The elements can also be separated by ion-exchange chromatography, making use {{of the fact that the}} <b>stability</b> <b>constant</b> for formation of EDTA complexes increases for log K ≈ 15.5 for − to log K ≈ 19.8 for −.|$|E

A polarographic study of the <b>stability</b> <b>constants</b> of the lead(II) -halides indicates that results become less reliable down the group.

40|$|Suitability of the pseudopolarographic {{approach}} for {{determination of the}} <b>stability</b> <b>constants</b> of labile metal complexes at low metal concentrations is explored. It is shown that the methodology based on the DeFord-Hume principle can be successfully applied to treat data obtained from pseudopolarograms. For reversible electrochemical systems, such as thallium(I) -chloride or cadmium(II) -chloride, the half-wave potential of a pseudopolarogram, or the corresponding "critical" potential, {{can be used to}} calculate the <b>stability</b> <b>constants.</b> A "formal" potential, evaluated by manual fitting of experimental and simulated (pseudo) polarograms, or a potential in a range where all curves yield a reversible slope, can be used as the "critical" potential. For systems in which reversibility of the electrochemical reaction changes (zinc(II) -oxalate and bismuth(Ill) -chloride), the shift of the half-wave potential depends both on the complexation parameters and on reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. Therefore, in such cases only the "critical" potential can be used for determination of <b>stability</b> <b>constants.</b> All calculated <b>stability</b> <b>constants</b> presented in the paper are in good agreement with the literature values.
