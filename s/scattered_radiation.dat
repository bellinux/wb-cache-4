5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Space {{constraints}} often {{present the}} greatest challenge in determining the lay-out of specific radiotherapy installations. To fulfill these constraints high density concrete is often employed in construction. We have undertaken a study to establish the transmission of primary, leakage and <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> through {{a particular type of}} high density concrete. In the course of this study various characteristics of leakage and <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> from a 10 MV linac have also been investigated. The results of these studies are reported in this thesis. To establish the correct chamber configuration required for the characterization of the transmission factors for primary, leakage and <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> and to determine the scatter-to-incidence dose ratio a, we have measured the build-up curves and verified the validity of the inverse square law for these different radiations. The build-up data for the <b>radiation</b> <b>scattered</b> from a humanoid phantom at different angles from the primary axis have shown that even at low scatter angles little to no build-up is required for <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> measurements...|$|R
40|$|During catheterized x-ray {{interventions}} {{the patient}} and medical staff is exposed to <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation,</b> {{as a consequence of}} tissue interactions. Ionizing radiation for medical purpose is potentially dangerous and can cause malignancy, skin damage and more. Studies have suggested an increase in the prevalence of eye lens cataract, thyroid cancer and left sided brain tumors in doctors. Therefore, it is mandatory to reduce the radiation dose in medicine, a principle known as ALARA (as low as Reasonably Achievable). Lead aprons, collars and shieldings are safety precautions to protect the team in the operating room. The x-ray equipment and surgical techniques are constantly evolving and the interventions become more complex which may increase the x-ray dose. Although x-ray imaging is required in interventional procedures endeavors of reducing radiation exposure to staff is of high interest. There is a need to increase the awareness about <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> and radiation protection efforts are gaining momentum. Initiative to train a dose reducing behavior by education and awareness are key documents within the European Union’s guidelines on Radiation protection. The aims of this thesis were to create a 3 D model for representation of real-time exposure and accumulated <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> to staff performing interventional x-ray procedures and identify parameters that affect the <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation.</b> Extensive measurements were made with real time dosimeters while irradiating an anthropomorphic phantom. For five lateral C-arm projections, 68 - 80 data points each were used to measure scatter dose distribution around the patient. In the typical operator position, the effect of craniocaudal projection angle, patient size, field size, image detector height and pulse rate on <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> dose was also investigated. It was possible to create a 3 D model from interpolated measurement data that can generate dose rate with promising results. Six out of eight modelled doses deviated +/- 26. 6 % from the validation cases. A model that delivers relative dose is an intuitive approach in education for interventional x-ray radiation safety. The staff position in relation to the x-ray source and the patient size have a significant correlation to the dose rate. Additional measurements are needed to ensure the reliability of the model. This work completes the effect of <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> distribution around the patient table, which is not yet evaluated as thoroughly by other authors...|$|R

25|$|Optical {{microscopy}} and {{electron microscopy}} involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation.</b> Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E

40|$|Using a {{collective}} coordinate numerical optimization procedure, we construct ground-state configurations of interacting particle systems in various space dimensions {{so that the}} <b>scattering</b> of <b>radiation</b> exactly matches a prescribed pattern {{for a set of}} wave vectors. We show that the constructed ground states are, counterintuitively, disordered (i. e., possess no long-range order) in the infinite-volume limit. We focus on three classes of configurations with unique <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> characteristics: (i) ``stealth'' materials, which are transparent to incident radiation at certain wavelengths; (ii) ``super-ideal'' gases, which <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> identically to that of an ensemble of ideal gas configurations for a selected set of wave vectors; and (iii) ``equi-luminous'' materials, which <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> equally intensely for a selected set of wave vectors. We find that ground-state configurations have an increased tendency to contain clusters of particles as one increases the prescribed luminosity. Limitations and consequences of this procedure are detailed. Comment: 44 pages, 16 figures, revtek...|$|R

In the small-particle (or long-wavelength) limit, conditions can occur for zero forward scatter, for complete polarization of <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> in other directions, and for asymmetry of forward scatter to backscatter. The special case in the small-particle limit provides interesting special instances of complete polarization and forward-scatter-to-backscatter asymmetry.|$|E

50|$|The {{energy of}} the <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> {{is less than the}} {{incident}} radiation for the Stokes line, and the {{energy of the}} <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> is more than the incident radiation for the anti-Stokes line. The energy increase or decrease from the excitation is related to the vibrational energy spacing in the ground electronic state of the molecule, and therefore the wavenumber of the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines are a direct measure of the vibrational energies of the molecule. The probability of an anti-Stokes transition is much less than that of a Stokes transition, since at room temperature the majority of molecules present are in the lowest vibrational level.|$|E

The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.|$|E
