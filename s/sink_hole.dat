5|$|Two homes {{along the}} Mamee River in Saint Andrew Parish were swept away while other {{residents}} in mountainous {{areas of the}} parish were stranded by landslides. Multiple residents became trapped within Gordon Town and hazardous weather hampered their rescue. A bridge in Mahoneyvale was destroyed. During the pre-dawn hours of July9, the Annotto, Pencar, and Motherford rivers burst their banks in Saint Mary Parish; more than 500people relocated from their homes in Annotto Bay. Flooding took place across much of Saint Catherine Parish with eight people requiring rescue. The Cobrun Gully submerged several homes in Bushy Park. Eastern areas of Clarendon Parish experienced significant flooding, with several communities cut-off or inundated. A <b>sink</b> <b>hole</b> in Halse Hall engulfed 35homes. An oil tank overflowed due to heavy rain at a Petrojam Refinery in Kingston Harbour resulting in a minor oil spill. Petrojam crews cleaned the spill within a day. Some streets in downtown Kingston were flooded. Effects in Trelawny Parish were relatively limited, with J$16million (US$259,000) in agricultural damage.|$|E

The General Cañas Highway connects the municipality of Alajuela to San José {{and was the}} subject of national ridicule when a <b>sink</b> <b>hole</b> temporarily closed it in 2012, causing enormous traffic problems throughout the metropolitan region. The Ciudad Colón to Orotina connects Orotina to San José. The Pan-American Highway runs through the province.|$|E
50|$|The Lost River {{is about}} 87 mi long, and its name {{is derived from}} the fact that at least 23 mi of the primary course of the river flows {{completely}} underground. The river's underground channels may in fact cover hundreds of miles, as the underground caverns have never been fully explored. The river disappears into a series of <b>sink</b> <b>holes</b> of the type that are abundant in the karstland of southern Indiana. In one square mile there are as many as 1,022 <b>sink</b> <b>holes.</b> The river slips into and out of these <b>sink</b> <b>holes</b> at various points flowing into hidden underground caverns that connect with multiple other streams, rivers, and springs.|$|R

25|$|This {{operation}} backfired and had {{devastating effects}} on Pakistan's economy. President Khan {{saw this as}} a major economic failure despite Khan's permission granted to Bhutto for the approval of her economic policies. Khan blamed Bhutto for this extensive economic slowdown and her policy that failed to stop the illegal immigration. Khan attributed Bhutto's government members corruption in government-owned industries as the major <b>sink</b> <b>hole</b> in Pakistan's economy that failed to compete with neighbouring India's economy.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 6,000 years ago, Tampa Bay {{formed as}} a {{brackish}} drowned river valley type estuary with a wide mouth connecting it to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to that time, {{it was a large}} fresh water lake, possibly fed by the Floridan Aquifer through natural springs. Though the exact process of the lake-to-bay transformation is not completely understood, the leading theory is that rising seas levels following the last ice age coupled with the formation of a massive <b>sink</b> <b>hole</b> near the current mouth of the bay created a connection between the lake and the gulf.|$|E
25|$|Marvel Cave is a National Natural Landmark {{located just}} west of Branson, Missouri, on top of Roark Mountain in Stone County. The cave was known by the Osage Indians in the early 16th century, after a tribe member fell through the cave's main entrance, a sinkhole. There is {{evidence}} that in 1541 the Spanish explored the cave, but the first recorded expedition was in 1869, led by Henry T. Blow. The unofficial Stone County chapter of Bald Knobbers, a local group of vigilantes, were rumored to have taken people {{to the top of}} Roark Mountain, and thrown them in the <b>sink</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Petersham Hole was a <b>sink</b> <b>hole</b> {{caused by}} {{subsidence}} of a sewer which forced the total {{closure of the}} A307 road in Petersham in 1979–80. As the hole and subsequent repair work had forced a total closure of this main road between Richmond and Kingston, traffic was diverted through the park and the Richmond, Ham, and Kingston gates remained open throughout the day and night. [...] The park road was widened at Ham Cross near Ham Gate to accommodate temporary traffic lights. About 10 deer a month were killed by traffic while the diversion was in operation. In the 2012 Summer Olympics the men's and the women's cycling road races went through the park.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{guided tours}} {{in the cave}} were in 1894 run by the Lynches. They lasted 8 hours and were by candle or lantern. Visitors climbed through the <b>sink</b> <b>hole</b> on a [...] ladder down {{to the top of}} the pile. Then you were {{instructed}} to slide down the pile to the bottom. You received a candle to guide your way. The tours included the Egyptian Room (now the Shoe Room), the Lakes Passage, and you saw formations such as the Great White Throne (now the Liberty Bell), and the Spring Room Sentinel (now just the Sentinel). After the Hershends started tours in 1950, they removed the wooden stairs, and added concrete stairs and paths through the cave. Current tours last for about an hour, and are limited to 60 people.|$|E
2500|$|The Cathedral Room {{is one of}} {{the largest}} cave {{entrance}} rooms found in North America. The room measures [...] high, [...] wide, and [...] feet long. Entrance to the cave is made through a <b>sink</b> <b>hole</b> which is 94’ deep. Two large openings are at the bottom of the sink. Rocks, trees, dirt and animals falling through the sinkhole and falling boulders from the ceiling throughout the centuries has left a debris pile measuring [...] tall. This pile is sometimes referred to as the Underground Mountain. On July 7, 1963 an underground altitude record was set by Don Piccard by flying a hot air balloon around the massive room. Later, in 1994 five hot air balloons were flown simultaneously in the Cathedral Room in celebration of the 100th year anniversary of giving cave tours.|$|E
40|$|The epigeic fauna in the <b>sink</b> <b>holes</b> was studied using {{formaldehyde}} ground traps at 14 -day intervals from April to October in 2002 and 2003. A {{total of}} 5 transects of traps have been installed within 5 selected {{areas of the}} northern part of the Moravian Karst. Areas within the district of Vilémovice, Lažánky and Ostrov near Macocha villages have been studied in particular. <b>Sink</b> <b>holes</b> have been selected on the basis of how they are probably influenced by human activities (types such as regularly mown <b>sink</b> <b>holes</b> within a thoroughly exploited field – 1, <b>sink</b> <b>holes</b> partially or totally overgrown by shrubs – 3 and 2, <b>sink</b> <b>holes</b> with fully developed trees – 4, <b>sink</b> <b>holes</b> within an intensely exploited meadow – 5. It was the aim of this study to determine the species composition of individual areas, numbers of individual species, differences among areas characterised by synoecological characteristics such as the dominance, Shannon-Wieneręs index of species diversity, equitability, Jaccardęs index of similarity and to try to express the degree of anthropogenic influence. Similarity of individual areas has also been evaluated by means of the cluster analysis (on the basis of the Jaccardęs index). Eudominant species were Abax parallelepipedus, Anchomenus dorsalis, Carabus ullrichi, Microlestes maurus, Poecilus cupreus and Pterostichus melanarius. Species such as Aptinus bombarda, Licinus depressus, Molops elatus and Syntomus obscuroguttatus were the most important ones. The highest and lowest values of the index of species diversity were found in the area No. 4, and 1 and 2, respectively. Equitability was the highest and the lowest in the area No. 4 and 1, respectively. According to the Jaccardęs index, areas No. 2 and 3, and No. 1 and 4 were the most and least similar ones, respectively. A total of 53. 3 %, 45. 6 % and 1. 1 % of species could, be classified as belonging to the group E, A and R, respectively. The group E represents eurytopic species inhabiting a large variety of habitats, the group A contains species of more or less natural habitats while in the group R there are species with the most narrow ecological valence. The highest index of community was in the area No. 4, while the lowest in the area No. 1. The total results and the evaluation of characteristics such as dominance, index of diversity, equitability, ecological bond to the habitat expressed by species classification of A, E or R and the index the carabid beetle community proves the fact that areas No. 4 and 5 are under the least anthropogenic influence...|$|R
