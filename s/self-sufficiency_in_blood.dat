They reported that the buildings were never designed for the scale of production envisaged. They commented: 'If this were a commercial operation we would have no hesitation in recommending that manufacture should cease until the facility was upgraded to a minimum acceptable level'. BPL was rescued by Crown Immunity. Among their recommendations the Inspectorate advised: 'Under no circumstances should production of any product be increased under the existing manufacturing conditions'. Meanwhile, the existing plant continued production, relying on Crown Immunity to dispense with all {{the requirements of the}} Medicines Act, but was able to meet only about 40% of the national requirements". Archer also found that [...] "in 1987 Lord Owen learned that the objective of <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> products had not been achieved. He wrote on 17 November to John Moore, then Secretary of State for Social Services. Mr Moore replied on 21 January. The fact that the reply required eight weeks of research suggests that self-sufficiency was not a priority theme in the Department". Lord Owen told the Archer inquiry that [...] "having told Parliament on 8 July 1975 that the target was to achieve self-sufficiency 'within two to three years'; the fact that the target had not been achieved should have been made known to Parliament".|$|E

Rondiak was born in 1934 in Hořice v Podkrkonoší, a small East Bohemian town where is father was a renowned and loved general medical practitioner who died when Jiří was young, thus increasing {{his interest in the}} study of medicine. Over 1952 – 1959 he studied at the Medical Faculty of Charles´ University in Prague and over 1959 – 1960 he worked at the Dept. of internal medicine in Hořice, and initially intended to specialize in obstetrics until he was impeded by a physical injury. Obsterics' loss was transfusion's gain and in 1960 he started working at the Blood Bank of the Faculty Hospital in Hradec Králové, where he passed board examinations in blood banking and also underwent the Tropical medicine course of Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic. By 1977 he had been appointed head of the Blood Bank of the Faculty Hospital in Hradec Králové and was the Chief Blood transfusion specialist for the East Bohemian region, holding these posts until 2002 and to the 1990 's respectively, responsible for the performance of the blood banks in the whole region. His achievements in his home environment included the building and continuous improvement of the transfusion service, including the challenges of infectious agents in the 1980 s- 90 s and the establishment of one of the first plasmapheresis centres in the country as the Czech Republic emerged from the Russian-domination era and moved towards <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> products.

40|$|Wheat {{is central}} to the {{government}} of Egypt's food security policy which is based on increasing <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> wheat {{on the one hand and}} subsidizing bread for consumers on the other hand. This paper uses a multi-market approach to assess the impact of increased <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> wheat and a switch to a cash-transfer subsidy on cropping patterns, food consumption, production, input use, and income. The findings show that raising <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> wheat would reduce reliance on imports but would also adversely affect other sectors, in particular livestock. At full <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> wheat, berseem the main animal feed would nearly vanish, with negative repercussions for livestock production. The simulations also show that a move to a cash transfer subsidy system would improve targeting of the poor and eliminate distortions on the consumption side. Finally, under the current wheat policy an increase in the world price of wheat would intensify the adverse consequences of both self-sufficiency and consumer subsidies at the agricultural sector level and economy wide.

The first part contains a theoretical treatment of the subject. There is discussed the issue of hydrocephalus and the issue of <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> self-care. In hydrocephalus, the author first examines in detail the anatomy of the cerebral ventricles and the creation, composition and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid. The following is a detailed discussion {{about the nature of the}} disease itself, its types, causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Finally, there is analyzed the quality of life of patients with this disease. In the area of self- sufficiency, the author focuses on the very concept of self-sufficiency, starting with a general description of this term and continuously moving towards a description of its different aspects with regard to movement and physical activity the patient, his clothing and hygiene, emptying the urine and stool and nutrition. The second part is conceived as an empirical. There are evaluated, what was found by using a questionnaire survey. The author examines whether the patients were improved after surgery in specific areas of self-sufficiency, and if so, to what extent. Areas examined are <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> food, hygiene, emptying, walking and dressing [...] . ...|$|R

Malaysia saw its <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> food increasing and <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> cereal declining following policies to diversify its food base and displacing rice production.

40|$|Having studied medical {{literature}} and having gained practical experience in {{taking care of}} patients with amputation in the Surgery Ward of the Hospital České Budějovice a. s., I decided to focus my bachelor thesis on: The role of nurses <b>in</b> promoting <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> patients with amputation during postoperative period. Lower-extremity amputation {{can be defined as}} the removal of a peripheral body part resulting from an injury or surgical operation. Currently, road transport in particular accounts for a high accident frequency. Many young people experience the loss of a body part due to injuries. As a planned surgical procedure, amputation of the lower extremity is performed in order to relieve or eliminate pain or in order to prevent infection or metastases from spreading. Lower-extremity amputation changes the life quality of most people. Health professionals provide the care for amputations according to the standards and lead the patients towards gaining self-sufficiency. The qualitative research was aimed at: 1. mapping the role of nurses <b>in</b> promoting <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> the patients with amputation during postoperative period, as viewed by both the nurses and the patients, and 2. determining the degree of successful practising <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> the patients with amputation during postoperative period. The relevant research questions were set as follows: 1. What is the role of nurses <b>in</b> promoting <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> the patients with lower-extremity amputation, as viewed by nurses? 2. What is the influence of nursing on the self-sufficiency of the patients with lower-extremity amputation? 3. How do nurses practise <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> the patients with lower-extremity amputation during postoperative period? The qualitative research was based on the use of in-depth interviews with the nurses and patients. The research sample included patients with lower-extremity amputation and nurses of the Surgery and Traumatology Wards in the Hospital České Budějovice a. s [...] As regards the promotion of <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> the patients with lower-extremity amputation, the results indicate that the nurses from the Surgery and Traumatology Wards performed mainly activities aimed at satisfying patients´ physiological needs (hygiene, food and fluid intake, excretion, assistance in moving and in the need to be pain-free). Nurses of the Surgery Ward consider practising <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> these patients more demanding in view of the patient´s age and the type of amputation related to a chronic disease. Patients believe that nursing care during the hospitalization has a significant influence on their self-sufficiency. The nurses of both the Surgery and Traumatology Wards consider practising self-sufficiency to be of great importance and can observe different effects as related to the patient´s age and the cause of amputation. Both the nurses and the patients agree that practising self-sufficiency includes hygiene, assistance with food intake and excretion, getting up from bed to assume vertical position, practising movability and managing pain. The investigation objectives were fulfilled and the obtained results may help nurses improve the quality of nursing, which will contribute to the improvement of {{the quality of life in}} the patients with amputation...|$|R
