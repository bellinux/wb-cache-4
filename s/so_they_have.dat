5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi infect {{and kill}} insects, {{including}} {{a variety of}} pest species, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been investigated as possible biological control agents. A variety of Ascomycetes, including Beauveria, Lecanicillium, Metarhizium, and Paecilomyces have promising features for use as biological insecticides. Metarhizium in particular can help to control outbreaks of locusts.|$|E
5|$|Many tall palms are {{herbaceous}} monocots; {{these do}} not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood. In many tall palms, the terminal bud {{on the main}} stem {{is the only one}} to develop, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to , but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.|$|E

5|$|October 5, 1841—No {{work was}} done today, as all the people have it to gather their own crop—It is a rule which we have, to give all the negroes {{one day in the}} spring to plant, and one day in the fall to reap, and as there is a rule on Sea Island {{plantations}} fixing the tasks required each day to be done, it occurs, during the long days of summer, that the hand is generally done his task by 2 p.m., often sooner, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> abundance of time to work their own crop, fish, etc., etc.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
5|$|On the way, {{they start}} the car after Meg puts mousetraps {{for the big}} mouse. Soon they are stopped by the survivors, who were looking for food, but the griffins don't have any food <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to {{distract}} them. They continue their journey {{only to find that}} the car has run out of gas. The griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found new home, but Peter thinks that our main journey was Natick as Lois takes an apple and bites it while an old man plays the song. So they once again continue their journey after Lois throws the apple at him. They made to natick, but there is no factory. Stewie yells that they done of their life only to trip and get covered in nuclear waste. Upon the sun lights up and shows the factory is still standing and in perfect condition. Expecting to be able to live off of the snackfood while stewie mutates his arms into tentacles, they establish the town of New Quahog around the factory. Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out how New Quahog is a peaceful place with no violence, Peter says that they are completely defenseless finds metal to make guns. Later stewie has transformed into an octopus, when lois tries put stewie on with the pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays with ink but misses it. Then he tries to get on the celling only to fall off and lois catch him then says that he getting heavy. Stewie suddenly lays hundreds of eggs. Peter shows and made guns that he uses the pipes from the city's water irrigation system to make guns and other weapons, outraging the citizens.|$|E

25|$|Since {{conditions}} {{from city}} to city differ, every district heating system is unique. In addition, nations have different access to primary energy carriers and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a different approach on how to address heating markets within their borders.|$|E

25|$|For PSL, n2−1 is the {{dimension}} of SL(n, K), which is a covering space of PSL, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the same dimension. More casually, PSL differs from SL and from PGL by a finite group in each case, so {{the dimension}}s agree.|$|E
25|$|Crumbing forward pockets do not {{exclusively}} crumb the ball. Sometimes, they lead {{for the ball}} like full forwards, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to be competent at marking the ball.

25|$|A 2009 {{study found}} higher urinary {{concentrations}} {{in young children}} than in adults under typical exposure scenarios. In adults, BPA is eliminated from the body through a detoxification process in the liver. In infants and children, this pathway is not fully developed <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a decreased ability to clear BPA from their systems. Several recent studies of children have found levels that exceed the EPAs suggested safe limit figure.|$|E

25|$|It was {{reported}} in September 2003, an SVR RF agent in London was making preparations to assassinate Boris Berezovsky with a binary weapon, {{and that is why}} Berezovsky had been speedily granted asylum in Britain. GRU officers who killed Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar in 2004 reportedly claimed that supporting SVR agents let them down by not evacuating them in time, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been arrested by Qatar authorities.|$|E
25|$|Like other arachnids, spiders {{are unable}} to chew their food, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a mouth part shaped like a short {{drinking}} straw that they use to suck up the liquefied insides of their prey. However, {{they are able to}} eat their own silk to recycle proteins needed in the production of new spider webs. Some spiders, such as the dewdrop spiders (Argyrodes), even eat the silk of other spider species.|$|E
25|$|Coltivirus is a genus of viruses. Viruses are {{intracellular}} parasites that do {{not have}} the necessary means to reproduce on their own, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to hijack the machinery of a host cell instead. Only then can they synthesize their viral proteins and make progeny. There are two types of viruses, distinguished by their type of genetic material. DNA viruses have genomes consisting of deoxyribonucleic acid (or DNA), while RNA viruses, like Coltivirus, have an RNA (ribonucleic acid) genome.|$|E

25|$|Another {{application}} of patterned SAMs is the functionalization of biosensors. The tail groups {{can be modified}} <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an affinity for cells, proteins, or molecules. The SAM can then be placed onto a biosensor so that binding of these molecules can be detected. The ability to pattern these SAMs allows them {{to be placed in}} configurations that increase sensitivity and do not damage or interfere with other components of the biosensor.|$|E
25|$|The National Health Service is {{publicly}} owned. It attracts {{medical tourism}} principally to specialist centres in London. Some private {{hospitals and clinics}} in the United Kingdom are medical tourism destinations. Very few UK private hospitals have gone through independent international accreditation (they have the mandatory registration with the UK's watchdog, the Care Quality Commission), <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not as yet measured themselves against the best clinics and hospitals elsewhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|Sikhs have {{emigrated to}} {{countries}} {{all over the}} world, especially to English-speaking and East Asian nations.

However, they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada.|$|E
