40|$|<b>Self-repairs</b> {{have been}} the subject of {{investigation}} in a number of research areas, notably psycholinguistics and conversation analysis. This study has aimed at the examination of <b>self-repairs</b> in second language classroom presentations. Specifically, it has sought to gain insight into <b>self-repairs</b> in naturally occurring talk and to explicate the possible relationships between the variables of age, sex, and educational background and <b>self-repair</b> behaviour of L 2 speakers as well as the possible link between <b>self-repair</b> and proficiency. Accomplishing these required a scrutiny of individual <b>self-repairs</b> and their classification. However, the classifications which have traditionally been used in the psycholinguistic approach suffer from a number of shortcomings, as they are usually based on the analysis of surface forms of <b>self-repairs.</b> Because of the subjectivity involved in this process, there has been considerable variation in terms of classes of <b>self-repairs</b> and also the decision as to where a given <b>self-repair</b> belongs. An in-depth analysis of <b>self-repair</b> data revealed that <b>self-repairs</b> do cluster into categories. This analysis also yielded a set of features which are relevant to the study of <b>self-repairs.</b> In addition to showing that the established categories are mutually exclusive, comparison of major categories of <b>self-repairs</b> according to these features, which characterise the trajectory of <b>self-repairs,</b> resulted in the explication of a number of regularities in the way L 2 speakers carry out <b>self-repairs.</b> Having established a data-driven classification of repairs, an attempt was made to see whether learner variables of age, sex and educational background have any significant effect on <b>self-repairs.</b> It turned out that none of these variables have a significant effect on <b>self-repairs.</b> In addition, it became clear that while beginning, intermediate, and advanced L 2 speakers have been shown to demonstrate significant proficiency-related differences, these differences fade away when they come from the same proficiency level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Self-repair</b> is a {{key area}} of {{functionality}} in overlay networks, especially as overlays become increasingly widely deployed and relied upon. Today’s common practice is for each overlay to implement its own <b>self-repair</b> mechanism. However, apart from leading to duplication of effort, this practice inhibits choice and flexibility in selecting from among multiple <b>self-repair</b> mechanisms that make different deploymentspecific trade-offs between dependability and overhead. In this paper, we present an approach in which overlay networks provide functional behaviour only, and rely for their <b>self-repair</b> on a generic <b>self-repair</b> service. In our previously-published work in this area, we {{have focused on the}} distributed algorithms encapsulated within our <b>self-repair</b> service. In this paper we focus instead on API and integration issues. In particular, we show how overlay implementations can interact with our generic <b>self-repair</b> service using a small and simple API. We concretise the discussion by illustrating the use of this API from within an implementation of the popular Chord overlay. This involves minimal changes to the implementation while considerably increasing its available range of <b>self-repair</b> strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the face}} of harsh natural {{environment}} applications such as earth-orbiting and deep space satellites, underwater sea vehicles, strong electromagnetic interference and temperature stress, the circuits faults appear easily. Circuit faults will inevitably lead to serious losses of availability or impeded mission success without <b>self-repair</b> over the mission duration. Traditional fault-repair methods based on redundant fault-tolerant technique are straightforward to implement, yet their area, power and weight cost can be excessive. Moreover they utilize all plug-in or component level circuits to realize redundant backup, such that their applicability is limited. Hence, a novel <b>self-repair</b> technology based on evolvable hardware (EHW) and reparation balance technology (RBT) is proposed. Its cost is low, and fault <b>self-repair</b> of various circuits and devices can be realized through dynamic configuration. Making full use of the fault signals, correcting circuit can be found through EHW technique to realize the balance and compensation of the fault output-signals. In this paper, the <b>self-repair</b> model was analyzed which based on EHW and RBT technique, the specific <b>self-repair</b> strategy was studied, the corresponding <b>self-repair</b> circuit fault system was designed, and the typical faults were simulated and analyzed which combined with the actual electronic devices. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed fault <b>self-repair</b> strategy was feasible. Compared to traditional techniques, fault <b>self-repair</b> based on EHW consumes fewer hardware resources, and the scope of fault <b>self-repair</b> was expanded significantly...|$|R

6000|$|... 3. Another opinion often {{maintained}} is, that wages (meaning {{of course}} money wages) {{vary with the}} price of food; rising when it rises, and falling when it falls. This opinion is, I conceive, only partially true; and, in so far as true, in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor: since the price of food, when it affects wages at all, affects them through that law. Dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages (unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity): or rather, it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed; since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment, and lower the labor market against themselves. But dearness or cheapness of food, when of a permanent character, and capable of being calculated on beforehand, may affect wages. (1.) In the first place, if the laborers have, as is often the case, no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children, it follows that, if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages, a greater number of the children will prematurely die; and thus wages will ultimately be higher, but only because the number of people will be smaller, than if food had remained cheap. (2.) But, secondly, even though wages were high enough to admit of food’s becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries; though they could bear, physically speaking, to be worse off, perhaps they would not consent to be so. They might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries, and sooner than forego which, they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication; so that wages would rise, not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births. In these cases, then, wages do adapt themselves to the price of food, though after an interval of almost a generation.(170) If wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction, to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers, a rise of the price of food, or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances, may operate in two ways: (a) it may correct itself by a rise of wages, brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population; or (b) it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class, in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort. In that case the injury done to them will be permanent, and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum, tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before. It is to be feared that, of the two modes in which the cause may operate, the last (b) is the most frequent, or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions, ascribing a <b>self-repairing</b> quality to the calamities which befall the laboring-classes, practically of no validity.|$|E

"Naturally," [...] I persisted, [...] "it is less easy to {{you than}} to me to imagine our race transcended and superseded, since the more energy a being is possessed of, the harder it must be for him to {{conceive}} his own death. But I, {{from the point of}} view of a reflective carp, can easily imagine myself and my congeners dispensed with in the frame of things and giving way not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of Entity. What I would ask you is, to show me why, since each new invention casts a new light along the pathway of discovery, and each new combination or structure brings into play more conditions than its inventor foresaw, there should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and chemical powers that it would find and assimilate the material to supply its own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular movements reproduce itself by some process of fission or budding. This last stage having been reached, either by man's contrivance or as an unforeseen result, one sees that the process of natural selection must drive men altogether out of the field; for they will long before have begun to sink into the miserable condition of those unhappy characters in fable who, having demons or djinns at their beck, and being obliged to supply them with work, found too much of everything done in too short a time. What demons so potent as molecular movements, none the less tremendously potent for not carrying the futile cargo of a consciousness screeching irrelevantly, like a fowl tied head downmost to the saddle of a swift horseman? Under such uncomfortable circumstances our race will have diminished with the diminishing call on their energies, and by the time that the <b>self-repairing</b> and reproducing machines arise, all but a few of the rare inventors, calculators, and speculators will have become pale, pulpy, and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration, and behold around them a scanty hydrocephalous offspring. As to the breed of the ingenious and intellectual, their nervous systems will at last have been overwrought in following the molecular revelations of the immensely more powerful unconscious race, and they will naturally, as the less energetic combinations of movement, subside like the flame of a candle in the sunlight Thus the feebler race, whose corporeal adjustments happened to be accompanied with a maniacal consciousness which imagined itself moving its mover, will have vanished, as all less adapted existences do before the fittest--i.e., the existence composed of the most persistent groups of movements and the most capable of incorporating new groups in harmonious relation. Who--if our consciousness is, as I have been given to understand, a mere stumbling of our organisms on their way to unconscious perfection--who shall say that those fittest existences will not be found along the track of what we call inorganic combinations, which will carry on the most elaborate processes as mutely and painlessly as we are now told that the minerals are metamorphosing themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the earth's crust? Thus this planet may be filled with beings who will be blind and deaf as the inmost rock, yet will execute changes as delicate and complicated as those of human language and all the intricate web of what we call its effects, without sensitive impression, without sensitive impulse: there may be, let us say, mute orations, mute rhapsodies, mute discussions, and no consciousness there even to enjoy the silence." ...|$|E
