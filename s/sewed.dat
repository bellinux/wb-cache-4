5|$|Nan Chiau High School's uniform {{is closely}} linked to its {{heritage}} as a former traditional Chinese school. Originally, the school uniform was in full white with the Chinese name of the school <b>sewed</b> on the right chest level of the blouse, much similar to other institutions with Chinese heritage. Students in the senior high and pre-university section wore white shirts with dark coloured skirts, before the pre-university classes were made mandatory to be taught at junior colleges, a policy declared by the ministry of education in 1979. Nearing the 1990s, the school uniform was switched to be worn with dark coloured school pants or skirt, with dark coloured school tag was <b>sewed</b> {{on the left side}} of the shirt. The uniform was redesigned as an effort to preserve the school's identity along with the relocation of the campus in 2000, which integrated the original heritage of the uniform in the 1960s and the 1990s.|$|E

And then we just <b>sewed</b> it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E

5|$|Currently, male {{students}} wear white studded shirts with Traditional Chinese {{characters of the}} school name on it in red. Navy blue shorts are worn for years one and two, and long pants for upper secondary levels. The six metal buttons bearing the school name is <b>sewed</b> onto the shirt as a modification to the traditional design adopted by other traditional Chinese schools, where rings were used to secure the buttons. Fe{{male students}} wear white blouses bearing the Traditional Chinese characters of the school name on it in red, with navy blue pleated skirts. During Assemblies and important functions, every student will wear a red-coloured school tie.|$|E
5|$|She and Charles had six {{children}} together. Before {{her first child}} Charles's birth, Lucinda had a premonition that her son would not live very long. She told her mother that the dress she <b>sewed</b> for him was like a funeral shroud, and after baby Charles's death at age two, she buried him in it. Lucinda's second child, a daughter named Rosette, also died in infancy. Dalton often references these lost child infants in her poetry. Her third child, Clifford, was born on February 18, 1875. Charles was a joint owner of a store in Beaver and also hauled freight to surrounding areas. However, his income was not sufficient to support his four wives and many children.|$|E
5|$|When Eva {{was a year}} old, Duarte {{returned}} permanently to {{his legal}} family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her children in penury. Ibarguren and her children were forced {{to move to the}} poorest area of Junín. Los Toldos was a village in the dusty region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty. To support herself and her children, Ibarguren <b>sewed</b> clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Agoncillo was a {{daughter}} of a rich family {{in her hometown of}} Taal, Batangas. Finishing her studies at Santa Catalina College, she acquired her learning in music and feminine crafts. At the age of 30, Agoncillo married Filipino lawyer and jurist Don Felipe Agoncillo and bore him six children. Her marriage led to her important role in Philippine history. When her husband was exiled to Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, Agoncillo {{and the rest of the}} family joined him and temporarily resided there to avoid the anti-Filipino hostility of some foreign countries. While in Hong Kong, General Emilio Aguinaldo requested her to sew a flag that would represent their country. Agoncillo, her eldest daughter and a friend manually <b>sewed</b> the flag in accordance with General Aguinaldo's design which later became the official flag of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They <b>sewed</b> jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt <b>sewed</b> all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design a drug delivery system (DDS) for the in vivo promotion of macrophage recruitment. As the drug, a water-insoluble agonist of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate type 1 receptor (<b>SEW</b> 2871) was selected. <b>SEW</b> 2871 (<b>SEW)</b> was water-solubilized by micelle formation with gelatin grafted by L-lactic acid oligomer. <b>SEW</b> micelles were mixed with gelatin, followed by dehydrothermal crosslinking of gelatin to obtain gelatin hydrogels incorporating <b>SEW</b> micelles. <b>SEW</b> was released from the hydrogels incorporating <b>SEW</b> micelles in vitro and in vivo. The water-solubilized <b>SEW</b> showed in vitro macrophage migration activity. When implanted into the back subcutis or the skin wound defect of mice, the hydrogel incorporating <b>SEW</b> micelles promoted macrophage migration toward the tissue around the implanted site to a significantly great extent compared with SEW-free hydrogel and that mixed with <b>SEW</b> micelles. The hydrogel is a promising DDS to enhance macrophage recruitment in vivo...|$|R

5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and <b>sewed</b> it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he <b>sewed</b> two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, <b>sewed</b> together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 This study {{investigated}} the relationships between motivation for <b>sewing</b> and: amount of <b>sewing,</b> perceived depersonalization of the job, and creativity among employed women. <b>Sewing</b> for creativity and <b>sewing</b> for economic reasons were the two motivations investigated. Previous studies indicated that <b>sewing</b> for economic reasons was the prevalent motivation for <b>sewing.</b> Current literature has indicated that <b>sewing</b> for creativity may also be an important motivation. Studies have also indicated that leisure activities may compensate for characteristics perceived to be lacking in the job. The possibility that <b>sewing</b> for creativity might be this type of leisure activity was also investigated in this study. The {{study was limited to}} home sewers who were full-time employees. A sample was collected of women who had taken a <b>sewing</b> class at a retail fabric store, and who worked over 30 hours per week. Fifty women who returned completed questionnaires were included in this study. Measures of <b>sewing</b> for creativity, <b>sewing</b> for economic reasons, and perceived depersonalization of the job were developed. All of these measures were tested for validity by item analysis and for reliability by test-retest. The measure of creativity was also tested for validity by item analysis. The findings indicated positive relationships at a significant level between <b>sewing</b> for creativity and: amount of <b>sewing,</b> and number of children out of school who lived at home. <b>Sewing</b> for economic reasons was positively related at a significant level to: age of the respondent, and number of children who lived at home. <b>Sewing</b> for creativity was not significantly related to perceived depersonalization of the job...|$|R

5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics <b>sewed</b> better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Verena Dietzel, {{creator of}} the fashion label V-Couture, who specializes in {{different}} kinds of corsets, were enlisted to create clothing for the video, {{as well as a}} Grammy Awards performance. Dietzel explained that she had initially thought Madonna's e-mail as spam, however after confirmation from the singer's assistant stylist, B. Åkerlund, she started working on the designs. Within 48 hours she <b>sewed</b> a new corset, as well as created two new ones, by basing them on the only information provided to her, that of Madonna's bra-size. She had to search on Google for deducing the rest of the singer's proportions. In total four different corsets were shipped off to Madonna. Lebanese designer Shady Zeineldine was also contacted by Åkerlund, who visited the designer's press conference in Los Angeles, and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for the video. After the deal was finalized, he created a custom made matador jacket which Madonna wore in the video. Another dress was a bodysuit, featuring a nude satin-stretch corset covered in three different types of lace, a black chiffon silk top and a satin tie. There was also a red velvet bolero jacket.|$|E

40|$|<b>SEW</b> {{refers to}} the stock of affect-related values that an owning family derives from its family business.

However, little study {{has been done to}} measure <b>SEW</b> directly and to measure the effect of <b>SEW</b> on family firms’ strategic choices.     Within the context of family-owned Hidden Champions, this thesis study replicates the five-dimension model proposed by Berrone et al. in an empirical study to verify the psychometric measurement on the degree of <b>SEW.</b> Furthermore, internationalization has been chosen as an example to demonstrate the effects of <b>SEW</b> on family firms’ strategic choices and outcomes.   This study has verified {{the reliability and validity of}} the <b>SEW</b> scale and <b>SEW’s</b> five subscales constructed. Furthermore, the measurement on <b>SEW</b> and its five dimensions has been applied to examine the effects of <b>SEW</b> and its five dimensions on the internationalization of family firms. The findings reveal that <b>SEW</b> has a negative effect on the internationalization of family firms, which is mainly due to the negative effect of Family Control and Influence...|$|R
