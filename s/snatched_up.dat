5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|Rendered {{unable to}} speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove a {{tapestry}} (or a robe) that told her story and had it sent to Procne. Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband. After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son, and {{he became aware of}} their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal. He <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters. They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis. In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance. The gods transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale. Subsequently, the gods would transform Tereus into a hoopoe.|$|E
25|$|The {{stabbing}} {{took place}} {{as the result of}} an argument over some opera tickets that a customer, John Finch, the son of the Countess of Winchelsea and brother to Lord Finch, had given to Sally's sister instead of Sally. During the argument in the Three Tuns Tavern in Chandos Street, Covent Garden, Finch and Salisbury both became angry and Salisbury <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> the knife she had been given with her meal and stabbed Finch in the chest. She was apparently immediately remorseful and called for a surgeon to attend Finch. Finch was gravely ill for some time, but forgave Salisbury on the spot. When he later recovered, he wished to visit her in prison to reiterate his forgiveness.|$|E

'But later, I was cramped and desired to walk, as I am used.' ...|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} August Cameron's {{forces had}} grown to 6000 effectives. He had the {{armoured}} 40-ton paddle-steamer Avon—20m long, drawing one metre of water and armed with a 12-pounder Armstrong in the bows—as well as boats, barges and canoes. But Māori defences had also grown: the so-called Meremere Line—a 22km-long line of fortifications that spread from Pukekawa to Meremere and Paparata—had been built, commanding about 2000 square kilometres of bush and manned by a force of up to 1500. The Meremere Line allowed bands of between 20 and 200 Māori warriors to freely cross the Waikato River and harass troops and kill settlers towards Auckland. On 25 August a party of Māori <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> the rifles and ammunition {{from a group of}} 25 soldiers who were timber-felling beside the Great South Road—part of an effort to destroy cover for Māori raiders intent on mounting further ambushes—and killed two soldiers. On 2 September a British party of 62 men was fired on from the rear during a march on the village of Pokeno, but managed to pursue their attackers and inflict some casualties.|$|E
500|$|The Princess was buried, her son at her feet, in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 19 November 1817. [...] A {{monument}} was erected, {{by public}} subscription, at her tomb. [...] It {{was not long}} before the public began to pin blame for the tragedy. [...] The Queen and the Prince Regent were blamed for not being present at the birth, though Charlotte had specifically requested that they stay away. [...] Although the postmortem was inconclusive, many blamed Croft for his care of the Princess. [...] The Prince Regent refused to blame Croft; nevertheless, three months after Charlotte's death and while attending another young woman, Croft <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> a gun and fatally shot himself. [...] The [...] "triple obstetric tragedy"—death of child, mother, and practitioner—led to significant changes in obstetric practice, with obstetricians who favoured intervention in protracted labour, including in particular more liberal use of forceps, gaining ground over those who did not.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the men}} was the audacious Stanislas-Marie Maillard, a {{prominent}} vainqueur of the Bastille, who eagerly <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> his own drum and led the infectious cry of [...] "à Versailles!" [...] Maillard was a popular figure among the market-women, and by unofficial acclamation was given a leadership role. Although hardly a gentle man, Maillard helped suppress by force of character the mob's worst instincts; he rescued the Hôtel de Villes quartermaster, Pierre-Louis Lefebvre-Laroche, a priest commonly known as Abbé Lefebvre, who had been strung up on a lamppost for trying to safeguard its gun powder storage. The Hôtel de Ville itself was ransacked as the crowd surged through taking its provisions and weapons, but Maillard helped prevent it from burning down the entire building. In due course, the rioters' attention turned again to Versailles, and they filtered back to the streets. Maillard deputized {{a number of women}} as group leaders and gave a loose sense of order to the proceedings as he led the crowd out of the city in the driving rain.|$|E

2500|$|The woman's [...] "male child" [...] is a {{reference}} to Jesus (Revelation 12:5), since he is destined to [...] "rule all nations with a rod of iron" [...] (Revelation 12:5). The dragon trying to devour the woman's child {{at the moment of}} his birth (Revelation 12:4) is {{a reference}} to Herod the Great's attempt to kill the infant Jesus (Matthew 2:16). Through his death and resurrection, Jesus [...] "was <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> to God and to his throne" [...] (Revelation 12:5).|$|E
2500|$|Kidd {{killed one}} of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck {{sharpening}} a chisel when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, [...] "If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more." [...] Kidd <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a fractured skull and died the following day.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, {{the first}} human-powered International Submarine Race (ISR) {{was held in}} Florida with 17 craft. Since then nine more races have been held. The races {{themselves}} have been moved from the waters of Florida to the [...] David Taylor Model Basin at the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and are held biennially. At the 9th ISR in 2007 (in which 23 submarines participated) several new records were set: A single-person craft, Omer5 achieved a record speed of 8.035 knots breaking the Omer team's previous record of 7.19 knots set by Omer 4 in 2004. Also Omer 6 <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> a record for non-propeller driven craft with a speed of 4.642 knots.|$|E

2500|$|With {{a return}} like this, Glenn Ford, {{not to mention}} his friend Bill Holden, need not have worried about their future careers after the war. Both men flourished {{throughout}} the 1950s and 1960s as male icons for those decades, but Ford was frustrated that he was not given the opportunities to work with directors of the caliber that led Holden to his Oscar-winning [...] career, such as Billy Wilder and David Lean. [...] Glenn Ford missed out on From Here to Eternity– as did Rita Hayworth– when production was stalled by Columbia studio head, Harry Cohn. He also made the mistake, which he bitterly regretted later, of turning down the lead in the brilliant comedy [...] Born Yesterday (also planned with Rita Hayworth) which Holden then <b>snatched</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{recording}} artist, Michael Jackson, {{died from}} cardiac arrest {{at the age}} of 50, later revealed to be from a drug intoxication of the anesthetic drug Propofol (also known as [...] "Diprivan"). Jackson was friends with musicians Chris Brown, Diddy, Boyz II Men and The Game. Aside from being friends with some of the musicians involved on the song, others involved had also respected and admired Jackson. According to The Game, prior to Jackson's death Jackson, Diddy and Eminem had tried to end the feuding and tension between rapper 50 Cent and The Game in 2005. The Game stated that in 2005, Jackson called him and offered to help end the feud, remembering [...] "I was on tour in Canada, sitting in my room, cutting my hair [...] I was messing my hair up. Then my road manager knocks on my door. Boom, boom, boom. He told me, I got MJ on the phone. I ran and <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> the phone." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the middle}} of 1649 until 1651 Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to engage in infighting. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and {{to put in place}} a broad-brush, {{tolerant}} national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, in April 1653 Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government of 40 members (drawn both from the Rump and the army) and then abdicate. However, the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government. Cromwell was so angered by this that on 20 April 1653, supported by about forty musketeers, he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force. Several accounts exist of this incident: in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said [...] "you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting". At least two accounts agree that Cromwell <b>snatched</b> <b>up</b> the mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the [...] "bauble" [...] be taken away. Cromwell's troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.|$|E
