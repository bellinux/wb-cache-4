40|$|A unified array {{architecture}} is described for computation of DFT, DHT, DCT and DST using a modified CORDIC (CoOrdinate Rotation DIgital Computer) arithmetic unit {{as the basic}} Processing Element (PE). All these four transforms can be computed by simple rearrangement of input samples. Compared to five other existing architectures, this one has the advantage in speed in terms of latency and throughput. Moreover, the simple local neighborhood interprocessor connections make it convenient for VLSI implementation. The architecture can be extended to compute transformation of longer length by judicially cascading the modules of shorter transformation length which will be suitable for Wafer Scale Integration (WSI). CORDIC is designed using Transmission Gate Logic (TGL) on <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> semicustom environment.

This is possible by making all transports visible to the compiler. The main advantages of transport triggered architectures are its simplicity and flexibility, allowing short processor cycle times and a quick (application specific) processor design. Transport triggered architectures also have certain advantages with respect to scheduling freedom and transport utilization.

40|$|In many {{applications}} {{in the field of}} pattern recognition it is often difficult or nearly impossible to describe the system behavior in an exact mathematical style. Therefore, neutral networks seem to be well suited showing significant advantages compared to traditional algorithms. The inherent parallelism of neural networks can't be used if they are applied to standard sequential processors. This is a real disadvantage in the case of real-time applications. Specialized parallel processors with communication structures inspired by their biological model combine lots of simple processing elements to increase processing speed. Until now these processors had the common problem of being very expensive, inflexible and showed a difficult handling which results in a rare usage. This work describe the design and implementation of a new architecture for speeding up neural calculations in hardware. This new architecture shows a simple handling and its implementation can be done at a very low cost level. Therefore a gate array technique is used, instead of expensive fullcustom technology which allows significant cost reduction, especially for small quantities. Taking into account the limitations of a gate array design this new architecture was designed. It uses no local memory on the chip and requires less busses to external components, compared to traditional designs. This architecture is based on a new communication style which uses elements of both systolic arrays and one dimensional SIMD processing structures. The reduction of communication allows simple programming and the usage of automatic code generation tools. In the framework of this dissertation, the new architecture has been implemented in hardware, based on a low cost <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> technology for speeding up neural calculations used within the recall phase of neural networks. This application specific processor is called SAND/ 1 (simple applicable neural device) and combines four parallel processing elements on one chip. At 50 MHz clock frequency it reaches a peak performance of 200 MCPS (million connections per second), which is equivalent to up to 600 MOPS (million operations per second). For speeding up PC based applications a PCI board was developed that allows parallel usage of up to four SAND chips. Maximum performance of this board is 2. 4 GOPS (giga operations per second).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the suitability of}} reconfigurable logic devices {{for the implementation of}} real-time embedded systems. Hybrid hardware systems have been studied, differentiated according to the method of hardware integration (either intraprocessor, bus-based or coprocessor). Software support and reconfigurability were found to be important considerations for the success of the systems. Most are aimed at high performance computing. Traditionally, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been characterised as a <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates.</b> The modern trend {{has been found to be}} towards more coarse-grained architectures - with hard cores, such as multipliers and processors included within the FPGA fabric. Research systems extend this concept even further. The issues and techniques used in real-time systems and real-time operating systems (RTOSs) have been examined. Reconfigurable devices have been found in real-time systems but the interaction between computation being executed in both hardware and software components has not been studied. Some researchers have moved some RTOS components into hardware in order to improve the predictability of the resulting systems. The verification of systems through techniques such as deadline monotonic analysis (DMA) is examined, along with some practical considerations. Suitable tools for designing reconfigurable embedded systems have been analysed. System-level design tools were examined - these were found to not be suitable for modern FPGA-based embedded systems. Traditional co-design tools were also evaluated - again, these were not intended for use in reconfigurable systems. Techniques used in embedded design with modern FPGAs has been summarised. In order to evaluate the suitability of a new technology to a particular application, suitable metrics need to be chosen. For this thesis, the metrics chosen are execution time, real-time metrics (interrupt latency, worst-case execution time), power and area usage. This is followed by an overview of the experimental work conducted, including the evaluation of applications and architectures in the context of real-time embedded systems. These applications, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering and Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filtering, are examined, along with possible solutions in a general sense. A range of architectures are defined, specifically targeted at providing solutions for the applications at hand. Hardware cores designed for input and output of analogue data are presented. Cores for the measurement of execution times and interrupt latency are also shown. The specific solutions for the applications are then shown, including entirely software-based solutions, those using hardware cores for all computation and those using both software and hardware for portions of the computation. A novel configurable network is described, which allows the software to control the configuration of components in the hardware system. This network allows the hardware cores to perform processing without interference from the software. All systems employ the uClinux operating system running on the Xilinx Microblaze processor. Each of the systems has been evaluated according to the metrics described. The results of these evaluations are presented, showing that interrupt latency is unrelated to CPU utilisation. The addition of computational hardware effectively lowers CPU utilisation, although at the expense of increased idle power consumption. The hardware cores are found to be significantly more power efficient, consuming between 9 % and 75 % less power than equivalent software solutions. A new equation is derived for the worst-case response time of hybrid hardwaresoftware tasks, based on deadline monotonic analysis. This equation shows that hybrid tasks should offer significant real-time performance advantages, where task-level paralellism can be exploited. Real-time performance is improved through the use of Real-Time Applications Interface (RTAI) real-time extensions, reducing interrupt latency by a factor of 20. The configurable network system is found to provide superior performance, along with reduced power consumption at the expense of 0. 1 % additional hardware over the base system...|$|E

We explore reconfiguration at the gate level, at the processing element (PE) level, and at the system level. A significant finding is that the conventional von Neumann model of a digital computer, may benefit from the use of reconfigurable interconnects at the gate level by implementing only the most recently used instructions in a function cache. By implementing only a subset of the instructions in a PE at any time, the physical size of the PE can be reduced and performance can be improved. The runtime behavior of programs executing on a uniprocessor is used as evidence that a function cache can be effective. Case studies are also provided for reconfiguration at the gate level and at the system level. The conclusion is made that reconfiguration can improve performance {{at all levels of the}} computer hierarchy, providing that the improvement in performance offsets the cost of reconfiguration. 1...|$|R
