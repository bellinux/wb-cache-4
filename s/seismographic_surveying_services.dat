40|$|The thesis {{describes}} all geodetic work {{in construction}} of buildings as defined by law. Below we define less demanding constructions, such as detached houses, which don't include all geodetic work defined by construction law. A report of <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> is created for all geodetic work. Before the start of construction the regulation of boundaries and a parcel division was carried out. During the construction of less demanding constructions, there are generally no <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> provided.

40|$|An {{important}} part of <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> {{is related to the}} construction of buildings, which is the content of this thesis. The thesis deals with the part of the <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> during the construction of buildings, as regulated in Slovenia; the focus is primarily on the operations of the cadastral pre editing and recording the new situation in the official real estate records. The analysis of the legal framework and procedures of <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> involves the various phases of the construction project. This is especially emphasized in the preparation of the surveying basis for the purposes of project documentation, project implementation and registration of the final state in surveying records. As a practical example, a project of surveying works at the international border crossing Sočerga, is presented. The project includes cadastral surveying and other work in the cadastral editing area of the border crossing and the building and recording of a new facility at the site in the land cadastre and buildings cadastre...|$|R

40|$|In the diploma thesis {{we studied}} the {{organization}} of the public surveying and mapping authority and surveying activities in selected countries. Surveying and mapping authority {{is an important part of}} public services in most of European countries, because of the importance of surveying records and <b>surveying</b> and mapping <b>services</b> for the society, is surveying activity, in the case of private sector, very organized. The private sector is usually represented by corporations, while the public sector is represented by responsible surveying offices, local authorities, public enterprises or agencies and institutions. In many countries, surveying activities, in co-relation to the tasks of <b>surveying</b> <b>services,</b> are performed by a public <b>service</b> of <b>surveying</b> and mapping. In case that these services can be carried out by a private enterprise, countries develop a system of licensing and control. In the diploma thesis we also analysed organization of <b>surveying</b> <b>service</b> and <b>surveying</b> profession in Slovenia, Croatia, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Special attention was dedicated to organization of the private sector in the implementation of public <b>surveying</b> <b>service</b> (mainly real estate records). These services are regulated in all selected countries, while it should be stressed, that the duties, responsibilities and authority, of the persons engaged in this profession, vary from country to country...|$|R
