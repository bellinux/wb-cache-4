50|$|The first officially {{designated}} STOLport in the U.S. {{opened on}} October 17, 1971 at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Shawnee Airlines operated scheduled passenger service between the Walt Disney World Airport (DWS, {{also known as}} the Lake Buena Vista STOLport) and Orlando McCoy Jetport (MCO, now the Orlando International Airport) as well as the Tampa International Airport (TPA) with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop STOL aircraft. Information concerning the Shawnee Airlines STOL service appeared in the Eastern Airlines system timetable dated September 6, 1972 with regard to connecting service between the two airlines at either Orlando or Tampa. The 2000 ft STOL runway at this former airport is no longer in use. Prior to that date, only portions of facilities were designated STOLports. Plans at the time called for an interstate STOL transportation system. On July 26, 1972; the FAA V/STOL office was renamed to the Quiet <b>Short-Haul</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transportation</b> System Office refocusing it and reflecting public concerns about noise created by smaller more numerous STOLports as opposed to larger airports. The Quiet <b>Short-Haul</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transportation</b> System Office was eliminated June 11, 1974. Logan International Airport opened an 1800 ft STOL runway September 20, 1968 for testing Eastern's STOL capable Breguet 941 turboprop shuttle on east coast routes.|$|E

40|$|Discussion of {{the basic}} {{incentives}} motivating {{the development of the}} <b>short-haul</b> STOL <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system. The technological impact on the aircraft and its related economics required to achieve short field performance is generally detrimental. Considerations such as wing and empennage sizing, engine thrust sizing and cycle selection, thrust reverser requirements, cruise Mach number effects, noise, and fuel usage impacts are discussed. The direct operating economics are adversely affected, although it is thought that the indirect costs can be correspondingly reduced. A study of the total operating costs of the short-haul system and its related fare structure indicates that a definite potential exists for the evolution of an economically viable system yielding positive returns on investment to the operators. It is concluded that this potential is sufficient to warrant more detailed studies of these economics and the alternative implementation schemes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> {{industry}} {{has a great}} impact on the economy. In this paper, we analyze the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network in the U.

For this, we measure several complex network features including average shortest path, degree distribution, assortative mixing, clustering, betweenness centrality, and resiliency. We also analyzed changes over the previous two decades and compared the networks with earlier <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network studies. In our analysis, we did not observe considerable changes in the analyzed complex network features of the U. S. <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> over the past two decade. Moreover, the U.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>transportation</b> {{usage and}} {{economic}} activity are interdependent. <b>Air</b> <b>transportation</b> provides employment and enables certain economic activities which {{are dependent on}} the availability of <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> services. The economy, in turn, drives the demand for <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> services resulting in the feedback relationship between the two. The objective of this work is to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} relationship between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> and economic activity. More specifically, this work seeks to (1) develop a feedback model to describe the relationship between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> and economic activity and (2) identify factors which stimulate or suppress <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> development. To achieve these objectives this work uses an exploratory research method which combines literature review, aggregate data and case study analyses. First, this work uses data at the individual country level to identify different types of growth patterns between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> passengers and GDP for 139 countries. This analysis is then used to identify twenty-two representative countries which span a range of possible interaction behaviors, geographies and income categories. The case study analysis at the individual country level is performed to describe the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> impact for each individual economy. These findings help develop a feedback model which describes the relationship between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> and economic activity. (cont.) Specifically, the analysis is used to describe (1) how <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> flows of passengers and cargo enable the flows of goods, services, knowledge, tourism, investment, remittances and labor among economies and (2) how <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> flows can affect the country's factor, demand and business conditions. The feedback model is then extended to perform quantitative analysis of the evolution of the enabling impact of <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> in a particular economy. Specifically, a quantitative system dynamics model is developed to describe the interaction between the demand for leisure travel and the resulting enabling impact of tourism on Jamaica's economy. Case study analysis is also used to identify factors which may stimulate or suppress <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system development. The factors are identified both from the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> supply and demand sides. The following supply side change factors are identified: changes in the regulatory framework, infrastructure capability, vehicle capability and airline strategy. The <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> demand is found to be directly affected by exogenous demand shocks, economic downturns, political and economic sanctions, and the development of other transportation modes. The analysis also identifies the following change factors which affect the demand indirectly by changing the country's economic attributes: economic liberalization, institutional and political reforms, supporting infrastructure investment, exchange rate fluctuations, political and macroeconomic stability, growing consumer demand, and changes in management practices. (cont.) This analysis of stimulating and suppressing factors helps to describe the role of government intervention in changing <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system development and its impact on economic activity. The results of this work can help guide further development efforts, investment and policy decisions pertaining to <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> usage especially in developing economies. by Mariya A.

40|$|The period 2003 - 08 is {{characterized}} in India as very promising for air transport, while the recent recession {{has put it}} under distress. However, the Indian Government has taken a decision, to modernize 32 non-metro airports and renovate 125 un-utilized regional airports, as well as introducing in the future, production of smaller capacity aircraft, there by to boost civil aviation industry. This paper will focus on these developments and a need for feeder and <b>short-haul</b> regional <b>air</b> transport network and its operational sustainability. Regional air services can augment better connectivity and will bring air connectivity into a reality, thereby help in further growth of aviation and economy because of multiplier effects (benefits) associated with air transport. The existing common phenomenon of small ratio of air time to total journey time taken to accomplish the <b>short-haul</b> <b>air</b> travel needs to be looked into by improving ground accessibility to/from existing and proposed new airports with rapid high capacity surface transport. The logistics, feeding each mode is necessary to perform a seamless journey and to promote ‘sustainable transport system that meets the transport and other needs of the present without compromising {{the ability of the}} future generations to meet their needs’.
