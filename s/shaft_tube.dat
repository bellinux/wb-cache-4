40|$|Sediments offer {{microorganisms}} an unexplored {{numbers of}} niches {{with the opportunity}} to evolve specialized microbial communities. The small size of microbial niches in biogeochemical gradients in sediments called for a high resolution study of the populations. We applied a genetic fingerprint method, the terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP), to characterize the diversity of the 16 S rRNA gene present in thin sediment layers at which one TRF represents one operational taxonomic unit (OTU). A partial gene amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of the amplicon allows the detection of about 150 different fragments in an intensity range of 100 to 10000 relative fluorescence units as a picture of the richness and evenness of the bacterial community. The T-RFLP method was established for intertidal soft sediments from the Wadden Sea, the North Sea. The variations in the results were correlated to variations in individual steps of the method protocol. Restriction enzyme digest and digest analysis on a capillary sequencer correlated with a dissimilarity of about 20 % and 10 % in the obtained replicate datasets describing one pooled amplicon from one DNA sample after binning with a fixed window size of 0. 5 and 1 base pair, respectively. The biases in individual PCR reactions did not increase the dissimilarity after performing independent T-RFLP analyses from one DNA sample. The dissimilarity was partly caused by an imperfect binning. Working with a high resolution window size of 0. 5 bp, no starting point (50. 25, 50. 20, 50. 30 and 50. 65 bp) gave a perfect binning result. Some of identical TRFs were always binned into two different TRFs, thus creating an additional OTU. A window size of 1 bp with starting point 50. 50 bp gave similar dissimilarities. Although our results may require an improved binning technique to utilize the full biodiversity information in the profiles, the current T-RFLP technique clearly detected the biological variation in adjacent small sediment layers and can be used to characterize the microbial community in individual sediment layers. Eukaryotes offer and create a number of niches. The lugworm Arenicola marina is a bioturbator in marine intertidal sediments. The T-RFLP method was applied to investigate the bacterial community in the burrow of the lugworm A. marina. The U-shaped burrow is divided into three compartments: the vertical head <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> through which the surface sediment is sinking down and ingested by the lugworm, the horizontal gallery tube at where the lugworm relatively stays permanent inside the sediment and the vertical tail <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> through which the lugworm does defecation by moving backward until the tail reaches sediment surface and ejects characteristic fecal cast on the sediment surface. In the bulk sediment surrounding the U-shaped burrow, the sediment contained a number of different bacterial communities changing with depth. On the basis of an aerobic layer, a redox potential discontinuity (RDP) layer and an anoxic layer, the decreasing and the increasing TRFs over depth may represent surface and subsurface layer bacteria respectively at 0 - 2 cm and 2 - 10 cm depth. T-RFLP data suggested that the RDP layer is at 3 - 5 cm sediment depth, because the unique TRFs of the surface layer and subsurface layers were not found at this depth and the change of abundance of TRFs was fast. The T-RFLP analyses clearly grouped the microbial population in the head <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> with sediment surface populations. The tail <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> was populated by different populations; close to the surface dominated by the surface bacteria and below 3 cm dominated by the subsurface bacteria. The populations in the gallery tube were similar to those in the head and tail <b>shaft</b> <b>tube.</b> The richness in the gallery tube was the lowest but had the highest evenness. T-RFLP analyses of two mm-thick sediment layers from areas with A. marina and without A. marina also revealed a strong depth-dependence of the surface bacterial community composition. According to the T-RFLP analyses, {{the presence or absence of}} A. marina had no clear detectable influence on the microbial populations in the top two centimeter of sediment. Most likely, the increase presence of other burrowing animals in the A. marina exclusion areas seems to form highly similar biogeochemical environments for the development of bacterial communities...|$|E

The hazardous phenomena {{depend on the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> structure {{and the extent of}} mining activity in the vicinity and, on the other hand, the dynamic processes which occur within rock strata. Among the processes which affect the rock mass structure is the rainfall water migration and erosion. The amount and rate of water flow within soil and bedrock in the specific area depend on time. The water saturation in rock formation is the main factor which determines the electric properties of geological environment. These phenomena can be used for monitoring erosion processes by electroresistivity or conductometric measurements. In the paper, experimental results of the tests car-ried out in an abandoned shaft site are described. The tests were performed in three series of measurements conducted using vertical electroresistivity sounding method (VES) in autumn, winter and spring. The results indicate significant changes of rock formation resistivity values due to change in seasonal condi-tions. This impacts the interpretation of the data collected in geoelectrical meas-urements. Łukasz Korta...|$|E

METHODS: The authors analysed repair figures and possible causes of damage to 35 instruments sent for repair to a leading UK supplier over a 1 -year period, and calculated cost figures for maintenance of the instruments as opposed to repair and replacement costs. RESULTS: All damages were handling-induced and therefore did not fall under the manufacturer's warranty: 28 % were damaged by misfiring of the laser inside the instrument; 72 %, mainly crushing and stripping of the ureteroscope <b>shaft</b> <b>tube,</b> were likely to have occurred during out-of-surgery handling, washing and disinfection. Seventeen (4 %) instruments were not repaired and consequently taken out of service due to the extensive costs involved. Eighteen (51 %) ureteroscopes were repaired at an average cost of 10 833 USD. CONCLUSION: Damages to flexible ureteroscopes bear considerable costs. Most damages occur during handling between surgical procedures. Thorough adherence to handling procedures, and courses for theater staff and surgeons on handling flexible instruments may help to reduce these damages and prove a cost-saving investment.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 KOMPOZİT MALZEMELİ BİR ŞAFTIN OTOMOTİV UYGULAMALARI İÇİN ÜRETİMİ VE TESTİAutomotive driveshafts are {{generally}} manufactured from steel or aluminum material and constructed in multiple pieces to avoid bending resonance. Composite materials {{have emerged as}} an alternative solution for torque tube material recently, enabling reduction to a single piece due to higher values of axial moduli. In this thesis; design, manufacture and testing of a composite driveshaft is sought, which is to replace a 2 -piece metallic driveshaft on a heavy weight commercial vehicle. Carbon/Epoxy composite torque tube of the driveshaft is to be produced by filament winding, regarding fundamentals of the method are also presented. Torque tube is modelled by utilizing Classical Laminate theory in analytical domain; numerical model was developed with finite element method. Material properties obtained from the literature {{is used for the}} initial evaluation of models. Manufacturing of composite materials is a complex issue and material properties depend on many parameters. The properties of actual material may differ from catalogue values found in the literature. To address that issue, test plate production is carried out in accordance with ISO 1268. Specimens are cut from test plates and mechanical properties are determined by testing per regarding ASTM standards.   End connections constitute, perhaps the most interesting and challenging issue about producing a composite driveshaft. In this particular design, end connections, which are machined from blocks of C 50 material, are planned to be co-cured with filament wound carbon/epoxy <b>shaft</b> <b>tube.</b> An adhesive layer of epoxy would develop between them and its strength is investigated in order to transmit the design torque safely. In order to ensure safer transmission, hexagonal shape for the joint is chosen to provide coupling between the shaft and joint. An appropriate amount of taper is given to provide a smooth inner bore and continuous layers. Manufacturing setup consists of the mandrel body and end connections mounted on it. Masking tape is applied to cylindrical surfaces in order to preserve them and release agent is applied on all surfaces bar the connection geometry. Carbon fibers, which are impregnated with epoxy resin system, would be wound on this setup. After curing cycle, the mandrel would be removed thus leaving a composite cylinder adhered to the end connections, which is our composite driveshaft in either test rig or vehicle configuration. Some problems had been encountered on conic hexagonal connection geometry during trial windings so draping analyses of connection geometries were carried out. Conic hexagonal connection geometry has been replaced with a polygonal section.   Static and fatigue testing of the prototype shafts are planned. A torsion test rig is designed to be employed on the MTS 322. 21 universal testing system for transforming the axial force of the system into a torque loading by the utilization of a torque arm. A prototype driveshaft has been manufactured but rig tests are yet to commence. 28 kilograms of weight saving is achieved which constitutes to 35 % of the structure. Design requirements are fulfilled, except for the natural frequency which might be attributed to the lower moduli of the production material. Better planning of the filament winding process would yield a production material with better properties resulting in further weight savings and a higher natural frequency for a production shaft.

The aim of {{the project}} is designing of a torque tube of the helicopter. Firstly, Torque tupe systems were investigated and also torque tubes that were tested in İTU-ROTAM, were examined. General informations of ITU-LCH were explained. ITU-LCH is designed as a six passenger, two pilot, single engine conventional helicopter. Critical attritubes of the ITU-LCH have been identified as; safety,affordability,ease of use,lower noise levels, high reliability, low cost maintainability. Main features of the ITU-LCH have been identified as; high altitude operation capability over the high Anatolian Plateau, beaeringless hub system design, composite rotor blades, lower rotor RPM with lower tip speed and hence lower noise levels, lower disc loading with relatively lower power requirement. ITU-LCH designed to be versatile {{in its ability to}} perform operations such as hover,low speed loiter and long range cruise for a variety of mission profiles such as; personal travel applications, commercial applications, corporate applications and government applications. General informations about components and systems of ITU-LCH were given such as; fuselage, landing gear, flight control system, propulsion system, transmission system,fuel system, electrical system and rotor system. The performance analysis of ITU-LCH was taken in different flight conditions. As the criteria of torque tupe design, attact angle of rotor blade conversion and effect of aerodynamic moments on rotor blade were investigated due to the performance analysis. Torque tube angle change must be around ± 15 °. In spite of the results of design criteria, torque tube design that easily assemblied to the rotor blade were completed. ITU-LCH has four blades so there are four torque tubes on rotor system. During the helicopter works, torque tubes should not crash. Torque tube included some parts such as; blade root <b>shaft,</b> <b>tube</b> input part, tubes, tubes’ stand, flexible couplins and blade cutaway part. Spherical bearing is on the blade root shaft. Displacements in the axial direction are restricted and freedom of the rotation provided. Tube input part and tubes transfer the force from swashplate mechanisim to blade. Tube input part rotates ± 15 °. Tubes’ stand connects tubes and flexible couplings. Flexible coupling, is rigid in the direction of torsion, is flexible in the direction of bending. Flexible couplings works as a multi-tier spring system. Blade cutaway part connects flexible couplings and blade. Material of blade root <b>shaft,</b> <b>tube</b> input part, tubes, tubes stand is aluminium. Material of flexible couplings and blade cutaway part is steel. Finite element model of torque tube were prepared. Appropriate boundary conditions of finite element model and finite element analysis with force application were carried out. The tensile strength values of torque tube parts obtained by finite element analysis lower than the safe yield stress value. Therefore, It can be said that structural design of torque tube is safe. In order to produce torque tube, technical drawings were prepared. 5 ABM prepared list of the necessary materials for production of torque tube. After the production, torque tube were assemblied on the test blade. Structural tests of torque tube were done by MTS tests equipment and other test equipments in ITU-ROTAM Structural Laboratory. Structural tests of torque tube were done for standard flight conditions and extreme flight conditions. During the standard flight conditions tests, force applied to torque tube which is assembled to blade. Blade angle of attack changed because of force. Boundary conditions were seen during this test. Steel beam’s dimension was calculated for the model of aerodynamic moment. Steel beam were tested in the MTS test equipments. Test results are as same as calculation of beam. Strain gages were glued high stress value point on torque tube parts using finite element analysis. Torque tube should work during minimum 75 hours (1500000 cycles) on helicopters. Torque tube on test blade connected steel beam with shaft. Helicopter rotation speed is 5. 2 Hz. However, fatigue test were done at 1. 5 Hz because of the MTS test equipments condition so fatigue test finished after 300 hours. Fatigue test were stopped after some cycles and strain values were evaluated using strain gages because any changing on torque tube parts have been seen. After the fatigue tests, stress values on the torque tube is lower than reliable yield stress. After the fatigue test of standard flight conditions, centrifugal test were done. Axial force, is two and three times centrifugal force, applied to torque tube. After the tests, stress on the torque tube is low. Stress on the torque tube is lower than reliable yield stress. For extreme flight conditions, steel beam’s dimensions were calculated again for model of the high aerodynamic moments. Static structural tests and fatigue test were done. During the static tests, torque tube with high aerodynamic moments effects were done so strain values were read by strain gages. Fatigue tests continued during 2000 cycles. After the static tests and fatigue test, there is any broken part. After these tests, torque tube is reliable for flight During the tests, design problems have been noticed. As a result of the force which applied to the torque tube, the angular variation of the torque pipe input part {{is not the same as}} angular variation of the angle of attack. However, angular variation of the angle of attack will be enough if the torque tube works like this. The other design problem is related to adaptor which is between torque tube’s tubes and tube input part. Torsion occurred on the torque tube’s tube because of the angular variation, Thus corrosion and erosion on the thread, is between tube input part and adaptor, occurred. Design of tube input part and adaptor changed because of design problem. The joint between this two parts is done shape instead of thread Finally, the finite element analysis will be repeated for the new design of torque tube. If the analysis results are suitable, the technical drawings will be updated and the torque tube will be produced. After the production, new torque tube design will be tested because of the modifications. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

The Design of a Power Tool Attachment for Sawing Operation is discussed. First, the Target Specifications are established. The Design work is carried out, especially that of the Main <b>Shaft</b> and Support <b>Tube.</b> Calculations and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) are also done. The Prototype is fabricated and assembled. The Testing of the prototype is done, by Sawing commercial plywood of maximum thickness 25 mm. Weight of the Attachment is 1. 3 kg, and the Machine is easy to use, benefitting unskilled users...|$|R
50|$|Nanza {{comprises}} numerous earth lodge sites {{encircled by}} a protective wall perhaps six feet high. Today the fortification is still visible. Archeological excavations have determined there was originally a ditch three feet deep and ten feet wide surrounding the berm. An earth embankment supporting a post palisade was discovered inside the ditch. Guns, hatchets, knives, beads, kettles, cloth and other European goods {{have been recovered}} from Ponca Fort, {{and serve as a}} testimony to the village's important position in the local fur trade. There is also evidence of extensive trade with other tribes. Pottery, stone mauls, meeling slabs and maulers, bone knives, hoes, <b>tubes,</b> <b>shaft</b> wrenches and picks, and strip bark in rolls {{from as far away as}} the Southeastern United States.|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{calculations}} {{has been}} performed {{for measuring the}} elastohydrodynamic lubrication characteristics of a stern tube bearing, and several main characteristic values has been determined. If it is not parallel to the propeller <b>shaft</b> and stern <b>tube</b> bearings, {{the magnitude of the}} maximum oil film pressure generated in the bearing increases significantly. The magnitude of the maximum oil film pressure generated is greatly affected by the attitude angle of the shaft. As the attitude angle of the shaft is varied from 90 to 180 degrees, the maximum oil film pressure gradually increases. If the eccentricity at the centre of the bearing, the angle of the shaft centre relative to the bearing centre and the attitude angle of the shaft can be determined, then it is possible to quantitatively determine the maximum oil film pressure taking the elastic deformation of the bearing into account by the method described in this paper...|$|R
500|$|The ship entered {{service in}} 1866 with the Baltic Fleet. She accidentally {{collided}} with and sank the wooden steam frigate [...] on 15 August 1869, killing 16 men from Oleg, but Kreml {{was only slightly}} damaged. She {{was assigned to the}} Gunnery Training Detachment in March 1870 and remained with it for the bulk of her career. In November 1881, the steam-powered steering gear taken from the ironclad [...] was installed which required the installation of a high-pressure donkey boiler in the cramped boiler room. This proved to be more trouble than it was worth and was removed two years later. Kreml was caught by a storm on 10 June 1885 while sailing for Reval (Tallinn) and began taking on so much water that her captain decided to make for shallow water; she reached Kunda Bay, on the Estonian coast, under sail alone after her engine bearings overheated and forced the engine to be stopped. Once there, the progressive flooding continued through the ventilation <b>shafts,</b> sounding <b>tubes,</b> and defective valves in the internal bulkheads, and the ship sank in [...] of water. Kreml was refloated on five days later and repaired in Kronstadt. She was reclassified as coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and placed in reserve on 24 December 1904. Kreml was disarmed and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 15 September 1905. She was stricken from the Navy List on 12 October and sold for scrap on 8 September 1908.|$|R
40|$|Bolt is a {{cylinder}} <b>shaft</b> or <b>tube</b> with a helical groove on its surface, with its primary use is as a fastener to resist {{two or more}} sharing object. One important benefit associated with building and bridge structural design, in particular the structure made from timber material, used for a mechanical connector. One of the mechanical properties parameters used in connection design is the yield bending strength (Fyb). In the United States NDS 2012 Code has been available equations to predict Fyb, while in the Indonesian (RSNI 201 x) Draft Code is not yet available equations to determine value of Fyb. In this paper presented results of the bolt yield bending strength parameter obtained from experimental studies, especially for bolt that is available at Indonesian market. Bolt diameter that discussed on this paper is limited for 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm. Specimens were used as much as 16 specimens. Methods of testing using ASTM F 1575 guidance by three point loading method. Results indicated that value of yield bending strength (average) will be smaller if the bolt diameter is greater, which are for bolt 8 mm is 1121. 40 MPa with C. O. V is 4. 23 %, for bolt 10 mm is 642. 19 MPa (C. O. V 4. 80 %), and for bolt 12 mm is 631. 76 MPa (C. O. V 1. 24 %). Generally, stress-strain relationship curve obtained from bending test showed as a bilinear shape trend...|$|R
