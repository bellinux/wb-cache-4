5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{consumed}} up to 1000cords {{of firewood}} every {{year during the}} 180-day navigation period, a quantity <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> it led to deforestation {{of most of the}} Kõpu peninsula.

5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} {{were in high}} demand.

In Virginia, travel agencies hired temporary workers to meet demand, and in New Orleans, the demand for hotel rooms was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> many hotels instituted a three-night minimum stay.|$|E

5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud {{is only a small}} part of the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E

5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> the ship snaps in two.|$|E

She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

5|$|The history text Zubdat-al Tawarikh, {{dedicated}} to Sultan Murad III in 1583, narrates {{a story of}} Uzair's grief {{for the destruction of}} Jerusalem.

In the miniature accompanying the manuscript, the building on the lower right depicts the rebuilt city of Jerusalem in the form a typical sixteenth-century Ottoman building with a dome and an arched portico.

5|$|The {{political}} and popular pressure for reform had grown <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons {{majority in the}} general election of 1831. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories with little more than the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September, by a margin of more than 100 votes.|$|E

The plant was officially opened in 1967 and is still making Plumbicon camera tubes today. Although the original use of Plumbicon camera tubes was in broadcast television, current demand is primarily in for use in medical imaging equipment.|$|E
