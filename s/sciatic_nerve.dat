5|$|During the First World War, Manstein {{served on}} both the German Western and Eastern Fronts. At the {{beginning}} of the war he was promoted to lieutenant and participated in the invasion of Belgium with the 2nd Guard Reserve Infantry Regiment. In August 1914 he took part in the capture of Namur, the site of a massive citadel surrounded by outlying forts. In September, Manstein's unit was one of two transferred to East Prussia and attached to the Eighth Army, commanded by Hindenburg. After seeing action in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, his unit was soon reassigned to the Ninth Army, which was in the process of advancing from Upper Silesia to Warsaw. Overstretched, the Ninth Army was forced to withdraw in the face of a Russian counterattack, and on 16 November Manstein was wounded during the retreat when he was among a detachment that stormed a Russian entrenchment. He was shot in the left shoulder and the left knee; one bullet hit his <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve,</b> causing the leg to be numb. Recovery took six months in hospital in Beuthen and Wiesbaden.|$|E

Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of both phosphorylated JNK 1 (p-JNK 1, approximately 46 kDa) and phosphorylated JNK 2 (p-JNK 2, approximately 54 kDa) in the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> of rats with EAN increased significantly (p < 0. 05) at day 14 post-immunization (PI) and remained at this level at days 24 and 30 PI, with a slight decrease. In EAN-affected <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves,</b> there was intense immunostaining for p-JNK in the infiltrating inflammatory cells (especially ED 1 -positive macrophages) and Schwann cells on days 14 - 24 PI, {{compared with those of}} controls. Some macrophages with increased p-JNK immunoreactivity was shown to be apoptotic, while some Schwann cells remained survived in this rat EAN model, suggesting that JNK is differentially involved in the EAN-affected <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves.</b> These findings suggest that JNK phosphorylation is closely associated with the clearance of inflammatory cells as well as the activation of Schwann cells in the EAN affected <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Though {{retrograde}} {{neuronal death}} and vascular insufficiency {{have been well}} established in plegics following intracerebral hemorrhage, the effects of plegia on arterial nervorums of peripheral nerves have not been reported. In this study, the histopathological effects of the intracerebral hemorrhage on the dorsal root ganglions and <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> via affecting the arterial nervorums were investigated. Methods This study was conducted on 13 male hybrid rabbits. Three animals were taken as control group and did not undergo surgery. The remaining 10 subjects were anesthetized and were injected with 0. 50 ml of autologous blood into their right sensory-motor region. All rabbits were followed-up for two months and then sacrificed. Endothelial cell numbers and volume values were estimated a three dimensionally created standardized arterial nervorums model of lumbar 3. Neuron numbers of dorsal root ganglions, and axon numbers in the lumbar 3 nerve root and volume values of arterial nervorums were examined histopathologically. The results were analyzed by using a Mann-Whitney-U test. Results Left hemiplegia developed in 8 animals. On the hemiplegic side, degenerative vascular changes and volume reduction in the arterial nervorums of the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves,</b> neuronal injury in the dorsal root ganglions, and axonal injury in the lumbar 3 were detected. Statistical analyses showed a significant correlation between the normal or nonplegic sides and plegic sides {{in terms of the}} neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglions (p Conclusion Intracerebral hemorrhage resulted in neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion and axonolysis in the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves,</b> endothelial injury, and volume reduction of the arterial nervorums in the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves.</b> The interruption of the neural network connection in the walls of the arterial nervorums in the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> may be responsible for circulation disorders of the arterial nervorums, and arterial nervorums degeneration could result in <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> injury. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background : The {{mechanisms}} of neuropathic pain are not clearly understood which {{are characterized by}} various different kinds abnormal sensation; hence the author attempted to elucidate a novel pain model that is produced by radiofrequency neurolysis in rats. Methods : Bilateral <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> of 30 wister rats (7 - 8 weeks) were exposed and blocked with heat (neurolysis) under pentobarbital anesthesia. Right <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> were treated at 50 ℃ for 45 sec. (N= 10), 60 ℃ for 45 sec. (N= 10), 70 ℃ for 45 sec. (N= 10) respectively; left <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> were not treated as a sham. Rats were placed in plastic cages for behavioral testing; posture of neurolyzed extremity, responses to spontaneous nociceptive pain and radiant heat impinged on plantar surface of hind paw. To examine neuropathologic change in <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> that were harvested after neurolysis, light microscopic sections were stained with toluidine blue. Results : Average autotomy scores were remarked during nerve reconstruction in 60 ℃ and 70 ℃ neurolysis but no {{significant difference was found}} between sham and operated paws in 50 ℃neurolysis. In micrographs of nerves removed 7 days after neurolysis, endoneural edema was prominent and the destruction of myelinated fibers could be seen. Conclusion : It was demonstrated that this model of neuropathic pain with radiofrequency neurolysis revealed partially similar, partially different results compared with previous models, and suggested that an optimal radiofrequency neurolysis in rats was 60 ℃ for 45 sec. that developed in recovery course of nerve injury...|$|R

In addition, we recorded wet weight of the gastrocnemius muscle. Schwann cell cultures were prepared from predegenerated nerves. Ten and 15 mm defects in rat <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> were bridged using bilateral tendon autografts with Schwann cell-seeded tendon autografts on one side, and untreated tendon autografts on the other. Animals were evaluated at six and 12 weeks, respectively. At six weeks, myelination, as judged by G-ratio (ratio of axonal diameter to diameter of nerve fibres), was significantly increased in tendon autografts pretreated with Schwann cells in 10 mm defects. No such difference {{was seen in the}} 15 mmdefects. We found no difference in functional recovery, other morphometric variables, or muscle weight between the two grafts.

Mast cells within the peripheral and central nervous systems of CBA and SJL mice during Theiler's virus-induced demyelination (TVID) have been investigated. CBA mice are intermediately susceptible and SJL mice are highly susceptible to TVIID. The two mouse strains were infected with the BeAn or DA strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) or PBS (controls). One control mouse and two mice from each infected group (with a clinical score ranging from 2 - 5) were euthanized and the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> and thalamic regions were collected for average mast cell counts. The SJL mice exhibited a higher incidence and degree of disease (based on clinical scores) than the CBA mice. SJL mice exhibited greater average numbers of mast cells within control <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> compared to CBA mice. However, CBA mice exhibited higher average number of mast cells within control thalamic regions compared to SJL mice. Within strain differences revealed that the CBA mice exhibited greater average numbers of mast cells within the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> during DA infection of the CNS and within control and BeAn infected thalamic regions compared to SJL mice.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{experiments}} {{the effect of}} systemic capsaicin treatment on the retrograde labelling of sensory ganglion cells was studied following the injection of choleratoxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (CTX-HRP) into intact and chronically transected peripheral nerves. In the control rats CTX-HRP injected into intact <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> labelled medium and large neurons with a mean cross-sectional area of 1041 ± 39 mm 2. However, after injection of the conjugate into chronically transected <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> of the control rats, many small cells were also labelled, shifting the mean cross-sectional area of the labelled cells to 632 ± 118 mm 2. Capsaicin pretreatment per se induced a moderate but significant decrease in the mean cross-sectional area of the labelled neurons (879 ± 79 mm 2). More importantly, systemic pretreatment with capsaicin prevented the peripheral nerve lesion-induced labelling of small cells. Thus, the mean cross-sectional areas of labelled neurons relating to the intact and transected <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves,</b> respectively, did not differ significantly. These findings provide direct evidence for a phenotypic switch of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptive neurons after peripheral nerve injury, and suggest that lesion-induced morphological changes in the spinal cord {{may be related to}} specific alterations in the chemistry of C-fibre afferent neurons rather than to a sprouting response of A-fibre afferents...|$|R
