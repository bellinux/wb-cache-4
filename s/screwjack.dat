5000|$|<b>Screwjack</b> & Other Stories is a {{collection}} of short stories written by gonzo writer Hunter S. Thompson. It was first Published by Maurice Neville in 1991 in a limited edition of 300 numbered and 26 lettered copies, then republished in 2000 by Simon & Schuster (...) [...]|$|E
50|$|A jack, <b>screwjack</b> or {{jackscrew}} is {{a mechanical}} device {{used as a}} lifting device to lift heavy loads or to apply great forces. A mechanical jack employs a screw thread for lifting heavy equipment. A hydraulic jack uses hydraulic power. The most common form is a car jack, floor jack or garage jack, which lifts vehicles so that maintenance can be performed. Jacks are usually rated for a maximum lifting capacity (for example, 1.5 tons or 3 tons). Industrial jacks can be rated for many tons of load.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final chapter}} in the series. Ostensibly written by Raoul Duke, [...] "Screwjack" [...] begins with an editor's note {{explaining}} of Thompson's alter ego that [...] "the first few lines contain no warning of the madness and fear and lust that came {{more and more to}} plague him and dominate his life...." [...] "I am guilty, Lord" [...] Thompson writes, [...] "but I am also a lover -- and I am one of your best people, as you know; and yea tho I have walked in many strange shadows and acted crazy {{from time to time and}} even drooled on many High Priests, I have not been an embarrassment to you...." [...] The story appears to be a surreal and disjointed description of the bizarre, violent, and even sexual relationship between Raoul Duke and a black tomcat named Mr. <b>Screwjack.</b> Halfway through the text, there is a break in the text and the narrator briefly refers to Duke by name, implying this half is either told by another narrator or merely written by Duke briefly in the third person.|$|E
40|$|Quick-actuating closure and {{handling}} system developed for containers, particularly for high-pressure vessels or shells entered frequently. Features simplicity {{in design and}} operation, saving of time, monitoring of leakage, and safety. Another significant feature, use of conical surfaces to engage effectively shear blocks in locked position to provide necessary preload and to transmit internal-pressure load directly to pressure vessel. Designed to impart proper radial movement to shear blocks, based on space available for longitudinal travel of <b>screwjacks.</b> Adaptable to many applications; used for such containers as autoclaves, vacuum chambers, and wide variety of specialized vessels requiring frequent entry and closure...|$|R
5000|$|The {{control system}} of the '150' was revolutionary for its time, with irreversible, {{electrically}} signalled and electrically driven <b>screwjacks</b> operating the control surfaces. This {{was one of the}} very first [...] "fly by wire" [...] aircraft as well as one of the very first all-powered flying control aircraft, albeit without the benefit of modern computers. Doubts about the control system were allayed at an early stage by extensive testing and demonstrations with an 'iron bird' test rig which duplicated the system installed in the aircraft, and a captured Ju 388L, designated '145', which was modified with the electrical control system. The electrical power source for the flying controls also raised doubts about the ability of the electrical system to cope, especially with an engine failure. To provide electrical power in the event of generator or engine failure a drop-down RAT(ram air turbine), driven by ram air in the aircraft slipstream provided a backup system.|$|R
40|$|Large Space Structures (LSS) exhibit {{characteristics}} {{which make}} the LSS control problem different form other control problems. LSS {{will most likely}} exhibit low frequency, densely spaced and lightly damped modes. In theory, the number of these modes is infinite. Because these structures are flexible, Vibration Suppression (VS) is {{an important aspect of}} LSS operation. In terms of VS, the control actuators should be as low mass as possible, have infinite bandwidth, and be electrically powered. It is proposed that actuators be built into the structure as dual purpose structural elements. A piezoelectric active member is proposed for the control of LSS. Such a device would consist of a piezoelectric actuator and sensor for measuring strain, and <b>screwjack</b> actuator in series for use in quasi-static shape control. An experiment simulates an active member using piezoelectric ceramic thin sheet material on a thin, uniform cantilever beam. The feasibility of using the piezoelectric materials for VS on LSS was demonstrated. Positive positive feedback as a VS control strategy was implemented. Multi-mode VS was achieved with dramatic reduction in dynamic response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRobotic {{technology}} has undergone various phase translations from being tortured as humanoids {{to the present}} day manipulators. Depending upon the various forms of its existence, robot manipulators are designed as serial manipulators and parallel manipulators. This work volume can be identified as co-operative work volume of those manipulators. Here the interference of manipulators in the work volume of other manipulators is possible and is ade obstacle free. In this paper, a cooperative design of robot manipulators to work in co-operative work environment is done and analysed for its efficacy. In the industrial applications when robotic manipulators are put together in more numbers, the trajectory planning becomes the tough task in the work cell. Proper design can remove the design defects of the cooperative manipulators and can be utilized in a more efficient way. In the proposed research paper an analysis is made on such a type of cooperative manipulator used for climbing stairs with three leg design and anlaysis were also done on the mechanism integrated to the system. Kinematics of the legs are analysed separately and the legs are designed to carry a maximum of 175 kgs, which is sustained by the center leg and shared by the dual wing legs equally during the walking phase. In the proposed design, <b>screwjack</b> mechanism is used as the central leg to share the load and thus the analysis on the load sharing capability of the whole system is analysed and concluded in terms of failure modes...|$|E
