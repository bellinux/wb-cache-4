In contrast to the predictions of the traditional Mundell-Fleming model, asset shifts in bank portfolios between bonds and bank loans produce aggregate demand effects in our credit-channel model.

40|$|While the {{punishment}} of juvenile offenders has increasingly become an issue of major concern to the public, there are few studies that test the government's coercive response to offending by this particular group. This study addresses this issue by examining the variation in sentence length for juvenile offenders adjudicated in the adult criminal courts for violent offenses. Results from the regression analyses consistently show that, while factors related to the specific offense are important contributors to the variation in sentence length, differences in the ideological climate of each state are a strong predictor {{of the variation in}} adult sanctions for minors. Specifically, the findings show that conservative citizen ideology and Republican control of state government are important contributors to the variation in sentencing of juveniles across U. <b>S.</b> <b>states.</b> Additional <b>evidence</b> shows that states where judges must run in an election to gain their seats proscribe more severe sanctions on juvenile offenders by sentencing more of them to adult prisons. Overall, the results suggest that the social and political climate of each state plays a very strong role in the sentencing of juvenile offenders to adult prisons. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the complexity of}} the policy improvement algorithm for Markov decision processes. We show that four variants of the algorithm require exponential time in the worst case. 1. Introduction Finding an optimal policy in a Markov decision process is a classical problem in optimization theory. Although the problem is solvable in polynomial time using linear programming (Howard [4], Khachian [7]), in practice, the policy improvement algorithm is often used. We show that four natural variants of this algorithm require exponential time in the worst case. A stationary Markov decision process consists of a finite number of states, which includes an initial <b>state</b> <b>s</b> 0. At each time t= 0, 1,..., the process is in some <b>state</b> <b>s</b> t. For each <b>state</b> <b>s</b> there is a finite set of decisions D s. If the process is in <b>state</b> <b>s</b> at time t and a decision d in D s is chosen, there is a fixed transition probability p (s,s,d) of being in a <b>state</b> <b>s</b> at time t + 1. The decision d incurs a cost c (s,d). A [...] ...|$|R
