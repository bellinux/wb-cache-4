2500|$|The chosen {{method of}} {{construction}} was the immersed tube technique. [...] In this method, a trench is dredged {{in the bed}} of the water channel. [...] Tunnel sections are constructed in the dry, for example in a casting basin, a fabrication yard, on a <b>ship-lift</b> platform or in a factory unit. [...] The ends of the section are then temporarily sealed with bulkheads. Each tunnel section is transported to the tunnel site – usually floating, occasionally on a barge, or assisted by cranes. [...] In the Jack Lynch Tunnel, the 610 metres long reinforced concrete immersed tube tunnel is made up of five elements, each around 122 metres long, 24.5 metres wide and 8.5 metres high. The northern approach was formed by a 120 m long floated open 'boat' section – the first of its kind.|$|E

50|$|The Australian Marine Complex {{is located}} on Cockburn Sound, in Henderson and is {{considered}} one of the largest ship building precincts in Australia. It contains dry dock facilities and Australia's largest <b>ship-lift</b> (nominal lifting capacity of 8065 tonnes). Some of the companies located in the complex include Austal Ships and BAE Systems Australia. In 2002 the Government proposed to use Garden Island and the facilities at Henderson for the 'sea-swap' program with the United States Navy 7th Fleet.|$|E
50|$|Stirling has {{expanded}} significantly within its existing boundaries {{and is the}} largest of the RAN's shore establishment, with a base population of approximately 2,300 service personnel, 600 defence civilians and 500 contractors. Amenities included berthing and wharves, vessel repair and refit services, a <b>ship-lift,</b> and a helicopter support facility, as well as medical facilities, fuel storage and accommodation. The base also hosts the Submarine Escape Training Facility - one of only six {{in the world and the}} only one in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Spread over {{an area of}} 45 km2 and 23 km of {{coastline}} on the Arabian Sea, Phase I of INS Kadamba {{was commissioned}} on 31 May 2005. The expanded base opened in 2007, with space for up to 11 front-line warships and 10 smaller FIC-type boats. Key facilities include the 10,000 tonne, 175 m x 28 m ship lift, a ship transfer system for dry docking at the Naval Ship Repair Yard, and a 141-bed naval hospital INHS Patanjali. Naval Ship Repair Yard commenced functioning in July 2006 and the <b>ship-lift</b> was commissioned on 8 November 2006. Commodore K P Ramachandran was the first Commanding Officer of Kadamba.|$|E

50|$|There {{are over}} 600 vessels of {{different}} types and sizes in the government fleet. About 152 vessels are major mechanised vessels serving under 16 government departments such as the Marine Police, Customs and Excise, and Fire Services. Some user departments operate and man their purpose-built vessels. The Marine Department itself controls about 100 vessels, including patrol launches, personnel carriers, pontoons, self-propelled barges and specialised vessels such as hydrographic survey launches and explosive carriers. These vessels provide support to the department's own port operations or serve other departments which do not have their own fleet. The Government Dockyard {{is responsible for the}} design, procurement and maintenance of all vessels owned by the Government. It occupies a site of 980,000 m² on Stonecutters Island and has an 83,000 m² protected water basin as an operational base for vessels operated by the Marine Department. The dockyard has a <b>ship-lift</b> system and three ship-hoists capable of drydocking vessels of up to 750 tonnes. An on-line computerised information system is employed to co-ordinate the maintenance activities and support services to maximise maintenance efficiency and vessel availability.|$|E
40|$|Key words: concrete; {{critical}} effective crack length; unstable fracture; fracture criterion; application Abstract The {{knowledge from}} extensive investigations {{showed that the}} non-linearity of the load and loading point displacement curve is mainly associated with crack propagation. Based on the linear asymptotic superposition assumption, the critical effective crack length is evaluated by analyzing the nonlinear characteristics of the load and loading point displacement curves {{of a series of}} the fracture tests. Furthermore, the unstable fracture toughness is determined by inserting the peak load and the critical effective crack length into a formula developed from LEFM. Based on the calculated results, the series K criterion of unstable fracture of concrete fracture is established. At last, an engineering example of cracking analysis of the upstream lock-head foundation of the <b>ship-lift</b> of the Three Gorges Project is given...|$|E
