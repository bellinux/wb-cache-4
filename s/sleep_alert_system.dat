40|$|Postsecondary {{institutions}} have increasingly attempted to discover innovative methods to promote student engagement and persistence, thus combating student attrition. In recent years, {{the higher education}} landscape has been flooded with intervention strategies sourced in early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> that utilize technological components to encourage student connections to institutional support entities. Whether homegrown or commercially developed, early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> provide cost-effective means of bolstering student persistence while depleting limited financial resources. While early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> {{have the potential to}} be a useful and cost-effective tactic to provide students with platforms for connections to faculty, academic advisors, and support resources, their development and implementation provides challenges. This study was based on Tinto’s student development and Astin’s student engagement theories. The purpose of this study was to uncover and analyze student perceptions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> usage as a retention tool, an area of research lacking depth. The entire undergraduate student enrollment (N = 21, 437) during the fall 2014 academic semester at East Carolina University was invited to complete an on-line survey requesting student opinions of campus utilization of the Starfish™ early <b>alert</b> <b>system.</b> A total of 4, 658 student responses were collected. A series of statistical tests were used to assess differences in student perceptions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> usage. General student opinions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> structure and differences within student population groups and demographics were also discovered through data examination. Additionally, results of the analysis showed statistical significance indicating that early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> serve as conduits between students and the institution, impacting their educational satisfaction, motivation to seek resources, communication with campus officials, and overall sense of belonging. Results from this study offer implications and recommendations for administrators, faculty, and other key institutional decision-makers focused on utilizing early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> as a retention tool. Study findings contribute to the body of knowledge on student development, engagement, and persistence, yet additional research is necessary to further investigate the impact of early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> in higher education...|$|R
40|$|Cockpit <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> monitor {{potentially}} hazardous situations, {{both inside}} and outside the aircraft. When a hazard is projected to occur, the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> displays <b>alerts</b> and/or command decisions to the pilot. However, pilots have been observed to not conform to <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> commands by delaying their response or by not following the automatic commands exactly. This non-conformance to the automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> can reduce its benefit. Therefore, a need exists to understand the causes and effects of pilot non-conformance in order to develop automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> whose commands the pilots are more likely to follow. These considerations were examined through flight simulator evaluations of the collision avoidance task during closely spaced parallel approaches. This task provided a useful case-study because the effects of non-conformance can be significant, given the time-critical nature of the task. A preliminary evaluation of <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> identified non-conformance in over 40 % of the cases and a corresponding drop in collision avoidance performance. A follow-on experiment found subjects' alerting and maneuver selection criteria were consistent with different strategies than those used by automatic systems, indicating the pilot may potentially disagree with the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> if the pilot attempts to verify automatic alerts and commanded avoidance maneuvers. A final experiment found supporting automatic alerts with the explicit display of its underlying criteria resulted in more consistent subject reactions. In light of these experimental results, a general discussion of pilot non-conformance is provided. Contributing factors in pilot non-conformance include a lack of confidence in the automatic system and mismatches between the <b>alerting</b> <b>system's</b> commands and the pilots' own decisions based on the information available to them. The effects of non-conformance on system performance are discussed. Possible methods of reconciling mismatches are given, and design considerations for <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> which alleviate the problem of non-conformance are provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of an}} <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> is to {{make the}} system {{operator}} (e. g., pilot) aware of an impending hazard or unsafe state so the hazard can be avoided or managed successfully. A review of 46 commercial aviation accidents (between 1998 and 2014) revealed that, {{in the vast majority of}} events, either the hazard was not alerted or relevant hazard alerting occurred but failed to aid the flight crew sufficiently. For this set of events, <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> failures were placed in one of five phases: Detection, Understanding, Action Selection, Prioritization, and Execution. This study also reviewed the evolution of <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> schemes in commercial aviation, which revealed naive assumptions about pilot reliability in monitoring flight path parameters; specifically, pilot monitoring was assumed to be more effective than it actually is.

40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the diagnostic performances of an <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> integrated into the CPOE/EMR system for renally cleared drug dosing control.

Materials and Methods: The pharmacists performed their analysis of medication orders as usual and were not aware of the <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> interventions that were not displayed for the purpose of the study neither to the physician nor to the pharmacist but kept with associate recommendations in a log file. A senior pharmacist analyzed the results of medication order analysis with and without the <b>alert</b> <b>system.</b> The unit of analysis was the drug prescription line.
