40|$|The {{effect of}} {{operating}} pressure heads on water application uniformity in microirrigation <b>submain</b> units was evaluated. Research {{results show that}} water application uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The water application uniformity decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. The relationship between operating pressure head and average emitter discharge in <b>submain</b> units can be considered as approximately linear for operating pressure heads in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum operating pressures of the <b>submain</b> units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a <b>submain</b> unit for an increased or decreased operating pressure head when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to the allowable minimum operating pressure head would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as operating pressure increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically. However, a microirrigation system designed to meet the required water application uniformity according to the allowable maximum operating pressure head would be better when x > 0. 5 because, in general, water application uniformity increases as operating pressure decreases...|$|E

We {{utilize the}} Millennium-II {{simulation}} databases {{to study the}} spin bias of dark subhalos in the Local Group-like systems which have two prominent satellites with comparable masses.

40|$|AbstractA {{recently}} discovered <b>submain</b> phase transition in multi-lamellar bilayers of long-chain saturated diacyl phosphatidylcholines (Jørgensen, K. (1995) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1240, 111 – 114) {{is discussed in}} terms of a theoretical molecular interaction model using computer simulation techniques. The model interprets the transition to be due to a decoupling of the acyl-chain melting from the melting of the pseudo-two-dimensional crystalline lattice of the Pβ′ phase. A two-stage melting process is predicted by the calculations suggesting that the sub-main transition involves a lattice melting whereas the acyl-chain melting takes place at a higher temperature at the main transition. The calculated heat contents of the two transitions as well as the chain-length dependence compare favorably with experimental data for multi-lamellar phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers...|$|E
40|$|A {{micro-irrigation}} {{system design}} based on control volume method using the back step procedure {{is presented in}} this study. The proposed numerical method is simple and consists of delimiting an elementary volume of the lateral equipped with an emitter, called « control volume » on which the conservation equations of the fl uid hydrodynamicʼs are applied. Control volume method is an iterative method to calculate velocity and pressure step by step throughout the micro-irrigation network based on an assumed pressure {{at the end of}} the line. A simple microcomputer program was used for the calculation and the convergence was very fast. When the average water requirement of plants was estimated, it is easy to choose the sum of the average emitter discharge as the total average fl ow rate of the network. The design consists of exploring an economical and effi cient network to deliver uniformly the input fl ow rate for all emitters. This program permitted the design of a large complex network of thousands of emitters very quickly. Three subroutine programs calculate velocity and pressure at a lateral pipe and <b>submain</b> pipe. The control volume method has already been tested for lateral design, the results from which were validated by other methods as fi nite element method, so it permits to determine the optimal design for such micro-irrigation networ...|$|E
40|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{is one of}} {{the efficient}} irrigation systems. The system layout simply consists of main line, <b>submain,</b> manifolds and laterals. There are many possible alternatives for the system layout. The main problem facing the designer is the choice of optimum system layout which depends on several factors. One of these factors is the assessment of capital cost of pipelines which mainly affects the total cost of the system. The second factor is the assessment of total friction losses of the system which mainly affects not only the pump head but also the pump cost. Mostafa [7] presented "cost analysis for drip irrigation system". The paper, herein, presents a cost analysis for sprinkler irrigation system. Several alternative layouts for a square cultivated area up to 150 Feddan are presented. Friction head loss analysis is performed for each layout. Comparison is done to show the layout which has a minimum friction head loss. Also, cost analysis of pipeline system is performed to show the layout which has a least capital pipeline cost. A simple relationship is presented to estimate the total friction head loss of the proposed layout. Another simple relationship is presented to estimate the capital pipeline cost of the proposed layout. Both relationships are function of the side length of a square cultivated area, pump discharge, and several coefficients derived from basic equations of continuity and head loss...|$|E
40|$|The use of drip and {{sprinkler}} irrigation systems is increasing rapidly. Both offer not only excellent control of water but also high efficiency {{in the application}} of water directly to the root zone. Comparing with other traditional methods, both offer significant reduction in the water consumption. In both types, the system consists of main line, <b>submain,</b> manifold and laterals. The cost of lateral and manifold pipelines may cost 30 % to 40 % of the total pipeline cost. Both pipelines are provided with several outlets. The designer assumes the pipe of constant diameter and constant discharge. The assumption leads to a percentage of error in the calculation of friction head loss. The assessment of actual friction head loss requires an accurate estimate of correction factor. The paper presents a new proposed correction factor formula which can be used in the estimation of friction head loss through either laterals or manifold of constant diameter and varying velocity. The new formula is compared with other published formulae. Moreover, the paper presents a unique correction factor equation which can be used in the estimation of friction head loss through either lateral or manifold of varying diameter and constant velocity, 1. 0 m/s. Lateral or manifold of varying diameter and of constant velocity is compared with that of constant diameter and varying velocity. A “relative saving ” is defined. A relationship of “relative saving ” is derived and a unique formula is presented to relate the relative saving to the number of outlets. It is shown that the “relative saving ” is increasing as the number of outlets increases...|$|E
40|$|Study on {{the effect}} of dose {{management}} on water irrigation and the effect of pruning corn lower leaves on productivity of Lamuru variety grown on dry land of dry climate area has been done. The experiment was organized at Naibonat Experimental Station, East Kupang Subdistrict, Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, from June to October 2011. The area used was 72 × 32 m using split plot design methods, employing two treatments. The first treatment was conducted on the main plot with water irrigation dose given 100, 80, and 60 % the dose control was according to the farmer’s customary. The second treatment was applied by pruning or not pruning the lower leaves at the generative phase on the determined <b>submain</b> plot. The result showed that dose of water irrigation of 80 and 60 % gave significant effect on corn productivity, that is 7. 3 and 5. 3 ton/ha, but not significant to the control (6. 6 ton/ha). On the other hand, the treatment with and without leaf pruning did not give significant effect on the growth component because pruning was conducted during the generative phase. The Anova test result of corn productivity was not significantly different between the treatment of with and without pruning. The treatment of 80 % dose of water irrigation could save water until 842 m 3 or 20 % per planting season per hectare. Meanwhile, the farmer’s customary wasted the water up to 2. 105 m 3 or 50 % per planting season per hectare. Based on the results, the optimizing of water irrigation interval is seven times more efficient in one planting period as compared to 14 irrigation times in one planting period...|$|E
40|$|La microirrigation est une {{technique}} dont l'uniformité de distribution d'eau par les goutteurs est très sensible aux faibles variations de pression. Pour maîtriser ces variations, avec davantage de précision, le présent travail est basé sur une analyse hydraulique approfondie de l'écoulement aboutissant à des équations différentielles aux dérivées partielles dont la pression et la vitesse de l'eau sont des inconnues. Ces équations non linéaires sont résolues en utilisant la méthode d'intégration Runge-Kutta d'ordre quatre. Les modèles développés dans la présente étude permettent de simuler la dynamique de l'eau dans la rampe et dans le réseau et sont utilisés pour déterminer le dimensionnement optimal du réseau. Les résultats obtenus corroborent ceux publiés par d'autres auteurs ayant utilisé la méthode des volumes de contrôle ou la méthode des éléments finis. Micro-irrigation {{is recommended}} for use in arid and semi-arid countries such as Algeria. This method consists of accurately providing {{the right amount of}} water and mineral nutrients to the plant's root area. The goal is to provide water efficiently by applying it at the correct rate. However, irrigation efficiency is clearly a function of the uniformity of water application. Micro-irrigation is a technique in which a delicate instrument known as an emitter (a terminal element of the network) operating with low pressure is used. The emitter, designed and manufactured with high precision, is a system with hydraulic laws and norms considered as a black box model that discharges water at atmospheric pressure. The emitter is an element of a network that constitutes a unit called a system or physical model. Water and mineral elements are delivered to a localized place, to the level of each plant by the emitters whose discharge is a function of lateral pressure. The precision of the dosage of irrigation, which must exactly satisfy the requirement for cultivation, depends fundamentally on the design of the network. It takes into account the pressure variations, which are due not only to head loss in the lateral branches of the network but also to the land slope and to the characteristics of the emitters. Water and air temperature and the possible plugging of the emitter orifice also influence the discharge of an emitter. The network is designed to satisfy the water needs of all the plants. Uniformity of water distribution is a main criterion for network design. To understand the variations in water distribution with more precision, we based the present work on a hydraulic analysis focussed on the outflow. This approach yields differential equations in which the pressure and the velocity of water in the pipeline network are unknown; the uniformity of water distribution is largely dependent on these variables. The differential second-order equations obtained are non-linear and analytical resolution is impossible, due to the empirical relation of the discharge emitter and the energy loss relation. Thus, the solution is obtained by numerical methods using the Runge Kutta integration method. The conditions in the limit equation modelling the outflow in the lateral pipes are different from those for the <b>submain</b> pipe. For the lateral pipes, the velocity of water at the extremity of the downstream region is inevitably minimal, as the whole region of discharge in the last pipe section is delivered by the last emitter where the pressure is minimal (Hmin). The velocity and pressure are calculated step by step along the lateral pipe until the entrance of water into the network where the pressure is maximal (Hsmax). The algorithm developed to simulate the emitter discharge distribution from the lateral pipes is called the "RK" model, and when it includes the discharge in the <b>submain</b> pipe it is called the "RS" model. These two models are transcribed in Fortran language by a computer program that automates iterations and calculations. Twelve parameters are changed in turn, or per group according to the cases studied, and the choice of the optimal solution of the parameters includes: emitter coefficients (a, y and Cvf); length and diameter of lateral pipes; the <b>submain</b> and main network (Lr, Dr, Ls, Ds, Lp, Dp); the roughness of the pipes (C); the spacing between the emitters (Δxr); the spacing between the lateral pipes (Δxs); and the water temperature. From these data of discharge and available pressure {{to the level of the}} parcel, the model precisely describes the distribution of the pressure and the discharges to all network emitters. In this case, the total discharge and the total required pressure, the uniformity of pressure and discharges are determined for each pattern of design. The combination of structural, functional and environmental factors is applied to guarantee an optimal exploitation taking into account the limits imposed by the specific norms for the micro-irrigation and the technical limits of velocity and pressure tolerance. Parameters that influence variations in uniformity are numerous and variable, which is why it is not easy to integrate them into this phase of study. The proposed model has merit as it avoids the complex numerical method of finite elements, recommended by some researchers (BRALTS et al., 1993; KANG and NISHIYAMA, 1994). The finite element method based on matrix structuring requires an important volume of iterations and calculations that could constitute a major constraint in the case of a large network. The model of BRALTS et al. (1993) is of particular interest in this regard; our results have been confronted with those obtained with their model. Thus, the models presented in this study permit the simulation of water dynamics in micro-irrigation networks and offer the opportunity to determine the optimal design for such networks. Optimization is based on the variation of twelve classical parameters plus the associated geometric structure of the network, which was shown to be a non-negligible parameter. Optimization would not only reduce irrigation water volumes, but also fertilizer use and pumping energy. The example illustrated in Table 4 shows that although the networks deliver the same total discharge and have some similar design characteristics, the consumption of pumping energy changes from one geometric structure to another. Once a network is installed, it is impossible to change its design, so it is important to assure precision of the design calculations. This work shows promise in the simulation of the optimal design of micro-irrigation networks and also constitutes an economic means of making decisions. Moreover, the modelling results can guide field experimentation to explore other methods. Micro-irrigation can potentially solve many water shortage problems, but it requires further research in the safe reuse of low quality water and wastewater, the development of long term sustainability and the minimization salt accumulation and drainage problems...|$|E

We consider any ϕ∈ R with ϕ≠ 0. In our main theorem we assume several conditions depending on P, z and Newton polyhedrons. By our assumptions the normal fan Σ of the Newton polyhedron Γ_+(P,ϕ) of ϕ over P has simple structure {{and we can}} make a special regular subdivision Σ^* of Σ called an upward subdivision, starting from a regular cone with dimension equal to R and repeating star subdivisions with center in a regular cone of dimension two.

We consider any closed point a∈ X such that σ(a) is the unique closed point of (R) and the morphism σ^*: R →O_X,a of local k-algebras induced by σ. We show that our numerical invariant of σ^*(ϕ) ∈O_X,a measuring the badness of the singularity is strictly less than the same invariant of ϕ∈ R and the singularity ϕ is strictly improved by σ. We notice that this result opens a way toward the theory of resolution of singularities in arbitrary characteristic.
