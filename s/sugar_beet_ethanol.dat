40|$|Purpose The {{results of}} {{published}} Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of biofuels {{are characterized by}} a large variability, arising from the diversity of both biofuel chains and the methodologies used to estimate inventory data. Here, we suggest that the best option to maximize the accuracy of biofuel LCA is to produce local results {{taking into account the}} local soil, climatic and agricultural management factors. Methods We focused on a case study involving the production of first-generation ethanol from sugar beet in the Picardy region in Northern France. To account for local factors, we first defined three climatic patterns according to rainfall from a 20 -year series of weather data. We subsequently defined two crop rotations with sugar beet as a break crop, corresponding to current practice and an optimized management scenario, respectively. The six combinations of climate types and rotations were run with the process-based model CERES-EGC to estimate crop yields and environmental emissions. We completed the data inventory and compiled the impact assessments using Simapro v. 7. 1 and Ecoinvent database v 2. 0. Results Overall, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>ethanol</b> had lower impacts than gasoline for the abiotic depletion, globalwarming, ozone layer depletion and photochemical oxidation categories. In particular, it emitted between 28 % and 42 % less greenhouse gases than gasoline. Conversely, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>ethanol</b> had higher impacts than gasoline for acidification and eutrophication due to losses of reactive nitrogen in the arable field. Thus, LCA results were highly sensitive to changes in local conditions and management factors. As a result, an average impact figures for a given biofuel chain at regional or national scales may only be indicative within a large uncertainty band. Conclusions Although the crop model made it possible to take local factors into account in the life-cycle inventory, best management practices that achieved high yields while reducing environmental impacts could not be identified. Further modelling developments are necessary to better account for the effects of management practices, in particular regarding the benefits of fertiliser incorporation into the topsoil in terms of nitrogen losses abatement. Supplementary data and modelling developments also are needed to better estimate the emissions of pesticides and heavy metals in the field. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture {{is by far}} {{the largest}} water user. This chapter reviews studies on the water {{footprints}} (WFs) of bioenergy (in the form of bioethanol, biodiesel, and heat and electricity produced from biomass) and compares their results with the WFs of fossil energy and other types of renewables (wind power, solar thermal energy, and hydropower). WFs for bioenergy vary, depending on crop type applied, production location, and agricultural practice. The most water-efficient way to generate bioenergy is to use biomass for heat generation, with electricity generation being the second best option. Biofuel production requires roughly twice as much water as bioelectricity. Regarding biofuels, bioethanol has smaller WFs than biodiesel. For example, the WF of rapeseed biodiesel is four times larger than the WF of sugarcane ethanol and seven times larger than the WF of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>ethanol.</b> Global weighted ethanol WFs increase in the order of sugar beet, potato, sugarcane, maize, cassava, barley, rye, paddy rice, wheat, and sorghum and range between 60 and 400 m 3 /GJ. For sugar beet, maize, and sugarcane, differences between regions are large. The European Union, northern Africa, and the United States have relatively small WFs for ethanol from sugar beet and maize, while eastern Europe has large WFs. Global weighted average biodiesel WFs increase in the following order: palm oil (95 m 3 /GJ), soybean and rapeseed (400 m 3 /GJ), and jatropha (570 m 3 /GJ). Conversely, the WFs of fossil fuels are relatively small. Finally, the WF of hydropower varies widely between 0. 5 and 850 m 3 /GJ. Our results provide new insight into the impacts of bioenergy on the use and pollution of freshwater. This knowledge is a valuable contribution to future research and for policies concerning energy needs, freshwater availability, and the choice whether to allocate water to food or energy productio...|$|E

40|$|The Netherlands {{has been}} {{cultivating}} sugar beet in large agro-industrial co-operatives since the 19 th century. In recent years, the sugar quota has limited sugar beet cultivation but the quota will expire in 2017. At the same time, the Dutch government aims {{to stimulate the}} biobased economy, therefore increasing the demand for biomass. For example, the proposed biorefinery project REDIFINERY is expected to consume four million tonnes of feedstock per year. Several studies indicate that, {{with the increase in}} demand, large amounts of biomass are imported to The Netherlands, while locally cultivated biomass shows economic potential at world market prices. Therefore, in this research, the geographic potential of locally cultivated sugar beet as a biomass resource for non-food purposes in the south west of The Netherlands is determined up to 2030. This is achieved by using ArcGIS software, creating maps of the sugar beet yields and costs. These cover the whole research area of the south west of The Netherlands, and, then in more detail, the province of South Holland. Scenarios from PBL/CPB (WLO scenarios) are used to determine agricultural land availability for non-food purposes, and KWIN AGV data is used to determine the cost of cultivation. To determine the transport costs, a demand node is assumed on the Maasvlakte. Other important inputs in to the model are; soil type, experience with sugar beet cultivation and transport distance. To determine the potential, the findings are benchmarked against imported lignocellulosic biomass sources. The supply costs found are extrapolated until 2030 to determine the future of sugar beet as a biomass source and as a stepping stone for the Dutch biobased economy. Finally, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the locally grown sugar beets are compared to imported biomass. In the south west of The Netherlands, the theoretical potential is estimated to be 198. 8 PJ (52 Mt sugar beet, 8, 946 kt fermentable sugar). The technical potential, limited by the crop rotations and WLO scenarios, is estimated to be 1. 9 PJ (0. 490 Mt sugar beet, 84 kt fermentable sugar). The economic potential, limited by the technical potential, is estimated to be 1. 9 PJ (0. 490 Mt sugar beet, 84 kt fermentable sugar). If the province of South Holland is examined in detail, the theoretical potential is estimated to be 39. 2 PJ (10. 3 Mt sugar beet, 1. 76 Mt fermentable sugar); the technical potential, limited by crop rotations and land availability without harming the food and feed supply, is estimated to be 0. 4 PJ (0. 094 Mt sugar beet, 16 kt fermentable sugar). The economic potential, again limited by the technical potential, is estimated to be 0. 4 PJ (0. 094 Mt sugar beet, 16 kt fermentable sugar). The net present value (NPV) of the business as usual (BAU) and bio economy crop rotations are compared in South Holland and they show that the NPV would increase when sugar beet is increased in the rotation. The data, with the addition of lower and higher limits, is shown in table 1. The 0. 49 Mt of sugar beet cultivated for non-food purposes in the south west of The Netherlands makes a large contribution to the 1. 6 Mt currently cultivated. The 0. 094 Mt of sugar beet cultivated for non-food purposes in the province of South Holland also substantially contributes to the 0. 3 Mt currently cultivated. However, when the potentials found in the south west of The Netherlands are compared to the demand, which is set to rise, by the REDIFINIERY project for example, it will only be a small contribution.   Table 1 Theoretical, Technical and Economic potential of sugar beet cultivation found in this thesis 		Reference case	Lower limit 	Higher limit 	Area	PJ (total yield 1) 	PJ (total yield) 	PJ (total yield 1) Theoretical Potential	SW-N 3 	 198. 8 (52 - 8, 946) 	N.

The results show that Dutch sugar beet cultivation costs are projected to remain below global market prices for raw sugars, fermentable sugars derived from woodchips, and fermentable sugars derived from wood pellets until 2030. Lastly, the GHG emissions of ethanol from sugar beet are compared to those of woodchips, assuming that ethanol will be produced. The GHG emissions of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>ethanol</b> range from 38 to 40 g CO 2 -eq/MJ ethanol and a GHG-saving performance of between 52 % and 53 %. This is insufficient to meet the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) (2009 / 28 /EC) threshold for liquid biofuel installations installed after 2018 (60 %). Sugar beet cultivation in the south west of The Netherlands can compete economically until 2030 in the world biomass market. It has a total potential of 0. 49 Mt of sugar beet cultivated at or below world market prices. This increases even further if technical constraints on competition with the food supply are not taken into account...|$|E

The factors favoring <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and adoption in the district include: adequate land area suitable for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and the high <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield that can be attained per unit suitable land area, farmers' awareness of the positive aspects of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation, and the willingness of many farmers to grow the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop. Notwithstanding these favorable conditions, some socio-economic factors-mainly the affordability of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production and possible lack of appropriate farming technologies, will present challenges to widespread <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption, particularly to those farmers in the low-and medium-income categories. The <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> profit analysis showed that depending on the market price, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> can potentially increase household net income. However, since the majority of households are in the low-and medium-income categories, for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> to pull the smallholder farmers out of poverty, interventions from government and other stakeholders is of vital necessity.

The {{process of}} {{intensive}} transformation {{to which the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> market in the European Union has been subject {{in recent years in}} order to meet the external obligations set by the WTO Panel, has had a severe impact on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in Poland. Two major observations have been reported, namely a significant decrease of number of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> farms and a reduction in those areas of tillage surfaces intended for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. It is worth mentioning that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is highly important to crop rotation and hardly any other plant in European agriculture can replace it. There is therefore both a strong need and a great opportunity for the further support and development of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. As the interna-tional obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emission became effective, interest in biomass us-age as a viable alternative to fossil fuels increased. This study thus set out to perform an eco-nomic comparison in respect of the use of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> for traditional purposes and for energy, and to conduct an economic analysis of the income obtained from the sale of electrical energy sale by a biogas facility where <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were used for biogas production.

40|$|The Rural Economic Department, University of Nebraska, after a {{study of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> {{production}} records, concluded that the area immediately {{in the vicinity of}} Gering, Nebraska, produced <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> consistently low in sugar percentage. In addition, the area near the Costin and Haig <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> dumps produced <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> of below average sugar content. It was suggested that the low percentage of sugar in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> produced in these areas may be due to an excess of available nitrogen in the soil, to an inadequate supply of available phosphorus in the soil, or to a lack of balance of available nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil. In order to test these ideas, three experiments were conducted to determine the influence of nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the soil on the sugar percentage of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> Advidor: H.

40|$|World sugar {{consumption}} {{has been}} recording a steady {{growth in the}} past 70 years and, according to all relevant estimates, {{it will continue to}} grow also in the next decade, which puts sugar in the category of the most significant foods and commodities in the world. Of the total world sugar production, around 77 % is derived from sugar cane and 23 % from <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> Brazil has been the world leader in sugar production {{for a long period of}} time, producing white sugar from sugar cane only, whereas the leader in the production of sugar derived from <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is the EU- 28. When the Republic of Croatia joined the EU, the Croatian sugar industry became part of the single European sugar market, so the break-even point was used in the research to determine the competitiveness level of the Croatian <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. Based on the expected selling price of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> amounting to EUR 34 per ton of standard quality <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> and using the break-even method, it was determined that the quantity required to cover total costs in <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in the Republic of Croatia amounts to 55. 26 tons per hectare of payable <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> standard quality, i. e. 8. 84 tons of polarized sugar per hectare. As the average <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in the Republic of Croatia, expressed in the equivalent of polarized sugar, amounts to 7. 8 tons per hectare, it is obvious that an average Croatian producer of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> without income from subsidies, operates at a loss.

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies have}} shown that weight and sugar content {{decrease}} during <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> storage in silos. Different parameter such as size of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> and height of storage, can affect on changes of weight and sugar. These parameters arewere considered in this study. Therefore, random sampling was done from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that had been carried to Shirvan <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> factory silos. Samples were divided in 4 groups of size (large, medium, small and mixed). These groups were stored in 4 different heights in industrial Shirvan <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> factory silos and after 18 days, pol and weight of beets were measured and were compared with data obtained on first day (before storing). The results showed that during storage of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> in silos, maximum weight and sugar loses belonged to small <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> with 5. 54 to 6. 97 and 3. 86 to 4. 13 percent decrease, respectively. Also minimum weight and sugar loses belonged to samples that were stored in floor of silos with 1. 69 to 1. 91 percent decrease. Increasing of height of storage resulted to increase of weight lose, so maximum of weight lose belonged to <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that were stored in 5 meter height (silos level) and amount of it was 6. 37 to 9. 84 percent. Furthermore, results showed that maximum of sugar lose belonged to <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that were stored in the lowest height in this study and amount of it was between 4. 80 to 5. 20 percent. Increasing the height of storage caused to decreasing of sugar loses, as sugar loses of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that was stored on the uppermost level were obtained between 1. 77 to 2. 20 percent.

40|$|In Kenya the {{government}} is promoting diversification of crops to embrace high value crops and drought resistant crop varieties in efforts to reduce poverty in rural areas. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> {{is one of the}} crops considered as an option in this context and it is therefore important to increase knowledge about the potentials in the country for cultivating this crop. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> trials conducted in Nyandarua and Butere Mumias Districts of Kenya have shown that the crop yields are comparable to those obtained in traditional sugar-beet cultivation regions of Europe. Since <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield is affected by climate and soils, the results of Nyandarua and Butere Mumias <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> trials are not adequate to propose that comparable yields can be obtained elsewhere in the country and other tropical regions. Physical land evaluations assessing the potentials and constraints for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production are therefore essential. The objectives {{of this study was to}} develop a Tropical <b>Sugar</b> <b>Beet</b> Land Evaluation Scheme (TSBLES) that can aid assessment of the suitability of different areas in the tropics for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation; and to test this scheme for an assessment of suitable <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> zones and land areas in Kenya. The development of the scheme was based on various literature sources and expert judgment on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> requirements, and a Tropical <b>Sugar</b> <b>Beet</b> yield prediction Model. The TSBLES accounts for physical conditions of land i. e. climatic, edaphic and topographic conditions. According to the assessment results 27 % of the land area in Kenya is suitable for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. Of this area, 5 % is highly suitable, another 5 % is moderately suitable and 17 % is marginally suitable. Most of the highly suitable land area is concentrated in Rift Valley, Central and Nyanza provinces. The Rift Valley has the highest share of the suitable land area...|$|R
