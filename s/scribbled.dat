40|$|<b>Scribble</b> is a {{potential}} tumor suppressor protein, whose loss is a frequent event in late stage cancer development. In both Drosophila and mammalian model systems, <b>Scribble</b> has been shown capable of regulating cell polarity, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Although several interacting partners, including βPiX, have been identified that help to explain how <b>Scribble</b> can regulate cell polarity and migration, {{little is known about}} how <b>Scribble</b> can control cell proliferation. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that <b>Scribble</b> can directly regulate the ERK signaling pathway. This is mediated by a direct protein-protein interaction between <b>Scribble</b> and ERK, which has two components. In the first, <b>Scribble</b> appears to anchor ERK at membrane-bound sites, with the loss of <b>Scribble</b> enhancing ERK nuclear translocation. In the second, <b>Scribble</b> can decrease the levels of active phosphorylated ERK, a function that is dependent upon the ability of <b>Scribble</b> to bind ERK directly. One of the consequences of this activity of <b>Scribble</b> is the inhibition of EJ-ras induced cell transformation. These results provide some of the first direct mechanistic information on how <b>Scribble</b> can regulate cell proliferation and, furthermore, they provide indications as to the identity of other signaling intermediates that may be recruited by <b>Scribble</b> to directly regulate mitogenic signaling pathways...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNeurite {{outgrowth}} {{is mediated}} by dynamic {{changes of the}} cytoskeleton and is largely controlled by Rho GTPases and their regulators. Here, we show that the polarity protein <b>Scribble</b> controls PC 12 cell neurite outgrowth in response to nerve growth factor. <b>Scribble</b> knockdown decreases neurite numbers and increases neurite length. This effect is linked to TrkA the cognate receptor for NGF as pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylated TrkA (pTrkA) reduces <b>Scribble</b> expression. Moreover, <b>Scribble</b> forms a complex with the MAPK components ERK 1 / 2 in a growth factor dependent manner. In RNAi experiments where <b>Scribble</b> expression is efficiently depleted sustained ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation is reduced. Conversely, siRNA with intermediate <b>Scribble</b> silencing efficiency fails to match this effect indicating that ERK 1 / 2 activation depends on basic <b>Scribble</b> protein levels. Finally, <b>Scribble</b> translocates to the plasma membrane in response to growth factor where it complexes with HRas and Rac 1 suggesting that the phenotype activated by loss of <b>Scribble</b> may {{be a result of}} altered GTPase activity. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role for <b>Scribble</b> in neurite outgrowth of PC 12 cells...|$|R

Despite evidence that the function of <b>Scribble</b> is maintained in the lymphocyte lineage, we still understand little about {{its role as a}} tumour suppressor in haematological malignancies. Using the Eμ-myc model of Burkitt’s lymphoma we investigated the role of <b>Scribble</b> in lymphomagenesis. We found that contrary to its well-documented tumour suppressor role in epithelial tissue, loss of <b>Scribble</b> expression delayed the expansion of peripheral B cells and delayed the onset of Eμ-myc-driven lymphoma. This was despite upregulated ERK phosphorylation levels in Scribble-deficient tumours, which are associated with loss of <b>Scribble</b> expression and the development of more aggressive Burkitt’s lymphoma. Interestingly, the developmental stage of lymphoma was unaffected by <b>Scribble</b> expression challenging any role for <b>Scribble</b> in fate determination in the haematopoetic lineage. These data provide evidence for oncogenic properties of <b>Scribble</b> in Myc-driven B-cell lymphomagenesis, reinforcing recent findings that overexpression of a mutant form of <b>Scribble</b> can act as an oncogene in epithelial cells.

Users do not undergo a design stage through software, {{and are able to}} fabricate practical and sustainable artifacts using <b>Scribbler,</b> a modeling system consisting of <b>Scribbler</b> tubes and a <b>Scribbler</b> tube gun. <b>Scribbler</b> tubes are hard hollow tubes with a temperature dependent rigidity. A <b>Scribbler</b> tube gun controls the rigidity of the <b>Scribbler</b> tube by controlling its temperature. Users can model the <b>Scribbler</b> tube while it is soft, and proceed to cool it with the <b>Scribbler</b> tube gun to keep it in shape.

30|$|It may be {{observed}} that for large <b>scribble</b> coverage, three investigated methods deliver very similar outcome (top {{row in the}} Figures), and the differences are hardly visible, which is confirmed by the quantitative results. However, for smaller coverage, the images obtained using these methods differ significantly. It may be seen that both visually and quantitatively FIVC method is the most sensitive to the <b>scribble</b> coverage and it fails to colorize the images correctly for fewer <b>scribbles.</b> Competitive image colorization has higher stability, {{making it possible to}} colorize the image based on medium <b>scribble</b> coverage.

When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. She {{goes on to say that}} with her new powers, she will be able to make his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories.

40|$|Mammalian <b>Scribble</b> is {{a target}} for {{proteins}} encoded by human papilloma virus, retro- and flaviviruses. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus that have evolved distinct strategies to escape antiviral responses. Information of how flaviviruses intrude on cell integrity comes from understanding of the roles that host-factors play when they interfere with viruses. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes a novel interaction between the TBEVNS 5 protein and <b>Scribble.</b> The importance of the interaction was demonstrated by RNAi-mediated depletion of <b>Scribble,</b> which prevented suppression of JAK-STAT signaling by NS 5. Together, these results define <b>Scribble</b> as a novel target for NS 5. TBEV is known to cause central nervous system disease TBE in humans that can lead to cognitive dysfunction. A unifying theme in CNS related diseases are defects in neuronal extensions. We therefore addressed the effects of TBEV expression in PC 12 cell differentiation, which is characterized by extensive neurite growth. Our data show that TBEVNS 5 suppresses neurite outgrowth through the Rho GTPase Rac 1. These findings provide evidence that Rac 1 is an indirect target of NS 5 in neurite inhibition. <b>Scribble</b> was recently implicated in spine morphogenesis. Thus, we tested the role of <b>Scribble</b> in neurite elongation. Depletion of <b>Scribble</b> in PC 12 cells, reduced neurite density but increased length of those remaining. Moreover, <b>Scribble</b> bound components in the Ras/ERK cascade in a growth factor dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrate that <b>Scribble</b> controls neurite elongation by scaffolding MAPK components. Moreover, as loss of dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions on neurons, is a feature in cognitive dysfunction we speculate that cognitive dysfunction in TBE might involve disturbed <b>Scribble</b> expression by NS 5. We also investigated the binding between NS 1 of Influenza A virus and <b>Scribble.</b> The PDZ domains of <b>Scribble</b> are usually selective for specific C-terminal motifs in proteins. Because NS 1 has a canonical PDZ motif we tested if binding to <b>Scribble</b> depends on this motif. We found that <b>Scribble</b> binds NS 1; the association is dependent on the NS 1 C-terminus that is recognized by PDZ 3 - 4 of <b>Scribble.</b> Together, these results suggest that <b>Scribble</b> is {{a target for}} the H 5 N 1 NS 1 protein At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : In press.

40|$|Loss of {{polarity}} {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} hallmarks of epithelial neoplasia and leads to aberrant communication between the epithelial cell and its microenvironment. Understanding how deregulation of polarity occurs and how it may contribute to tumour formation is a new and unexplored area of cancer research. Genetic screens in Drosophila have identified <b>scribble,</b> discs large (dlg) and lethal giant larvae (lgl) as key epithelial polarity regulators with mutation in any of these genes resulting in loss of polarity, overproliferation and multilayering of epithelial cells leading to 3 D-tumourous overgrowth, and in the presence of activated Ras, invasion and metastasis. We have recently described the human homologue of <b>Scribble</b> and demonstrated using complementation studies in Drosophila that expression of human <b>Scribble</b> can also regulate polarity and proliferation. Evidence from cancer patients suggests that <b>Scribble</b> and Dlg could act as a tumour suppressor in some epithelial cancers with, in many cases, low levels of <b>Scribble</b> or Dlg correlating with increased tumour invasiveness and malignancy. We have undertaken a detailed functional analysis of <b>Scribble</b> in mammalian epithelial cells and mice mutant for <b>Scribble</b> and uncovered a critical role for <b>Scribble</b> in the regulation of epithelial polarity required for directed migration during development and wound healing in vivo. In addition, we show that impaired human <b>Scribble</b> can function together with activated Ras to lead to increased invasion and tumourigenesis. Therefore, <b>Scribble</b> can act to promote or inhibit migration dependent on the cellular context. We propose that <b>Scribble</b> and other polarity regulators may be key signalling molecules involved in a new pathway regulating epithelial tumour progression in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in genes of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway occur in approximately 30 % {{of all human}} cancers; however, mutation of Ras alone is rarely sufficient to induce tumour development. <b>Scribble</b> is a polarity regulator recently isolated from a Drosophila screen for events that cooperate with Ras mutation to promote tumour progression and cell invasion. In mammals, <b>Scribble</b> regulates directed cell migration and wound healing in vivo; however, no role has been identified for mammalian <b>Scribble</b> in oncogenic transformation. Here we show that in human epithelial cells expressing oncogenic Ras or Raf, loss of <b>Scribble</b> promotes invasion of cells through extracellular matrix in an organotypic culture system. Further, we show that the mechanism by which this occurs is in the regulation of MAPK signalling by <b>Scribble.</b> The suppression of MAPK signalling is a highly conserved function of <b>Scribble</b> as it also prevents Raf-mediated defects in Drosophila wing development. Our data identify <b>Scribble</b> as an important mediator of MAPK signalling and provide a molecular basis for the observation that <b>Scribble</b> expression is decreased in many invasive human cancers. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved...|$|R
