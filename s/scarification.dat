5|$|Ritual <b>scarification</b> in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} {{forehead}} down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many <b>scarification</b> marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{physicians}} performed surgery so rarely, the Middle Ages saw {{a proliferation}} of barbers, among other medical [...] "paraprofessionals", including cataract couchers, herniotomists, lithotomists, midwives, and pig gelders. In 1254, Bruno di Longoburgo, a physician who wrote on surgery, was concerned about barbers performing phlebotomies and <b>scarifications.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Scarification</b> had {{its origins}} in Nri mythology. Nri, the son of Eri who {{established}} the town of Nri, {{was said to have}} pleaded to Chukwu (the Great God) because of hunger. Chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son's and daughter's heads and plant them, creating a 'blood bond' between the Igbo and the earth deity, Ana. Before doing so, Nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads. Coco yam, a crop managed by females, sprang from his daughter's head, and yam, the Igbo peoples' staple crop, sprung from his son's head; Chukwu had taught Nri plant domestication. From this, the eze Nri's first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification's seven days after birth, with the eze Nri's daughter being the only female to receive ichi. Nri, the son of Eri, also gained knowledge of the yam medicine (ogwu ji). People from other Igbo communities made pilgrimages to Nri in order to receive this knowledge received in exchange for annual tributes.|$|E
25|$|Art {{director}} James Robbins {{developed the}} design of the Ori and the Priors from scratch. At the beginning he knew a basic description of them and their powers, and that they would carry a staff weapon. The art department first looked at Japanese and Samurai from a costuming point of view. Inspired by remote jungle tribes for the mystical aspects, Robbins {{came up with the idea}} of <b>scarification</b> for the Priors and the Doci. The Priors have scarifications on the chin and the cheek, while the Doci also have them on their forehead. <b>Scarification</b> would therefore be a symbol of high establishment. Originally, it was also considered to have <b>scarification</b> on the hands, and to have the Priors have finger extensions, but this became too impracticable. When the Prime Jaffa Gerak became a Prior in , his golden Jaffa tattoo on his forehead was replaced with a Prior <b>scarification,</b> and his makeup was made to look like the gold had melted and become part of his Prior <b>scarification.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{initiation}} {{into these}} Nnukwu-Ozo titles was and still is, very expensive. Historically, the initiation ceremony into {{the secrets of}} the Nnukwu-Ozo involved the very painful and prestigious Ichi <b>scarification,</b> by which these men were identified in public. The Ichi <b>scarification</b> as part of the ritual has been discontinued in modern times for aesthetic reasons. The last bearer of Ichi marks, Chief Ezenwosu died in the early twentieth century. Other distinctive pieces of regalia that identify the Ozo title holder and the Nnukwu-Ozo title holder in Awka-Etiti are the red cap (with eagle feathers for the Nnukwu-Ozo), the horse tail fly whisk, the round cow hide fan and the elephant tusk.|$|E

25|$|For {{the look}} of aliens, the make-up {{department}} collaborated with prosthetics companies from Vancouver and Los Angeles, including Todd Masters. While the human origins of many alien races and human civilizations were left recognizable, the recurring characters {{who were members of}} the Unas race required elaborate prosthetics and make-up work. To convey the cultural origins of the various fictional human civilizations living on different planets after their displacement from Earth, the costume designers combined elements of their respective Earth cultures with modern fabrics, elaborate trims and chains to produce a historically rooted yet otherworldly appearance. The look of the Goa'uld such as Apophis was initially based on {{the look of}} Ra in the feature film. For the design of the Ori and the Priors in Season 9, the art department looked at Japanese and Samurai garments for costume design. Art director James Robbins found the face painting, <b>scarification</b> and burns of remote jungle tribes mystical and these served as inspiration for the face <b>scarification</b> of the Priors and the Doci. Early ideas to include finger extensions and <b>scarification</b> on these characters' hands were discarded as impracticable.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Fifty-four {{patients}} {{with evidence of}} locally advanced primary squamous cell bronchial carcinoma (SCC), and three {{patients with}} adenocarcinoma (AC) had lung resection to remove all the visible tumour. After operation a randomly chosen group of 20 SCC patients received adjuvant BCG immunostimulation by <b>scarifications</b> (BCG-A). An additional group of 14 SCC patients, and three AC patients received initially intrapleural BCG treatment and sub-sequently <b>scarifications</b> (BCG-B). A control group of 20 SCC patients received no adjuvant treatment. Follow-up studies were done from three to 51 months. Immune reactivity was monitored in vivo with PPD skin tests in 33 treated and in 18 untreated patients. In both the BCG-treated SCC groups recurrence rates decreased statistically significant during follow-up (BCG-A: six to 51 months, p< 0001; BCG: 6 - 9 months, p< 001 and nine to 24 months, p< 0001). However, no difference could be demonstrated between systemic and combined systemic and intrapleural treatment. The three BCG-treated AC patients all relapsed within nine months of follow-up. A pronounced increase in skin reactivity to PPD was seen six months after surgery in the BCG-treated patients (BCG-A, p< 0001; BCG-B, p< 001), whereas the control patients remained anergic after surgery.

40|$|The {{case of a}} 40 -year-old black man, who {{developed}} a very unusual tumour-like lymphoid hyperplasia involving primarily the subcutaneous tissue, is reported. The lesion, which arose at a site of tribal <b>scarifications,</b> displayed a deceptive morphology that closely resembled subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL). An accurate diagnosis could only be made following detailed immunohistochemical and molecular studies. Although SPTCL has been thought to represent a very specific clinicopathologic entity, the present case illustrates that its histological appearance can, however, be closely mimicked by reactive and benign conditions.

50|$|In {{their wedding}} ceremonies music {{is played by}} males with large {{calabash}} trumpets (was'a).

25|$|Australian Aboriginal tribes {{usually had}} {{long periods of}} time to help prepare {{adolescent}} boys, teaching them traditional lore before they were ready to attend large elaborate ceremonies at the time of initiation when they were finally recognized as full-fledged men in their society.

25|$|Some tribal {{cultures}} traditionally created tattoos {{by cutting}} designs {{into the skin}} and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to <b>scarification.</b> Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s {{it was thought}} that the Igbo Ukwu bronze and copper items were of an external origin or were influenced by outside technology due to their technical sophistication. The opposite was revealed to be true since local copper deposits had been exploited by the 9th century and anthropological evidence, such as the Ichi-like <b>scarifications</b> on the human figures, show local origin. The works have been attributed to an isolated bronze industry which had developed without outside influence over time to reach such sophistication.|$|R
5000|$|Alternative porn (also {{known as}} alt-porn, altporn, alternaporn, or simply alt), a {{shortening}} of [...] "alternative pornography", tends to involve members of such subcultures as goths, punks, emos, scenes, skaters or ravers {{and is often}} produced by small and independent websites or filmmakers. It often features models with body modifications such as tattoos, piercings, or <b>scarifications,</b> or temporary modifications such as dyed hair.

50|$|Daniele Buetti became {{internationally known}} in the 2000s with a major group of works {{entitled}} Looking for Love.

25|$|<b>Scarification</b> mimics natural {{processes}} that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, {{such as the}} heat of a fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or soaking in a body of water {{for a long period of}} time. Others need to be passed through an animal's digestive tract to weaken the seed coat enough to allow the seedling to emerge.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} {{of social and}} religious transition ceremonies {{that can be found}} in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and <b>scarification.</b> Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual <b>scarification,</b> traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E

40|$|Dogs are {{animals that}} are most often kept as pets in the cities. Their health problem may {{be the cause of}} infections of humans and animals. Skin changes and {{etiology}} factors present important segment of the diseases that disturb health of the pets. The objective of this work was mycology examination of <b>scarifications</b> and skin swabs from dogs with clinical symptoms. The aim was to find out which fungi species can be isolated from the changed parts of the skin, and whether is possible that, besides dermatophyte, saprophyte fungi from the environment may also be the cause of the changes, and to reveal their effect on the host. During a one year period, 67 swabs and <b>scarifications</b> from dogs were examined to detect the presence of fungi. The samples were streaked on Sabourdaud's dextrose agar and incubated for 10 - 21 days at 25 °C. In microscopis examination according to their shape, and color, the colonies were identified as conidia, macroconidia and conidiaophora. From 59, of total 67 samples, the following saprophyte fungi were isolated: Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., Alternaria sp., Mucor sp. and Fusarium sp. Occurrence of these fungi means that a considerable increase of this microbiological flora may be expected in homes of the owners. This may be the cause of systemic mycosis and allergies in animals and humans, as well as a possibility of contaminated food and incidence of mycotoxicosis...|$|R
