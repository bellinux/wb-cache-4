50|$|To {{achieve the}} {{required}} TSFC, the EJ22 turbofan {{was designed as}} a three <b>spool</b> <b>engine</b> having a fan, two axial compressors and three expansion turbines. As a result, the engine was significantly more complicated than any prior Williams International engine. While very impressive on the test stand, the EJ22 proved quite temperamental during the two years of its development process and it was frequently subject to problems starting, overheating, part failures and various subsystem issues. While most of the problems may have eventually been resolved during a normal development program, the shortened development period, and the frequent changes by Eclipse, proved to be insurmountable obstacles.|$|E
50|$|Although the TriStar's design {{schedule}} {{closely followed}} {{that of its}} competitor, McDonnell-Douglas beat Lockheed to market by a year due to delays in powerplant development. In February 1971, after massive development {{costs associated with the}} RB211, Rolls-Royce went into receivership. This halted L-1011 final assembly and Lockheed investigated the possibility of a US engine supplier. However the engineering was finalized at that stage in the TriStar's development and its S-duct, which was designed to fit the smaller cross-section of the triple spool RB-211 engine that would have reduced drag, was too small in diameter to accommodate an existing double <b>spool</b> <b>engine.</b> One option presented was potential outsource of RB-211 production to Canadian manufacturer Orenda Engines.|$|E

5000|$|One {{issue with}} trijets is {{positioning}} the central engine. On most trijets this is {{placed at the}} tail along the centerline, producing some technical difficulties. The most common configuration is having the central engine located in the rear fuselage and supplied with air by an S-shaped duct [...] - [...] this is used on the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Boeing 727, Tupolev Tu-154, Lockheed Tristar and, more recently, the Dassault_Falcon_7X. The S-duct design {{has the advantage of}} reduced drag, additionally since the engine outlet is located lower down, the aircraft will be easier to handle {{in the event of an}} engine failure. However, S-ducts are complicated and costly designs. Furthermore, the central engine bay would require structural changes in order accommodate future larger-diameter engines in the case of the Boeing 727 and Lockheed TriStar. The Boeing 727's central bay was only wide enough to fit a low-bypass turbofan and not the newer high-bypass turbofans which had greater output as well as being quiet enough to meet new noise regulations of the 1980s, but such a redesign was prohibitively expensive and so Boeing ended production of the 727 instead of pursuing further development. The Lockheed Tristar's S-duct cross section was too small to fit an existing double <b>spool</b> <b>engine</b> as it was designed only to accommodate the new triple spool RB211 engine, and delays in RB211 development in turn pushed back the TriStar's entry into service which affected sales. [...] The DC-10 and related MD-11 use an alternative [...] "straight" [...] layout, which allows for easier engine installation, modification, and access. However, this has inferior aerodynamic properties when compared to the S-duct designs. Also, as the engine outlet is located much higher up than the wing-mounted engines, an engine failure will produce a greater moment about the aircraft's lateral axis, making it more difficult to control.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) has {{attracted much attention}} in control theory {{during the last three}} decades which has resulted in development of sophisticated FDI algorithms. However, increasing the complexity of FDI algorithms is not necessarily feasible. Particularly for on-line FDI, the FDI unit must have the minimum possible computation cost to prevent any long delays in fault detection. In this research, we try to address the FDI problem of a single <b>spool</b> jet <b>engine</b> by using a modified linear multiple model (MM). We first develop a novel symbolic computation-based method for linearization purposes such that the obtained linear models are subjected to the symbolic fault variables. By substituting certain values for these symbolic variables, one can obtain different linear models, which describe mathematically the healthy and faulty models. In order to select the operating point, we use this fact that for a given constant fuel flow (W_f), the system reaches a steady state, that is varying for different values of W_f. Therefore, the operating points for linearization can be determined by the level of the Power Level Angel (PLA) (different values of W_f). These operating points are selected such that an observer, which is designed as a candidate for the healthy mode, can accurately estimates the states of the system in healthy scenario and the number of false alarm then would be kept to minimum. If the system works at different operating points one can then discretize the W_f into different intervals such that in each interval a linear model represents the behavior of the original system. By using the obtained models for different operating points, one designs the corresponding FDI units. Second, we provide a modified multiple model (MM) approach to investigate the FDI problem of a single <b>spool</b> jet <b>engine.</b> The main advantage of this method {{lies in the fact that}} the proposed MM consists of a certain set of linear Kalman filter banks rather than using nonlinear Kalman filters such as the Extended Kalman Filter which requires more computational cost. Moreover, a hierarchical structural multiple model is used to detect and isolate multiple faults. The simulation results show the capability of the proposed method when it is applied to a single <b>spool</b> jet <b>engine</b> model. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to develop and {{evaluate}} a cutback noise minimization process - also known as dynamic cutback optimization - that considers <b>engine</b> <b>spool</b> down during thrust cutback and is consistent with ICAO and FAR Part 36 noise certification procedures. Simplified methods for flyover EPNL prediction used by propulsion designers assume instantaneous thrust reduction and do {{not take into account}} the spooling down of the engine during the cutback procedure. The thesis investigates if there is an additional noise benefit that can be gained by modeling the <b>engine</b> <b>spool</b> down behavior. This in turn would improve the margin between predicted EPNL and Stage 4 noise regulations. Modeling dynamic cutback also impacts engine design during the preliminary and detailed design stages. Reduced noise levels due to cutback may be traded for lower engine fan diameter, which in turn reduces weight, fuel burn, and cost. M. S.

5000|$|The TriStar's design {{featured}} a twin-aisle interior {{with a maximum}} of 400 passengers and a three-engine layout. The TriStar was originally conceived as a [...] "jumbo twin", but a three-engine design was ultimately chosen to give the aircraft enough thrust to take off from existing runways. The main visible difference between the TriStar and its similar trijet competitor, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, is the central tail engine configuration: the DC-10's engine is mounted above the fuselage for simplicity of design and more economical construction, while the TriStar's engine is mounted to the rear fuselage and fed through an S-duct (similar to the Boeing 727) for reduced drag, improved stability, and easier servicing/replacement. Lockheed engineers were able to maintain straight-through engine performance by limiting {{the curve of the}} S-duct to {{less than a quarter of}} the radius of the engine intake diameter. The S-duct design also reduced the total empty aircraft weight. The research undertaken during the design of the L-1011 indicated that losses of using an S-duct were more than compensated for by the above savings. A further major difference between the L-1011 and the DC-10 was Lockheed's selection of the Rolls-Royce RB211 as the only engine for the L-1011. As originally designed, the RB211 turbofan was an advanced three-spool design with a carbon fiber fan, which would have better efficiency and power-to-weight ratio than any competing engine like the General Electric CF6 that powered the DC-10. In theory, the triple spool would produce the same or more power of existing double <b>spool</b> <b>engines</b> while having a smaller cross section that would reduce drag.|$|R

Three types of integration methods, including explicit integration methods, implicit integration methods, and the proposed {{hybrid integration}} method, are used to integrate the dynamic model. Simulation of the model by explicit integration methods fails to reach real time, since the stiff characteristic of the engine model requires small integration step size to maintain stability. On the other hand, although use of an implicit integration algorithm can enlarge the step size, extra function evaluations are needed to calculate the system Jacobian for the Newton-Raphson algorithm, and the simulation still cannot reach real time.

40|$|The core noise {{components}} of a dual <b>spool</b> turbofan <b>engine</b> (Honeywell TECH 977) were separated {{by the use of}} a coherence function. A source location technique based on adjusting the time delay between the combustor pressure sensor signal and the far-field microphone signal to maximize the coherence and remove as much variation of the phase angle with frequency as possible was used. While adjusting the time delay to maximize the coherence and minimize the cross spectrum phase angle variation with frequency, the discovery was made that for the 130 microphone a 90. 027 ms time shift worked best for the frequency band from 0 to 200 Hz while a 86. 975 ms time shift worked best for the frequency band from 200 to 400 Hz. Since the 0 to 200 Hz band signal took more time to travel the same distance, it is slower than the 200 to 400 Hz band signal. This suggests the 0 to 200 Hz coherent cross spectral density band is partly due to indirect combustion noise attributed to hot spots interacting with the turbine.
