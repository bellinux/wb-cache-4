The B of Battersea was a problem for me. The floor manager <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> say [...] "Crufts" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|On February21,1985, Yankovic began {{recording}} the parodies for Dare to Be Stupid. The first parody recorded for {{the album was}} [...] "Yoda". [...] "Yoda" [...] was originally written by Yankovic during the initial run of the 1980 American film The Empire Strikes Back. After {{the success of the}} movie, Yankovic {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable song to use as the base. Yankovic remembers, [...] "I was still in college at the time, and a friend of mine named Mike <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do the song to the tune of 'Lola'—which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since I was such a huge Kinks fan." [...] Yankovic wrote and recorded a version of the song, using only an accordion, on a four-track cassette Portastudio. This version of [...] "Yoda" [...] was a hit on the [...] "Dr. Demento Show", and even managed to hit, and hold onto, number one on the Funny Five countdown for several weeks. This early demo was later released on the sixth volume of Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes.|$|E

500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, in {{a chapter}} about his second spell in America, Buñuel states that [...] "n several occasions, both American and European {{producers}} have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> tackle a {{film version of}} Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano". He says that he read the book many times as well as eight different screenplays {{but was unable to}} come up with a solution for the cinema. The movie was eventually made in 1984 by John Huston.|$|E

At 16 years age Junaid Khan was measured as the fastest bowler in the NWFP Twenty/20 competition. Junaid Khan said, [...] "Some of my team mates <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should go for the Under 17 trials Abbottabad. I was in two minds but afterwards I was relieved that I attended the trials, as Ehteshamuddin spotted {{me and told me}} that I had potential and that I should go to Lahore".|$|E

I {{decided to make}} a film I would love to have seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where you walk down the corridor and things jump out at you." [...] The film has often been cited as an allegory on the virtue of sexual purity and the danger of casual sex, although Carpenter has explained that this was not his intent: [...] "It has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fred A. Cornell, a {{freshman}} football player {{and member of}} the Glee Club who was well known for his intellect, was called upon to write an Alma Mater for that December 11 concert. Although the story is often romanticized to include Cornell penning the lyrics {{on the back of a}} napkin during a train ride home after a particularly nasty defeat by the Michigan football team, in reality the creation of the composition was much more deliberate. Cornell recounts in a 1915 interview with the Ohio State Monthly: [...] "The Glee Club of 1903-1904 wanted an Alma Mater, as the most generally-sung college hymn is generally designated. [...] Howard Rector <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> try my hand." [...] In particular, the music, which was adapted from the well-known [...] "Spanish Hymn," [...] was carefully chosen: ...|$|E
2500|$|Richey {{recalled}} {{that he met}} in Columbia with former Governor John McKeithen, who had been instrumental in Winters's election as national committeewoman. Richey found that the two were [...] "apparently ... on the outs ... {{at the time of}} our election. At one meeting ... he <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> make a big push with black voters by informing them that 'Mary Lou Winters was a member of not one, but two Lily-white country clubs.' That exact line appeared in campaign letters from me to black voters in the waning days of the election." [...] Richey ran first in the primary and defeated Mrs. Winters in the second balloting, 58-42 percent. Prior to the Senate election, Winters, a graduate of Louisiana State University, had been the chief lobbyist for the Louisiana State Medical Society, in which capacity she worked pro bono in 1975 to obtain passage of legislation to protect the medical profession against questionable lawsuits. Winters served for thirty-two years on the Democratic National Committee and attended all of the presidential nominating conventions during her tenure. In 1996, Winters was an elector for President Bill Clinton, who carried Louisiana in both of his elections. She was later the vice chairman of her state party.|$|E

2500|$|Obama and Clinton {{were in a}} {{statistical}} dead heat in Texas, according to a poll released February 25, 2008. During Obama's sweep of February's post-Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, the March 4 primaries of Texas and Ohio were seen as a firewall for the Clinton campaign. In early polls for these states, Clinton held double digit leads in polls for those states, {{but by the end}} of February Obama had started to erode Clinton's lead in her key demographics, and her lead had been reduced to single digits in some polls. In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> use it, I think is silly." [...] Clinton received a round of boos from the crowd when she responded, [...] "Lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in; it's change you can Xerox." ...|$|E
2500|$|I later learned, {{a copy of}} my {{personal}} credit report– with detailed information about my bank accounts, home mortgage, credit-card payments, home address and Social Security number– had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called Trans Union. The sham company that received it, [...] "Educational Funding Services" [...] of Los Angeles, gave as its address a mail drop {{a few blocks from}} Scientology's headquarters. The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson, who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals. Wolfson says he was told that Scientology's attorneys [...] "had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them." [...] He says now, [...] "These are vicious people. These are vipers." [...] Ingram, through a lawyer, denies any involvement in the scam. … [...] After that, however, an attorney subpoenaed me, while another falsely <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists (he also threatened to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). [...] A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me– an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained {{my personal}} phone records. [...] Two detectives contacted me, posing as a friend and a relative of a so-called cult victim, to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology. Some of my conversations with them were taped, transcribed and presented by the church in affidavits to TIME's lawyers as [...] "proof" [...] of my bias against Scientology.|$|E
