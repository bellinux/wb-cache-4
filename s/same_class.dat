5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons is automatically refilled when not in use, and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the <b>same</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|The core of {{the complex}} has a ring {{structure}} consisting of six proteins that all belong to the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> of RNases, the RNase PH-like proteins. In archaea {{there are two different}} PH-like proteins (called Rrp41 and Rrp42), each present three times in an alternating order. Eukaryotic exosome complexes have six different proteins that form the ring structure. Of these six eukaryotic proteins, three resemble the archaeal Rrp41 protein and the other three proteins are more similar to the archaeal Rrp42 protein.|$|E
5|$|Aspinall {{was born}} in Prestatyn, North Wales, after {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the family home in Liverpool because of the air-raids on Liverpool during the Second World War, while Aspinall's father was away at sea with the Royal Navy. Aspinall and his mother returned to Liverpool later in 1942 after the bombing had subsided. Aspinall later attended West Derby School, where he passed his 11-Plus exams. When he was twelve years old, Aspinall gained a place at the Liverpool Institute in Mount Street, and was in the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as Paul McCartney for English and Art lessons.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Pratt & Whitney {{dominated}} the commercial market. GE needed an engine {{in this market}} class, and SNECMA had previous experience of working with them, collaborating on {{the production of the}} CF6-50 turbofan for the Airbus A300. Pratt & Whitney was considering upgrading their JT8D to compete in the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as the CFM56 as a sole venture, while Rolls-Royce dealt with financial issues that precluded them from starting new projects; this situation caused GE to gain the title of best partner for the program.|$|E
5|$|In Victoria {{groups of}} {{locomotives}} {{of the same}} design are classed together by letter, in a system introduced in 1886. Initially low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, in a continuous number block which is unique to the class. In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, {{and in some cases}} there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> letter. In addition, some classes start the number series with a 0, while others start with a 1.|$|E
5|$|Like the Storm II, the Mark III was {{initially}} {{available only to}} the military with versions set to be delivered to the Israel Police in 2009. A civilian version would only be released if the local tax code was modified {{to allow it to}} compete with foreign imports of the <b>same</b> <b>class.</b> AIL states that if such a thing would happen, a petrol engine version could be offered. Regarding Export markets, the Storm 3 has already seen use in several countries, especially in its armored version.|$|E

5|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} given the name Great Western. The first was an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's Swindon locomotive works. This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive in the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> was given the same name; this was withdrawn four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure they sat in the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E
5|$|The younger McKnight {{attended}} {{schools in}} New Jersey {{and graduated from}} the College of New Jersey in 1771, in the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as James Madison, Gunning Bedford, Jr., Henry Brackenridge, and Philip Freneau. He {{was one of the}} founders of the American Whig Society, along with Brackenridge, Madison, Samuel Stanhope Smith, Bedford, Freneau, John Beatty, John Henry of Maryland, and William Bradford. McKnight studied medicine and surgery privately with eminent Philadelphia surgeon William Shippen, but left before he completed his studies and entered the Continental Army in 1775.|$|E

5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept it in the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E
5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the <b>same</b> <b>class</b> are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Potsdam {{were to be}} renamed Jade and Elbe, respectively. Once converted, {{the ships}} were {{intended}} to operate twelve Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers and twelve Bf-109 fighters. Work on Jade was not started and the conversion project was abandoned in November 1942. She returned to service as a troopship, only to be sunk by a mine in the western Baltic. Elbe actually began the conversion process in December 1942, but only her passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted in February 1943. She was converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen and seized by the United Kingdom {{after the end of}} the war. She remained in use until 1976, when she was broken up for scrap. A third ocean liner of the <b>same</b> <b>class,</b> , was purchased by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted into the escort carrier Shin'yō. Shin'yō was torpedoed and sunk in the East China Sea by a United States Navy submarine.|$|E
