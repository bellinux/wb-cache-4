5000|$|Another {{thing we}} did was to devise a {{manoeuvre}} which was aimed at getting us out of a difficult corner if we ever got into one. This may sound very extraordinary, probably, to practising pilots today, but it consisted of putting everything into the left hand front corner of the cockpit. If you saw a 109 on your tail, and it hadn't shot you down at that point, you put on full throttle, fine pitch, full left rudder, <b>full</b> left <b>stick</b> and <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>stick.</b> This resulted in a horrible manoeuvre which was, in fact, a negative g spiral dive. But you {{would come out of}} the bottom with no 109 on your tail and your aeroplane intact. Roland Beaumontdescribing how a Hurricane can get away from an Me109.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of a 0. 034 -scale model of the production version of the Chance Vought F 7 U- 3 airplane has been conducted in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel. The inverted and erect spin and recovery characteristics of the model were determined for the combat loading with the model in the clean condition {{and the effect of}} extending slats was investigated. A brief {{investigation of}} pilot ejection was also performed. The results indicate that the inverted spin-recovery characteristics of the airplane will be satisfactory by full rudder reversal. If the rudders can only be neutralized because of high pedal forces in the inverted spins, satisfactory recovery will be obtained if the auxiliary rudders can be moved to neutral or against the spin provided the <b>stick</b> is held <b>full</b> <b>forward.</b> Optimum control technique for satisfactory recovery from erect spins will be full rudder reversal in conjunction with aileron movement to full with the spin (stick right in a right spin). Extension of the slats will have a slightly adverse effect on recoveries from (1 inverted spins but will have a favorable effect on recoveries from erect spins. The results of brief tests indicate that if a pilot is ejected during a spin while a spin-recovery parachute is extended and fully inflated, he will probably clear the tail parachute...|$|R

50|$|Allan Jeans used Jason Dunstall as a lead up <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> and {{established}} {{a new breed of}} lead up <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> who would lead up the ground in a straight line, providing midfielders with a large, fast and strong running target to kick.

This means that the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> needs to be fast, but only in short bursts. In modern times, some teams have experimented by playing a smaller and faster player (possibly a former forward pocket or flanker) at <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> in order to beat the defender with speed rather than strength.
