5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E

25|$|Animals {{have been}} known to {{perceive}} the infrasonic waves going through the earth by natural disasters and can use these as an early warning.

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|The three brigades {{gathered}} by Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth from the Austrian Hereditary Provinces neared the Vág and Garam rivers, receiving a brigade from {{the division of}} Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich and the Jablonowski division defeated at Vác some days earlier. Welden was <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> Austrian army corps, now containing around 20 000 men, would stop the Hungarian advancement. But the contradictory orders given by Welden and Jelačić, prevented that this corps to arrive on time {{in the vicinity of}} the Garam river. Welden on 17 April gave him order to march towards Vác, and enter in contact with Wohlgemuth, but the Croatian ban was not very willingly to obey, agreeing to move only on 20 April (a day after the battle of Nagysalló actually took place).|$|E
25|$|Vainio's track {{season was}} really strong. In June 1984, he competed {{five times in}} 5000 metres, the weakest result being 13:30.40, and once in 10,000 metres with his all-time second best result 27:41.75. At the Bislett Games on 28 June, he broke Lasse Virén's Finnish record in 5000 metres and {{finished}} second after Fernando Mamede with the result 13:16.02. In July, he competed only three times; first two times in the Finnish Championships on July 6–8 in Kajaani, where he took the gold medals after solo runs in both 5000 metres (13:24.99) and 10,000 metres (28:06.85), and the third time when improving his 3000 metres record to 7:44.42 in Varkaus on 12 July. According to a Vainio interview in 2004, he took his next injection after the Rotterdam Marathon around 10 July, and was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> time period would be long enough to allow metabolism to take its effect and ensure a negative test at the Olympics.|$|E

25|$|Local gossips noticed Wright's flirtations, and he {{developed}} a reputation in Oak Park as a man-about-town. His family had grown to six children, but Wright was not parental and he relied on his wife Catherine to care for them. In 1903, Wright designed a house for Edwin Cheney, a neighbor in Oak Park, and immediately took a liking to Cheney's wife, Mamah. Mamah Cheney was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. The two fell in love, and they became {{the talk of the}} town, as they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. Wright's wife, Kitty, <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce. Mamah had to live in Europe for two years in order to obtain a divorce from Edwin on the grounds of desertion.|$|E

I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> unique endgame position was discovered {{with the help}} of Thompson’s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? [...] Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions – there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.|$|E

A two-hour long procession of tanks, armored cars, field guns, and lorries full of troops went through the city and surrounded it. At 9:00pm a wave of detentions began. The detainees were taken to Ławica airport, where they were subjected to brutal interrogation; 746persons were detained until August8. The protests continued until June30, when the troops finally pacified the city, after exchanging fire with some violent demonstrators.

500|$|The {{architectural}} historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner {{compared the}} college unfavourably to {{the designs of}} the Danish architect Arne Jacobsen [...] for St Catherine's College, Oxford, construction of which began in 1960 (the year that Nuffield College was completed): St Catherine's, in his view, was [...] "the most perfect piece of architecture of 20th-century Oxford" [...] and made Nuffield [...] "look even more absurd". Nevertheless, he [...] "proposed forgiveness" [...] for the [...] "mighty tower", which [...] "positively helps the famous skyline of Oxford", adding that it has [...] "enough identity {{to be sure that}} one day it will find affection". He said that the tower had something of the architect Edwin Lutyens' [...] "felicitous manipulation of period details into a non-period whole and will, I prophesy, one day be loved", although he was less <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> fate awaited the rest of the buildings. Simon Jenkins said of Pevsner's prophecy about the tower, [...] "I doubt it"; he described it as [...] "at best ungainly", with a [...] "weak spire", and said that [...] "vegetation was its best hope, as for the rest of Nuffield". The college, in his view [...] "required a sense of humour".|$|E
500|$|Gabrielle Christian first {{auditioned for}} the role of Spencer (then called [...] "Zooey") in July 2004, though Lynch also had her read for Ashley's part. Mandy Musgrave also auditioned {{for the role}} of Spencer, but Lynch liked her {{chemistry}} with Christian, so he paired the two up with Musgrave as Ashley. The pilot was first shot in October 2004 and directed by Rose Troche, but after the series was picked up by The N in January 2005, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters. He said that [...] "I didn't pick [...] up right away, I had her keep re-auditioning. ... I [...] to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> combination [...] perfect." [...] Her contract was finally picked up in May 2005 and the pilot was re-filmed with the new cast in July. Filming took place in Los Angeles, with a correctional facility used largely as the high school set. Donna Deitch, who directed the second version of the pilot but no subsequent South of Nowhere episodes said that the pilot is [...] "something I'm really, really proud of, because I think that show has a look, a style to it that really helps". She felt that the style she set suited the material and was [...] "fairly inventive" [...] for a low-budget series.|$|E

500|$|Soon, Shakira {{began work}} on her next studio album, titled She Wolf, which was, among other places, {{recorded}} at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan. Unlike most of her previous projects, which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles, She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences. When asked why the album had electronic influences, Shakira responded, [...] "I felt very curious and intrigued about the electro-pop world and everything it has to offer. I wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> album was very bassy and that the kicks hit really hard, and I wanted {{to concentrate on the}} beat. But my music, to a certain extent, is very complex– because I always try to experiment with sounds {{from other parts of the}} world." [...] Explaining the meaning behind the title, Shakira said that [...] "'She Wolf' is the woman of our time. The woman who knows what she wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions. She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws like a wild animal".|$|E
