An outer edge periphery of the plate is increased by 25 percentages when compared to an edge periphery of the body, where the plate is made of silicon carbide ceramics and/or silicon nitride ceramics.

40|$|Shadow {{shielding}} is a {{novel and}} practical concept for waste heat rejection from lunar surface spacecraft systems. A shadow shield is a light shield that shades the radiator from parasitic thermal radiation emanating from the sun or lunar <b>surface.</b> <b>Radiator</b> size and mass can reduce if the radiator {{is not required to}} account for parasitic heat loads in addition to system energy rejection requirements. The lunar thermal environment can be very harsh towards radiative heat rejection. Parasitic heat loads force the radiator to expand in size and mass to compensate. On the Moon, there are three types: surface infrared, solar insulation, and albedo. This thesis tests shadow shielding geometry and its effect on the radiator and nuclear reactor in a reactor-powered Carnot heat engine. Due to the nature of cooling by radiative heat transfer, the maximum shaft work a Carnot system can produce and the minimal required radiator area occurs when the Carnot efficiency is 25 %. First, a case for shadow shielding is made using an isothermal, control radiator model in Thermal Desktop. Six radiator temperatures and three latitudes are considered in the tests. Test variables in this section include radiator shapes and shade geometry. The simulations found that shadow shielding is best suited for a low-temperature radiator at the lunar equator. Optimized parabolic shade geometry includes a focus right above or {{at the top of the}} radiator and full to three-quarters shade height. The most useful rectangular radiator shape for shadow shielding is that which has a low height and long width. All simulations were conducted using a shade with a 10 kg/m 2 area mass. A sensitivity study was conducted for different shade area masses using high and low values found in the literature. The shade is the most useful when the shade's area mass is less than or equal to that of the radiator. If the shade mass is below this threshold, the shade would be applicable to all radiator temperatures tested. Optimized shade and radiator geometry results were then factored into a second model where the radiator is comprised of heat pipes which is similar to radiators from actual system designs. Further simulations were conducted implementing the SAFE- 4001 fast fission nuclear reactor design. The study found that shadow shielding allowed the system to use a low-temperature radiator where other configurations were not viable because shadow shielding drastically improves radiative heat transfer from the radiator, but at the consequence of raising radiator mass...|$|E

40|$|A heat {{rejection}} system for space is described which uses a recirculating free stream of liquid droplets {{in place of a}} solid surface to radiate waste heat. By using sufficiently small droplets (100 micron diameter) of low vapor pressure liquids the radiating droplet sheet can be made many times lighter than the lightest solid <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> (heat pipes). The liquid droplet radiator (LDR) is less vulnerable to damage by micrometeoroids than solid <b>surface</b> <b>radiators,</b> and may be transported into space far more efficiently. Analyses are presented of LDR applications in thermal and photovoltaic energy conversion which indicate that fluid handling components (droplet generator, droplet collector, heat exchanger, and pump) may comprise most of the radiator system mass. Even the unoptimized models employed yield LDR system masses less than heat pipe radiator system masses, and significant improvement is expected using design approaches that incorporate fluid handling components more efficiently.

2500|$|As first built, the NiD 42 was {{a highly}} {{streamlined}} parasol-wing monoplane with a monocoque fuselage [...] and an open cockpit of which a single prototype was built.

50|$|The M.39 was {{designed}} by Mario Castoldi (1888-1968) to represent Italy in the 1926 Schneider Trophy race, {{and it was the}} first low-wing monoplane that he designed for Macchi. It was a single-seat, twin-float racing seaplane, of mixed (metal and wooden) construction. The wooden wings were wire-braced, with two-thirds of the upper surfaces used as low drag <b>surface</b> <b>radiators.</b> The pilot sat in an open cockpit parallel with the trailing edge of the wing; the cockpits windscreen was profiled into the fuselage decking to reduce aerodynamic drag.

50|$|The Macchi M.33 was a single-seat, wooden, shoulder-wing {{monoplane}} {{flying boat}} of very clean aerodynamic design for its time. Its cantilever wing was fairly thick and carried stabilizing floats on each side. Italy lacked competitive racing engines in 1925, so the M.33 was powered with a used 1923 Curtiss D-12 engine rated at 378 kilowatts (507 horsepower) in a steamlined nacelle mounted on struts above the fuselage and driving a two-bladed tractor propeller. The M.33 had a flat-plate radiator, a type that was obsolescent by 1925, rather than modern <b>surface</b> <b>radiators.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the Supermarine S.5 in the 1927 Schneider Trophy R.J. Mitchell {{designed}} a successor, the Supermarine S.6 to Specification 8/28. Refining the design of the earlier S.5, Mitchell now used all-metal construction. Although its lineage was evident, the new design had to accommodate a new powerplant. The [...] Napier Lion VIIB engine was judged to be incapable of further development, and the S.6 was to use the new 1,900 hp (1,417 kW) Rolls-Royce R engine.

The S.5 had a low, braced wing with spruce spars and spuce-ply ribs and a plywood skin. The wing <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> made up of corrugated copper sheets replaced the Lamblin type radiators of the S.4.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims to gain {{understanding of}} the key design aspects in using renewable sources (e. g., geothermal and solar) for residential heating. To achieve this aim, a simulation study has been undertaken by using the EnergyPlus™ software Version 8. 1. First {{a brief review of}} the literature was carried out, which covers solar ground-source heat pump, solar-heated water, low-temperature wall and floor <b>surface</b> <b>radiators,</b> types of solar collector, fixed tilt versus solar tracker, and cost versus savings. Then the conceptual design idea and energy simulation process are described. Following this a simulation study of a 30 m 2 one-bedroom simple house, as a case example was carried out. The results show that, with two <b>surface</b> <b>radiators,</b> a 30 m 2 house would remain within the acceptable thermal comfort temperature range in winter. The simulation results also show that the floor radiator, fed with water from U-tube in deep ground warms the concrete-in-ground floor, which would otherwise be cold {{for more than half a}} year. The simulation results also show that the wall radiators, fed with water (stored in a 2 m 3 indoor tank) heated by evacuated tubes make the indoors comfortable throughout the year. Furthermore, the results of additional 3 -dimensional simulation show that, the creation of a thermal mass under the floor, using vertical insulation into the ground along its perimeter, may obviate the need of the floor radiator and borehole. In conclusion, the results of the simulation study show that it is feasible to utilise a combination of the renewable geothermal and solar energy to achieve indoor thermal comfort in houses. Future research is needed which includes validation of these simulations results with actual data collected from the case example and simulation study of more complex and larger scales residential houses...|$|R
