There were two or three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands, and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children, who did the fairy business when required. The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the families {{on the top of a}} great pole; the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins, ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing. All the mothers could (and did) dance, upon the <b>slack</b> <b>wire</b> and the tight-rope, and perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds; none of them were at all particular in respect of showing their legs; and one of them, alone in a Greek chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came to. They all assumed to be mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their private dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic arrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company would have produced but a poor letter on any subject. Yet there was a remarkable gentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for any kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity one another, deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much generous construction, as the every- day virtues of any class of people in the world.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{flexural}} damping of {{wire cable}} {{due to the}} flexural hysteresis influences the dynamic behavior of <b>slacking</b> <b>wire</b> cables significantly. However, {{the details of the}} local model, accounting for the flexural hysteresis between the wire strands, are quite challenging to include in large-scale engineering applications. This paper addresses these difficulties by modeling the flexural damping of <b>slacking</b> <b>wire</b> cables using homogenized Rayleigh damping. By using the nonlinear finite element method and high-speed imaging technique, three aspects of the work were examined. First, the mechanical properties of the slacking cable were identified experimentally. Second, a sample cable was fixed at one end and allowed to vibrate freely at the other end. The shapes of the vibrating cable were captured by a high-speed digital camera and processed by photogrammetry. The cable demonstrated a high flexural damping at zero tension and its damping was measured to be as high as 37. 7 % of the critical damping. Third, the cable was modeled and analyzed using our newly developed nonlinear curved beam element with the Rayleigh damping. The finite element predictions of the cable motion agree well with the experimental measurement. These predictions demonstrate that the new element is capable of describing the dynamic response of the cable and that the Rayleigh damping is sufficient to model the flexural damping of <b>slacking</b> <b>wire</b> cables...|$|R

The wing is of wood and as {{may be seen in}} the photographs presented, <b>slack</b> <b>wires</b> are used to limit the amplitude of unstable motions. The fuselage is mounted on bearings permitting freedom of roll, but provision is made to clamp the fuselage for some of the tests. It is found that freedom in roll increases the dynamic pressure at which aeroelastic instability first appears. With the model free in roll, the effectiveness of the ailerons in maintaining trim is not noticeably affected by passage through the speed at which the wing would become unstable if clamped...|$|R

40|$|Agnes Lake Hickok rode horses, {{walked on}} <b>slack</b> <b>wires,</b> and trained various animals. If {{that was not}} enough, {{she was also a}} smart, diligent {{entrepreneur}} who became the first woman to own and operate a circus in the United States. The circus business brought her a busy schedule, some profitable opportunities, and wide acclaim as an entertainer who traveled with legendary performers P. T. Barnum and Buffalo Bill Cody. Although Agnes Lake Hickok did not necessarily invent circus shows, she certainly helped to popularize this form of entertainment in the nineteenth century and prepared the next generation of performers, including her daughter, Emma Lake, whose equestrian renown rivaled that of Annie Oakley. Agnes Lake Hickok is primarily a compensatory biography meant to salvage the story of a German immigrant child who built a career managing and appearing in traveling shows. Agnes and her first husband, Bill Lake, performed steadily through the 1840 s, 1850 s, and 1860 s, maintaining financial security and drawing large crowds even during the Civil War. Her second marriage, in 1876, to the celebrated Wild Bill Hickok catapulted her already well-known reputation into the realm of national attention. They were only married five months, however, before he was killed (although they had courted for nearly five years once they met in Abilene, Kansas, in 1871), so the authors point to Agnes Lake Hickok 2 ̆ 7 s own stamina and creativity during her remaining thirty years as justification for finally noting her place in history...|$|R

They gave trouble initially with poor contact and so the <b>slack</b> <b>wire</b> system was developed. A tensioned wire usually gave a good contact but broke contact when the collector passed the pole. Slackening the wire and deliberately lifting it up clear of the collector at the poles allowed its weight to give a reliable contact over the other collector, spaced {{to be at the}} midpoint between poles. A revised collector was in use within the first few years, by 1900. A small hinged bow frame was placed on top of the fixed uprights, giving a sprung contact. Bow collectors did not last though and were replaced with trolley poles.|$|E
40|$|Timing-driven {{placement}} is {{a critical}} step in nanometerscale physical synthesis. To improve design timing on a global scale, net-weight based global timing-driven placement is a commonly used technique. This paper shows that such an approach can improve timing, but often degrades wire length and routability. Another problem with existing timing-driven placers is inconsistencies {{in the definition of}} timing closure. Approaches using linear programming are forced to make assumptions about the timing models that simplify the problem. To truly do timing-driven placement, the placer must be able to make queries to a real timing analyzer with incremental capabilities. This paper describes an incremental timing-driven placer called ITOP. Using accurate timing from an industrial static timer, ITOP integrates incremental timing closure optimizations like buffering and repowering within placement to improve design timing without degrading wire length and routability. Experimental results on a set of optimized industrial circuit netlists show that ITOP significantly outperforms conventional net-weight based timing-driven placement. In particular, on average, it obtains an improvement of over 47. 45 %, 9. 88 % and 5 % in the worst slack, total negative <b>slack</b> and <b>wire</b> length as compared to the conventional flow...|$|R
40|$|As {{a service}} company {{performing}} subsea operations, DeepOcean wishes {{to operate in}} the widest range of sea conditions. The majority of all offshore operations are performed using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), where lifting through the splash zone is considered the most critical phase during launching and recovery of the ROV system. Available standards from DNV propose a systematic and analytical approach for estimating the hydrodynamic loads occurring in the splash zone. A maximum operational significant wave height, Hs, is determined using a proposed acceptance criteria. Experience from the industry have shown that the method is unreasonable conservative, consequently leading to a restrictive operational Hs window. The main objective of this master thesis is to compare results obtained from the analytical calculations with results obtained from the time domain simulation programs; Simulation of Marine Operations (SIMO) and OrcaFlex. The operational limit established in the time domain programs {{is based on the assumption}} that the maximum relative velocity between the crane tip and the waves represent a worst case scenario and that a <b>slack</b> lifting <b>wire</b> is not acceptable. This is due to the uncertainties associated with snap loading after a <b>slack</b> lifting <b>wire.</b> Three different ROV models have been established, two in OrcaFlex and one in SIMO. A sensitivity study regarding the hydrodynamic coefficients for the ROV models is also performed. The three different ROV models show different dependency of the added mass and drag term. The overall trend for the ROV systems is that the added mass dependency is reduced for the structures modelled with multiple elements, while the drag dependency is increased. The Simplified Method is certainly conservative compared to time domain simulations performed in SIMO and OrcaFlex. The present operational sea state of Hs = 4. 5 m is rejected by the Simplified Method. If the operation is to be performed independent of a Tz value, an operational Hs of 0. 75 m is acceptable according to the analytical calculations. From the time domain analyses in SIMO and OrcaFlex, the current operational sea state of Hs = 4. 5 m could be justified if a limiting Tz is given. For launching this limiting value is 9 s, while for recovery of the ROV system the limiting Tz value is 8 s. The operational limit should not only be set by a Hs value, but also a Tz due to the large dependency of the wave period for lifting though the splash zone. Simulating the ROV lift operation in a time domain simulation program has proven to be a good alternative compared to the Simplified Method. </p...|$|R

40|$|Crosstalk noise {{has become}} an {{important}} issue as technology scales down for timing and signal integrity closure. Existing works to fix crosstalk noise are mostly done at the routing or post routing stage, which may be too late. Since placement determines the overall routing congestion, which correlates with the coupling capacitance, which in turn correlates with the crosstalk noise, placement shall be a good level to do early noise mitigation. The only existing work for the crosstalk aware placement (to our best knowledge) is [1], which uses the coupling capacitance map to guide placement. However, crosstalk is determined {{not only by the}} coupling capacitance, but also by many other factors, such as the driver resistance of the victim net and the coupling location (near source vs near sink coupling) [2]. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of noise map which takes those factors into account. Guided by this accurate noise map explicitly, we propose an incremental placement technique to mitigate noise without disturbing the global placement order. Our incremental placement has two key steps, namely noise aware cell inflation and local refinement. Experimental results on industrial circuits show that our approach is able {{to reduce the number of}} top noise nets by 25 % and improve the timing (300 ps on the worst <b>slack),</b> with no <b>wire</b> length penalty or CPU overhead.

40|$|As the {{offshore}} industry operates on deeper seas, subsea technology {{becomes more and}} more important. As a consequence of this, marine lifting operations of subsea equipment has become very common. Prior to such an operation it is necessary to define the limiting sea states. Many methods for doing this are very conservative and will underestimate the operational conditions. Defining the limiting sea states can be done by numerical simulations using commercial software. However this may be very time consuming. The focus on this report is put on modeling lifting of objects through the splash zone using the computer program USFOS. Dynamic analyses of the lowering were performed. Even though this program is not initially intended for such use, it has features that makes such analyses possible. In this report the applicability of USFOS for such use will be studied. Three main models have been considered. The first of them was a very simple model of a horizontal pipe that was lowered into the sea. The wire forces was considered, and it was studied how different input parameters affected the results. The input parameters for this simple model was taken further by simulating the lowering of a subsea spool through the splash zone. This model consisted of a subsea spool, a spreader bar, 4 slings and a lifting wire. Both flat sea and regular waves were simulated. For the regular wave cases, the forces in the wires and slings was studied. This showed that slack in the lifting wire or slings would occur in 3 out of 4 sea states. Further the elastic utilization of the structure was evaluated according to API-RP- 2 A-WSD, which is implemented in USFOS. In this study {{it was found that the}} utilization of the structure increases as the wave height in- creases. However it is questioned how accurately USFOS calculates the forces in the splash zone for the most extreme cases of regular waves. The last and most realistic model that was considered in this thesis, was lowering of the subsea spool into irregular waves. These waves were simulated according to the JONSWAP wave spectrum. Different sea states were modeled by changing the value of significant wave height and peak period. In addition the top end of the lifting wire was connected to the moving crane tip of a vessel. The vessel motions were defined by RAO functions that were included in the input files. For all of the sea states that were modeled, the minimum wire forces were found. This resulted in an overview of which sea states that would give <b>slack</b> in lifting <b>wire</b> or slings. The trend showed that as the significant wave height was increased, the minimum forces in the wires and slings decreased. From the work that was carried out it was concluded that USFOS can be used for modeling simple marine lifting operations. The program calculates the equilibrium forces in the top end of the wire element in the right way. But its use for this purpose is limited. If damping is introduced to the system, the force in the wire element will decrease due to this, and thus give an error in the equilibrium value. Further the special beam formulation used to model the elongating wire element, requires that a dynamic analysis is performed. Thus there will be oscillations in the system due to initiation of gravity and self weight. Therefore this initial phase should be neglected when considering the structural response. One of the advantages of the program for this type of use is its ability to evaluate non-linear structural behavior, and calculate elastic utilization of the structure. There are, however, uncertainties in the elastic utilization calculations when it comes to definitions of parameters such as buckling length. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the dynamic air cushion {{pressure}} inside suction anchors during low- ering through the splash zone has been studied. A non-linear continuity equation {{for the air}} mass is used to establish a theoretical model for the dynamic air cush- ion pressure. Buoyancy forces due to dynamic air cushion pressure inside the suction anchors are calculated until the wave elevation inside the suction anchor reach the top. At impact Wagner s wedge method together with Von Karman s wetted length {{is used to calculate}} the impact force on the cone-shaped suction anchor top. Important parameters aﬀecting the dynamic air cushion pressure and thus the buoyancy forces have been investigated. Force measured in lifting wire during splash zone transition of a single suction anchor is used as basis for comparison. The parameters that are investigated are introduction of a time-varying lowering velocity, changing characteristics of the ventilation hatch outlet and introducing regular and irregular waves. By varying these parameters a best-ﬁt comparison with 2. 5 [%] deviation between calculations and measurements have been ob- tained. Further, a comparison between theoretical calculations and force measurements from a lifting operation of a subsea structure with suction anchors as foundation has been performed. The buoyancy forces calculated prior to impact are due to the dynamic air cushion pressure alone. The total force in the lifting wire for this phase are corresponding well to the magnitude of the measured force. During this comparison the eﬀect of changing perforation ratio clearly show an increase of buoyancy forces for decreasing size of ventilation hatch. Including both inﬂow and outﬂow of air from the suction anchors when oscillating in large waves have also been studied. When comparing with force measurements the im- portance of including both inﬂow and outﬂow of air to account for both suction and compressive pressure has been shown. This lead to negative and positive buoyancy forces respectively. Long crested waves accounting for wind and swell sea are calculated with the JONSWAP- and Torsethaugen-spectra. By using empirical formulas for the lim- iting case between wind and swell sea it is shown that wind sea is the dominating part for the sea state measured during splash zone transition of the suction an- chors. Using Wagner s wedge model together with Von Karman s wetted length for cal- culating impact force on a ﬂat suction anchor top is also performed. Impact forces with impact angles in the range of 5 - 15 degrees between the wedge-shaped water and top overestimate the force compared with measurements. A best-ﬁt for the impact forces with the measurements has been obtained with deadrise angle of 17. 5 [deg] in addition to impact forces calculated with a time-varying slamming coeﬃcient. Possible resonant phenomena connected with oscillations of suction anchor and pressure measurements at impact have been studied. Simpliﬁed models for cal- culating A) natural period of oscillating air cushion, B) piston mode of water column and C) coupled piston mode of air cushion and water column has been developed. These have been compared with oscillation-period of pressure mea- surements observed after impact of a single suction anchor. These calculations have also been compared with oscillations of the suction anchor observed from videos of experiment. Case B) proved to give the most similar results with the suction anchor oscillations while case A) and C) were not in the proximity of the observed oscillations. This showed that the air cushion were not causing any resonant motion. Using a common safety criterion for avoiding <b>slack</b> in lifting <b>wire,</b> the calculation model have been used to give a recommendation for perforation ratios for the suction anchors used on the installation of the subsea structure studied here. Perforation ratios in the range 1 - 3 [%] used on suction anchor with diameters in the range 3 - 6 [m] proved to be well within the slack-wire limit.

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{industry is}} constantly seeking {{to operate in}} more extreme conditions. DeepOcean is a subsea service company, where offshore lifts {{is a part of}} every day operations. To remain competitive, it is important to reduce operational downtime, where time spent waiting on weather {{is one of the main}} contributors. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate how shielding effects influence the operational limit for offshore lifting operations at different heading angles. Common practice in the offshore industry is to use long-crested waves when determining the operational limit, and shielding effects are often neglected, which is a conservative approach. A case study of two different structures, a Manifold and a ROV system, has been conducted. Repeated launch and recovery analyzes has been performed in Orcaflex, a time domain finite element program developed for static and dynamic analysis of offshore systems. Irregular waves are applied using a JONSWAP spectrum with $T_{p}= 5 - 19 s $ and $H_{s}= 1 - 4 m$ for the Manifold and $H_{s}= 2 - 8 m$ for the ROV system. Both long- and short-crested waves, as well as 4 heading angles have been investigated. Shielding effects has been accounted for by the use of Sea State RAOs calculated in WADAM, a hydrodynamic analysis program for calculation of wave-structure interaction. The maximum tension in the lifting wire is considered as the dimensioning parameter. Gumbel extreme value statistics has been used to evaluate the distribution of maximum lifting wire tension, based on 20 simulations per sea state. The calculated maximum wire tension was found to be highly dependent on whether or not slack would occur during a simulation. A <b>slack</b> <b>wire</b> result in snap loads with unpredictable magnitude. Incorporation of shielding in the simulations resulted in a significant drop in the occurrence of slack, for both structures. Thus, shielding effects is found to reduce the uncertainty related to the maximum tension due to a reduction in snap loads. The operational limit for the Manifold was increased with 0. 5 - 1. 0 m on average when shielding was included for most periods and heading angles, for both long-and short crested waves. The results obtained for the ROV was found to be highly unpredictable in magnitude due to slack occurring in the dominating part of the simulations, especially for steep waves. In contrast shielding showed to have a consistent positive effect, for heading angles with low vessel motion in roll...|$|E
40|$|Wave energy {{converters}} {{of point}} absorber type {{have been developed}} and constructed. Full scale experiments {{have been carried out}} at sea and electricity has been successfully delivered. Linear permanent magnet generators together with a subsea substation and buoys of various geometric shapes have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The design has in large extent an electronic approach, keeping the mechanical part of it as simple as possible, due to the long life span and reliability of electric components. Because of the nature of a linear generator, the internal translator with permanent magnets has a limited stroke length which will be reached when the buoy is exposed to large wave heights. Internal springs at {{the top and bottom of}} the generator prevent the translator from hitting the generator hull. Inertial forces due to the mass and velocity of the translator and the buoy and its heave added mass compresses the spring. The added mass is a rather large part of the total moving mass. Simulations of a converter with a vertical cylindrical buoy and with a toroidal buoy were conducted, as well as real sea experiments with converters with cylindrical buoys of two different sizes and a toroidal buoy. The overloads are likely to affect the design and service life of the generator, the buoy and the wire which interconnects them. Buoy shapes with as much excitation force as possible and as little heave added mass as possible were sought. A toroidal buoy caused less overloads on the generator at sea states with short wave periods and relatively large wave height, but for sea states with very long wave periods or extremely high waves, the magnitude of the overloads was mainly determined by the maximum displacement of the buoy. Snap loads on the interconnecting wire, as the <b>slack</b> <b>wire</b> tensed up after a very deep wave trough, were found to be greater but of the same order of magnitude as forces during the rest of the wave cycle. During a 4 day period at various wave conditions, two converters with cylindrical buoys proved efficiency between 11. 1 % and 24. 4 %. The larger buoy had 78 % larger water plane area than the other buoy which resulted in 11 % more power production. Short wave period was beneficial for the power production. Infinite frequency heave added mass was measured for a cylindrical buoy at real sea and found to be greater than the linearly calculated theoretical added mass...|$|E
40|$|Marine lifting {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in the installation of turbines and bottom-fixed foundations. Offshroe installations of the bottom-fixed foundations, tripod foundation in this study, are costly and risky due to the challenging environmental conditons and the bulkiness of the object. It becomes more and more challenging due to the tendency to intall larger turbines in the sites further away from shoreline. To minimize the risks and better prepare the operations, careful study and analysis are essential. This thesis addresses numerical studies of the installation of tripod foundations using a heavy lift vessel (HLV). Both frequency and time-domain methods are applied in the study. Investigation is first carried out in the frequency domain using the response aptitude operators (RAOs) of the HLV. The wave induced rigid body motions of the vessel are calculated, represented by response spectrum and spectral moment. Thus, the vertical motion of the crane tip can be predicted, which is used as a criterion to find the limiting weather. As the frequency domain method is based on the simplification of linear response, detailed numerical modelling and simulation of the installation system have been carried out in time domain to analyse the coupled dynamic system. The predicted limiting weather using frequency domain method is firstly verified in time domain by running stationary simulations. It is found that the predicted limiting sea states are inaccurate. The calculated limiting (significant wave height) is underestimated with (spectral peak period of the wave) approaching the natural periods of the installation vessel. During the lifting operations, some potential critical events may be encountered, such as <b>slack</b> <b>wire</b> or re-hit, collision with the lifting vessel due to excessive motions of the tripod. To identify the potential risks, nonstationary simulations are conducted with emphasis on two lifting scenarios, the lift-off and the lowering phases. Moreover, comparative studies in response using two types of installation vessel, the HLV and the Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process. Furthermore, sensitivity study on various hoisting speeds is also performed for the case onboard lift-off. It is found that the wire tension and response of the tripod using the jack-up are relatively smaller, during the lowering process in the selected sea states, than the case utilizing floating vessel. Especially for the lowering in air, huge difference exists between the two types of installation vessels and barely any tripod motion is induced for the jack-up case thanks to the great bottom-fixed stability. Compared to the onboard lift-off, it turns out that there would be much more challenges for the lift-off from barge. Under the considered wave condition, the onboard lift-off operation can be smoothly implemented while the operation from the barge experiences snap load and re-hit...|$|E
