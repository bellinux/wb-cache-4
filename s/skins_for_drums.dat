50|$|Among the {{documents}} discovered, {{written in a}} variety of scripts on paper, wooden tablets, and sticks, were Buddhist texts; a petition for the recovery of a donkey after the failure of its two purchasers to pay even ten months later; a petition for exemption from requisitions of grain and forced labour after visitation by bandits; a request for the military of <b>skins</b> <b>for</b> <b>drums</b> and quail feathers for arrows; records of loans; and an important early Judeo-Persian document edited and dated to 718 by David Samuel Margoliouth seemingly concerned predominantly with the sale of sheep, complaints of unfair treatment, and the teaching of a girl. Aurel Stein translated the document into English.|$|E
50|$|Among several peoples {{near the}} Altai Mountains, the new drum of a shaman {{must go through}} a special ritual. This is {{regarded}} as “making the drum alive”: the tree and the deer who gave their wood and <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> the new <b>drum</b> narrate their whole lives and promise to the shaman that they will serve him. The ritual itself is a libation: beer is poured onto the skin and wood of the drum, and these materials “come to life” and speak with {{the voice of the}} shaman {{in the name of the}} tree and the deer. Among the Tubalar, this means literally the imitation of the behavior and the voice of the animal by the shaman.|$|R
50|$|Shamanism among Siberian peoples {{exhibits}} {{the great}} diversity characteristic of shamanism in general. Among several peoples near the Altai Mountains, the new drum of a shaman {{must go through}} a special ritual. This is regarded as “enlivening the drum”: the tree and the deer who gave their wood and <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> the new <b>drum</b> narrate their whole lives and promise to the shaman that they will serve him. The ritual itself is a libation: beer is poured onto the skin and wood of the drum, and these materials “come to life” and speak with {{the voice of the}} shaman {{in the name of the}} tree and the deer. Among the Tubalar, moreover, the shaman imitates the voice of the animal, and its behaviour as well.|$|R
50|$|Today {{they are}} made of both wood and clay. Wooden water drums are made either by {{hollowing}} out a solid section of a small soft wood log, or assembled using cedar slats and banded like a wooden keg. Clay drums are either handmade or an old crock is used. Wyandot and Seneca/Cayuga traditionally used a groundhog <b>skin</b> (daˀyęh) <b>for</b> the <b>drum</b> covering,though a piece of deer skin works well. An Iroquoian or Wendat/Wyandot drum stick is carved from a piece of hardwood with a small rounded tip. Each drum style has a unique way of tightening the hide to maximize the sound. The drum head must be both tight and saturated with water for best results.|$|R
