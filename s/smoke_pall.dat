Given the amount of damage to Kenley, it also seemed unnecessary to the bomber crews. As they were deciding what action to take, they were attacked. The Bf 109s led by Hannes Trautloft had a difficult job of defending the Ju 88s. After passing Biggin Hill {{on their way to}} RAF West Malling British AAA fire began targeting the formation. One Ju 88 was hit, and Trautloft gave it special protection. As he manoeuvred himself into position, the formation was jumped by Spitfires and Hurricanes. One Ju 88 was lost to 32 Squadron's Pilot Officer Bolesław Własnowolski. As they attack began, the Ju 88s turned to West Malling, and began dive-bombing attacks as an alternate target.|$|E
60|$|When next I awoke, {{a sickly}} yellow light was {{filtering}} in on me. It was {{dawn of the}} second day. I crept {{to the front of}} the store. A <b>smoke</b> <b>pall,</b> shot through with lurid gleams, filled the sky. Down the opposite side of the street tottered a wretched slave. One hand he held tightly against his side, and behind him he left a bloody trail. His eyes roved everywhere, and they were filled with apprehension and dread. Once he looked straight across at me, and in his face was all the dumb pathos of the wounded and hunted animal. He saw me, but there was no kinship between us, and with him, at least, no sympathy of understanding; for he cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on. He could expect no aid in all God's world. He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the masters were making. All he could hope for, all he sought, was some hole to crawl away in and hide like any animal. The sharp clang of a passing ambulance at the corner gave him a start. Ambulances were not for such as he. With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway. A minute later he was out again and desperately hobbling on.|$|E

30|$|In the Savannas of East Africa the {{proportion}} of direct sunlight is much decreased during the months May–October, for during these months the skies are for appreciable periods overcast by dun palls of smoke arising from the great fires that sweep the country from end to end. It {{is interesting to note}} that Brown (1887) records a fire in the Southwestern Cape that caused a <b>smoke</b> <b>pall</b> 120 miles long by 7 to 8 miles wide, to hang over the country for some days.|$|E
30|$|According to Busse (1908), {{extensive}} {{firing of}} vegetation {{took place in}} East and Central Africa during the times of Hanno the Carthaginian. Sim (1907 : 43) in an interesting chapter on forest destruction records that Vasco Da Gama, in 1497, {{on account of the}} <b>smoke</b> <b>pall</b> discernible from the sea, called the Cape “Terra de fume.” It appears that firing was practised by the Hottentots, for Kolbe (1727) states that it was from these that the Europeans learned. At all events the various Placaats (No. 38 of Nov. 9, 1658; No. 71 of Dec. 16, 1661; No. 215 of Feb. 19, 1687) of the Dutch East India Company at the Cape, threatened punishment to those who fired grass. The last named Placaat {{went so far as to}} prescribe scourging for the first offence, and death as the penalty for the second. The Forest and Herbage Act of 1859, of the Cape of Good Hope, laid down relatively heavy penalties, for example, a fine not exceeding a £ 100, or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or combined fine and imprisonment, but appears to have been applied all too rarely.|$|E
40|$|Burning {{to clear}} land for crops and to destroy pests is an {{integral}} and largely unavoidable part of tropical agriculture. It is easy to note but difficult to quantify using remote sensing. This report describes our efforts to integrate remotely sensed data into our computer model of tropical chemical trace-gas emissions, weather, and reaction chemistry (using the MM 5 mesoscale model and our own Global-Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Simulator). The effects of burning over the continents of Africa and South America have been noticed in observations from several satellites. Smoke plumes hundreds of kilometers long may be seen individually, or may merge into a large <b>smoke</b> <b>pall</b> over thousands of kilometers of these continents. These features are related to intense pollution in the much more confined regions with heavy burning. These emissions also translocate nitrogen thousands of kilometers in the tropical ecosystems, with large fixed-nitrogen losses balanced partially by locally intense fertilization downwind, where nitric acid is rained out. At a much larger scale, various satellite measurements have indicated the escape of carbon monoxide and ozone into large filaments which extend across the Tropical and Southern Atlantic Ocean. Our work relates the source emissions, estimated in part from remote sensing, in part from conventional surface reports, to the concentrations of these gases over these intercontinental regions. We will mention work in progress to use meteorological satellite data (AVHRR, GOES, and Meteosat) to estimate the surface temperature and extent and height of clouds, and explain why these uses are so important in our computer simulations of global biogeochemistry. We will compare our simulations and interpretation of remote observations to the international cooperation involving Brazil, South Africa, and the USA in the TRACE-A (Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator - Atlantic) and SAFARI (Southern Africa Fire Atmosphere Research Initiative) and remote-sensing /aircraft/ecosystem observational campaigns...|$|E
