5|$|After Lillehammer {{was awarded}} the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became {{necessary}} to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. The name of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, {{as part of a}} broader branding policy, based on the history of the Birkebeiner. Originally the administration had suggested the new larger hall be named Håkons Hall, after Haakon Haakonarson, later king of Norway, while the smaller hall would be named Sveres Hall, for Sverre Sigurdsson. During the political debate, a number of female councilors suggested that the smaller hall be named Kristins Hall, for Sigurdsson's daughter Kristina Sverresdotter, which was passed by the city council. Kristin and Håkon would be used to name the mascots for the Olympics. Kristins Hall has had small renovations throughout the years, including an upgrade in 2007 which included new ice hockey <b>sideboards,</b> a new ice machine, a new lighting system, and a new handball floor.|$|E

5000|$|A player may {{exchange}} cards {{between the}} playing deck and <b>sideboard</b> after any {{game in a}} match, but the [...] "deck and <b>sideboard</b> must each be returned to their original composition" [...] before a new match. This exchange {{is referred to as}} <b>sideboarding.</b> The number of cards removed from the playing deck need not be the same as the number of cards added to it from the <b>sideboard,</b> but the changes must satisfy the conditions for minimum playing deck size and maximum <b>sideboard</b> size. A player may inspect any <b>sideboard</b> under their control at any time during a game.|$|R
50|$|In {{a limited}} deck format, all cards {{not in the}} playing deck {{are part of the}} <b>sideboard,</b> and the playing deck must have at least 40 cards. Tournaments require a minimum 60 cards in the playing deck, and up to 15 cards in the <b>sideboard.</b> In tournaments, use of the <b>sideboard</b> is the only {{permitted}} form of deck alteration, and the list of cards in the <b>sideboard</b> must be registered.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, a <b>sideboard</b> {{consisting}} {{of no more}} than 15 cards is permitted, from which a player may modify his or her deck during a match to better deal with their opponents strategy. Following the first game of a best-two-of-three match (third game for best-three-of-five match), each player is permitted to change the configuration of cards between his or her deck and <b>sideboard,</b> as long as the changed deck and <b>sideboard</b> are still legal. The original deck configuration is restored {{at the conclusion of the}} match. (Prior to Dragons Mazes rule, a <b>sideboard</b> should consist of exactly of 15 cards and if card replacement between deck or <b>sideboard</b> occurred, the number of cards replaced from Deck and from the <b>Sideboard</b> must be equal. This was modified to current configuration in Magic 2014.) ...|$|R
25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the <b>sideboards</b> and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed around behind the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as it came out the other side.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday 1stMay. Hazy, raw. Yesty {{was very}} {{unfavorable}} {{for the general}} moving of our great city. High rents, incommodious dwellings, & necessity combine to crowd our streets with carts overloaded with furniture & hand barrows with sofas, chairs, <b>sideboards,</b> looking glasses & pictures, so as to render the sidewalks almost impassable. The practice of all moving on one day, & give up & hiring Houses in Feby is of an antient custom & when the city was small & inhabitants few in number, almost every body owned or continued for years tenants in the same houses. Few instances of removals were seen, but now N York is literally in an uproar for several days before & after the 1stofMay. This practice of move all, to strangers appears absurd, but it is attended with the advantage of affording a greater choice of abodes in the Feby quarter.|$|E
500|$|The goal must be {{at least}} 1.20m deep at ground level and at least 0.90m deep at {{crossbar}} level. The goal area must be delimited at ground level by a goal backboard and two <b>sideboards</b> of height [...] Affixed to these boards, the posts and crossbar is a net to stop the ball.|$|E
50|$|Players must {{present their}} <b>sideboard</b> face {{down to the}} {{opponent}} before a match, and allow the opponent to {{count the number of}} cards in the <b>sideboard</b> upon request. The <b>sideboard</b> must be set aside before the playing deck is shuffled, and those cards are considered to be outside the game.|$|R

5000|$|In Magic: The Gathering, {{a player}} {{may have a}} playing deck and an {{optional}} <b>sideboard</b> or [...] "side". In a constructed deck format, a <b>sideboard</b> may have up to 15 cards, and the playing deck and <b>sideboard</b> combined may have {{no more than four}} copies of one card excepting basic lands. Previous versions of the rules required the optional <b>sideboard</b> to contain exactly 15 cards, and for players to agree to their use before a match. This rule was changed with the prerelease of the Magic 2014 core set, and became standard effective 13 July 2013.|$|R
500|$|The Earps {{may have}} spent the winter in Wrangell before setting out for Dawson in the spring on board the Governor Pingree, {{but by the time}} they reached Rampart on the Yukon River, {{freeze-up}} has set in. The Earps rented a cabin from Rex Beach for $100 a month and spent the winter of 1898–1899 there. He managed a small store during the spring of 1899 in St. Michael on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River. By this time, he decided the rush to stake a claim in the Klondike was over. Earp headed for Nome, Alaska, instead. In September, Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, the city's first two-story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. The second floor had 12 [...] "clubrooms" [...] upstairs decorated with fine mirrors, thick carpets, draperies, and <b>sideboards.</b> The building was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: [...] with [...] ceilings. Earp used the club rooms upstairs as a brothel, another fact that Josephine worked hard to see was omitted from stories about him.|$|E

5000|$|The set {{of cards}} to include in a <b>sideboard</b> {{typically}} supplement a deck's weakness against certain opponent decks, and can affect the gameplay dynamics of a deck. A <b>sideboard</b> can lack versatility because of {{the limited number of}} cards it can contain and the diversity of decks that can be constructed. In a sealed deck or booster draft tournament, one strategy is to [...] "pull the questionable" [...] cards from the deck and place them in the <b>sideboard.</b>|$|R

It was a fine room panelled with German oak, and lighted sufficiently, if not brilliantly, by two hanging brass chandeliers of the famous Flemish workmanship, in each of which were fixed eighteen of the best candles, while on the <b>sideboards</b> were branch candlesticks, also of worked brass. The light thus provided was supplemented by that from the great fire of peat and old ships' timber which burned in a wide blue-tiled fire-place, half way down the chamber, throwing its reflections upon many a flagon and bowl of cunningly hammered silver that adorned the table and the <b>sideboards.</b>|$|E

50|$|Godwin {{designed}} {{the first version}} of this <b>sideboard</b> in ebonised , a cheap wood, in 1867. He subsequently changed to ebonised mahogany, as he found deal to be unstable. At least ten versions of the original were made between 1867 and 1888, with differences in design, in decoration or in the number of legs. There are several surviving examples of this <b>sideboard,</b> made of ebonised deal, mahogany, or oak and pine. The original <b>sideboard</b> was designed by Godwin for the dining room of his London home in 1867.|$|R
