40|$|Background: Inventory {{management}} {{is the important}} pillar of the pharmaceutical supply system. Problems in inventory management system generally features with ad hoc decision about order frequency and quantity, inaccurate <b>stock</b> <b>records</b> and lack of system performance monitoring and consequently shortage of pharmaceuticals in the health facilities. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the pharmaceutical logistics system performance in Pemba public health facilities. Methodology: The study was a cross-sectional survey that involved twenty eight health facilities and two warehouses. Inventory <b>keeping</b> <b>records</b> over a period of one year, from January to December 2012, were reviewed. Data on storage condition and HWs’ knowledge on logistics were collected using storage condition check list and questionnaire respectively. Data on medicine expiry were collected based on recorded data and physical counting. Results: The average percent of time out of stock for all health facilities combined was 31 %, at ZILS department store was 13. 2 % and at the Zonal Central Medical Store was 14. 4 %. Percentage of accurate <b>stock</b> <b>records</b> was 70. 6 % in health facilities that were using pull supply system, 64. 9 % in those facilities which were using push supply system, and 47. 3 % in facilities which were using bulky supply system (DHs). Storage condition in 52. 2 % of the PHCUs was unacceptable. Conclusion: Health facilities in Pemba, within a year, faced stock outs of a number of pharmaceutical products. <b>Stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>records</b> were also not perfectly accurate. It is recommended that training should be conducted to all health workers involved in the management of pharmaceuticals, on the basics of pharmaceutical store management with due emphasis on <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> and specifically the proper use of store ledgers and bin cards...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of good warehouse management {{is one of}} important aspect should be concerned in a company, especially for a company which engaged in manufacturing. The basic activities that are managed by warehouse management includes receiving goods from production section, transferring them from one location to another within same warehouse or another, delivering to customers include picking and loading activities, and physical verification activities compare to the recorded data in the system. PT Latinusa Tbk as the only one company in Indonesia that produces tinplate, raw material for cans, faced several warehouse problems, such as missed products shipping to customers, long time execution to look for goods in warehouse due to position of goods were not updated, any changes in goods’ specifications were not followed by reattachment process of goods’ tickets, inaccurate data recording, and update of goods position was not carried out regularly. This evidence consequently decreasing low warehouse management image in which it will give effect on customers’ trust for the company. This paper proposed a suggestion to PT Latinusa Tbk to improve quality of warehouse management system for implementing information technology approach namely Barcode System. The proposed solution includes: 1. Design of process warehouse management activities involve <b>stock</b> management, <b>record</b> <b>keeping,</b> delivery activity to customers, 2. Design of barcode format {{that will be used}} through optimization of feature from two-dimensional barcode format, 3. Design of systems to increase barcode solution with existing ERP System with necessity of estimated costs from implementation and proposed implementation time schedule. To provide additional insight relates to integrated barcode system solutions for the warehouse, it conducted a comparation in performances of implemented integrated barcode system in PT Frisian Flag and PT Krakatau Steel Tbk. Research shows that implementation of barcode solution can affect positively the quality of the warehouse management both in terms of time savings, loss of income due to customers’ claims, data quality in system, personnel’s cost, as well as company image in providing high quality delivery services to customers...|$|R

40|$|The {{realization}} of the significant roles played by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in economic development and the crucial values attached to <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> in performances and development of SMEs has attracted multiple researchers. However, little emphasis {{has so far been}} given to understand as to how SMEs business owners themselves feel about <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> for their business. The study therefore aimed to assess the general attitude of SMEs owners from Madukani ward- Dodoma on <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> and its challenges emanating therein. Achieving this objective, the paper adopts a quantitative and qualitative approach in which a semi structured questionnaire was used as the main data collection method and supplemented with in depth interview and observation methods. The findings indicate that the SMEs have many issues triggers to have negative attitudes in compliance to proper <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> for their business, including cost associated, Time consuming and Tax avoidance. However, the current study found that, this attitude has been largely contributed due to inadequate education and training in particularly <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> skill and knowledge area and the absence of guidelines that equally to their size of their business. The paper concludes that a concerted effort should be made by the government and other stakeholders to set out proper guidelines for <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> and proposes that SMEs owners be trained on key skills for records and information management...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{traces the}} development of public administration in Malawi from the pre-colonial period to the post-colonial period up to 2012, and finds that public administration in Malawi has spanned four epochs: the pre-colonial traditional African administration; the British Colonial Administration from 1891 to 1964; the post-colonial administration under the one party regime from 1964 to 1994; and the post-colonial administration under the multiparty democracy from 1994 to the present period, 2012. Of particular interest to the research are the major factors {{that have led to}} administrative change through this public administration spectrum, and how the changes have affected information and <b>record</b> <b>keeping.</b> The research seeks to establish the relationship that exists between administrative change and <b>record</b> <b>keeping.</b> The research finds that colonialism was a change factor which transformed the pre-colonial administrative set-up and its information keeping systems, and led to the establishment of the Western bureaucracy and <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> systems modelled on those in Britain. The enactment of the Native Authority Ordinance in 1933 established Native Authorities, which comprised local chiefs and their councillors, as part of the local government. The establishment of the Native Authorities resulted in the establishment of <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> systems that captured and maintained official records at local levels of government throughout the country. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland as one of the remarkable administrative developments during the colonial period promoted records management programmes and led to the establishment of the National Archives in Malawi. As part of the administrative change in preparation for the transfer of power, the Treasury’s Organisation and Methods Unit reviewed and instituted new <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> systems for government departments. Before the transfer of power, the research finds that the Colonial Administration exported some categories of records to London and ordered the destruction of certain categories of records held by District Commissioners throughout the country. Furthermore, the research finds that soon after the transfer of power, the new administration disregarded <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> by repealing the Records Management regulations from the Malawi Public Service Regulations. This has been detrimental to public sector <b>record</b> <b>keeping.</b> Additionally, the one party government imposed controls on access to public archives by frequently closing the Archives, imposing lengthy and difficult access procedures, limiting areas for research, and using the Archives for intelligence surveillance. This thesis finds that, {{towards the end of the}} one party regime, some sensitive records were destroyed by the outgoing regime. After the attainment of democracy, the research finds that public archives were made widely and easily accessible, and that the public archives asumed a new meaning for ordinary people who had suffered from widespread attrocities during the one party regime. A number of governance reforms that have been undertaken have on the one hand, resulted in the promotion of records management and on the other hand, relied heavily on good <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> for their successful implementation. Additionally, the research finds that technological developments have shaped the way in which the public sector generates and manages records today. Last, but not least, the research finds that implementation of some of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank policy reforms, such as privatisation of public enterprises, downsising, and freeze in public service employment, have impacted both positively and negatively on <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> in Malawi. Likewise, implementation of the New Public Management policy reforms, such as commercialisation of the Staff Development Institute of Malawi, and compulsory competitive bidding in the public service, have had both positive and negative effects on <b>record</b> <b>keeping.</b> The research concludes that the developments that have taken place during all the four administrative epochs have had an immense bearing on <b>record</b> <b>keeping,</b> and therefore a direct relationship exists between administrative change and <b>record</b> <b>keeping.</b> Administrative change is responsible for shaping <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> over a period of time and as long as administrative change occurs, <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> will keep on developing in response. Although this is the case, good <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> plays an important role in facilitating effective implementation of public sector reforms that result from administrative change. Citing Malawi as a case study, this thesis concludes that administrative change and public sector reforms provide a better context for understanding the history and development of <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> in a country, than any other context because administrative change and public sector reforms are necessitated by the interaction of socio-political, economic and technological factors...|$|R
