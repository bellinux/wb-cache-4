50|$|The {{container}} of the Bubblers {{is similar to}} the construction of a gas washing bottle and used for the protected storage of metalorganic compounds to exclude air (oxygen, moisture). The bubbler has a supply pipe and a <b>sampling</b> <b>tube.</b> The inlet tube ends just before the bottom of the tube. In this tube, an inert gas is introduced, which bubbles through the liquid chemical; a solid chemical will sublime. The mixture of the controlled inert gas and the vaporized chemical leaves the cylinder into a downstream reaction vessel. The temperature is controlled by a thermostat, so that a defined, constant steam pressure can be achieved. The supply of the often expensive and sensitive chemical is controlled by the regulated flow of inert gas and the temperature of the bubbler, resulting in a given vapor pressure of the chemical.|$|E
50|$|The Water FLUTe {{system is}} a MLS that uses a {{flexible}} impermeable liner of polyurethane-coated nylon fabric inflated against the borehole wall to isolate many discrete intervals, {{each of which is}} accessed by a <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> that extends to the ground surface. The system is custom-made at the factory to the customer's specifications and then shipped on a reel to the site for installation. The system can be used to monitor a few zones in boreholes as small as 2-inches, to boreholes up to 20 inches in diameter where numerous depth intervals can be monitored (most installations are in the 4- to 10-inch diameter borehole range) with maximum depth to date of 1,400 feet. Depth-to-water measurements can be made inside the sampling tubing using small-diameter water-level meters. Optional dedicated pressure transducers facilitate continuous, long-term pressure monitoring. Water FLUTe systems are described further by Einarson (2006) and Cherry et al. (2007) and by accessing the FLUTe website.|$|E
40|$|An Outer Planets Probe which {{retains the}} charred {{heatshield}} during atmospheric descent must deploy a <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> through the heatshield to extract atmospheric samples for analysis. Once the <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> is deployed, the atmospheric samples ingested must {{be free of}} contaminant gases generated by the heatshield. Outgassing products such as methane and water vapor are present in planetary atmospheres and hence, ingestion of such species would result in gas analyzer measurement uncertainties. This paper evaluates the potential for, and design impact of, the extracted atmospheric samples being contaminated by heatshield outgassing products. Flight trajectory data for Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus entries are analyzed to define the conditions resulting in the greatest potential for outgassing products being ingested into the probe's sampling system. An experimental program is defined and described which simulates the key flow field features for a planetary flight in a ground-based test facility. The primary parameters varied in the test include: <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> length, injectant mass flow rate and angle of attack.

40|$|A {{system is}} {{proposed}} for packaging material samples {{on a remote}} planet (especially Mars) in sealed <b>sample</b> <b>tubes</b> in preparation for later return to Earth. The <b>sample</b> <b>tubes</b> (Figure 1) would comprise (1) tubes initially having open tops and closed bottoms; (2) small, bellows-like collapsible bodies inside the tubes at their bottoms; and (3) plugs to be eventually used to close {{the tops of the}} tubes. The top inner surface of each tube would be coated with solder. The side of each plug, which would fit snugly into a tube, would feature a solder-filled ring groove. The system would include equipment for storing, manipulating, filling, and sealing the tubes. The containerization system (see Figure 2) will be organized in stations and will include: the storage station, the loading station, and the heating station. These stations can be structured in circular or linear pattern to minimize the manipulator complexity, allowing for compact design and mass efficiency. The manipulation of the <b>sample</b> <b>tube</b> between stations is done by a simple manipulator arm. The storage station contains the unloaded <b>sample</b> <b>tubes</b> and the plugs before sealing as well as the sealed <b>sample</b> <b>tubes</b> with <b>samples</b> after loading and sealing. The chambers at the storage station also allow for plug insertion into the <b>sample</b> <b>tube.</b> At the loading station the sample is poured or inserted into the <b>sample</b> <b>tube</b> and then the tube is topped off. At the heating station the plug is heated so the solder ring melts and seals the plug to the <b>sample</b> <b>tube.</b> The process is performed as follows: Each tube is filled or slightly overfilled with sample material and the excess sample material is wiped off the top.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and reliable method {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous determination of 20 airborne carbonyl compounds in the C- 1 -C- 10 range. The carbonyls were collected onto solid sorbent coated with pentafluorophenyl hydrazine (PFPH), followed by solvent extraction and gas chromatographic (GC) /mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of the PFPH derivatives. The sorbent is packed into two separate sections in a glass <b>sampling</b> <b>tube.</b> The two-section design allows convenient checking of collection efficiency and breakthrough. The <b>sampling</b> <b>tube.</b> with a coating amount of 971 nmol PFPH per 100 mg Tenax TA and operated at a sampling flow rate of 80 mL min(- 1), collects the 20 carbonyls with efficiencies above 95 %. Hexane extracts the collected carbonyls in their PFPH derivatives in the <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> with better than 95 % extraction efficiency. It is necessary to let the <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> sit at ambient temperature for 3 days before solvent extraction to ensure complete derivatization of the carbonyls. The limits of detection (LODs) of the tested carbonyls {{are in the range}} of 3. 7 - 11. 6 ng per sample. The method has been field-tested both in ambient environment and in an indoor environment from burning mosquito-repel lent incense. Eighteen carbonyls were detected in the ambient air samples with the exception of o-tolualdehyde and m-tolualdehyde, while all the 20 target carbonyls were found in the incense smoke. Compare field test with classical DNPH-HPLC/UV method, good agreement exited between the two methods for lower molecular carbonyls but PFPH method is found to be a better analytical method for determination of high molecular weight carbonyls.

40|$|This {{research}} {{provides an}} insight into {{the quality of a}} soil sample during the penetration of a soil sampler. The investigation of the mechanical disturbances in a clay soil is conducted by using an updated Lagrangian finite element formulation with the 2 nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress rate (the Truesdell stress increment) to account for the large deformation behavior near the <b>sampling</b> <b>tube.</b> The penetration of the sampler is simulated by spliting a group of nodes ahead of the penetration route up to a sufficient depth and applying incremental deformation to match the geometric configuration of the <b>sampling</b> <b>tube.</b> Consolidation effect is included to account for the rate of penetration. Thin-layer elements are added into the inside wall of the <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> to model the soil-sampler interface. The modified Cam-clay model is used to simulate the behavior of the soils. An experimental study was conducted to study the variations of stresses and pore water pressures at the soil-sampler interface. The numerical results show that (1) soil samples are subjected to three distinct stages of vertical strain history, compression-extension-recompression. The first stage of compression, in particular, causes irrecoverable changes in the virgin soil properties of the soil; (2) the undrained shear strength of a disturbed sample reconsolidated to the in situ stress condition is larger than the virgin soil for normally consolidated soils but it is smaller for over consolidated soils; (3) the sampling disturbances due to friction at the soil-sampler interface increase as the sampler penetrates the soil. As a result, long samples will be seriously degraded; (4) the increase of the rate of penetration can reduce the degree of disturbances; (5) the piston sampler induces much larger disturbances than the open-drive sampler...|$|E
