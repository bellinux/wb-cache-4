50|$|For the 1996 model year, the Grand Cherokee {{received}} a minor restyling {{to keep up}} with competitors such as the Ford Explorer and the Toyota 4Runner, both of which had been improved. The Grand Cherokee featured new front and rear bumpers, dual front SRS airbags, upgraded seatbelt safety devices, steering wheel-mounted sound system controls for some models, and revised steering wheel, now three-spoke with integrated cruise control buttons, a new dual-note horn, and the horn buttons were deleted in favor of a single horn pad which allowed the driver to press anywhere {{in the center of the}} steering wheel to sound the vehicle's horn. It was also given upgraded seats, an upgraded interior with new door panels and interior trim panels, a glove box that had more storage space, new tires and wheels, revised headlamps, fog lamps that were directly integrated into the vehicle's front bumper on some models, a new keyless entry remote, and faux wood interior trim standard on all models. An optional rear lift glass (first introduced with the 1995 Orvis edition where production tailgates manufactured after January 3, 1995 have both provisions for both fixed and lift glass) for the Laredo and Limited were added to the options list (the fixed glass came standard). The base SE model was dropped for 1996, in favor of new features being added to the Laredo (now base) model. The Grand Cherokee now offered standard power windows, power door locks, rear door child locks, cool blasting, keyless entry, A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and compact disc player and four standard speakers, cloth seating surfaces, and more. The manual transmission was no longer offered after the 1994 model year Grand Cherokee sold in North America but remained as the base transmission for European ZJs (ZG) sold in Europe with the diesel motor. New front door designs got new side body cladding strips, and the 'Laredo' subtext on the Laredo model was moved down to the cladding. The 'Grand Cherokee' badge was relocated to the front lower doors, and was now larger (using a font style similar to other Chrysler products), replacing the 1974-era American Motors font style used on Jeep vehicles. On V8-equipped Grand Cherokees, there was a new V8 badge on the rear liftgate. The 4X4 badge, on four-wheel-drive-equipped Grand Cherokees, was also changed to raised metal letters instead of the 4X4 decals offered before. A combination cassette player and CD player was available for the first time as an option, and the vehicle featured an OBD II diagnostics port under the dashboard on the driver's side, required for all 1996 model year and newer vehicles, a digital odometer and trip odometer, a 120 miles per hour speedometer rating on some models, and the vehicle now included some user-programmable features such as if the headlamps and tail lamps flashed when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, how many miles until service intervals, whether the horn sounded when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, and more. The overhead console was somewhat redesigned for the 1996 model year to improve storage space and feature availability. In addition to the cigarette lighter port, a 12-volt power port was added for cellular telephones, coolers, computers, and other devices. The ashtray was also removed from the rear doors, replaced by a <b>solid</b> <b>area.</b> The Limited model and Orvis Edition model both got chrome interior door handles.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} value of {{quantitative}} ADC in the identification and diagnosis of cerebral alveolar echinococcosis and tuberculoma. Materials and methodsPatients admitted to our hospital from 2010 to 2014 with diagnosis of cerebral alveolar echinococcosis and tuberculoma underwent 3. 0 T superconduction MRI including whole brain routine MR plain scanning, enhanced scanning and DWI examination. The b-value for the DWI gradient sensitive factor is taken as 1000  s/mm 2. The apparent diffusion coefficient in the lesion <b>solid</b> <b>area,</b> {{the area around the}} edema and the brain normal <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> on the corresponding opposite location (control area) were measured respectively. The SPSS 17. 0 software was used for statistics, and changes in the ADC values in the both pathologic lesion <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> and the area around the edema area were analyzed. ResultsThe median and inter quartile range (IQR) of the ADC values of <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> of the cerebral alveolar echinococcosis and the brain tuberculoma lesion were: 1. 08  ×  10 − 3  mm 2 /s (1. 03 – 1. 13), 1. 28  ×  10 − 3  mm 2 /s (1. 19 – 1. 34), there was the significant difference between the average ADC values of the <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> of both diseases (t′− 5. 435, P    0. 05). The ADC values of <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> and the area around the edema of the brain tuberculoma were higher than that of the corresponding area of the cerebral alveolar echinococcosis.

40|$|We present {{simulations}} of the start-up of shear flow of 2 D suspensions of rigid particles in viscoelastic fluids. A novel numerical method is applied that {{makes use of}} biperiodic domains, which act as representative volume elements of the suspension. Local mesh refine- ment ensures the method is both accurate and efficient, {{without the need for}} a repulsive potential between the particles. By averaging many simulations for random initial positions of the particles, we obtain the true rheological bulk response of the material. At Weissenberg numbers of 1 and higher, particle chaining is observed that leads to a decrease in bulk viscos- ity, an effect that was observed experimentally in [1]. Increasing the <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> fraction leads to the particle alignment occuring faster and the particles forming longer chains, causing a stronger decrease in bulk viscosity. In addition, at <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> fractions of 0. 3 and higher, an increase of the bulk first normal stress difference is observed, which may be attributed to an increase in local shear rate in between the particle chains. Finally, flow cessation is simulated and it is found that the particle chains are preserved until all elastic stresses in the fluid have relaxed...|$|E

The two key variables of the study were: a) horizontal and vertical south-facing top-glazing area, and b) the percentage and the reflectance of the <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> of the atrium walls. The calculated Daylight Factors (DF) were then compared to the daylight availability of selected cities with warm climates. The increase of the effective reflectance (i. e., <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> and the reflectance) reduced the optimum top-fenestration transmittance, which would reduce the heat gain in the atrium space.

40|$|Understanding eliminative {{behaviour}} in pigs is {{a priority}} for designing pig facilities. Pigs prefer to lie in areas separated from where they eliminate (urinate, defecate). Welfare-friendly housing facilities include separate areas for lying (solid floors) and elimination (slatted floors). To prevent pen fouling, {{ways to reduce the}} amount of eliminative behaviour on the solid floor area are essential. This study investigated whether the position of the drinkers influences areas preferred for eliminative behaviour in growing-finishing pigs (n = 432; over two batches) assigned to one of three drinker treatments: two drinkers placed in the inner slatted area (IN group; n = 8 pens), two drinkers in the outer slatted area (OUT group; n = 8 pens), or a drinker in each of the inner and outer slatted areas (IN_OUT group; n = 8 pens). We predicted that the OUT group would have fewer elimination events on the inner <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> than the IN group. The number of eliminations in the IN_OUT group was predicted to be a compromise between the IN and OUT group patterns. In addition, we quantified the diurnal variation of lying and eliminative behaviour in different pen areas with respect to temperature, and the effect of pigs lying in eliminatory areas on eliminative behaviour. On the solid floor area, the OUT group urinated 32. 5 % less frequently and defecated 30. 4 % less frequently than the IN group. For urination preferences, the IN_OUT group was intermediate between IN and OUT groups on the inner solid floor, but not for defecation. No significant differences in lying preferences were found between drinker groups on the inner <b>solid</b> <b>area.</b> Elimination (urination and defecation) was most prevalent in the afternoon (15 : 00 and 14 : 00. h, respectively) and least prevalent during the night (03 : 00 and 00 : 02. h, respectively). A one SD increase in temperature (approximately 6. °C) was associated with a 42. 3 % decrease in lying observations on the inner <b>solid</b> <b>area,</b> while the percentage of elimination on the solid floor increased (urination: 75. 8 %; defecation: 139. 5 %). Our results showed that the placement of drinkers in the outer area compared to the inner area resulted in less pen fouling (fewer eliminations on the solid floor) and, thus, provided pigs with a cleaner <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> for lying. This study has identified a simple method of increasing the cleanliness of pigs' dedicated lying areas, which has important implications for improving the design of pig housing facilities and maximising pig welfare. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey of}} 68 integrated Irish pig farms {{was conducted to}} determine the prevalence and risk factors for foot and limb lesions in 2948 piglets from 272 litters. One litter was selected per age category; 3 – 7 days, 8 – 14 days, 15 – 21 days and 22 – 28 days per farm. All piglets were examined for sole bruising, sole erosion, coronary band injuries, limb abrasions, alopecia, swollen limbs and swollen feet and scored from 0 to 3 based on relative size. Environmental parameters were recorded for each litter examined. A questionnaire was completed on management, health and performance factors for each farm. The overall prevalence of each lesion was calculated and multilevel mixed effect logistic regression models were used to elucidate risk factors. The prevalence (farm range) of lesions were: sole bruising = 61. 5 % (7 – 100 %), sole erosion = 34. 1 % (0 – 100 %), coronary band injuries = 11. 3 % (0 – 46 %), limb abrasions = 55. 7 % (11 – 98 %), alopecia = 24. 8 % (0 – 83 %), swollen limbs = 2. 4 % (0 – 11 %) and swollen feet = 4. 4 % (0 – 14 %). Age was negatively associated with sole bruising (OR 0. 42; CI 0. 37, 0. 50) and coronary band injury (OR 0. 69; CI 0. 60, 0. 81) and positively associated with limb abrasions (OR 1. 54; CI 1. 12, 2. 14). There was a reduced risk of sole bruising in piglets in pens with plastic slats with oval voids in the piglet area of the pen with a plastic <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> for piglets and metal slats under the crate (OR 0. 32; CI 0. 15, 0. 70) compared with plastic stats throughout and a plastic <b>solid</b> <b>area</b> for piglets.

Materials and methods: 22 subjects (12 with brain tuberculosis and 10 with toxoplasmosis) were recruited, who underwent routine MRI, T 1 WI-CE and DTI imaging sequence. The morphological characteristics of lesions were observed, and FA and ADC values of the <b>solid</b> <b>areas,</b> edematous areas and the contralateral normal areas of the lesions were calculated. Results were compared by one-way ANOVA and independent sample t-test. The TB diagnosis efficiency of these two values was analyzed by ROC curve. Results: ADC and FA values were detected with significant differences among the three regions between subjects with brain tuberculosis and subjects with toxoplasmosis (P <  0. 05). Statistically significant difference was recorded between <b>solid</b> and edematous <b>areas</b> and contralateral areas in ADC and FA values (P <  0. 05). And so was between the <b>solid</b> <b>areas</b> and edema areas in either group. Moreover, the FA values of the <b>solid</b> <b>areas</b> between two groups also presented statistically significant difference (P <  0. 01).

Case 1 : A 54 -year-old female presented with postmenopausal bleeding, abdominal pain, and pervaginal watery discharge for 10 days. Ultrasonography (USG) of pelvis showed endometrial thickening and multiple tiny echogenic foci in omentum suggestive of omental cake. With a provisional diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma, total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy was done.
