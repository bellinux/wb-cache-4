5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be doing <b>something</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

[...] Tom Charity of CNN found Garfield's [...] "combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor ... immediately appealing." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline said she [...] "had no specific {{desire to see}} the series resuscitated. But watching Garfield and Stone made me think doing so wasn't such a bad idea". Mary F. Pols of Time [...] said {{that even though the}} story was familiar Garfield and Webb made it feel [...] "convincingly fresh and exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 1982 book, Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism, philosopher {{of science}} Philip Kitcher {{specifically}} addresses the [...] "falsifiability" [...] question by {{taking into account}} notable philosophical critiques of Popper by Carl Gustav Hempel and Willard Van Orman Quine and provides a definition of theory other than {{as a set of}} falsifiable statements. As Kitcher points out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of [...] "theory," [...] observations of Uranus when it was first discovered in 1781 would have [...] "falsified" [...] Isaac Newton's celestial mechanics. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus' orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed. Kitcher agrees with Popper that [...] "there is surely <b>something</b> <b>right</b> in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail." [...] But he insists that we view scientific theories as consisting of an [...] "elaborate collection of statements," [...] some of which are not falsifiable, and others—what he calls [...] "auxiliary hypotheses," [...] which are.|$|E

He {{found it difficult to}} write a complete song at home, and finished the lyrics later. Hutchins worked well with Smith, and said that the producer became involved in the music-making and [...] "would start talking a lot of shit to us to let us feel like he felt". Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... But we knew we got <b>something</b> <b>right</b> when Larry started grabbing his dick, and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E
500|$|Sheen reprised {{the role}} of David Frost in 2008's Frost/Nixon, a film dramatisation of The Nixon Interviews of 1977. Despite {{appearing}} in the original stage production in a part written for him by Peter Morgan, Sheen was surprised to have been cast in the film: [...] "Peter said he'd only be prepared to give the rights to someone who would cast me as Frost, which was very nice, but when the studios {{get their hands on}} <b>something...</b> <b>Right</b> up until we started filming I was prepared to be disappointed". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times asserted that Sheen embodied his character in a [...] "compelling, intense" [...] performance while The Wall Street Journal felt he was [...] "a brilliant actor" [...] who [...] "grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator". However, The New York Times felt [...] "the likable, watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer" [...] in Frank Langella's Nixon. Frost himself later said it was [...] "a wonderful performance". Sheen was the recipient of the Variety Award at the British Independent Film Awards 2008.|$|E

[...] Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: [...] " [...] are just little stories, little comedies—stories that make people laugh." [...] On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement the public, in which he said: [...] "So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking The Simpsons. We must be doing <b>something</b> <b>right.</b> I must point out The Simpsons is a cartoon show—not 60 Minutes.

[...] is a mid-tempo electro-R song, {{produced}} by Norwegian producers, StarGate, who return Rihanna to the [...] "Island-pop" [...] of her early career with a backing track consisting of [...] "heavy reggae" [...] and ska beats with synthesised organs. Bill Lamb from About.com noted that before Rihanna's vocals start, {{there is an}} internal buildup of [...] "dreamy drum machine rhythms". Overall he described the backing track as [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "atmospheric". The song was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake and incorporates themes of [...] "sex and romance". Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the vocal delivery and lyrical content of the song as [...] "sassy". Lamb as said that [...] "lyrically, [...] amounts to romantic, sexual sweet nothings". Rihanna called the collaboration [...] "young and playful", something which Stacy Anderson from Spin and Nick Levine of Digital Spy both picked up, when commenting on the sexual innuendos in the lyrics. In particular, [...] Anderson and Levine noted an arithmetic-based joke during Drake's guest vocal, where he says [...] "The square root of 69 is 8 <b>something,</b> <b>right</b> / 'Cuz I been trying to work it out". Megan Vick from Billboard noted that [...] "Rihanna's lush vocal turn denotes a startling leap in maturity from previous singles".|$|E
500|$|Continuing their {{practice}} from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within {{the week before}} its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas {{at the start of}} the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized them as if they were doing a live show. Stone said of the practice, [...] "We kind of need that [...] to work. We're, like, 'We have to do <b>something</b> <b>right</b> now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" [...] For example, three days before the broadcast of the season premiere, [...] "The Ring", the script was only half-finished and the animation was incomplete. Likewise, they did not start work on [...] "Whale Whores" [...] until five days before the episode aired, and the scripts for [...] "Margaritaville" [...] and [...] "Pee" [...] were both still being finished the day before the episodes were first broadcast. Parker and Stone said [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] was a particularly challenging episode to make—they were up all night working on it the day before it aired, and did not finish until 11a.m. on its broadcast date. Some critics have said that this short turnaround process helps South Park stay fresh and allows the show to address current events in a timely fashion.|$|E
500|$|... "The Ring" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It was first broadcast on March 11, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central, and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom. It was the first episode of South Parks thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high-definition (HD). Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession, which they had been planning to do for some time. Stone argued they should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. An episode about the economy entitled [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was shown later in the season. By March 8, three days before the episode premiered, the script was only half-finished and the animation was not yet complete, in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last-minute deadlines; Stone said of the practice, [...] "We don't do a live show, but we kind of harness some of that energy. We kind of need that to work. We're, like, 'We have to do <b>something</b> <b>right</b> now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Just before Cassandra leaves town, {{she tells}} Donna that Matt, {{the man who}} raised her, is not her {{biological}} father. Cassandra tells Donna that her real father is a man named Nick. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Donna's father had been cast and would be introduced the following year. Brian Vriends was given the role of Nick Nixon. Of the introduction of Brian and Nick, executive producer, Susan Bower said [...] "The Freedman family have provided fantastic drama for us so far and we have lots in store for Brian, it's great to have him with us. This is just one of many, many great storylines we have coming up in 2010". Donna discovers that there are two men that could be her father and she contacts them both. Nick Nixon replies first and Donna begins to believe that he is her father. However, Professor Nicholas McKay (Chris Bunworth) later turns up and Donna becomes confused over the situation. Nicholas has just been released from jail and he is keen to do <b>something</b> <b>right.</b> However, he hurts Donna when he tells her that she is just like her mother and that she will run away.

[...] The DNA test eventually proves that Nick is her real father.|$|E

[...] Further, his 'prediction' is clearly not linked in its essentials to the fundamental Velikovskian theses.

2500|$|After the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, the Duke community gathered together during the Silent Vigil to raise awareness for racial equality on campus, presenting an opportunity for Local 77 to accentuate both their workplace and racial equality concerns.
