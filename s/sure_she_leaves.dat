5000|$|With Cinderella {{asleep and}} the family gone, a wanted cat burglar and self-proclaimed {{transvestite}} and kleptomaniac (Richardson) ducks into the empty house to hide from an angry mob. Upon being discovered by Cinderella, he convinces her that he is her [...] "fairy" [...] godmother and sends her upstairs to bathe while he burgles the house ("Grab It"). When Cinderella emerges fully cleaned, he is amazed at her beauty and decides to help her after all.

5000|$|Cara Graves (Elise Cantu) is a cool, down-to-earth chick {{who knows}} {{who she is}} and what she likes.

Meanwhile, <b>she</b> makes <b>sure</b> <b>she’s</b> doing well in her classes, but <b>she</b> <b>leaves</b> ample room for fun too and frequently tries to drag Alice out with her.|$|R
50|$|Sasuke is quiet, rather aloof and expressionless, but has {{a caring}} side for others, such as finding Umeka's flower clip for her, but got Kotaro {{to give it to}} her, and tried to steal cold {{medicine}} for Neko when she got sick. Sasuke has an twin brother called Yusuke, who both look extremely alike. However, the two don't seem to be on good terms with each other, and he is actually Yusuke's enemy and is constantly counter-attacking his brother's actions. He has been smiling once when talking to Neko, who he seems to greatly care about. He has sworn to protect Neko, and is doing whatever he can to make <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> won't <b>leave</b> the academy. Sasuke is really a human and is using his trusted black cat, Kurou, to hide his identity. Sasuke regrets {{a lot of things in}} his past, and came to MoriMori because he wanted his feelings to be locked away by an old school headmistress.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{traditional}} flying trapeze act, flyers mount a narrow board (usually by climbing a tall ladder) {{and take off}} from the board on the fly bar. The flyer must wait for {{a call from the}} catcher to make <b>sure</b> he or <b>she</b> <b>leaves</b> at the correct time. Otherwise, the catcher will not be close enough to the flyer to make a successful catch. The flier then performs one of many aerial tricks and is caught by the catcher, who is swinging from a separate catch bar. Once in the catcher's hands, the flyer continues to swing and is thrust back toward the fly bar in a maneuver called a [...] "return". A return could consist of some kind of twist back to the bar, an [...] "angel" [...] (when the catcher holds the flyer by the feet and one arm), or any other trick that a flyer can think of {{to get back to the}} bar. Once back to the fly bar, the flyer can return to the board, and another flyer takes a turn.|$|R
