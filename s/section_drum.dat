5000|$|Alec Foege of Spin found {{parallels}} to American funk music via the album's syncopated horn <b>section,</b> <b>drum</b> breaks and electric guitars. Rocheareau's voice is [...] "high and caressing, curious and questioning at times," [...] according to Folk Roots. The percussion {{on the album}} is [...] "rumbling," [...] "dancing" [...] atop the beat [...] "with precise, ever changing cymbal and snare patterns." [...] The recording also displays felicities such as Rochereau's new focus on and preference for solo horns, as opposed to ensemble horns. The various guitar styles, dance beats, female vocal cameos and [...] "the Smokey-styled ballad" [...] on the album were described by Robert Christgau as its [...] "constituent parts." [...] While the album {{has been described as}} [...] "a lively and fairly comprehensive overview" [...] of the development of soukous music, the music does also tend towards [...] "the older, slower, original form with which Tabu Ley is most closely associated." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} <b>section,</b> <b>drums,</b> bass, and guitar enter, {{and the music}} becomes more consonant, resolving to the key of A minor {{through the use of}} D and A {{suspended}} second chords, as David Gilmour sings a refrain of [...] "Ooh, babe".|$|R
50|$|In 1968, the Wink Strutters Drum and Bugle Band reorganized, {{and were}} founded as a {{non-profit}} organization, becoming the Edmonton Strutters Drum Corps. Composed {{of young men}} and women ranging from age 12 to 21, the Corps averaged around 80 members. The Corps included a horn <b>section,</b> <b>drums,</b> color guard, rifles, and drum majors.

50|$|DAG {{signed with}} Columbia Records, and {{released}} their debut album Righteous in 1994. Their recordings even attracted special guest performances from Muscle Shoals Rhythm <b>Section</b> <b>drummer</b> Roger Hawkins, {{also known for}} drum work with Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Steve Winwood and others. The album was well praised nationally with high reviews.|$|R
50|$|The {{figure of}} {{the queen of the}} <b>drums</b> <b>section</b> {{appeared}} in the 1970s when the famous mulatto Adele Fatima led the Youth Independent <b>Drums</b> <b>Section,</b> an unprecedent fact, and gained popularity in the following decade. Today {{it is one of the}} most celebrated roles in samba schools. Monique Evans, in Mocidade, Luma de Oliveira, in Tradição and Soninha Capeta, in Beija-Flor, were some notable queens of <b>drum</b> <b>sections.</b> Some schools also introduced the figure of a King of the <b>drums</b> <b>section.</b>|$|R

Vocals {{are provided by}} Mel Fuhrman. It was recorded at A&R Studios, New York City in two sessions, on April 29 (tracks 1, 2, 4 & 6), and May 7 (tracks 3 & 5), 1968.|$|R
50|$|After {{the demise}} of SIN 34 the band's rhythm <b>section</b> (<b>drummer</b> Dave Markey and bassist Phil Newman) formed a new band with guitarists Vic Makauskas (formerly of SVDB) and Nick Delaney from Vancouver, Canada's No Exit. Newman chose the name Painted Willie from a 1950s {{thesaurus}} he had found in a thrift store which defined it as an old English acronym for homosexual, or more approximately transvestite or drag queen.|$|R
50|$|The {{queen of}} the <b>drums</b> <b>section</b> and related roles: godmother, muse, and princess are {{positions}} of honor occupied by distinguished {{members of the community}} and sometimes by celebrities. The {{queen of the}} <b>drums</b> <b>section</b> dances ahead of the drummers group and sometimes interacts with them.|$|R
5000|$|The CD single was {{released}} in Europe with the harsher profanity removed. Its B-side was album track [...] "New Power Soul", a mostly instrumental number with the title repeated throughout. [...] "New Power Soul" [...] is a band-oriented, laid-back funk jam, allowing solos for the horn <b>section,</b> <b>drums</b> and organ. Background noise was added to sound as if the song was recorded with an audience. The title of this song re-appeared (as two words) {{as the title of}} the 1998 New Power Generation album, Newpower Soul.|$|R
50|$|Andrew Jones {{compared}} the unusual sax-guitar-trombone lineup {{to a group}} led by Jimmy Giuffre in the late 1950s, featuring the leader's sax and clarinets alongside valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer and guitarist Jim Hall (see, e.g., Western Suite). Like Guiffre's group, Zorn's band for the Lulu sessions had no traditional rhythm <b>section</b> (<b>drums,</b> piano and/or bass), {{and as a result}} the three musicians found themselves sliding in and out of soloing and supporting roles depending on the song and arrangements, occasionally veering into experimental territory but mostly swinging and staying rooted in blues.|$|R
5000|$|Produced by Grammy {{nominated}} record {{producer and}} songwriter, John Custer, this work of 1970s-style solid beats and creative imagination received terrific reviews. A quote from VIBE Magazine hailed the album as [...] "...one {{of the best}} funk records since 1978. DAG's debut, Righteous, is definitely {{some of the most}} ass-grinding grooves you've heard since back in the day." [...] Featured songs include [...] "Sweet Little Lass", [...] "Righteous (City Pain)" [...] and [...] "Lovely Jane". Numerous additional musicians contribute to Righteous, including Muscle Shoals Rhythm <b>Section</b> <b>drummer</b> Roger Hawkins and jazz trumpeter Jeremy Davenport.|$|R

5000|$|Substatic {{is known}} to be one of Jefferies' most {{experimental}} and musically adventurous recordings. The album comprises five pieces of music, including a lengthy seventeen-minute suite titled [...] "Three Movements". The compositions are based around repetitious rhythms created by Jefferies' pianodrum, a combination of a keyboard and the snare and bass <b>drum</b> <b>sections</b> of a <b>drum</b> set, and are partially improvised.|$|R
50|$|Destiny is {{the ninth}} studio album by heavy metal band Saxon {{released}} in 1988. It {{is also the}} only studio album to feature the rhythm <b>section</b> of <b>drummer</b> Nigel Durham and bassist Paul Johnson (former Heritage, later in U.S.I. and Demon) on it.|$|R

50|$|During the First World War, some Breton pipers {{serving in}} the French Army {{came in contact with}} the pipers of Scottish regiments, and brought back home a few Great Highland Bagpipes which Breton pipe-makers started copying. Polig Monjarret led the {{introduction}} of the Great Highland bagpipe to Brittany during the Celtic revival of the 1920s Breton folk music scene, inventing the bagad, a pipe band incorporating a binioù braz section, a bombarde <b>section,</b> a <b>drums</b> <b>section,</b> and in recent years almost any added grouping of wind instruments such as the saxophones, and brass instruments such as the trumpet and trombone.|$|R

500|$|Side two {{begins with}} Florence Kaye and Bernie Baum's [...] "Power of My Love". The song has a blues-based sound, with Presley {{backed by a}} brass <b>section,</b> <b>drums</b> and {{electric}} guitar and organ. The lyrics include double entendres ("Crush it, kick it / You can never win / I know baby you can't lick it/ I'll make you give in)", with groans by backing female singers emphasizing sexuality. The second track, a cover of John Hartford's [...] "Gentle on My Mind" [...] follows. The string-laden arrangement was inspired by Glen Campbell's 1967 Grammy-winning version of the song. The next song, Eddy Arnold's 1962 hit [...] "After Loving You", is arranged in a 12/8 tempo rhythm-and-blues style. This is followed by Dallas Frazier's [...] "True Love Travels on a Gravel Road" [...] and Chuck Jackson's 1962 hit, [...] "Any Day Now".|$|R

50|$|A modern-day bagad {{consists}} of a biniou braz (bagpipe), a bombarde <b>section,</b> a <b>drum</b> corps, perhaps more accurately described nowadays as a 'large and varied percussion section' (one band's percussionists lug around a huge metal model elephant), and any additional musical instruments the band wishes to add. Common additions are clarinets, brass instruments (often trumpets or saxophones), guitars, {{and other forms of}} binious.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{departure}} of drummer Wiederschall and bassist West in 1988, Mulcahy and Neal continued Miracle Legion as a duo, touring as the opening act for The Sugarcubes. Their 1989 release of Me and Mr. Ray, recorded at Prince's Paisley Park Studios, reflected the band's new direction with its stripped-down instrumentation. The album yielded a single, [...] "You're the Ōne-Lee", the video for which received modest rotation on MTV's 120 Minutes alternative music show. That year, the band found a new rhythm <b>section,</b> <b>drummer</b> Scott Boutier and bassist Dave McCaffrey, and signed with the now-defunct label Morgan Creek Records, which funded their 1992 album Drenched produced by John Porter (of Roxy Music and The Smiths fame). The band had a national if limited tour that year {{in support of the}} new album, mostly playing clubs and other small venues. The song [...] "So Good" [...] off of Drenched was featured in the 1993 film The Crush.|$|R

500|$|Peart {{had long}} played matched grip, but shifted to {{traditional}} {{as part of}} his style reinvention in the mid-1990s under the tutelage of jazz coach Freddie Gruber. He played traditional grip throughout his first instructional DVD [...] A Work in Progress, and on Rush's Test For Echo studio album. Peart went back to using primarily matched, though he does switch to traditional from time to time when playing songs from Test for Echo and during moments when he feels traditional grip is more appropriate, such as the rudimental snare <b>drum</b> <b>section</b> of his <b>drum</b> solo. He discusses the details of these switches in the DVD Anatomy of a Drum Solo.|$|R
