The motivation of the paper is an attempt to develop a workable prototype of the OOS protection system. The deficiencies of the protection currently used in the Latvian Power System network are highlighted and a new protection structure is proposed. The protection system comprises of several strategically located terminals, exchanging information in real time by means of a communication network. The OOS condition detection method is based on system-wide generation <b>sources,</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces,</b> vectors, and angle control. The network splitting decision is based on generator coherence evaluation. Protection terminals determine online the groups of coherent generators and choose the splitting boundary from a predefined transmission lines (TLs) cut sets list.

Johann Heinrich Winckler, {{professor of physics at}} Leipzig, substituted a leather cushion for the hand. During 1746, Jan Ingenhousz invented electric machines made of plate glass. Experiments with the electric machine were largely aided by the discovery of the Leyden Jar.

50|$|The article {{states that}} {{alternating}} power <b>source</b> generates <b>electromotive</b> <b>force,</b> which generates potential differences and longitudinal electric fields in a circuit almost instantaneously. The word speed of alternating electricity refers generally {{to the speed}} of electric energy from a alternating power source to an electric load (such as a resistor) in a electric circuit. The movement of electrons through a conductor {{in the presence of}} potential and an electric field is very slow. When a DC voltage is applied, The drift speed is on the order of millimeters per hour. AC voltages cause no net movement; the electrons oscillate back and forth in response to the alternating electric field.|$|R
50|$|Voltage can {{be caused}} by static {{electric}} fields, by electric current through a magnetic field, by time-varying magnetic fields, or some combination of these three. A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage (or potential difference) between two points in a system; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. A voltage may represent either a <b>source</b> of energy (<b>electromotive</b> <b>force)</b> or lost, used, or stored energy (potential drop).|$|R
50|$|Even Faraday himself, however, did not {{settle the}} controversy, {{and while the}} views of the advocates {{on both sides of the}} {{question}} have undergone modifications, as subsequent investigations and discoveries demanded, up to 1918 diversity of opinion on these points continued to crop out. Volta made numerous experiments in support of his theory and ultimately developed the pile or battery, which was the precursor of all subsequent chemical batteries, and possessed the distinguishing merit of being the first means by which a prolonged continuous current of electricity was obtainable. Volta communicated a description of his pile to the Royal Society of London and shortly thereafter Nicholson and Cavendish (1780) produced the decomposition of water by means of the electric current, using Voltas pile as the <b>source</b> of <b>electromotive</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{between local}} {{magnetization}} and conduction electrons {{is responsible for}} a variety of phenomena in magnetic materials. It has been recently shown that spin current and associated electric voltage can be induced by magnetization that depends on both time and space. This effect, called spinmotive force, provides for a powerful tool for exploring the dynamics and the nature of magnetic textures, as well as a new <b>source</b> for <b>electromotive</b> <b>force.</b> Here we theoretically demonstrate the generation of electric voltages in magnetic bubble array systems subjected to a magnetic field gradient. It is shown by deriving expressions for the electric voltages that the present system offers a direct measure of phenomenological parameter that describes non-adiabaticity in the current induced magnetization dynamics.

As a consequence, we propose and implement a direct experimental procedure for the correct identification of retarded positions of bound field contributions on the oscilloscope time scale as a function of a distance from the emitting loop antenna. It provides unambiguous empirical information on causal characteristics of bound electromagnetic fields. According to the observation of no retardation inside the near zone of the emitting loop antenna, the experimental evidence for nonlocal properties of bound electromagnetic fields is reported...|$|R

[...] He also made a major contribution to motoring when he patented a form of electric spark ignition for the internal combustion engine (the Lodge Igniter). Later, two of his sons developed his ideas and in 1903 founded Lodge Bros, which eventually became known as Lodge Plugs Ltd. He also made discoveries in the field of wireless transmission. In 1898, Lodge gained a patent on the moving-coil loudspeaker, utilizing a coil connected to a diaphragm, suspended in a strong magnetic field.|$|R
2500|$|Volta {{believed}} the current {{was the result}} of two different materials simply touching each other—an obsolete scientific theory known as contact tension—and not the result of chemical reactions. As a consequence, he regarded the corrosion of the zinc plates as an unrelated flaw that could perhaps be fixed by changing the materials somehow. However, no scientist ever succeeded in preventing this corrosion. In fact, it was observed that the corrosion was faster when a higher current was drawn. This suggested that the corrosion was actually integral to the battery's ability to produce a current. This, in part, led to the rejection of Volta's contact tension theory in favor of electrochemical theory. Volta's illustrations of his Crown of Cups and voltaic pile have extra metal disks, now known to be unnecessary, on both the top and bottom. The figure associated with this section, of the zinc-copper voltaic pile, has the modern design, an indication that [...] "contact tension" [...] is not the <b>source</b> of <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> for the voltaic pile.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electric}} machine was subsequently improved by Francis Hauksbee, Litzendorf, and by Prof. Georg Matthias Bose, about 1750.

Ingenhousz, during 1746, invented {{electric machine}}s made of plate glass.

The collector, consisting of a series of metal points, was added to the machine by Benjamin Wilson about 1746, and in 1762, John Canton of England (also the inventor of the first pith-ball electroscope) improved the efficiency of electric machines by sprinkling an amalgam of tin over the surface of the rubber.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of dynamo electric machines, voltaic, or primary, batteries were extensively used for electro-plating and in telegraphy. There are two distinct types of voltaic cells, namely, the [...] "open" [...] and the [...] "closed", or [...] "constant", type. The open type in brief is that type which operated on closed circuit becomes, after a short time, polarized; that is, gases are liberated in the cell which settle on the negative plate and establish a resistance that reduces the current strength. After a brief interval of open circuit these gases are eliminated or absorbed and the cell is again ready for operation. Closed circuit cells are those in which the gases in the cells are absorbed as quickly as liberated and hence {{the output of the}} cell is practically uniform. The Leclanché and Daniell cells, respectively, are familiar examples of the [...] "open" [...] and [...] "closed" [...] type of voltaic cell. The [...] "open" [...] cells are used very extensively at present, especially in the dry cell form, and in annunciator and other open circuit signal systems. Batteries of the Daniell or [...] "gravity" [...] type were employed almost generally in the United States and Canada as the <b>source</b> of <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> in telegraphy before the dynamo machine became available, and still are largely used for this service or as [...] "local" [...] cells.
