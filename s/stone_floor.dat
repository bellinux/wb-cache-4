5|$|In 1833 a large {{earthquake}} on {{the west}} coast of Sumatra struck up a tsunami which destroyed much of Padang. The mosque was one of several buildings which survived the tsunami. Its <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was later replaced by a mixture of clam shells and pumice.|$|E
5|$|The current {{concrete}} {{stairs to}} the keep are modern, and the original medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a drawbridge just before the castle doors. The basement contained a well, which could also {{be drawn from the}} 1st floor {{through a hole in the}} <b>stone</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Interior {{materials}} vary {{depend on}} their location, either in standard apartments, premium apartments, or common areas. In the standard apartments, materials include bamboo and <b>stone</b> <b>flooring,</b> white tiled bathrooms, white stone kitchen counters, and metal cabinets. In the premium apartments, materials include palm and <b>stone</b> <b>flooring,</b> glass tiled bathrooms, and Boffi brand kitchens. In the common areas materials include bamboo wall paneling, <b>stone</b> <b>floors,</b> and white back-lit glass panels. The structural and interior materials are not uncommon in high-end residential projects, but the unconventional form necessitated an innovative approach to methods of construction.|$|R

50|$|Many {{different}} natural {{stones are}} cut into {{a variety of}} sizes, shapes, and thicknesses for use as <b>flooring.</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>flooring</b> uses a similar installation method to ceramic tile. Slate and marble are popular types of <b>stone</b> <b>flooring</b> that requires polishing and sealing. Stone aggregates, like Terrazzo, can also be used instead of raw cut stone and are available as either preformed tiles or to be constructed in-place using a cement binder.|$|R
5|$|After the work-in had finished, the {{boarding}} of the <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned {{in preparation for}} an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost £3,250. Donations received were £2,000 from Rank Xerox, £1,704 from the Historic Buildings Council and £130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council. Other donations and income received amounted to £70. The project received further coverage in local media, the Eastern Daily Press, and South Norfolk News.|$|E
5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.|$|E
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. <b>Stone</b> <b>floor</b> and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E
5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E

She stayed beside him for more than half an hour, nuzzling him and keeping him warm with her fur. To everyone’s astonishment, Cowan eventually stirred. He was taken to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. He visited Lassie again when he returned to thank all who saved his life.|$|E
25|$|Dmitry's {{mother died}} in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke’s poor {{eyesight}} became the source of temporary mirth {{at the end of}} the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held in her hands. Unable to see clearly, he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the <b>stone</b> <b>floor.</b> Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though nothing had happened.|$|E
25|$|In {{the walls}} of the {{sanctuary}} are two corbels which have been re-set, and they may indicate the use of a Lenten veil. On the sanctuary floor are early 20thcentury memorial mosaics, with a crypt below. The chancel contains a 14thcentury piscina with an ogee opening, but the piscina and the top of the sedilia are low on the wall {{to the right of the}} altar, indicating a raising of the <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> which has 17th and 19thcentury ledgers. It has scribed render walls. The roof was restored in 1884, and is arch-braced with 4.5 bays.|$|E

50|$|Because {{none of the}} {{interior}} walls make right angles, Stiles' dorm rooms are furnished with built-in desks and bookshelves. The college was once heated by a system that warmed the <b>stone</b> <b>floors,</b> but maintenance troubles led Yale to abandon it and install radiators.|$|R

Some groups relying on hunting and gathering partially retained their pre-civilizational lifestyle up to the last century.|$|E
25|$|Llangar Church is a 'Guardianship monument', {{meaning that}} {{responsibility}} for the Church building {{is now in the}} hands of Cadw, having been formerly part of St Asaph Diocese of the Church in Wales. There remains a facility for two services a year to be held within the Church. Responsibility for Llangar passed to the Secretary of State for Wales (Cadw's predecessor) in 1967., and a project to investigate and conserve the Church was begun in 1974. Archaeological excavations under the <b>stone</b> <b>floor,</b> led by Ron Shoesmith, found no evidence dating back before the 14th century. The building was stabilised, made weatherproof, and in 1991 a scheme of work to reveal and conserve the wall paintings was completed. The building is accessible to visitors by arrangement with the Cadw staff based at Rug Chapel.|$|E
500|$|The new {{main beam}} for the <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was {{installed}} {{and the ground}} floor was concreted. The <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was reconstructed, reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse. Other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine. New floorboards were laid in the dust floor, the [...] thick elm boards being double-grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a trammel attached to the upright shaft.|$|E
