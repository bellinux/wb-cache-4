In 2014 grab samples were retrieved at 101 positions in the wider Swansea Bay area to analyse the infauna benthos as well as sediment grain size distribution. Grab samples were taken with a 0. 1 m 2 Day grab. About 200 g of surface sediment were removed for particle size analysis, and the remaining sediment was washed through a sieve with 1 mm mesh. The sieve residue was fixed in 4 % formaldehyde and stained with Rose Bengal. All benthic fauna was sorted from the samples, identified to species level if possible, and counted. Sediment samples were air dried and passed through a series of sieves from 2 mm to 63 µm according to the Wentworth-Udden classification scale to determine particle-size distribution. The survey revealed spatially discrete benthic communities including a biodiversity hotspot. Habitat characteristics including sediment properties and the proximity to a sewage outfall explained 17 - 35 % of the variation in the community structure.

40|$|SUMMARY: Chesapeake Bay {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{estuaries}} in the world with its shores partly in Virginia and partly in Maryland, and an expected population of 30 million by 2020 AD. There is a wide range of shorelines with wetlands used by wildfowl and also with valuable fisheries. It is heavily used for recreation but also for shipping, industry, sewage dispersal, dredge <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal</b> and power generating stations. Pressures for alterations to the Bay are very great and in 1973 over 2000 applications were made to the US Anny Corps of Engineers for changes. A study to draw up management guidelines was made by the Chesapeake Research Consortium and they recommended a moratorium on heavily pressurised coastlines. Examples are given of shoreline classification and of pressures resulting from increased sewage effluent disposal and bulkheading applications. Two proposals were co~. sidered in detail and management problems arising from them discussed and specific proposals made. Arising from this study a number of lessons were listed from which New Zealand could benefit. In particular it is suggested that groups of estuaries should be under the control of a local estuary commission that should examine all proposals for the group once a year and that an environmental impact report should be produced...|$|R
40|$|Between 1970 to 2000, {{the annual}} mean {{suspended}} matter (SPM) {{concentrations in the}} Vlie and Marsdiep tidal inlets of the Wadden Sea varied over five times. The present paper examines the possible relationship between SPM in the Wadden Sea and changing river Rhine discharges and dredging operations. The major short-term variations in annual mean SPM in part of the Wadden Sea {{appears to be a}} non-linear, exponential, function of river Rhine discharge and dredge <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal</b> (110 km to over 200 km from the area in front of the Dutch coast near the river Rhine outlet). Correlation coefficients (with SPM as the fixed and dredge disposal as the independent variable) ranged from r = 0 (.) 8 (deep tidal inlet of Marsdiep) to r= 0 (.) 2 (shallow inner area of Vlie) and weakened mainly as a function of distance to the disposal site. The best correlation with river discharge was for Marsdiep tidal inlet (r= 0 (.) 45), indicating the superior effect of dredge disposal over river discharge-related processes. Taking the estimated regression equation as an explorative model, indicates that, without any <b>disposal</b> of dredge <b>spoil,</b> the expected SPM concentration levels in the tidal inlets of the Wadden Sea will be < 15 g m(- 3) (comparable to the 1950 s). The overall mean (and the highest mean) annual concentrations for the investigation period reached 42 (90) g m(- 3) at Marsdiep and 35 (75) g m(- 3) at Vlie. Assuming a 10 % (220 m(- 3) s(- 1)) increase in river Rhine discharge over the next 50 years, and unchanged dredging policy and other circumstances, SPM concentrations would increase 5 - 15 % for Marsdiep and Vlie. Compared with the calculated (12 (.) 4 g m(- 3) SPM in Marsdiep and 14 (.) 8 g m(- 3) SPM in Vlie) and measured (15 g m(- 3) SPM in Marsdiep) background SPM concentrations, the expected overall mean increase since 1950 is at least 250 % of background. The natural variation in river Rhine discharge will cause further inter-annual variation. Changes in SPM concentrations, due to expected changes in wind climate, combined with river discharge are estimated to increase SPM concentrations 20 % above the present situation. The possible implications of changes in land use in combination with further increasing river discharge, changed wind fields and increased temperature are discussed. An important management conclusion is that increasing mean river discharge will significantly increase the need for dredging and <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal,</b> and result in further elevated SPM concentrations in the Dutch coastal zone and the Wadden Sea. The presented relationships offer possibilities for developing new management strategies in relation to dredging and its effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Matakana Banks ebb-tidal delta {{is located}} {{offshore}} from the Tauranga Entrance to Tauranga Harbour, Bay of Plenty New Zealand. In order {{to access the}} Port of Tauranga, Matakana Banks has been dredged to provide a shipping channel with sufficient depth for navigational purposes. In 1968 the first capital-dredging programme included an Entrance Channel through the delta, which was further enlarged in 1992. A biennial maintenance dredging programme has been required to deal with subsequent infilling of the Channel. Recently, the Port has obtained resource consent to further widen and deepen the Entrance Channel. However, while granting the consent, the Environment Court accepted that dredging could result in adverse impacts to the stability of Matakana Banks and the adjacent Panepane Point {{on the western side}} of the tidal inlet. Therefore, this study was undertaken to assess the response of the ebb tidal delta to dredging, and determine possible mitigation measures if dredging has adverse effects. The study analysed bathymetric data from single beam echo sounder (SBES) surveys obtained from 1998 to 2011. These data indicate that {{the main body of the}} ebb tidal delta is stable and undergoes little change. However, the swash bars located on the swash platform are very mobile, and probably account for the changes reported by the earlier assessments of changes between bathymetric surveys. In order to better track swash bars and assess variations in ebb-tidal delta morphology, multibeam echo sounder (MBES) surveys have been instituted. Comparison of morphological changes with the dredging volume and the wave climate during 1998 to 2011 indicated that the storm events may trigger erosion of the ebb-tidal delta, particularly after a maintenance dredging campaign. However, the ebb-tidal delta volume recovered quickly between dredging campaigns, suggesting that the sediment was redistibuted within the system and not permanently removed. To provide insights into the processes affecting the ebb-tidal delta, and provide the necessary data for the calibration and verification of numerical models, and a major 27 -day field programme was undertaken. Sediment traps were used to assess sedimentaion rates, and provide sediment samples for characterising the sediment grain size and bed roughness distribution for numerical modelling. Concentric arcs of wave and current recorders were used to measure hydrodynamic processes within and around the ebb-tidal delta and tidal inlet, and along the Matakana Island shoreface. The field and historical bathymetric data showed that the ebb-tidal delta can be divided into 3 sub-regions according to the dominant hydrodynamic regime; (1) close to the Entrance Channel and ebb-jet where tidal currents dominate; (2) the central area of the swash platform, where the influence of tidal currents is still present but waves also play important role; and (3) the margins of the swash platform where waves are dominant and tidal influence is minimal. Overall the wave influence becomes more dominant as the distance from the Entrance Channel (main ebb jet) increases, and vice versa for tidal processes. The short- and long-term impacts of dredging on the Matakana Banks ebb-tidal delta were investigated by numerical modelling using Delft 3 D. The model covered dredging locations inside Tauranga Harbour and the offshore areas around the Matakana Banks ebb-tidal delta, and was calibrated by the field measurement data. A month-long time series of wave conditions were used to force a wave model coupled with a hydrodynamic model for the 2013 bathymetry to simulate the present day situation. The modelling results showed that the sediment volume of the ebb-tidal delta fluctuates with tidal range; accretion occurred during neap tides; and erosion during spring tides. To assess the long term impact, the morphological factor (morfac) tool in Delft 3 D was used. A morfac of 60 was applied to 12 -days simulations to predict 2 -year morphological changes, corresponding to the approximate time interval between maintenance dredging campaigns. The impacts of dredging were then investigated by modelling three different conditions: (1) before dredging started in 1968, using 1967 bathymetry; (2) the present situation using 2013 bathymetry with existing dredging and dumping activities; and (3) future scenarios using the 2013 bathymetry with alternative offshore disposal locations. Conditions of average waves (no storm) and with storm waves were also simulated. Before dredging commenced, the ebb-tidal delta had a continuous terminal lobe from the north to southeast with a minimum depth of 5 m. Sediment transport modelling indicated that bar by-passing transported sediment past the inlet via mobile bedforms on the terminal lobe, and suggested that the ebb-tidal delta was getting shallower and broader. Simulations incorporating dredging revealed that the tidal currents in the channels of the ebb-tidal delta became more asymmetric (stronger ebb-current), and the ebb-tidal delta became bifurcated and more complex in its morphology. The system changed to inlet bypassing, although only small quantities of sediment appear to be transported past the tidal inlet (most sediment recirculates within the tidal inlet system). Overall dredging does not appear to have affected the stability of the Matakana Banks ebb-tidal delta, but there may have been an increase in the morphologic variability as bedforms circulate over the swash platform, and additional bands of sand bars have formed on the seaward margin of the swash platform. Modelling of alternative <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal</b> sites indicated that shallow nearshore <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal</b> sites were more rapidly dispersed than the offshore <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal</b> site in 20 m depth, particularly during storm events. However, the volumetric differences between the models were small (less than 0. 2 %). The smallest volumetric changes compared to an initial ebb-tidal delta volume are associated with <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal</b> located northeast of the ebb-tidal delta (DaD New), and the most effective site for contributing sediment to mitigate erosion of Matakana Island is on the shoreface to the west of the ebb-tidal delta...|$|R

25|$|The WST {{was armed}} with one 76.2mm wz. 02 field gun, two Bofors 37 mm wz. 36 {{anti-tank}} guns, and four Stokes-Brandt 81 mm wz. 31 medium mortars. The strong {{side of the}} garrison was a disproportionately large number of machine guns at their <b>disposal</b> (41 <b>machine</b> guns, including 16 heavy machine guns). They had also 160 rifles, 40 pistols and over 1,000 hand grenades.|$|R
40|$|Coring in the Lagoon of Venice mudflats along {{previously}} collected high-resolution subbottom seismic-reflection survey profile lines {{has enabled}} {{the collection of}} interlayered radiocarbon-datable terrestrial plant material. Along present and former meander bends, dipping laminated sandy channel-bank deposits rest in sharp lithostratigraphic and chronologic contrast to the adjacent and overlying mudflat deposits. Horizontal channel migration rates of roughly 10 to 20 meters per century are orders of magnitude faster than the minimum estimates of vertical mudflat silt accumulation, which range from 5 to 25 centimeters per century. Given the nearly 6000 -year history since the late-Holocene marine transgression that produced the initial lagoon environments of deposition, {{it is no surprise}} that channel meander migration has left a prevalence of channel-bank deposits in the subsurface lithostratigraphy. Furthermore, regional subsidence and rising relative sea level continue to enhance the net accumulation of mudflat and salt marsh deposition on top of the older deposits. Tapered variations of tidal-channel width, depth, and flow velocity, as well as wind-driven waves with associated intensities of turbulence along the meandering paths, lead to recognizable sediment grain size trends and lagoon deposit stratigraphy. Human interventions, such as dredging, <b>spoil</b> <b>disposal,</b> and powerboat wakes, introduce other contrasting processes and depositional features. For complete understanding of the depositional environments in the lagoon, the full set of dynamic processes and depositional consequences often need to be considered. Patterns and processes revealed in this case study probably have broad applicability to other coastal lagoon environments experiencing significant tidal flow and sea-level change...|$|R
