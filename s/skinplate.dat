50|$|A {{critical}} factor in Tainter gate design {{is the amount of}} stress transferred from the <b>skinplate</b> through the radial arms and to the trunnion and the resulting friction encountered when raising or lowering the gate. Some older systems have had to be modified to allow for frictional forces for which the original design did not plan.|$|E
50|$|A {{side view}} of a Tainter gate resembles a slice of pie with the curved part of the piece facing the source or upper pool of water and the tip {{pointing}} toward the destination or lower pool. The curved face or <b>skinplate</b> of the gate {{takes the form of}} a wedge section of cylinder. The straight sides of the pie shape, the trunnion arms, extend back from each end of the cylinder section and meet at a trunnion which serves as a pivot point when the gate rotates.|$|E
