The project works with Gateshead Council and the Gateshead Housing Company to provide a community cafe promoting healthy eating (the T–Junction), a gymnasium, indoor sports hall, outdoor Five-a-side football pitches and a meeting place for resident groups. The project has education provision for young children as a registered day–care provider and it also offers adult education and training. The project hosts the Carnival on the Hill/Deckham Festival, a collaborative enterprise between Route 26, Gateshead Council and Home Group, offering free activities such as go-karting and children's soft play, {{against the backdrop of}} a <b>steel</b> <b>band.</b> The second Carnival on the Hill was held on 3 September 2011 and attracted more than 1,000 visitors, including the Mayor of Gateshead and BBC local weatherman Paul Mooney.|$|E
25|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>band</b> {{tradition}} {{is common to}} many Caribbean, and especially Lesser Antillean, islands. The Montserratian tradition began in 1949 in Ryner's Village and Kinsale, and was prominent enough by the following year to be played at the Empire Day celebrations. Despite some criticism that the music was degrading for children, steel bands have become {{a major part of}} the island's musical heritage.|$|E
25|$|After having {{visited the}} United States in the {{beginning}} of the 1960's to build up the U.S. Navy <b>Steel</b> <b>Band,</b> , he was invited to New York City to build instruments for an inner city youth program. This invitation had been carried out by Murray Narell, a New York social worker and father of Jeff and Andy Narell. At this time, Mannette tuned his instruments by ear. Eventually he learned about the necessity of concert pitch A440Hz and the use of strobe tuners.|$|E

50|$|Corded and woven {{strapping}} {{are available}} in several constructions, primarily involving polyester and rayon. Some types are reusable. Because this system uses a buckle for a joint, corded and woven strapping can have a larger system strength than <b>steel</b> <b>banding.</b> Corded polyester strapping also has a higher elongation than other strapping systems, which gives it an ideal memory for sea and rail shipments. Because corded and woven polyester straps are light and soft, they are also a safer alternative to <b>steel</b> <b>banding.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Pebble Steel is a steel-bodied {{variant of}} the {{original}} Pebble smartwatch. Announced at CES 2014, it has a thinner body, tactile metal buttons, and Corning Gorilla Glass. It comes in 2 variations: a black matte finish and a brushed stainless steel finish, with both a black leather band and a matching <b>steel</b> <b>band.</b> It was released in February 2014. The CNET reviewer liked the design, readability, swim-friendliness and selection of apps, while he disliked the lack of storage that limits to 8 user installed apps {{and the lack of}} a heart-rate monitor.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Mannette {{was awarded}} the Hummingbird Medal (Silver) of Trinidad and Tobago for his {{innovations}} in pan making. For more than 30 years, he {{has been at the}} forefront of the <b>steel</b> <b>band</b> movement in the United States and in recognition of his significant contribution to this thriving art form, Mannette received the 1999 NEA National Heritage Fellowship Award, the highest honour for the traditional arts given in the US. Also in November 2000, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of the West Indies and returned home to Trinidad, after a 33-year absence, to receive it. The same year he also received the Chaconia Medal Silver from his home country, for outstanding cultural achievement.|$|E
25|$|Tamboo-bamboo bands {{consist of}} three {{different}} instruments (each cut from bamboo): boom, foulé, and cutter. The boom serves as the bass instrument, is usually about five feet long, and is played by stamping it on the ground. The foulé, a higher-pitched instrument, consists of two pieces of bamboo, each about a foot long, and is played by striking these pieces end to end. The cutter, the highest-pitched instrument in the ensemble, is made from a thinner piece of bamboo (of varying length) and is struck with a stick. These three types of instruments combined to beat out rhythms that accompanied the chantwells and were a staple of carnival celebrations for many years. They were gradually rendered obsolete by the <b>steel</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E

The wheels are wooden with a 75mm wide <b>steel</b> <b>band.</b> The wheel diameter is 1.7 m. The track width is 1.8 m. Barrel width at the muzzle is 140mm. Such was the confidence of the army in the accuracy of the gun that at the battle of Hairini Ridge the artillery was fired {{over the heads of the}} advancing infantry as they stormed the ridge. The infantry took cover in a slight depression in the ground in front of the Maori trenches and then stormed the trenches when the shelling stopped.|$|E

500|$|I {{found that}} such a {{pendulum}} actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. [...] At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. [...] We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. [...] The problem was {{to get it in}} exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a <b>steel</b> <b>band</b> around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder.

The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill was also life-altering for Parks and changed his [...] "very reason for being". Sometime after, he met the Esso Trinidad <b>Steel</b> <b>Band,</b> a Trinidadian calypso band who had been performing with Liberace in Las Vegas. According to Parks, [...] "I saw them as enslaved in their relationship to Liberace; I {{thought it was a}} vulgarity. I wanted to save them from their trivialization." [...] What had begun as Parks's desire to popularize calypso at that point became his focal point, and he would work with the <b>steel</b> <b>band</b> the next several years. Speaking about his life then, Parks stated, [...] "My favorite group was the Esso Trinidad <b>Steel</b> <b>Band,</b> whom I worked with. I loved calypso all my life.
