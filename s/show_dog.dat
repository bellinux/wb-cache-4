5|$|Members of {{the breed}} were {{originally}} used as hunting dogs, but increased in popularity as a <b>show</b> <b>dog.</b> It was bred {{more and more}} in conformation with the breed standard, resulting in certain attributes, such as a long coat, which no longer make it an ideal working dog.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a <b>show</b> <b>dog.</b> The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E

5|$|Old Jock (18591871), was a Fox Terrier famous {{during the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. A mostly white dog, he ran briefly with a hunting kennel before {{becoming}} a <b>show</b> <b>dog,</b> most notably with a victory at the show which popularised the Fox Terrier. His main show rivalry was with a dog named Tartar, and along with a dog named Trap, the three were popular sires of the Fox Terrier breed. He was also involved in the early formation of the Jack Russell Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier breeds.|$|E
25|$|Some experts {{insist that}} this breed {{is related to}} the more {{well-known}} Briard and Beauceron, while others believe it shares a common origin with Dutch and Belgian Shepherds. Although the Berger Picard made an appearance at the first French dog show in 1863, the breed's rustic appearance did not lead to popularity as a <b>show</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shibas tend {{to exhibit}} an {{independent}} nature and sometimes <b>show</b> <b>dog</b> aggression. This is more prevalent between female Shibas and {{is influenced by}} the breed's strong prey drive. The Shiba Inu is best in a home without other small dogs or young children, but consistent obedience training and early socialization can make all the difference. The breed also interacts fairly well with cats.|$|E

25|$|Crufts Judge Terry Hannan {{insisted that}} the working German Shepherds are anatomically incorrect, {{and that it is}} the <b>show</b> <b>dog</b> that {{conforms}} to the breed standard. When it was put to the Chairman of the Basset Hound Club that they were breeding deformed congenital dwarfs, he rejected that accusation, claiming that current Basset Hounds look very much like those of the 1800s. When shown a photo of a Basset Hound from sixty years ago, he was less than impressed.|$|E

25|$|The breed was {{introduced}} {{to other parts of}} Europe in the late 19th century and to the United States {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The American Kennel Club (AKC) registered the first Boxer in 1904, and recognized the first Boxer champion, Dampf vom Dom, in 1915. During World War I, the Boxer was co-opted for military work, acting as a valuable messenger dog, pack-carrier, attack dog, and guard dog. It was not until after World War II that the Boxer became popular around the world. Taken home by returning soldiers, they introduced the dog to a wider audience and soon became a favorite as a companion, a <b>show</b> <b>dog,</b> and a guard dog.|$|E

25|$|The English Springer Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on {{the legs and}} tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a <b>show</b> <b>dog</b> {{would not have the}} speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.|$|E
25|$|When DreamWorks {{closed in}} 2005, Keith founded the label <b>Show</b> <b>Dog</b> Nashville, which merged with Universal South Records to become Show Dog-Universal Music in December 2009. He has {{released}} ten studio albums through Show Dog/Show Dog-Universal: 2006's White Trash with Money, 2007's Big Dog Daddy, 2008's That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy, 2009's American Ride, 2010's Bullets in the Gun, 2011's Clancy's Tavern, 2012's Hope on the Rocks, and 2013's Drinks After Work, 2015's 35 MPH Town, 2017's The Bus Songs, {{as well as}} the compilation 35 Biggest Hits in 2008. Keith also made his acting debut in 2006, starring in the film Broken Bridges, and co-starred with comedian Rodney Carrington in the 2008 film Beer for My Horses, inspired by his song of the same name.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Greyhound has, {{since its}} first {{appearance}} as a hunting type and breed, enjoyed a specific degree {{of fame and}} definition in Western literature, heraldry and art as the most elegant or noble companion and hunter of the canine world. In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred Greyhounds, as well as international adoption programs aimed at rescuing and re-homing dogs that were at a surplus to the industry. They have redefined the breed in their almost mutually dependent pursuit of its welfare- as a sporting dog that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement. Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a <b>show</b> <b>dog</b> and pet. There is an emerging pattern visible in recent years (2009–2010) of a significant decline in track betting and multiple track closures in the US, which will have consequences for the origin of future companion Greyhounds and the re-homing of current ex-racers.|$|E

25|$|Charlie and Itchy live in San Francisco as {{guardian}} angels. In each episode, {{they are}} given an assignment by Anabelle but, while they {{try to do the}} right thing, they become caught {{up in the middle of}} awkward situations. Charlie’s callous enemy Carface and his sidekick, Killer (from the first film), also appeared in the series, as did Charlie’s friends: the dog Sasha, the dog-angel Anabelle, and the human kid David. Finally, the series also featured two new characters named Bess, a pure bred award winning <b>show</b> <b>dog</b> and Itchy's love interest, and Belladonna, Anabelle's demonic cousin. The series makes several changes to the second film. For example, Charlie and Sasha were shown as being a couple at the end of the second film, however, in the series, they seem to have never had a first date together; also, Itchy decides to stay in Heaven, but he is alive in the series, although it is explained later in the series why he is on Earth instead of being in Heaven.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{the fictional}} Lad, {{he was not}} {{registered}} with the American Kennel Club and was not a <b>show</b> <b>dog.</b> His pedigree was reportedly lost {{by one of his}} previous owners, though there was no doubt he was a purebred collie.

On July 4, 1917, Lad was entered into a dog show despite having no papers on his pedigree. [...] It was the only show he ever attended and he won the Veteran Cup. As in the novel, Lad was extremely, even [...] "hostile reserved" [...] with strangers, wanting little to do with anyone outside of the family.|$|E

5000|$|The {{popularity}} of dog and pet keeping generated animal fancy. <b>Dog</b> fanciers <b>showed</b> enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding <b>dogs,</b> and <b>showing</b> <b>dogs</b> in various <b>shows.</b> The first <b>dog</b> <b>show</b> {{took place on}} 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs. [...] However, pet owners produced an eagerness to demonstrate their pets as well as have an outlet to compete. [...] Thus, pet animals gradually were included within <b>dog</b> <b>shows.</b> The first large show, which would host one thousand entries, took place in Chelsea in 1863. [...] The Kennel Club was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within <b>dog</b> <b>shows.</b> The development of the Stud Book by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national registry system of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized <b>dog</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|R

500|$|For $150 the {{committee}} bought a two-year-old blue-ribbon-champion <b>show</b> <b>dog</b> named [...] "Lil-Nan's Royal Jacket," [...] named because {{the colors of}} his coat looked like a jacket. This dog was to be renamed [...] "Hoya" [...] like his 1926 predecessor, but refused to respond to any name other than his call name [...] "Jack." [...] Jack lived outside New South Hall in a heated doghouse. In 1967, Royal Jacket retired {{and was replaced by}} a second bulldog who continued under the simple name [...] "Jack." [...] In 1977, as the basketball program gained popularity, the costumed mascot took over duties as Jack. The costume, first worn by student Pat Sheehan, has been updated numerous times, most recently in 2013. Other live bulldogs owned by students at times joined the costumed Jack, including one named Rocky from 1982 to 1985 and one named Daisy in 1997.|$|E
