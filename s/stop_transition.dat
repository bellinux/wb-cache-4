In this paper we investigate what {{can be learned from}} measurements of electrical power at a single point, that of the electrical service for the entire HVAC system. This low-cost measurement has proved in field tests to be capable of detecting the power change when a piece of equipment turns on or off; detecting oscillating equipment power caused by poorly tuned controllers; and detecting suboptimal staging of multiple chillers. Detection of equipment start and <b>stop</b> <b>transitions</b> was strengthened by application of a nonlinear filter that determines the point of median power from a filtering window of user-selected width. A review of electric motor literature indicated that samples of electrical current taken at slightly faster than twice the 60 Hz fundamental can be used to detect several indicators of incipient motor failure.

40|$|Several firing {{patterns}} experimentally {{observed in}} neural populations {{have been successfully}} correlated to animal behavior. Population bursting, hereby regarded as a period of high firing rate followed by a period of quiescence, is typically observed in groups of neurons during behavior. Biophysical membrane-potential models of single cell bursting involve at least three equations. Extending such models to study the collective behavior of neural populations involves thousands of equations and can be very expensive computationally. For this reason, low dimensional population models that capture biophysical aspects of networks are needed. The present paper uses a firing-rate model to study mechanisms that trigger and <b>stop</b> <b>transitions</b> between tonic and phasic population firing. These mechanisms are captured through a two-dimensional system, which can potentially be extended to include interactions between {{different areas of the}} nervous system with a small number of equations. The typical behavior of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the rodent is used as an example to illustrate and interpret our results. The model presented here {{can be used as a}} building block to study interactions between networks of neurons. This theoretical approach may help contextualize and understand the factors involved in regulating burst firing in populations and how it may modulate distinct aspects of behavior.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article, which was a keynote {{presentation}} at the Qualitative Health Research Conference (QHR 2000) in Banff, Canada, {{is to provide a}} historical perspective of qualitative research in nursing over the past 20 years. Van Gennep’s model of rites of passage is used as a heuristic. A discussion of the stages of <b>stopping,</b> waiting, <b>transition,</b> and entry is followed by speculation about the key characteristics necessary for qualitative research to be valued and valuable in the future. In this article, I offer a glance at the evolution of qualitative health research anda projection for the future, at least {{from the perspective of a}} nurse who has engaged in it for the past quarter of a century. First, I will provide a historical per-spective, which may serve to evoke some collective memories and experiences and to illuminate how the past and present shape the future. I have adopted the anthropologist Van Gennep’s (1909 / 1960) model of rites of passage as a way of examining the evolution of qualitative research in health. Van Gennep viewed rites of passage as a series of transitional experiences, marked by ritual events, that includes stages of <b>stopping,</b> waiting, <b>transition,</b> and entry. Although the stages appear sequential, they are not lock step. There are no clear demarcations; rather, there are “cycles and phases, ” “breaks and ruptures ” (Lincoln & Denzin, 1994, p. 575), slipping and sliding in various areas. Van Gennep provided a heu-ristic for thinking about what has happened over time in qualitative health research in general and nursing in particular. After I discuss these stages, I will end with some futuristic speculation about where qualitative research might be in the new millennium...|$|R

The aim was twofold: 1) to identify the electro-cortical correlates of selective and non-selective inhibition processes and 2) to investigate which type of inhibition - selective or not - is required when switching between two bimanual motor patterns. The results revealed that all tasks led to enhanced activation (alpha power) of the left sensorimotor and posterior regions which seems to reflect an overall effort to stop the preferred bimanual in-phase tendency. Each task implied specific functional connectivity reorganizations (beta coherence) between cerebral motor areas, probably reflecting engagement in a new unimanual or bimanual movement...|$|R

50|$|The Delay-Insensitive (DI) {{class is}} the most robust of all {{asynchronous}} circuit delay models. It makes no assumptions on the delay of wires or gates. In this model all transitions on gates or wires must be acknowledged before transitioning again. This condition <b>stops</b> unseen <b>transitions</b> from occurring. In DI circuits any transition on an input to a gate must {{be seen on the}} output of the gate before a subsequent transition on that input is allowed to happen. This forces some input states or sequences to become illegal. For example OR gates must never go into the state where both inputs are one, as the entry and exit from this state will not be seen on the output of the gate. Although this model is very robust, no practical circuits are possible {{due to the lack of}} expressible conditionals in DI circuits. Instead the Quasi-Delay-Insensitive model is the smallest compromise model yet capable of generating useful computing circuits. For this reason circuits are often incorrectly referred to as Delay-Insensitive when they are Quasi Delay-Insensitive.|$|R

In our model, multi-strange hadrons go through chemical freeze-out {{when the system}} reaches some temperature close to the phase <b>transition,</b> <b>stopping</b> to make inelastic collisions, and their abundances are therefore determined only by partonic EOS. At a lower temperature thermal freeze-out takes place where elastic collisions are brought to a halt.

40|$|A new {{graphical}} framework, Abridged Petri Nets (APNs) {{is introduced}} for bottom-up modeling of complex stochastic systems. APNs {{are similar to}} Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) {{in as much as}} they both rely on component-based representation of system state space, in contrast to Markov chains that explicitly model the states of an entire system. In both frameworks, so-called tokens (denoted as small circles) represent individual entities comprising the system; however, SPN graphs contain two distinct types of nodes (called places and transitions) with transitions serving the purpose of routing tokens among places. As a result, a pair of place nodes in SPNs can be linked to each other only via a transient <b>stop,</b> a <b>transition</b> node. In contrast, APN graphs link place nodes directly by arcs (transitions), similar to state space diagrams for Markov chains, and separate transition nodes are not needed. Tokens in APN are distinct and have labels that can assume both discrete values ("colors") and continuous values ("ages"), both of which can change during simulation. Component interactions are modeled in APNs using triggers, which are either inhibitors or enablers (the inhibitors' opposites). Hierarchical construction of APNs rely on using stacks (layers) of submodels with automatically matching color policies. As a result, APNs provide at least the same modeling power as SPNs, but, as demonstrated by means of several examples, the resulting models are often more compact and transparent, therefore facilitating more efficient performance evaluation of complex systems.
