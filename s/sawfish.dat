5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, <b>sawfish,</b> guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth <b>sawfish,</b> manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sawfishes</b> have {{declined}} drastically and few records are recent in several regions. For example, <b>sawfishes</b> were once relatively {{common in the}} northeast Atlantic off West Africa, but few recent sightings are reported.|$|R
50|$|Sclerorhynchiformes is {{an order}} of extinct batoids with long, {{serrated}} rostrums {{very similar to those}} of sawsharks and <b>sawfishes.</b> While they are neither, they are more closely related to <b>sawfishes,</b> and are included alongside them in the clade Pristiorajea.|$|R
50|$|Although {{they are}} similar in appearances, sawsharks are {{distinct}} from <b>sawfishes.</b> <b>Sawfishes</b> have a much larger maximum size, lack barbels, have evenly sized rather than alternating sawteeth, and have gill slits on their undersurface {{rather than on the}} side of the head.|$|R
25|$|The {{bull shark}} {{is the best}} known of 43 species of elasmobranch in 10 genera and four {{families}} to have been reported in fresh water. Other species that enter rivers include the stingrays (Dasyatidae, Potamotrygonidae and others) and <b>sawfish</b> (Pristidae). Some skates (Rajidae), smooth dogfishes (Triakidae), and sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) regularly enter estuaries.|$|E
25|$|Some {{fish and}} {{amphibians}} {{found in the}} Sundarbans are <b>sawfish,</b> butter fish, electric ray, common carp, silver carp, barb, river eels, starfish, king crab, fiddler crab, hermit crab, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipping frogs, common toads and tree frogs. One particularly interesting fish is the mudskipper, a gobioid that {{climbs out of the}} water into mudflats and even climbs trees.|$|E
25|$|Large animals {{taken by}} adult {{crocodiles}} include sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus), kangaroos, humans, orangutans (Pongo ssp.), dingos (Canis lupus dingo), tigers (Panthera tigris), and large bovines, such as banteng (Bos javanicus), water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), and gaur (Bos gaurus). However, larger animals are taken only sporadically {{due to the}} fact only large males typically attack very large prey and large ungulates and other sizeable wild mammals are only sparsely distributed in this species' range, outside of a few key areas such as the Sundarbans. Off-setting this, goats, water buffalo and wild boar/pigs have been introduced to many of the areas occupied by saltwater crocodiles and returned to feral states to varying degrees and thus can amply support large crocodiles. Any type of domestic livestock, such as chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), sheep (Ovis aries), pigs, horses (Equus ferus caballus) and cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), and domesticated animals/pets may be eaten if given the opportunity. As a seagoing species, the saltwater crocodile also preys on a variety of saltwater bony fish and other marine animals, including sea snakes, sea turtles, sea birds, dugongs (Dugong dugon), rays (including large <b>sawfish),</b> and small sharks. Most witnessed acts of predation on marine animals have occurred in coastal waters or within sight of land, with female sea turtles and their babies caught during mating season when the turtles are closer to shore and bull sharks being the only largish shark with a strong propensity to patrol brackish and fresh waters. However, there is evidence that saltwater crocodiles do hunt while out in the open seas, based upon the remains of pelagic fishes that dwell only miles away from land being found in their stomachs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{classification}} of batoids is currently undergoing revision; however, molecular evidence refutes {{the hypothesis that}} skates and rays are derived sharks. Nelson's 2006 Fishes of the World recognizes four orders. The Mesozoic Sclerorhynchoidea are basal or incertae sedis; they show features of the Rajiformes but have snouts resembling those of <b>sawfishes.</b> However, evidence indicates they are probably the sister group to <b>sawfishes</b> ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sawfishes</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with sawsharks (order Pristiophoriformes), or the extinct sclerorhynchids (order Sclerorhynchiformes) which have a similar appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sawfishes,</b> {{also known}} as {{carpenter}} sharks, are a family of rays characterized by a long, narrow, flattened rostrum, or nose extension, lined with sharp transverse teeth, arranged {{in a way that}} resembles a saw. Several species of <b>sawfishes</b> can grow to about 7 m. The family as a whole is largely unknown and little studied. The Pristidae are the only living family within the order Pristiformes, whose name comes from the πρίστης.|$|R

Areas farther offshore are protected within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding [...] to a depth of [...] The offshore waters harbor brown pelicans, magnificent frigatebirds, brown boobies, particularly around the offshore lights, [...] and pelagic birds such as shearwaters and petrels. Whales in offshore waters are rare, but can include right whales, humpback whales, sperm whales, fin whales and sei whales, all of them endangered. The smalltooth <b>sawfish</b> is similarly rare in park waters and endangered. Threatened coral species include elkhorn and staghorn corals, as well as pillar coral, listed as endangered in Florida.|$|E

50|$|Wedgefishes are rays of {{the family}} Rhinidae, {{comprising}} ten species in three genera. Classified in the order Rhinopristiformes along with guitarfishes and <b>sawfishes,</b> they have also been known as giant guitarfishes or sharkfin guitarfishes.|$|R
2500|$|Further, Lisp dialects {{are used}} as {{scripting}} languages in many applications, with the best-known being Emacs Lisp in the Emacs editor, AutoLisp and later Visual Lisp in AutoCAD, Nyquist in Audacity, Scheme in LilyPond. The potential small size of a useful Scheme interpreter makes it particularly popular for embedded scripting. Examples include SIOD and TinyScheme, {{both of which have}} been successfully embedded in the GIMP image processor under the generic name [...] "Script-fu". LIBREP, a Lisp interpreter by John Harper originally based on the Emacs Lisp language, has been embedded in the <b>Sawfish</b> window manager.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} works by Rockman in the early 1990s, {{including}} Barnyard Scene (1990), Jungle Fever (1991), The Trough (1992), [...] and Biosphere: Laboratory (1993), use dark humor in depicting different species mating with one another. [...] In Barnyard Scene, Rockman depicts a raccoon mating with a rooster, and Jungle Fever shows a praying mantis mating with a chipmunk. [...] In the Biosphere series of paintings, Rockman alludes to the Biosphere 2 project in Arizona and envisions {{a situation where the}} Earth has become too toxic for human life, so life only exists in strangely mutated forms inside geodesic-dome structures. [...] Biosphere uses references from science fiction cinema, particularly the opening scene of the 1971 film Silent Running, as well as Stanley Kubrick's 2001, and Ridley Scott's Alien. [...] Biosphere: The Ocean (1994), influenced by H. R. Giger's work, depicts a shark with a long, bionic <b>sawfish</b> beak, suited for tearing through its food.|$|E
2500|$|The head is {{as large}} as an {{ordinary}} flour barrel, and has {{the shape of a}} sea lion head. The neck, if the creature may be said to have a neck, is of the same diameter as the body. The mouth is on the under side of the head and is protected by two tentacle tubes about eight inches in diameter and about 30 feet long. These tubes resemble an elephant's trunk and obviously were used to clutch in a sucker like fashion any object within their reach. Another tube or tentacle of the same dimensions stands out {{on the top of the}} head. [...] Two others, one on each side, protrude from beyond the monster's neck, and extend fully 15 feet along the body and beyond the tail. The tail, which is separated and jagged with cutting points for several feet, is flanked with two more tentacles of the same dimensions as the others and 30 feet long. The eyes are under the back of the mouth instead of over it. This specimen is so badly cut up by sharks and <b>sawfish</b> that only the stumps of the tentacles remain, but pieces of them were found strewn for some distance on the beach, showing that the animal had a fierce battle with its foes before it was disabled and beached by the surf.|$|E
50|$|These sclerorhynchiform <b>sawﬁshes</b> {{are only}} known by {{isolated}} vertebra and rostral spines. On {{the basis of}} fossil findings they are considered large, bottom-dwelling fishes, mainly inhabiting shallow marine habitats, {{but they were also}} powerful swimmers.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic animals. Various unnamed fish, octopi {{and other}} marine animals serve as minor {{characters}} throughout the series. They {{are often used}} as tools by the main characters {{in a manner similar}} to The Flintstones. For example, <b>sawfishes</b> double as power saws.|$|R
40|$|Glyphis {{sharks and}} pristid <b>sawfishes</b> are {{globally}} threatened. While some populations still exist in northern Australia, their distributions are poorly quantified. We used catch records from commercial fisheries and independent surveys {{to estimate the}} broad distribution and relative abundances of 2 Glyphis sharks (G. glyphis and G. garricki) and 4 pristid <b>sawfishes</b> (Pristis pristis, P. zijsron, P. clavata and Anoxypristis cuspidata) along the coast, estuaries and river systems of the Northern Territory, Australia. Coarse-scale catch data and records from commercial fishing logbooks that report encounters with Threatened, Endangered and Protected species confirm that small, fragmented populations are distributed across the Northern Territory coastline and suggest limited fishery interactions, although underreporting might occur.

2500|$|... 1925: On 21 August, the Ilkley Gazette {{received}} a letter of complaint that the collection was just a curiosity shop, and {{this led to the}} reduction of the collection in favour of its local heritage items. [...] However the letter did include a description of the exhibits of the time. [...] There was the Ellison collection of classified geological specimens. [...] There were photographs of the local great and good, a stuffed albatross and Japanese armour. There were valuable coins, a Queen Victoria mug, and the Anglo-Saxon cross shaft carvings, unlabelled. [...] The [...] "famous Roman triple vase [...] found near the Assembly Hall in Weston Road" [...] was still there with a serpent, boomerangs and a <b>sawfish.</b> The existence of superfluous paintings was bemoaned, with special attention being paid to the portraits of the Rombalds Moor hermit, and of James Fletcher (his name now changed to Metcalfe) the local 18th century blind fiddler - this latter was in the Museum's foundation collection, and possibly held some sentimental value for Ilkley residents. [...] It might also be worth noting that Mr Woodward, the classifier of the Roman artefacts, was absent in Greece when this article was written - so there may have been some political element involved in the publication of this piece. [...] The primary complaint is that items were intermixed and were not all labelled or classified, and the secondary complaint is that there was insufficient space to separate and classify them all properly. It appears well-intentioned, but there are possibly intimations of an administrative power-struggle in the background.|$|E

40|$|DNA was {{obtained}} from the skin tissue of a high proportion (198 / 236) of dry rostra collected during the past - 30 years from the <b>sawfishes</b> Pristis microdon, P. clavata, P. zijsron and Anoxypristis cuspidate. DNA obtained from the dry rostra was usually either non-degraded, or only partly degraded, and was of a quality whereby a 465 - 468 -bp portion of the mtDNA 12 S rRNA gene could be PCR-amplified. These findings demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} use the dry rostra, which are generally readily available, as a source of DNA in conservation genetic studies of <b>sawfishes.</b> Such studies are needed for the development of effective conservation strategies for these critically endangered species, but would otherwise be greatly constrained by the difficulties of obtaining samples from sufficient numbers of living sawfishe...|$|R
50|$|Though {{few details}} of their ecology are {{precisely}} known, <b>sawfishes</b> tend to prefer shallow, muddy, brackish water, spending {{most of their time}} on or near the seabed, only visiting the surface occasionally. Juveniles are common in very shallow waters, and adults can be found at depths of 40 m or more.|$|R
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth guitarfish and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) and skates (Rajidae) while others have them basal to all other rays except <b>sawfishes</b> (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the <b>sawfishes</b> rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that {{it is part of}} the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina).|$|R
60|$|We {{pioneers of}} light tackle {{are out of}} the woods now. There was a pride in a fight against odds--a pride of silence, and a fight of example and {{expressed}} standards and splendid achievements. But now we have followers, disciples who have learned, who have profited, who have climbed to the heights, and we are no longer alone. Hence we can scatter the news to the four winds and ask for the comradeship of kindred spirits, of men who love the sea and the stream and the gameness of a fish. The Open Sesame to our clan is just that love, and an ambition to achieve higher things. Who fishes just to kill? At Long Key last winter I met two self-styled sportsmen. They were eager to convert me to what they claimed was the dry-fly class angling of the sea. And it was to jab harpoons and spears into porpoises and manatee and <b>sawfish,</b> and be dragged about in their boat. The height of their achievements that winter had been the harpooning of several <b>sawfish,</b> each of which gave birth to a little one while being fought on the harpoon! Ye gods! It would never do to record my utterances.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} <b>sawfish</b> is {{the dwarf}} <b>sawfish</b> (P. clavata), which grows to 1.4 m, {{much smaller than}} the others. The largest species seem to be the large-tooth <b>sawfish</b> (P. microdon), the Leichhardt's <b>sawfish</b> (P. perotteti), and the common <b>sawfish</b> (P. pristis), which can all reach about 7 m in length. One southern <b>sawfish</b> was recorded as weighing 2455 kg. Such massive specimens that survive long enough to approach their maximum size and age are believed to have lifespans of about 51 years.|$|E

50|$|Sclerorhynchus is an extinct genus of {{primitive}} batoidean {{that lived in}} the Cretaceous. The namesake of the Mesozoic suborder Sclerorhynchoidea, it is not quite clear whether they were closer to the Rajiformes (skates and rays) or to the Pristiformes (<b>sawfishes).</b> Its fossils have been found mainly around the Mediterranean region. The related Ganopristis might actually belong in Sclerorhynchus.|$|R
50|$|While {{popular in}} public aquaria, <b>sawfishes</b> are {{difficult}} to maintain because of their size. They likely require a variety of habitats, including both marine and fresh water to complete their lifecycles. Consequently, captive breeding has resulted in very little success, so far limited to a single species (P. pectinata) at a single aquarium (Atlantis Paradise Island).|$|R
40|$|Like {{many of the}} earth’s natural resources, {{humankind}} has mistakenly {{viewed the}} ocean as having an infinite supply of reserves to satisfy our needs and wants. This has made the waters of our globe vulnerable to overexploitation and, as a consequence, many ocean species are now declining at an alarming and unsustainable rate. The <b>sawfishes</b> are one such group of species, and are now recognised as being among the most threatened marine species, facing a rapid descent to extinction if immediate action is not taken to address the severity of their plight. The wonderful morphology of these species, with their long, highly distinctive tooth-nosed snout, makes them a truly striking and iconic image of our seas. Unfortunately, this unique feature has sadly been the cause of their own ruin, being both easily entangled in net and highly-prized for medicinal and cultural purposes and sold as curios for the tourist trade. Other threats to the <b>sawfishes</b> are common to many marine species and include overfishing and habitat destruction. As a result, <b>sawfishes</b> are {{now one of the}} most threatened families of marine species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™. Conservation must be built on sound knowledge and scientific research. The IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) is a science-based network of more than 8, 000 volunteer experts from over 160 countries. SSC members are deployed in over 130 Specialist Groups, and it is one of these groups – the IUCN Shark Specialist Group – that has prioritised <b>sawfishes</b> for urgent conservation action and has ably led the way in designing a focused global strategy to provide the best possible scientific basis to secure the survival of these iconic species. The SSC Conservation Action Plan series {{has been one of the}} world’s most respected sources of information on species and their conservation needs. Since the mid- 1980 s, the SSC has published more than 60 Action Plans for some of the world’s most charismatic species. Recently, the SSC has developed a new process better able to link science and management for the effective delivery of conservation action. The formerly known Action Plans are now known a...|$|R
