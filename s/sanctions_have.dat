25|$|Over the years, <b>sanctions</b> <b>have</b> taken {{a serious}} toll on Iran's economy and people. Since 1979, the United States has led {{international}} efforts to use sanctions to influence Iran's policies, including Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Western governments fear is intended for developing the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Iran counters that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, including generating electricity and medical purposes.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{sanctions}} against Iran, {{such as the}} embargo against Iranian crude oil, have affected the economy. <b>Sanctions</b> <b>have</b> led to a steep fall {{in the value of}} the rial, and as of April 2013, one US dollar is worth 36,000 rial, compared with 16,000 in early 2012. In 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program that removed the main sanctions pertaining to Iran's nuclear program by 2016.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>sanctions</b> <b>have</b> {{caused a}} shift in Iran’s trading {{partners}} from West to East, scientific collaboration has remained largely oriented towards the West. Between 2008 and 2014, Iran’s top partners for scientific collaboration were the USA, Canada, the UK and Germany, in that order. Iranian scientists co-authored almost twice as many articles with {{their counterparts in the}} USA (6 377) as with their next-closest collaborators in Canada (3 433) and the UK (3 318). Iranian and U.S. scientists have collaborated on a number of projects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sanctions</b> <b>have</b> reduced Iran's {{access to}} {{products}} {{needed for the}} oil and energy sectors, have prompted many oil companies to withdraw from Iran, and have also caused a decline in oil production due to reduced access to technologies needed to improve their efficiency. According to Undersecretary of State William Burns, Iran may be annually losing as much as $60 billion in energy investment. Many international companies have also been reluctant {{to do business with}} Iran for fear of losing access to larger Western markets. As well as restricting export markets, the <b>sanctions</b> <b>have</b> reduced Iran's oil income by increasing the costs of repatriating revenues in complicated ways that sidestep the sanctions; Iranian analysts estimate the budget deficit for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, which in Iran ends in late March, at between $30bn to $50bn. The effects of U.S. sanctions include expensive basic goods for Iranian citizens, and an aging and increasingly unsafe civil aircraft fleet. According to the Arms Control Association, the international arms embargo against Iran is slowly reducing Iran's military capabilities, largely due to its dependence on Russian and Chinese military assistance. The only substitute is to find compensatory measures requiring more time and money, and which are less effective. According to at least one analyst (Fareed Zakaria), the market for imports in Iran is dominated by state enterprises and state-friendly enterprises, because the way to get around the sanctions is smuggling, and smuggling requires strong connections with the government. This has weakened Iranian civil society and strengthened the state.|$|E
500|$|The NCAA {{found that}} Bush had {{received}} gifts from two sports agents {{from at least}} December 2004, including a limousine ride to the 2005 Heisman Trophy presentation and a rent-free home.

The currency collapse has largely overtaken the findings of an IMF forecast, released in October 2012, which Iran would return to economic growth in 2013, after a small decline in 2012. An Economist Intelligence Unit assessment published in late 2012 indicates Iran’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) likely contracted about 3% in 2012 and will contract an additional 1.2% in 2013.
