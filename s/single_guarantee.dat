RMA uses the futures prices on harvest-times listed in the commodity exchange markets, to determine the prices. Combining the future price with farmer's average production gives the estimated revenue of the farmer. Accessing the futures market offers enables revenue protection even before the crop planted. There is a <b>single</b> <b>guarantee</b> for {{a certain number of}} dollars. The policy pays an indemnity if the combination of the actual yield and the cash settlement price in the futures market is less than the guarantee. In the United States, the program is called Crop Revenue Coverage. Crop-revenue insurance covers the decline in price that occurs during the crop's growing season.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} for robust optimization that relaxes the standard notion of robustness by allowing the decision maker to vary the protection level in a smooth way across the uncertainty set. We apply our approach {{to the problem of}} maximizing the expected value of a payoff function when the underlying distribution is ambiguous and therefore robustness is relevant. Our primary objective is to develop this framework and relate it to the standard notion of robustness, which deals with only a <b>single</b> <b>guarantee</b> across one uncertainty set. First, we show that our approach connects closely to the theory of convex risk measures. We show that the complexity of this approach is equivalent to that of solving a small number of standard robust problems. We then investigate the conservatism benefits and downside probability guarantees implied by this approach and compare to the standard robust approach. Finally, we illustrate theme thodology on an asset allocation example consisting of historical market data over a 25 -year investment horizon and find in every case we explore that relaxing standard robustness with soft robustness yields a seemingly favorable risk-return trade-off: each case results in a higher out-of-sample expected return for a relatively minor degradation of out-of-sample downside performance. © 2010 INFORMS...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we focus}} on the {{challenge}} of verifying the correctness of molecular implementations of abstract chemical reaction networks, where operation in a well-mixed "soup" of molecules is stochastic, asynchronous, concurrent, and often involves multiple intermediate steps in the implementation, parallel pathways, and side reactions. This problem relates to the verification of Petri nets, but existing approaches are not sufficient for providing a <b>single</b> <b>guarantee</b> covering an infinite set of possible initial states (molecule counts) and an infinite state space potentially explored by the system given any initial state. We address these issues by formulating a new theory of pathway decomposition that provides an elegant formal basis for comparing chemical reaction network implementations, and we present an algorithm that computes this basis. Our theory naturally handles certain situations that commonly arise in molecular implementations, such as what we call "delayed choice," that are not easily accommodated by other approaches. We further show how pathway decomposition can be combined with weak bisimulation to handle a wider class that includes most currently known enzyme-free DNA implementation techniques. We anticipate that our notion of logical equivalence between chemical reaction network implementations will be valuable for other molecular implementations such as biochemical enzyme systems, and perhaps even more broadly in concurrency theory.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} and {{explores the}} connections between risk theory and robust optimization. Specifically, we {{show that there is}} a one-to-one correspondence between a class of risk measures known as coherent risk measures and uncertainty sets in robust optimization. An important consequence of this is that one may construct uncertainty sets, which are the critical primitives of robust optimization, using decision-maker risk preferences. In addition, we show some results on the geometry of such uncertainty sets. We also consider a more general class of risk measures known as convex risk measures, and show that these risk measures lead to a more flexible approach to robust optimization. In particular, these models allow one to specify not only the values of the uncertain parameters for which feasibility should be ensured, but also the degree of feasibility. We show that traditional, robust optimization models are a special case of this framework. As a result, this framework implies a family of probability guarantees on infeasibility at different levels, as opposed to standard, robust approaches which generally imply a <b>single</b> <b>guarantee.</b> (cont.) Furthermore, we illustrate the performance of these risk measures on a real-world portfolio optimization application and show promising results that our methodology can, in some cases, yield significant improvements in downside risk protection at little or no expense in expected performance over traditional methods. While we develop this framework for tile case of linear optimization under uncertainty, we show how to extend the results to optimization over more general cones. Moreover, our methodology is scenario-based, and(we prove a new rate of convergence result on a specific class of convex risk measures. Finally, we consider a multi-stage problem under uncertainty, specifically optimization of quadratic functions over un-certain linear systems. Although the theory of risk measures is still undeveloped with respect to dynamic optimization problems. we show that a set-based model of uncertainty yields a tractable approach to this problem in the presence of constraints. Moreover, we are able to derive a near-closed form solution for this approach and prove new probability guarantees on its resulting performance. by David Benjamin Brown. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Bouchut, Dumbreck, and Heidfeld in the No. 5 and Lagorce, Lamy, and Schneider in the No. 6 entries would have to pre-qualify for the event, while No. 4 was free to use the pre-qualifying session for testing purposes. Pre-qualifying involved all 62 entry applicant teams setting lap times over a long session. The final entry for Le Mans would be made of 48 cars, combining guaranteed entries and the fastest cars in pre-qualifying within their respective classes; the prototype category, combining LMP and LMGTP cars, only allowed 28 cars from 31 entries. Competitors in the prototype category for 1999 included factory-supported LMGTP programmes from Toyota and Audi, and LMP entries from Nissan, BMW, Audi, and Panoz. Toyota set the fastest pre-qualifying time overall, followed by Panoz and BMW. Mercedes No. 6 was the sixth fastest car, while Nos. 4 and 5 were 14th and 15th respectively.

40|$|After the {{annexation}} of Austria to Greater Germany in March 1938, Jews struggled to emigrate, {{realizing that the}} Nazi takeover and the virulent anti-Semitism that emerged would threaten their existence. American consuls stationed in Austria played an integral role in emigration efforts because of their implementation of U. S. immigration policy. Diplomatic papers and documents reveal that American consuls in Austria were shocked by {{the annexation}} and ensuing pogroms, and thus, responded humanely to Jewish plight, allowing as many Jews as legally met the restrictions to obtain visas. Consul General John Wiley strongly advocated this humanitarian approach, which continued to be implemented after his departure. A visa applicant's successful emigration relied {{not only on the}} policies upheld by the American consul, but also on the help of agencies, access to immigration information, and the applicant's response to the situation. Three agencies were fundamental in facilitating Jewish emigration: American Friends Service Committee, Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien [the Jewish community], and Adolf Eichmann's Zentralstelle [Central Office for Jewish Emigration]. These agencies helped assist emigration by providing monetary support or the necessary paperwork. Given that there was no <b>single</b> <b>guaranteed</b> way by which a refugee could emigrate, the refugees' examination of possibilities and gathering of immigration information was critical to successful emigration. Additionally, men and women's varying responses to the urgency of the political situation further complicated the decision to remain or pursue immigration. Four reasons contributed to making Vienna a unique location from which to pursue emigration: Austria's annexation to Germany, the size of the Viennese Jewish community, the implementation of the conveyor-system of receiving immigration documents at the Zentralstelle and the leniency with which American consuls interpreted immigration policy. As a result, two-thirds of all Austrian Jews emigrated from Vienna and found refuge throughout the world. Wiley's humanitarian policies set a precedent which allowed as many Jews as was legally possible to leave, and created a middle ground where American Foreign Service Officers could respond sympathetically without jeopardizing their careers.

Its implementation involves file domain partitioning, and having the right partitioning is a key to achieving high-performance I/O. As modern parallel file systems maintain data consistency by adopting a distributed file locking mechanism to avoid centralized lock management, different locking protocols can have significant impact to the degree of parallelism of a given file domain partitioning method. In this paper, we propose dynamic file partitioning methods that adapt according to the underlying locking protocols in the parallel file systems and evaluate the performance of four partitioning methods under two locking protocols. By running multiple I/O benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that no <b>single</b> partitioning <b>guarantees</b> the best performance.
