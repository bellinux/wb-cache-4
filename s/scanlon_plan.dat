50|$|The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>plan</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} used {{by a variety of}} public and private companies for many decades. These plans combine leadership, total workforce education, and widespread employee participation with a reward system linked to d/or organization performance. The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>plan</b> is a gainsharing program in which employees share in pre-established cost savings, based upon employee effort. Formal employee participation is necessary with the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan,</b> as well as periodic progress reporting and an incentive formula.|$|E
5000|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} has been conducted on the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan.</b> Scanlon research was conducted at MIT, Michigan State University, The American Productivity Center, and The Scanlon Leadership Network. Dr. Mike Schuster, and Dr. Dow Scott have published many papers and chapters on the results of the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan.</b> The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> has also been featured in The Compensation Handbook and many articles and chapters by the World of Work (American Compensation Association). In earlier studies the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> could be compared to the two other [...] "named" [...] gainsharing plans and the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> was found to produce higher levels of employee involvement. Scanlon Plans increase job satisfaction, financial literacy, engagement, financial performance, quality, and on time delivery. In studies of the Sears Scanlon Goalsharing plans, Scanlon Units were found to have higher levels of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and higher financial performance than control units. Most research today lumps Scanlon Plans into research on gainsharing as almost all plans are now customized.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> {{especially}} as practiced by Carl Frost with the Scanlon Roadmap installation process {{takes time to}} implement. It {{is not unusual for}} an organization of 200-300 people to spend a year involving, researching, and creating a plan. The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> is leader dependent. It requires top level involvement in creating the mandate and building commitment. It requires a servant-leader—someone who is willing to develop others. Since Scanlon Plans are relatively rare it can become difficult to find leaders with experience in knowing how to lead in a Scanlon organization. The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> requires Theory Y assumptions among most of the managers to be successful. (Workers want to work, the average employee has great creativity and ingenuity if given a chance to express them, etc.) Once a plan is installed it requires time and energy to maintain. A <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> also requires a great deal of training and development of employees. In Organizations with large part-time staff and/or turnover it can become difficult to develop employees sufficiently. The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> requires a great deal of sharing of information. Most Scanlon organizations are [...] "open-book" [...] organizations. This can be a disadvantage for organizations that prefer or require greater secrecy. While the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> can lead organizational change once a plan is installed and becomes {{a way of life for}} an organization it is difficult to go back. Employees like the information sharing, high involvement, equitable culture Scanlon creates. This can make it difficult in Scanlon organizations to acquire or merge with non Scanlon organizations. Some Scanlon organizations have become rigid especially in regard to how the bonus is calculated and have resisted needed change. The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> is an organizational wide system. It requires an organizational unit that makes sense to employees. For example, a plant, or a self-sufficient unit, or a store, could develop a <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan.</b> An individual, team or department could not. While Scanlon plans have been installed in small and large organizations, very small organizations (30 or less employees) tend to not need the structure that Scanlon provides. Very large organizations may find it difficult to create the collaboration that Scanlon requires.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} labor/management {{teams that}} Scanlon created {{did not include}} a bonus. Early on they were created to save distressed companies or to encourage war production. Scanlon believed that much distrust existed between labor and management because {{there was a lack of}} information sharing. He believed that, given information about the company and a chance to participate in helping solve problems, the average worker would contribute to the success of the company. Scanlon did not believe in what he called [...] "the economic man theory." [...] Piece work systems and ideas about human motivation at the time reduced the worker to something that was thought to be only motivated by money. Scanlon believed that people were motivated by many things besides money—a chance to make a difference, pride, fellowship, etc. Eventually Scanlon included an organizational bonus system as part of the plan. Often these systems replaced piece work systems that were common at that time. Douglas McGregor would study Scanlon's clients to develop his Theory Y vs Theory X. <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plans</b> were considered one of the best ways to develop Theory Y.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scanlon</b> {{described}} a <b>plan</b> by which Abramoff {{would help to}} build the client base of Scanlon's firm, Campaign Capitol Strategies, up to at least $3 million per year. At some point, Scanlon would use his contacts in the public affairs industry to get the firm acquired at a price of three times the revenue, and Scanlon and Abramoff would split the profits. This is considered by investigators to {{be the beginning of}} what Abramoff and Scanlon would refer to as [...] "gimme five".|$|R
50|$|Financial {{incentives}} {{under the}} <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> are ordinarily offered to all employees including managers and sometimes executives. In several small Scanlon organizations the bonus was even offered to key suppliers.|$|E
50|$|Fred Lesieur {{carried on}} the Scanlon Conferences at MIT until the 1980s. He {{consulted}} and implemented Scanlon Plans widely. Dana corporation was in the top 100 Best Places to work while they had their Lesieur <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{greatest}} misconceptions of the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> {{is that it can}} be defined by the way the bonus is calculated. Historically, the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>plan</b> bonus was calculated on the historical ratio of labor cost to sales value of production. Scanlon believed that it was very important that employees understand how the bonus is calculated and this method was easy for employees to understand. He felt that profit sharing as a way to create a bonus was fine as long as everyone understood [...] "profits." [...] He concluded that most don't understand how profits are calculated. Today Scanlon Plans have been created that use only financial measures (like profits), operational measures (like quality) Combinations of financial measures and operational measures and no bonus at all.|$|E
5000|$|At MIT, Scanlon {{continued}} {{to develop his}} ideas about labor/management cooperation and organizational improvement. It was at MIT that the term [...] "Scanlon Plan" [...] was coined by accident. There were two conferences going on at MIT and signs were needed to guide attendees. Thus those headed to Scanlon's event were directed to the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> and the name stuck.|$|E
5000|$|Scanlon's {{work with}} the Admanson Company was {{featured}} in a Life Magazine article [...] "Every man a Capitalist" [...] by John Chamberlain, December 1946. His work with Lapointe was featured in a Fortune article [...] "Enterprise for Everyman" [...] by John Davenport, January 1950. Time Magazine wrote that Joe Scanlon was the most sought after consultant {{of his time in}} [...] "Management: The <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan,</b> September 1955.|$|E
5000|$|Scanlon Plans, {{unlike most}} other gainsharing systems, are {{installed}} using a high engagement process. The process was labelled the Roadmap by Carl Frost. It {{begins with an}} exploration of Scanlon by the top leader of the organization considering a <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan.</b> If the leader feels the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> makes sense for his/her organization a [...] "mandate" [...] is drafted. The mandate explains why change is necessary. The top leader then brings together the top leadership team and explains the mandate and asks the following questions. 1) Is there a compelling need to change? 2) Are we able, willing and ready? 3)Can the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> help us to meet the mandate? The top leader asks for a secret ballot vote to proceed. Usually unless the vote is unanimous the Scanlon Roadmap does not proceed further. If the top team is ready, willing and able, they explain the mandate and Scanlon Roadmap to the organization's Middle Managers and Supervisors. They asks the entire management team to support the mandate and the Scanlon Roadmap. Usually unless 80% of the entire management team supports Scanlon by secret ballot the roadmap does not go any further. The Managers and Supervisors along with the top Leadership Team then explain the mandate and Scanlon Roadmap to the entire workforce. Again a secret ballot is taken and unless 80-90% of the workforce support the Mandate and the roadmap the process stops. This top down approach coupled with multiple secret ballots assures the following: 1) Top level commitment and support 2) A reason for Scanlon and change 3) Alignment of the entire management team including front line supervisors 4) Understanding and commitment by the entire work force ...|$|E
50|$|Because the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>plan</b> was {{originated}} {{during the}} crisis of depression, it was initially presumed that it was for failing companies. However it later got instituted in Adamson Company to improve a healthy situation. Scanlon Plans have been successfully installed in Manufacturing, Retail, Health care, Financial Services and Telecommunications. There is no central registry of Scanlon Plans and the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> was not copyrighted or trademarked. Scanlon Plans were implemented in at least the following organizations: Adamson, Advanced Business Graphics, Atlantic Automotive, ARaymond, Atwood, American Tape, Beth Israel Hospital, Bradford, Bridgestone-Firestone, Briggs & Stratton, Canon, Dana, ELGA, Fairchild-Burns, Ferro, Harley Davidson,Herman Miller, Hitachi Magnetics, Hron Signs, ITT, Kysor-Cadillac, Lapointe, Landscape Forms, Limerick Veterinary Hospital, Lorin, Magna-Donnelly, Martin-Marietta, Meier, Michigan Bell, Motorola, National Manufacturing, Neelon Castings, Nicholas Plastics, Pacific Cast, Parker Pen, Pohlman, Quality Container, Raynor, S & L Plastics, Sara Lee, Sears, SGS Tool Company, Sligh, Spring, Thermatron, Thomson-Shore, TG Fluids, Trans-Matic, United Building Centers, US Vision, Watermark Credit Union, Wescast, Westling, Wolverine Worldwide, and Xaloy. Thus Scanlon plans have been utilized both {{as a means of}} saving firms from economic collapse as well as a mechanism for reducing labor and production costs and to provide increased worker participation in organization whose immediate economic situation is not bad. They have been installed in union and nonunion organizations, for profit and not for profits and large as well as small organizations.|$|E
50|$|Scanlon Plans {{that follow}} the Frost Roadmap process find the process {{develops}} employees and {{allows them to}} manage, and change their plans with little need for outside expertise or consulting expenses. Also since the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> is an open-source system there is no cost to use the process, name or ideas. The main cost {{is the cost of}} employee time in the development and maintenance of the Plan. Most Plan bonuses are self funded from the gains that are created. This allows an organization to increase employee engagement and organizational performance and pay a bonus while generating over a 125% percent return.|$|E
50|$|Two of Scanlon's colleagues {{carried on}} his work - Fred Lesieur who he had met at the Lapointe Tool Company and Dr. Carl F. Frost at MIT. Carl Frost would take the ideas west to Michigan State University which became a center for Scanlon thought and {{practice}} for many years. Frost would also create the Frost/Scanlon Principles of Identity, Participation, Equity and Competence. Frost's clients would create the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> Association which today is the Scanlon Leadership Network, a nonprofit Network of Organizations with Scanlon Plans. Frost worked with Herman Miller, Donnelly, Motorola, and Beth Israel Hospital all {{who were in the}} top 50 Best Places to Work while they were practicing Scanlon methods.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>Scanlon</b> <b>plan</b> {{was instituted}} by Joseph N. Scanlon (1899-1956) a steelworker, cost accountant, {{professional}} boxer, local union president, Acting Director of the Steelworkers Research Department, and Lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As the local union {{president of the}} steel mill {{in which he was}} employed, he witnessed the depressed economy of the 1930s. His co-workers wanted increased wages, his company had barely survived the depression. He was advised by the Steelworkers International {{to see if he could}} harness the energy and talents of the workers to save the company. Scanlon set up joint union/management committees to solve organizational problems. The committees became successful and Scanlon was soon asked to help other organizations in trouble. His success led him to become Acting Director of the Steelworker's Research Department. Scanlon became active in setting up many labor/management committees in support of War production for WWII.|$|E

40|$|Since its inception, the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> has {{attracted}} considerable attention.

Despite the many benefits attributed to the Plan, it is the position of this paper that: (1) there have been few well designed studies that can assess the multiple impacts of the Plan, and (2) there has been little theoretical elaboration of models that would aid in predicting, the impact of the Plan in different types of organizations over time.

40|$|The three {{elements}} of this evaluation model: worker needs and goals, {{the level of the}} economy, {{and the nature of the}} technology, are ordinarily interrelated and strongly influence the degree to which a particular level of worker participation in management is accepted by the workers, persists and achieves the economic and psychological rewards expected by worker participation. Thus in scarcity level economies, using mass production methods, the workers are ordinarily operating at the level of physiological and safety needs and only very limited participation schemes like the <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan</b> have any chance of success. Shop floor or enterprise control would probably result in decreased income for the workers and would be rejected by them. On the other hand, in affluent economies, in enterprises devoted to the production of electronic components, the highly educated workers operate at the level of social and possibly self-actualizing needs and a very advanced participation scheme is essential to the full motivation of the workers and maximum productivity. Between these two, there are, of course a wide range and variety of work settings and the author suggests that for them must be devised an equal variety of ways and degrees of worker participation in management...|$|E
40|$|Stimulating {{productivity}} {{through the}} participation of employees in gains resulting from its increase makes it necessary to distinguish between two levels of productivity: the acceptable level and the stimulated level. A prerequisite {{for the implementation of}} such motivation systems is the prior attainment of the first of the mentioned levels. Such systems may be divided into two groups. To the first one belong the systems in which a key role is played by the normative share of labour costs in the value of production (<b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan,</b> Rucker's system). To the second group belong the systems based on the norms setting the time- -standards for manufacturing particular products. In the latter systems the effects of increased productivity are calculated in terms of number of man-hours saved. To these systems belongs the "Improshare" system, to whose presentation the author devotes the main part of his article. This system is characterized by the predetermined ceilings of the awarded increase of productivity and by buying out labour norms by virtue of an agreement concluded between management and personnel if productivity permanently exceeds this level.

40|$|In Chapter 1 ，I {{introduce}} the viewpoint {{and the purpose}} of this study. This is a study of the wage and salary administration system which is really the substance of labor management in modern enterprise. In this paper. Wage and salary payment system is taken up as the central problem domain from the viewpoint of business management. And then this study' s purpose is to consider that wage and salary payment system based on the seniority-oriented system should be corrected for what kind of it in the times of aging of population composition, internationalization of labor movement, and the computerization in our country. Moreover. it considers about the rule by which wage and salary payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for wage and salary, and the principles of wage and salary administration which are not established as yet in Japanese enterprise. Chapter 2 is the preceding chapter before the main subject. The wage and salary payment system which is the central problem domain of wage and salary administration system is surrounded by various laws, theories and influences on wage and salary administration. I considered the surrounding four positions. The first is the legal theory on subjects of wage and salary (labor standard law of our country, collective agreement and office regulations of enterprise of our country). The second is the theory of wage and salary as economic theory (the wage fund theory, the marginal productivity theory and the labor value theory). The third is the social theory of the wage and salary as the factor which should be taken into consideration in the case of wage and salary determination (the market rate, the laborer' s living expenses level, change of prices, labor productivity, the ability of enterprise to pay) Finally，it is the business management theory of the wage and salary. Although such theory and influence are not the direct requirements for the wage and salary administration or wage and salary payment system, it's effect is never small Therein is clarified the basic meaning of wage and salary, the positioning wage and salary administration in labor management，and the domain of wage and salary administration. That is to say, the article about wage and salary is taken up from five laws, including the labor standard law of our country. And then，it is clarified that wage and salary is the compensation of labor between laborer and employer. Wage and salary administration is positioned with one basic domain of labor management that is divided to seven domains of labor management (Employment Management, Educational Training and Capability Development Management. Working Environmental Management. Wage and Salary Administration， Health and Welfare Management, Management of Human Relations，Management of lndustrial Relations). Also, the main domain of wage and salary administration is divided into two wage and salary payment system and the amount of money for wage and salary. These two points are occupying the important positions in this study. In Chapter 3, I discussed the trend of the actuality in the wage and salary administration system in enterprise of our country. The first wage and salary payment system in our country is a Den-san type wage structure, this wage structure had the deep color of living wages. Next. the seniority-oriented wage and salary payment system appeared around from 1960, subsequently, job performance abilities evaluation wage rate system appear around from 1975. But the color of living wages and seniority-oriented wages remained in this wage and salary payment system. However, in our country, aging of population composition and internationalization of labor movement progress around from 1980. It becomes increase of personnel expenses (labor cost) and it becomes the big burden of business management in enterprise. Moreover, in the times of the computerization which spreads quickly, the correspondence to change of the job contents is needed by business management in enterprise. In this way， adoption of a new wage and salary payment system come to be seen in after 1990. Here, I touch the annual salary system and profit or added value sharing plan that draws public attention as new wage and salary payment system. It is decided how the result (profit or added value) is shared among both based on recognition as the result of collaboration of laborer and employer (Profit Sharing Plan, Rucker Plan, <b>Scanlon</b> <b>Plan,</b> American Mortor's Plan, Kaiser Plan). The annual salary plan is the wage and salary payment system that is adopted as the managerial position of the company of our country on the pretext of restructuring in after 1990. This plan can say it is correction of the wage and salary payment system from living serious-consideration wages to job serious-consideration wages. Also，this plan has the strong character of reward, and the wage rate in this plan, can be called single job rate. Therefore, it is necessary for us to give feed back on job evaluation research. By the way, the seniority-oriented system and the custom of lifelong things completely, but however, have a close relation in fact. Merely，the wage and salary payment system does not give any answer about the amount of money for wage and salary. Therefore another principle is required. When the wage and salary payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for wage and salary, the separate principle is necessary. That is to say, the purpose of business management is the upkeep and the development of enterprise, and improvement in the laborer' s living standard. What business management should think important is two subjects of cost (labor cost) and laborer' s life (living expenses). From here, business management does not use mind only for the cost reduction, but should adopt “the laborer' s living standard" as the separate principle for the determination of the amount of money. Moreover，I {{introduce the}} principles of wage and salary administration which should be thought important. In case the wage and salary payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for wage and salary，it is very important. That is, conditions on the side of business management is the requirement of management. nature and objective of the organization, integration in administration. And conditions on the side of labor is satisfy the public interest, locality requirement, and reactions of the labor union. These principles are advocated by Prof. Y. Shimabukuro as basic theory of “Consensus Management". This “Consensus Management" is the important principle in that the determination of wage and salary should be reached by consensus among both laborer and employer. These six principles of wage and salary administration must be taken notice of as what functions on the “consensus" formation among business management and laborer. In addition，the incentive nature of wage and salary and the dissatisfied concentration nature of wage and salary are taken up as important matters in enforcement of the wage and salary administration system. Chapter 6 is conclusions of what so far has been described. That is to say wage and salary payment system which is main content of the wage and salary administration system in the modern enterprises has been studied center in this paper. First, as a direction of the ecdysis by aging and internationalization from the seniority-oriented wage and salary payment system, it was asserted that the correction to job evaluation wage rate system was concretely appropriate to the work(job) center wage and salary payment system. Secondly， the adoption of the Paterson method (the job evaluation method) is asserted as the correspondence to change of the job contents by the computerization. Thirdly, when the wage and salary payment system is combined with actual amount of money, the principle to be emphasized is no except for “living standard of the worker". Therefore, it should be sufficiently regarded on this principle in the business administration side. And, I would advocate that it should be equal agreement determination by the “consensus" formation among business management and laborers on the wage and salary administration system. まえがき　Abstract　基本用語　第 1 章 序　第 2 章 賃金管理に影響を与える理論 第 1 節 賃金管理といくつかの立場 第 2 節 賃金問題に関する理論 第 1 項 賃金の法律理論(賃金問題への法の介入) 第 2 項 賃金の経済理論(労働市場における賃金水準の存在) 第 3 項 賃金の社会理論(賃金決定の際に考慮されるべき要因) 第 4 項 賃金の経営理論(労務管理の実体としての賃金管理) 第 3 節 賃金管理と賃金支払制度 第 3 章 我国企業の賃金管理制度における現実の動向 第 1 節 年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱却 第 2 節 我国企業における新しい賃金支払制度の採用 第 1 項 成果分配制度 〈成果分配制度導入企業の実例〉 第 2 項 年俸制 〈年俸制導入企業の実例〉 第 3 節 職務給制度採用の妥当性 第 1 項 高齢化・国際化が要請する年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱皮の試み 第 2 項 職務評価と職務給制度 第 4 章 賃金支払制度と職務給制度 第 1 節 賃金問題と賃金支払制度 第 2 節 賃金支払制度の形態 第 3 節 職務給制度の発展 第 1 項 職務給制度の前身としての計測日給制度 第 2 項 職務給制度と労働能力 第 3 項 職務給制度における賃金体系 第 4 項 賃金規程の実例および職務給制度導入企業の実例 第 4 節 “意思決定"要素による職務評価(バターソン法) 第 1 項 評価要素および評価尺度 第 2 項 職務評価手続き 第 3 項 パターソン法による職務評価の事例(化学工業会社の場合) 第 4 項 パターソン法についてのまとめ 第 5 章 賃金支払制度と賃金額 第 1 節 賃金支払制度の賃金額への結合 第 2 節 賃金管理の原理 第 3 節 賃金管理制度の実施における留意点 第 1 項 賃金の刺激性 第 2 項 賃金とその不満集約性 第 6 章 結 ※注釈 ※参考文献 ※資料①～...|$|E
