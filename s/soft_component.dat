40|$|We have {{analyzed}} an XMM-Newton {{observation of}} the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1313, which contains two "ultra-luminous" X-ray (ULX) sources. We measure isotropic luminosities of L_X = 2. 0 * 10 ^(40) erg/s and L_(X) = 6. 6 * 10 ^(39) erg/s for NGC 1313 X- 1 and X- 2 (0. 2 - 10. 0 keV, assuming a distance of 3. 7 Mpc). The spectra statistically require soft and hard spectral components to describe the continuum emission; some prior studies of ULXs have claimed cool <b>soft</b> <b>components</b> with lower statistics. The improvement over several single-component models exceeds the 8 -sigma level of confidence for X- 1; the improvement for X- 2 is significant at the 3 -sigma level. The <b>soft</b> <b>components</b> in these ULX spectra are well-fit by multi-color disk blackbody models with color temperatures of kT = 150 eV. This temperature differs markedly from those commonly measured in the spectra of stellar-mass (10 M_sun) black holes in their brightest states (kT = 1 keV). It is expected that the temperature of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole should decrease with increasing black hole mass. If the <b>soft</b> <b>components</b> we measure are due to emission from the inner region of an accretion disk, and disks extend close to the innermost stable circular orbit at the accretion rates being probed, the low color temperatures may be interpreted as spectroscopic evidence of black holes with intermediate masses (M_BH = 10 ^(2) M_sun). This range agrees with simple isotropic Eddington limit scaling arguments and the disk blackbody normalization. We note that NGC 1313 X- 1 and X- 2 are found in optical nebulae (Pakull and Mirioni 2002); this may indicate that anisotropic emission geometries are unlikely {{to account for the}} fluxes observed...|$|R
40|$|The prime {{black hole}} {{candidate}} LMC X- 3 was observed {{over three years}} with the Ginga satellite, and a characteristic spectral variation was found accompanying the periodic intensity variation of about 198 (or possibly about 99) days (Cowley et al., 1991). The energy spectrum of LMC X- 3 consists of the soft, thermal component and the hard, power-law component, which are respectively dominant below and above about 9 keV. The <b>soft</b> <b>component,</b> which carries most of the X-ray intensity, shows a clear correlation between the intensity and the hardness, while the hard component varies independently of the <b>soft</b> <b>component.</b> It {{was found that the}} spectral variation of the <b>soft</b> <b>component</b> is well described by an optically thick accretion disk model with a remarkably constant innermost radius and variable mass accretion rate.

40|$|We present pulse-phase X-ray {{spectroscopy}} of the high-mass X-ray pulsar SMC X- 1 {{from five}} different epochs, using Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data. The X-ray spectrum consistently shows two distinct components, a hard power law {{and a soft}} blackbody with kT_BB ~ 0. 18 keV. For all five epochs the hard component shows a simple double-peaked pulse shape, and also {{a variation in the}} power law slope, which becomes harder at maximum flux and softer at minimum flux. For the <b>soft</b> <b>component,</b> the pulse profile changes between epochs, in both shape and phase relative to the power law pulses. The <b>soft</b> <b>component</b> is likely produced by reprocessing of the hard X-ray pulsar beam by the inner accretion disk. We have created a model of a twisted inner disk, illuminated by the rotating X-ray pulsar beam, which simulates pulsations in the <b>soft</b> <b>component</b> due to this reprocessing. We find that for some disk and beam geometries, precession of an illuminated accretion disk can roughly reproduce the observed long-term changes in the soft pulse profiles...|$|E

40|$|Restricted AccessWe present {{here the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the pulse-averaged and pulse-phase-resolved energy spectra of two high-luminosity accretion-powered X-ray pulsars SMC X- 1 and LMC X- 4 made with ASCA. The phase-averaged energy spectra definitely show the presence of a soft excess in both sources. If the soft excess is modeled as a separate blackbody- or thermal-bremsstrahlung-type component, pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy of SMC X- 1 shows that the <b>soft</b> <b>component</b> also has a pulsating nature. The same may be true for LMC X- 4, although a very small pulse fraction limits the statistical significance. The pulsating <b>soft</b> <b>component</b> is found to have a nearly sinusoidal profile, dissimilar to the complex profile seen at higher energies, which can be an effect of smearing. Due to the very high luminosity of these sources, the size of the emission zone required for the <b>soft</b> <b>component</b> is large (radius ~ 300 - 400 km). We show that the pulsating nature of the <b>soft</b> <b>component</b> is difficult to explain if a thermal origin is assumed for it. We further investigate with alternate models, such as an inversely broken power law or two different power-law components, and find that these models {{can also be used to}} explain the excess at low energy. A soft power-law component may be a common feature of accreting X-ray pulsars, which is difficult to detect because most high-mass X-ray binary pulsars are in the Galactic plane and experience large interstellar absorption. In LMC X- 4, we have also measured two additional mideclipse times, which confirm the known orbital decay...|$|E

40|$|Background: In the {{anterior}} ankle impingement syndrome, recurrent traction to {{the anterior}} joint capsule is stated {{to be the}} cause of formation of talotibial osteophytes. This hypothesis involves the assumption that the osteophytes originate at the site where a capsular attachment is located. A <b>soft</b> tissue <b>component</b> that can get squeezed between the distal tibia and talus is thought to be responsible for impingement complaints during dorsiflexion movements. Methods: In eight ankle specimens, the width of the nonweightbearing tibial cartilage rim and the distance of the tibial and talar cartilage to the capsular attachment were measured. The relationship of the <b>soft</b> tissue <b>components</b> to the anterior joint was studied. The average tibial cartilage rim width was 2. 4 mm (1. 5 - 3. 0 mm). Tibial and talar cartilage-capsule distances were 4. 3 mm (0. 5 - 9. 0 mm) and 2. 4 mm (1. 8 - 3. 3 mm), respectively. In all specimens, the anterior joint space contained a triangular <b>soft</b> tissue <b>component,</b> overlying the joint capsule. The component consisted of a synovial membrane and subsynovial located fat and collagen tissue. It was observed that in 15 degrees dorsiflexion the <b>soft</b> tissue <b>component</b> was squeezed between the tibia and talus. Conclusions: The anterior ankle joint capsule attaches proximal to the site where the anterior talotibial spurs originate. The hypothesis of formation of talotibial spurs due to repetitive capsule traction therefore does not seem plausible. The anatomic findings do support the hypothesis that an anteriorly located <b>soft</b> tissue <b>component</b> is present that can give impingement symptom...|$|R
