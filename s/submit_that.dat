25|$|On 13 April 2011, the UNHCR {{recommended}} that the General Assembly reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session (to be held in September 2011), and urges the Assembly to <b>submit</b> <b>that</b> report to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral {{of the situation in}} the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute. The resolution was drafted by the Palestinian Authority and adopted by the Human Rights Council with 27 states voting in favour, three against, and 16 abstentions. It followed the second report of a Committee of Independent Experts, established to monitor the domestic investigations into violations committed during the conflict, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council on 18 March 2011. The report concurred with Amnesty International's assessment that – more than 18 months since the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict documented crimes under international law committed by both sides – the Israeli authorities and the Hamas de facto administration have failed to conduct investigations meeting the required international standards of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. The General Assembly has already twice called on the domestic authorities to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, in resolutions adopted in November 2009 and February 2010. Those calls appear to have been ignored meaning that the General Assembly would be entitled to submit the issue to the Security Council.|$|E

2500|$|Connotations of [...] "gamer" [...] with sexism on {{the fringe}} of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label. [...] "Girl gamers" [...] or [...] "gamer girls" [...] is a label for women who {{regularly}} play games. While some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, others have described the term as unhelpful, offensive, and even harmful or misleading. The word [...] "girl", for example, has been seen as an inherently age-linked term that glosses over the difference between women over 30 and younger women. The term [...] "girl gamer" [...] rather than simply [...] "gamer" [...] has also been described as perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. For many critics uncomfortable with the term [...] "girl gamer", its over-embracement may lead to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes of female gamers as oversexualized, casual, and sometimes defiant or confrontational. This in turn can result in poor game design. These critics <b>submit</b> <b>that</b> there is no single definition of a female gamer, and that women gamers are as diverse as any other group of people.|$|E
2500|$|Many in Congress {{questioned}} {{both the}} legality of the Reorganized Virginia government and the constitutionality of the creation of West Virginia. Many scholars since have questioned the democratic nature of the Second Wheeling Convention, the legal and moral legitimacy of the Reorganized Government, and the constitutionality of the creation of West Virginia. But most lengthy scholarly treatments of the issue assert {{the legality of}} the Reorganized government. In Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. 1 (1849), the Supreme Court held that only the federal government could determine what constituted a [...] "republican form of government" [...] in a state (as provided for in the [...] of Article Four of the United States Constitution). Virginia was not alone in having two governments—one unionist, one rebel—with the union government recognized by the United States. The Supreme Court had held in Luther v. Borden, [...] "Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State." [...] As both the President and Congress had recognized the Reorganized Government, this provision was met and the entire process was legal. There were precedents for such action as well. As one legal scholar has noted, Michigan was admitted to the union after irregular elections for three unauthorized constitutional conventions led to a request for statehood that Congress (eventually) granted in 1837. Kansas, too, went through a highly irregular statehood process marked by violence, mass meetings masquerading as legislative assemblies, and allegations of vote fraud, but it was also admitted to the union. One widely cited legal analysis concludes that [...] "the process of West Virginia statehood was hyper-legal". Indeed, to deny {{the legality of the}} Reorganized Government creates significant problems, two legal scholars have argued: [...] " [...] follows, we <b>submit,</b> <b>that</b> 'Virginia' validly consented to the creation of West Virginia with its borders. Indeed, one can deny this conclusion only if one denies one of Lincoln's twin premises: the unlawfulness of secession; or the power of the national government, under the Guarantee Clause, to recognize alternative State governments created by loyal citizens in resistance to insurrectionary regimes that have taken over the usual governing machinery of their States." ...|$|E
