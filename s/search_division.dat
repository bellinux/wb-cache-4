As a consequence, no meaningful search was considered to be possible.

This was not foreseen under the former regulations. Under the new rules, if the claims as filed in a European patent application contain a plurality of independent claims in the same claim category and if the EPO considers in that case that the claims therefore do not comply with Rule 43(2) EPC, the EPO may [...] "invite the applicant to indicate, within {{a period of two}} months, the claims complying with Rule 43, paragraph 2, on the basis of which the search is to be carried out."
