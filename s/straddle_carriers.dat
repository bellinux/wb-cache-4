40|$|Abstract: The {{motivation}} {{of this study}} is the recent advancement of the <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (S/C). Previously <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (S/C) system was used focusing on container lift on/off due to its lower driving speed than that of (Y/T). Shuttle Carrier is evaluated as an upgraded <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier.</b> Recently, however, the driving speed of (S/C) has been improved to the level of Yard Tractor and Trailer systems (Y/T), which is 30 Km per hour which makes (S/C) qualified as terminal in-yard transportation equipment. This paper, therefore, aims to evaluate three types of terminal in-yard transportation equipments such as (Y/T), (AGV) and the advanced (S/C) from economic perspective. The results revealed that by observing the total costs of equipment, (S/C) is a cheaper option than (Y/T) over 20 years, and than (AGV) over 6 years...|$|R
25|$|Containers are {{transferred}} between rail, truck, and ship by container cranes at container terminals.

25|$|In the 1970s, {{containerisation}} revolutionised shipping, eventually {{coming to}} New Zealand as well. The local harbour boards wrought massive changes on those ports selected (after much political wrangling) {{to handle the}} new giant vessels, such as Lyttelton and Auckland Port. Gantry cranes, <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> and powerful tugboats were built or purchased, and shipping channels dredged deeper, while large areas of land were reclaimed to enable the new container terminals. The changes {{have been described as}} having been more radical than the changeover from sail to steam a century before.|$|E

50|$|The <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> {{was invented}} by H. B. Ross in 1913 as a road-going vehicle that could easily {{transport}} lumber around mills and yards. Lumber was stacked on special pallets known as carrier blocks; the <b>carrier</b> would then <b>straddle</b> the stack, grasp and lift the carrier block, and drive off with the load. Because a <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> is open at both front and rear, it can transport lumber much longer than the carrier itself, over 30 m in length.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1947 as Belotti Handling SpA {{and was the first}} company to build mobile {{handling}} equipment specifically designed for ports. This from their manufacturing facility on Ponte Canepa wharf, Genoa. In 1952 Belotti manufactured the first crane able to lift and transport military aircraft. In 1967 Belotti introduced the first container handling <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> with side lifting capability. The first 100 tonne capacity aircraft transporter was supplied in 1967.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on improving the energy efficiency of a <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> by optimizing the electrical powertrain. Mobile working machines have significantly varying power demands in operation. Average demand is considerably {{lower than the}} maximum power requirements. This results in the machine operating far from its optimum efficiency range significant amount of its operating hours. This work cycle power level variation is vastly different from road vehicle power demands and optimization scenarios. Diesel powered working machine efficiency can be significantly improved with electric hybridization. The study is beneficial to both direct electric driven and hybrid systems. Main focus is the optimizing the motor and generator with the analysed load cycles. Comprehensive measurement data sets of vehicle use in real port operations are used {{as a base for}} the load analysis. In conjunction with the load models several mechanical and electrical simulation models were created. These component models were used to estimate changes that different motor and generator combinations would have on the overall efficiency. For this the efficiency maps for electrical machines are determined analytically in the whole torque–rotational speed plane based on the electrical machine parameters. Electrical machine losses and torque generation were studied in depth to find appropriate future development paths for the electrical powertrain of a <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier.</b> Additionally the payback time for the most feasible improvements were estimated. The thesis provides a case example of dimensioning and improving electrical powertrain of a working machine...|$|R
30|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and effectiveness of}} rail freight services is largely dependent on the {{efficiency and}} effectiveness of terminals, marshalling yards along the transport chain, and feeder transports. Transhipment in terminals is traditionally performed vertically, {{using a variety of}} equipment, such as Transtainer (gantry crane), Reach Stacker, <b>Straddle</b> <b>carrier,</b> or Fork lift. With this type of equipment, a container is lifted from a train and moved to a stack yard, either for storage, or loading onto a truck, etc. Comparatively speaking, this vertical transhipment is costly, time consuming and incurs a higher risk of loss/damage to cargo. Moreover, 80  % of European trailers cannot be lifted, restricting market share.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} modern {{application}} for <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> is in port terminals and intermodal yards {{where they are}} used for stacking and moving ISO standard containers. Straddles pick and carry containers while straddling their load and connecting to the top lifting points via a container spreader. These machines {{have the ability to}} stack containers up to 4 high. These are capable of relatively low speeds (up to 30 km/h) with a laden container. The workers that use this machinery sit at the very top seated facing the middle as they can see behind them and in front of them. <b>Straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> can lift up to 60 t which equals up to 2 full containers.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simultaneous}} berth allocation and yard planning problem at tactical level, since the berth allocation {{has a great}} impact on the yard planning and vice versa. This problem is solved by means of an alternating berth and yard planning heuristic approach. The alternating heuristic quickly converges to a local minimum which heavily depends on the starting point. Therefore, we formulate another optimization problem for generating a suitable starting point. A real size case study provided by PSA Antwerp shows that our approach to simultaneously solve both problems might reduce the total <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> travel distance considerably as compared with a representative allocation...|$|R
