5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching.

5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to <b>swim,</b> <b>and</b> have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{four stages}} {{take place in}} power plants, flats, {{underwater}} habitats, and space stations in zero gravity, respectively. Every level is an interior space, and consists of multi-storey rooms and corridors divided by interlocking lifts and doors. The player {{is equipped with a}} jet pack to reach higher areas and perform acrobatic manoeuvres such as backflips and rolls. They can also <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> dive underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should they come into contact. Each stage ends with a boss battle, ranging from fire-breathing flowers to robotic fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{preserved}} {{contents of}} its digestive tract {{are typical of}} those of other predators', and this lifestyle {{is supported by the}} raptor-like nature of the spiny great appendages {{and the size of the}} eyes. The organism was clearly a competent swimmer, propelling itself with the 'flippers' attached to its head, and using its wing-like lobes on the 11th segment to steer. These lobes presumably derived from the lateral lobes of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used lobes along their sides to <b>swim,</b> <b>and</b> lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E
5|$|As a {{survival}} horror game, Revelations emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player {{has the ability to}} run, climb ladders, <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> dive underwater for a limited period of time. Up to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to grenades and the standard combat knife. Firearms range from handguns to shotguns, submachine guns and rifles. When aiming a firearm to shoot enemies, the gameplay switches into a first-person perspective. Playing as Jill, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game. The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the right time. Ammunition and health suppliers are dispersed among the game to help players increase their resources. A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find items hidden throughout the game's environments. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the game.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to <b>swim,</b> <b>and</b> in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.|$|E

5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter with shoot 'em up and action-adventure elements, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Weapons have no magazines restrictions and range from grenades to a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much {{of the game is}} spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, hang from most ledges, <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> fly using jet packs when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with the targeting camera fixed behind the character's head. When using this technique, a crosshair appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} , Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes {{the role of}} Turok from a first-person perspective. As Turok, the player can run, jump, climb ladders, <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> dive underwater for a limited period of time. The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of latching onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has {{a certain amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses one Life Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game will be over. Ammunition, health, and Life Force suppliers can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's resources.|$|E

5|$|The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter {{based on}} MGM's 1999 James Bond {{film of the}} same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 {{missions}} with three difficulty settings. The player {{has the ability to}} run, jump, crouch, <b>swim</b> <b>and</b> dive underwater {{for a short period of}} time. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete a number of objectives while defeating enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the Keypad Decrypter can be used to decode lock systems, while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints.|$|E
