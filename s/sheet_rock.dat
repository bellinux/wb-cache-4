A request was made for the owner to propose plans to fireproof the hotel's wooden roof and attic. County officials suggested the installation of either a sprinkler system or <b>sheet</b> <b>rock</b> in the attic, {{as well as the}} addition of fire-proof materials {{on the roof of the}} hotel structures. In November 1962, key positions in the resort were being named while an opening date of Christmas week was being planned.|$|E
25|$|Sylvia {{was born}} and raised in Ellsworth, Maine, {{attending}} Ellsworth High School and graduating in 1992. He joined a karate school as a child, and began wrestling in high school. After graduation, he worked construction, community gardening, hanging <b>sheet</b> <b>rock,</b> a bouncer, and painting houses. After high school, he played semi-pro football for three years before becoming interested in MMA, and began to train with Marcus Davis, a fellow bouncer. During this time Sylvia decided to take up boxing and grappling. After training for a year, and winning grappling tournaments, he got the opportunity to fight in a Rhode Island no holds barred amateur event, in which he knocked out his opponent in 17 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Kulpahar region {{comprises}} areas {{which are}} essentially covered by grey, pink, red granitic rock and black dolerite. The rocks are generally medium to coarse to very coarse grained, having variegated colours with varying textural patterns. In geological nomenclature {{they can be}} classified {{on the basis of}} colour, grain size and texture. Over half of the areas identified so far appear suitable for extracting blocks of two cubic meters in size from the surface outcrops. The granite with red feldspar having presence of white and bluish quartz has caught the fancy of buyers and has become quite popular in national and international markets during the last 10 years, The remaining outcrops would be suited for blocks of smaller size. Ruby red granite is good in quality and is very popular in national and international markets, In granitic terrain the rocks may occur in the form of widespread sheets exposed above the ground level, in the form of hillocks, as high ground or below the ground under soil cover. They may also occur as boulders of different size and shapes spread over the <b>sheet</b> <b>rock.</b> They may be found as dykes, particularly of black and green types, as long narrow ridges often concealed beneath the surface. A major part of granite deposits in these regions are underground and have to be extracted by open cast mining. Underground granite block is more compact and require sophisticated and specialised machinery which adds to the cost of mining.|$|E

40|$|The Brasilia Fold Thrust Belt at Tapira area (SW of Minas Gerais State, Brazil) {{has four}} {{different}} litho-tectonic domains imbricated by thrust faults with vergency to the São Francisco Craton. Sm/Nd isotopic studies were undertaken {{and the results}} show different model and metamorphic ages for the thrust <b>sheets.</b> <b>Rocks</b> from the lower thrust sheet yield a metamorphic age of 543 Ma while the upper thrust sheet has a metamorphic age of 581 Ma. The TDM model ages are similar for both thrust sheets, between 1. 7 and 2. 2 Ga. Because of their lithologic characteristics, the thrust sheets are interpreted as having been deposited in a distal continental platform environment, their main source being Paleoproterozoic rocks of the São Francisco Craton. The upper thrust <b>sheet</b> <b>rocks</b> presents a metamorphism age of 612 Ma and a bimodal distribution of TDM model ages between 1. 3 and 1. 9 - 2. 0 Ga, respectively.

In spite of the small number of analyzed samples and the uncertainties inherent to the Sm/Nd method the metamorphisms are not considered to be synchronous in the different thrust sheets. This is to be expected in a thrust belt system, in which the more metamorphosed thrust sheets are juxtaposed to less metamorphosed ones...|$|R
