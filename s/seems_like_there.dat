At this moment it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is only one antivirus for smart TVs available. Ocean Blue Software partnered with Sophos and developed first cloud based antimalware system “Neptune”. Also antivirus company Avira has joined forces with digital TV testing company Labwise {{to work on the}} software that would protect against potential attacks. The privacy policy for Samsung's Smart TVs has been called Orwellian (a reference to George Orwell and the dystopian world of constant surveillance he depicted in 1984), and compared to Telescreens because of eavesdropping concerns.|$|E
500|$|To {{continue}} the tradition, the organization produces 20,500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game. [...] Following his first playoff game in 2007 Vancouver forward Alex Burrows stated [...] "It {{looks like the}} fans are really into {{the game and the}} atmosphere out there is something else, people are really passionate instead of just sitting and no one moving or anything like some places. It just creates movement and it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building." [...] As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson. Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson's mock surrender which started towel power.|$|E
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} video {{released by}} Capitol Records for Don't Ask Me, the band's second single, features the band performing {{in a black}} and white room with a backup dancer. The video was edited to make it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> were multiple backup dancers.|$|R
50|$|From June to September, so many French-Algerian {{tourists}} were arriving that it almost <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was an airlift set up between Vichy-Charmeil and the airports of Algeria. Mayor Pierre Coulon (1950-1967) {{decided to create}} Lake Allier (June 10, 1963) and Omnisports Park (1963-68), giving the city its current look.|$|R
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baker {{described}} {{working with}} Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) and Eakes as a fun but somewhat intimidating experience. [...] "They are naturals at it!" [...] she stated. She said that Eakes helped her {{feel more comfortable}} during her first few weeks as Babe, {{and to get a}} better understanding of the character. [...] "She came up to me the first day we worked together and offered to go over lines together and help me with anything I needed. She is a sweetheart," [...] said Baker. Baker revealed that in her spare time in between takes as the character, she managed to find something to keep entertained by. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is always something to do when you have down time on the set," [...] she said. [...] "I either run lines with the other actors or hang out in the hair and makeup room. I love those ladies!" [...] Adding to Baker's enjoyment on the set was Young. [...] "He is always cracking jokes!" [...] stated Baker.|$|E
5000|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Jeremy Dunham says [...] "Quest for Booty {{has been}} designed as a quick four-hour experience and it feels shortchanged because of it. Though its shooting and platforming sequences are fun and of high production, it still <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there's</b> something missing," [...] but said that [...] "there are some really cool puzzles and new gameplay elements." ...|$|R
5000|$|Keselowski {{described}} his day as [...] "really, really great. It <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> {{were plenty of}} challenges, whether it was pit road or the weather or cautions. They threw everything they had at us today but this Miller Lite Ford team was too strong {{and we were able}} to fight them off and get to victory lane.” ...|$|R
5000|$|.....Wildboyz {{probably}} could've {{kept going}} after Season 4. It just didn't <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was a point. Over {{time it had}} essentially evolved back into Jackass. During our final trip to Russia there were no stunts that wouldn't have fit in just as easily on Jackass. Knoxville came along on that trip too, which contributed even more to that vibe." ...|$|R
2500|$|Winning the toss and batting, India reached 5/311 by stumps on {{the opening}} day. India were bowled out for 469 on the second day, after Ganguly scored his 16th and last Test century. Hayden was bowled for a third-ball duck, while Ponting was trapped lbw by a Sharma off cutter for five, as Australia {{collapsed}} to 5/58 and then 8/144 in their first innings reply. Shane Watson and Brett Lee combined for 73 eight wicket partnership, helping Australia reach a meagre 268. In the home-side's second innings, Ponting was criticised for using part-timers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen after he was informed that he was five overs behind the required over rate, which is penalisable by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant {{that he was not}} able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly. A long discussion between Lee and Ponting prompted media allegations of a team rift, something Ponting denied. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> are people trying to make a bit more of that than what it actually was," [...] Ponting said after his team's defeat. [...] "I made Brett aware he wasn't going to bowl first-thing in the morning. I let him know we were wanting to take pace off the ball." [...] Where it fell down a bit is I didn't communicate those reasons to Brett at 11am when he wanted to bowl. I made it clear to him from that moment on of those reasons." [...] After India declared on 3/314 with just over four sessions of play remaining, Australia were bowled out for 195 on the fifth morning, with Ponting's off stump knocked out of the ground by another Sharma off cutter for just 2, as India completed a 320 run victory.|$|E

At first it didn't come easy; but now it's got started it pours in and pours in; it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was no end to it. I've got well on to three million; but it couldn't keep me from losin' my son. It can't buy me back a minute of his life; not {{all the money in}} the world can do it!" ...|$|E
50|$|Excavate {{relationships}} are still uncertain; {{it is possible}} that they are not a monophyletic group. The monophyly of the excavates is far from clear, although it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> are several clades within the excavates which are monophyletic.|$|E
50|$|In February 2010, Dr. Michael Kimura, a {{specialist}} in veterinary neurology with BluePearl, assisted in giving a live shark from the Florida Aquarium an MRI after the shark had failed to eat anything and it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was a foreign object lodged in the shark's esophagus. This {{is one of the}} first times a live shark had ever been given and MRI under anesthesia.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the episode}} made it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was more debate after Brian {{requested}} his termination, Donald Trump said {{at that point}} that Brian was finished. He then questioned the other team members about issues and problems not related to Brian (mostly Kristen's disrespectful behavior towards the other team members, and Chris's lackluster contribution to the task), before picking up the thread and telling Brian to get lost.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the Generator space was partially inspired by Montgomery's trips to Europe, in which he encountered likeminded multi-purpose venues (citing the Staaltape cassette shop in Amsterdam and the Gelbe Musik in Berlin as significant influences in this regard): [...] "I saw all these kinds of places and every time I came back to New York I got very frustrated, because it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was nothing <b>like</b> that here." ...|$|R

5000|$|In a mixed review, the NME {{wrote that}} [...] "as sweet as {{it often is}} on the surface, it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>theres</b> {{something}} deeply selfish underpinning The Jayhawks new approach." [...] The Village Voices Robert Christgau wrote that the band, without Olsons contributions, were now [...] "as vapid as late Poco and then some" [...] and [...] "aspire to the generalization level of transcendentalist parlor ballads, Hallmark cards, and, increasingly, Music Row." ...|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Santos of With an Accent gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that the}} second season {{continues}} to surpass its entertaining, yet slightly mediocre first season with each new episode that airs and that [...] "If You Could See Her Through My Eyes" [...] was a great episode. [...] "While at times it may <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there’s</b> too much going in the town in which the show takes place, overall it feels pretty balanced." ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the close}} {{relationship}} between economics, biology and psychology since {{the late nineteenth century}} –the main economic categories have clear psychological connotations– the so called “mainstream” economics has not studied these links systematically. An illustrative account of these interactions between economic theory psychology and biology is presented. In general, it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there’s</b> return to the hedonistic logic and a recovery of the utilitarian vision. In this context there is a fortunate space to advance the relationship between economics biology...|$|R
50|$|At this point, {{the main}} {{character}} encounters an obstacle that prevents the character from achieving his or her dramatic need. This {{is known as the}} complication. The main character reaches his or her lowest point and seems farthest from fulfilling the dramatic need or objective and it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is no longer any way that the protagonist can succeed.|$|E
5000|$|According to an {{investigation}} {{carried out in}} 1976, some seven years after the event, most of those present at the meeting either did not recall the event, or did not recall it as being anything important. According to Fred Hart, the only guest contacted who remembered seeing the object: [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was a little—like a blue light or something or other in the sky that night—like some kind of weather balloon they send out or something ... it had been pretty far back in my mind.".|$|E
5000|$|While {{at first}} it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> are {{numerous}} [...] "visions" [...] on Lost, most are in fact not visions, and are either {{the spirit of a}} dead person, or Jacob's brother taking on the physical form and memories of a dead person. Visions have helped several characters achieve certain tasks. Many spirits have appeared on and off the Island, such as Michael Dawson, Jacob, Emily Linus, Claudia, Ana Lucia, Charlie Pace. Some spirits communicate with the living in their dreams, such as Horace Goodspeed and Boone Carlyle, who each appear to John Locke on separate occasions.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} false balance is the [...] "debate" [...] on global warming; {{although}} {{the scientific community}} almost unanimously attributes global warming {{to the effects of}} the industrial revolution, there is a very small number, a few dozen scientists out {{of tens of thousands of}} scientists, who dispute the conclusion. Giving equal voice to scientists on both sides makes it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is a serious disagreement within the scientific community, when in fact there is an overwhelming scientific consensus [...] that anthropogenic global warming exists.|$|R
50|$|This union premium {{wage gap}} can be {{interpreted}} as the adaptations to globalization, technological, and demographic changes. Another argument for this gap between union and non-union wages is the competition between the wages including a foreign competitor, different workplace improvements to enhance productivity, safety in the workplace, and other interests of the workers. Thus higher wages paid in the union sector makes it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is a rationing of union jobs and that the average worker would rather work a union job than a non-union job.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most {{video game}} websites, Giant Bomb does not heavily cover {{industry}} news {{from a business}} perspective. During an interview on X-Play, Gerstmann said that he thought video game websites had become too focused on {{the business side of}} games, and that game news had become [...] "stale" [...] in the process. [...] "We want {{to get out there and}} talk about games, because we <b>like</b> games…and it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there's</b> an audience out <b>there,</b> and they <b>like</b> games... and their needs aren't being met by what's out there right now." ...|$|R

5000|$|On 4 October, New York University {{professor}} of history Greg Grandin stated that [...] "it's still early to tell exactly what happened" [...] and in his initial analysis said, [...] "the government has made a lot of, I think, accurate accusations {{that it was not}} just a spontaneous social protest against austerity. It was too coordinated. It happened simultaneously in a number of cities, a number of barracks. Sectors of the air force joined in immediately. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> have been sectors that have been dissatisfied with Correa within the military.
