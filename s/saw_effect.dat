50|$|One {{theory as}} to how it sank is that in 1816..."the year without a summer", there was an early spring thaw and the streams that fed Canadarago were running high. Their water flow covered the lake ice. A north wind blew the ice pack into the {{southern}} portion of the lake. Not long after that, there was a hard freeze and the winds shifted {{from out of the}} south. The ice pack, larger than before, was sent back in the opposite direction. The <b>saw</b> <b>effect</b> took off the surface soil of Loon Island and took down the trees and vegetation. It has been under water ever since.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the early}} part of the 19th century, there was a second island on the lake called Loon Island. Smaller than the island that remains on Canadarago today, Loon Island was only half an acre in size. Its {{southern}} shore was marshy, but the northern end of the island (toward Richfield Springs) had trees and vegetation. In 1816..."the year without a summer", there was an early spring thaw and the streams that feed Canadarago were running high. Their water flow covered the lake ice.

50|$|The {{role of the}} {{professor}} {{was meant to be}} played by Clifton Webb. Reisch:That was absolutely the most beautiful idea, because Clifton Webb had a certain tongue-in-cheek style, suited to playing a professor with crazy notions, which could be paired with Pat Boone as his favorite disciple. Every week Clifton visited Brackett's office, where we described scenes to him and he became very excited at the prospect of playing that kind of part. Maybe two or three weeks before we actually began to shoot, Clifton Webb went to the hospital for a checkup, and they never let him out. He had to undergo major surgery. Unless my memory fails me completely, it was a double hernia, and he was, as you can imagine, a very sensitive man, very touchy about sickness. He called Zanuck himself on his private line, and said he could not play the part because it was such a physical part.Webb was replaced at the last minute by James Mason, who had previously appeared in an earlier adaptation of a Jules Verne work, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954). Reisch:I think it was head of Twentieth Century-Fox casting Billy Gordon or Lew Schreiber Century-Fox production executive who suggested James Mason. James Mason was, of course, British, with a beautiful voice, and he liked the idea the part. He felt it was his duty as Clifton's colleague to take over. From there on it was clear sailing, except that Pat Boone had about three or four songs, if not more, and I think all of them died in the end, {{with the exception of one}} or two. The moment that Zanuck <b>saw</b> <b>effect</b> on the action, those songs just fell by the wayside.Some of the underground sequences for Journey to the Center of the Earth were filmed at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Other shooting locations included Amboy Crater and Sequit Point, California, as well as Edinburgh, Scotland. Principal photography took place from late June to mid-September 1959.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} was reported of the injection of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to fix diamond beads on wire <b>saws.</b> <b>Effects</b> of injection material hardness, injection temperature and dwell {{pressure on the}} mechanical properties of three types of TPU plastics were studied and {{the results showed that}} with the increase of material hardness, both the 100 % Modulus and the tensile strength of TPU were improved, but the rupture extensibility reduced. With the increase of injection temperature, the tensile strength increased but the rupture elongation decreased. To every type of TPU, a minimum injection temperature can be found for an ideal density of TPU...|$|R

Since <b>SAW</b> <b>effects</b> decay nonuniformly with depth in the structure, {{the location of the}} QW region needs to be designed carefully. For a thick QW region, a large uniform SAW induced electric field is required and thus the QW region is located at a depth of approximately 2 / 3 the SAW wavelength below the surface. A deposited ZnO film is also required to enhance the electric field induced by SAW and long SAW wavelength is used to obtain a more linear SAW potential. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|To {{achieve the}} {{efficient}} sawing of decorative stone by diamond circular saws, {{it is necessary}} to find the conditions for the most considerable <b>sawing</b> <b>effect</b> and the least bluntness consumption of diamond tool. Therefore one of the most complex questions in testing the performance of diamond circular saws is the determination of optimal sawing regime, which implies the right choice of sawing depth, longitudinal and peripheral (circular) saw velocity. To find out how the alteration of peripheral saw velocity affects the consumption of diamond segments and therewith the saw duration and its entire efficiency, the author carried out experimental explorations related to the dependence of diamond segment consumption on the alteration of peripheral saw velocity (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
