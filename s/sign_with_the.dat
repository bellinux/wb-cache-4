5|$|After the draft, Milwaukee {{attempted}} to convince Yi to <b>sign</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team and on 2 July 2007, {{the owner of}} the Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to <b>sign</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.|$|E

5|$|The Twins {{have made}} 16 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and have made the first overall selection twice (1983 and 2001). They have also had 18 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Twins have six times failed to sign their first-round pick.
