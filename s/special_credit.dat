In September 2009, Goldman Sachs, among others, created a <b>special</b> <b>credit</b> default swap (CDS) index to cover the high risk of Greece's national debt. The interest-rates of Greek national bonds soared, leading the Greek economy very close to bankruptcy in 2010 and 2011.|$|E

Two great arranger-bandleaders deserve <b>special</b> <b>credit</b> for this, Armando Romeu Jr. and Damaso Perez Prado. Armando Romeu Jr. led the Tropicana Cabaret orchestra for 25 years, starting in 1941. He had experience playing with visiting American jazz {{groups as well as}} a complete mastery of Cuban forms of music. In his hands the Tropicana presented not only Afrocuban and other popular Cuban music, but also Cuban jazz and American big band compositions. Later he conducted the Orquesta Cubana de Musica Moderna.|$|E

This is surely a path breaker in terms of Telugu film making and with the likes of 'Arundhati', Tollywood sure is proud to have this one in its league. It is a valiant attempt to bring such genre to the modern day audience and present it with finesse so that it fits the historical angle and the today's angle." [...] However, Rajamouli was accused of lifting scenes from films like Gladiator (2000), Troy (2004), The Myth (2005) and 300 (2007).|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season, Lana Wachowski took over {{many of the}} filmmaking aspects of the show, which {{combined}} with her sister's break, made her responsibilities as director shoot up. Production sound mixer Stevie Haywood recounted Lana's directing style was to use two cameras as the default setup, and develop the shot over [...] "enormously long takes" [...] which could last up to fifteen to twenty minutes. Additionally, {{the cast and crew}} under Lana did not use any rehearsals. [...] "We rehearse on camera effectively", said Haywood. If there were any technical issues Lana expected the cast to improvise and keep the shoot going instead of calling [...] "cut". Smith, Desai and Silvestre corroborated Lana's style of developing the shots on the set, her dislike for rehearsals, and the use of long takes, with the actors told to try different variations on how they play their parts. McTeigue returned as director for Mexico City. Tykwer returned as director for the Nairobi parts but not for the Berlin ones, as he was busy working on his own TV series, Babylon Berlin. According to Glass, in the second season he directed the second unit in Seoul, and he also did some directing in Berlin. Overall, six episodes of the second season, including the Christmas <b>special,</b> <b>credit</b> Lana as director, three credit McTeigue, and Tykwer and Glass get credited each in one.|$|E

2500|$|Nikolai Leskov, then an {{anonymous}} reviewer in [...] (The Stock Exchange Herald), wrote several articles praising highly War and Peace, calling it [...] "the best ever Russian historical novel" [...] and [...] "the {{pride of the}} contemporary literature". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the <b>special</b> <b>credit</b> for [...] "having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved". [...] "While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently {{the character of the}} nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers", Leskov wrote.|$|E

2500|$|Massive scale {{persecution}} {{against the}} local Greek element started in 1961, {{as part of}} the Eritme Programmi operation that aimed at the elimination of Greek education and the enforcement of economic, psychological pressure and violence. Under these conditions the Turkish government approved the appropriation of the 90% of the cultivated areas of the island and the settlement of additional 6,000 ethnic Turks from mainland Turkey. The Turkish Government, also, closed the Greek schools on the island and classified it as [...] "supervised zone", which meant that expatriates could not visit the island and their homes without special admission. Greeks on the island were also targeted by the construction of an open prison on the island that included inmates convicted of rape and murder, who were then allowed to roam freely on the island and harass locals. Some are said to have committed the same crimes before the prison was closed down in 1992. Additional population settlements from Anatolia occurred in 1973, 1984 and 2000. The state provided <b>special</b> <b>credit</b> opportunities and agricultural aid in kind to those who would decide to settle in the island. New settlements were created and existing settlements were renamed with Turkish names. The island itself was officially renamed to Gökçeada in 1970. On the other hand, the indigenous Greek population being deprived of its means of production and facing hostile behaviour from the government and the newly arrived settlers, left its native land.

6000|$|... "No {{man is a}} fair {{judge of}} his own actions, Sir Gervaise," [...] Caretto said. [...] "A man may believe himself a Solon, or a Roland; others may {{consider}} him as a fool, or an empty braggart; {{and it must be}} taken that the general opinion of the public is the judgment from which there is no appeal. It is not the mob of Genoa only who regard the services that you have rendered as extraordinary, but it is the opinion of the councillors and authorities of the Republic, and of those who, like myself, have borne our share in warfare, that not only is the service great, but that it is due to the singular ability with which you, in command of only a single galley, have wholly destroyed or captured the fleet that threatened our commerce. As our councillors, therefore, all competent judges, are unanimous in their opinion that you have deserved the highest honours that Genoa can bestow upon you, it is useless for you to set up your own opinion to the contrary. Take the good things that fall to you, Sir Gervaise, and be thankful. It is seldom that men obtain more honours than they deserve, while it very often happens that they deserve far more than they obtain. Fortune has doubtless some share in every man's career; but when it is not once, but several times, that a knight gains <b>special</b> <b>credit</b> for deeds he has performed, we may be sure that fortune {{has less to do with}} the matter than his personal merits. Three times have you earned special credit; upon the first occasion, the grand master--no mean judge of conduct and character--deemed you worthy of secular knighthood, an honour which has not, in my memory, been bestowed at Rhodes upon any young knight; on the second, you were promoted to the command of a galley, though never before has such a command been given to any, save knights of long experience; and now, for the third time, the councillors of one of the greatest of Italian cities are about to do you honour. It is good to be modest, Sir Gervaise, and it is better to underestimate than to overrate one's own merits, but it is not well to carry the feeling to an extreme. I am quite sure that in your case your disclaimer is wholly sincere and unaffected; but take my advice, accept the honours the world may pay you as not undeserved, determining only in your mind that if you deem them excessive, you will at least do all in your power to show that they are not ill bestowed. You will not, I trust, take my counsel amiss." ...|$|E
