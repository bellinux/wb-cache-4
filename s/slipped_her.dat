5|$|In this episode, Veronica aids a {{conservative}} Christian student named Bonnie Capistrano (Carlee Avers) {{in finding out}} who <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> mifepristone, which caused a miscarriage. Meanwhile, Veronica becomes obsessed with Madison Sinclair (Amanda Noret) after becoming enraged that Madison and Logan (Jason Dohring) had sex while they were broken up. In addition, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) discover new information about Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. Barham <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> mooring at 22:08 and was followed by the rest of Beatty's ships.|$|E
5|$|USS Downes entered {{service in}} January 1937. The {{following}} November, she sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Diego, California. While based there, Downes participated in exercises {{along the west}} coast, in the Caribbean and in Hawaiian waters until April 1940. Pearl Harbor then became her homeport. In early 1941, Downes joined a cruise to Samoa, the Fiji Islands, and Australia, then visited the west coast later in the year. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Downes was in dry-dock with the battleship Pennsylvania and the destroyer Cassin. Both destroyers were {{at the southern end}} of the dock when an incendiary bomb struck Downes, setting unstoppable fires on both ships. Cassin <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> blocks and rolled over onto the burning Downes, and Downes was later decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|Veronica has a {{dream that}} she {{woke up in the}} middle of the winter with Logan, but she is plagued with visions of Madison. When she wakes up, she goes to the Hearst library, where Tim Foyle’s (James Jordan) girlfriend, Bonnie, asks her to {{investigate}} who <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> RU-486, which caused a miscarriage. When Veronica presses Bonnie further, she reveals that Tim or Dick (Ryan Hansen) could be the father, although Tim has been very supportive. Veronica asks Logan point-blank whether Logan had sex with Madison over the winter, and he says yes, leading to a major fight, with Veronica saying she’ll never forgive him. Veronica speaks to Bonnie’s roommate, Phyllis (Toni Trucks), who reiterates that Tim is being very supportive. Veronica successfully breaks into Tim’s office to investigate before realizing she doesn’t have the password. After Keith comforts Veronica due to her breakup, she bugs Tim’s office.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Gable {{got along}} well with his co-stars during filming. Gable was great friends with actress Hattie McDaniel, {{and he even}} <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> a real {{alcoholic}} drink during the scene {{in which they were}} supposed to be celebrating the birth of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter. Gable tried to boycott the premiere of Gone with the Wind in Atlanta, Georgia, because the African American McDaniel was not permitted to attend. He reportedly only went after she pleaded with him to go. Gable remained friends with McDaniel, and he always attended her Hollywood parties, especially when she was raising funds during World War II.|$|E

500|$|She {{was still}} in dry dock when the United States {{declared}} war on Germany on 6 April 1917. On 10 July, she {{was assigned to the}} 4th Battleship Division (4th BatDiv) and was tasked primarily with training naval personnel in the Chesapeake Bay. In September 1918, she was assigned to convoy escort duty, with the first such mission on 6 September. The ship departed with her sister ship [...] and the dreadnought [...] to protect a fast HX troopship convoy. On 16 September, the three battleships left the convoy in the Atlantic and steamed back to the United States, while other escorts brought the convoy into port. On the 17th, South Carolina <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> starboard propeller, which forced her to reduce speed to [...] using only the port shaft. Kansas and New Hampshire remained with South Carolina to escort her back to port. Convoy duty did not last long, as the Germans signed the Armistice that ended the war on 11 November.|$|E
2500|$|Worsening weather {{gave all}} {{signs of an}} {{approaching}} typhoon; and Vigilance was forced to anchor in various berths at Wakanoura Wan, off Honshū, between the 16th and 19th. As the storm reached its climax before dawn on the 18th, [...] dragged her anchors and drifted down toward Vigilance's berth. The minesweeper <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> anchor and chain {{in an effort to}} avoid a collision; but the [...] wind pushed the LST inexorably toward the minecraft. Soon there came the crunch of steel on steel as the landing ship crashed into the minesweeper's starboard side, forward, bending in the bulwarks near the bow.|$|E
2500|$|After {{almost four}} years, Elliott {{came out of}} {{retirement}} {{on the national level}} on Saturday October 28, 1989, when she raced the ABA's Fall National in Yorba Linda, Californiaapparently {{for the fun of it}} due to her ABA BMX Hall of Fame induction the following November. She probably thought she would be at the ABA Grand Nationals anyway for her acceptance speech, why not race as well? Other reports have it that Elliott was lured out of retirement by the Bicycle Center bicycle shop as a [...] "spoiler" [...] to better position other Bicycle Center racers to take various titles. Whatever the reason, prior to the Fall Nationals she was seen practicing at the Roseville, California Oak Creek BMX track. She dominated the 15 & Over girls' class at the Fall Nationals on Saturday. However, she <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> pedals in the Main and finished in seventh place—last, in this case—in the main. On Sunday, she again came in last (out of six) in the main.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 July 1945 the XE3 was towed to {{the area}} by the {{submarine}} Stygian. She <b>slipped</b> <b>her</b> tow at 23:00 for the forty-mile journey through hazardous wrecks, minefields and listening posts to reach the Takao. After arriving at the Takao at 13:00 on 31 July 1945. Magennis {{slipped out of the}} wet-and-dry chamber and he attached limpet mines to the Japanese cruiser Takao under particularly difficult circumstances. He had to chip away at barnacles {{on the bottom of the}} cruiser for 30 minutes before being able to attach the limpets. During this time his breathing apparatus was leaking and he returned to the submarine after completion of his task very exhausted. On withdrawing, Lieutenant Ian Fraser found that one of the limpet carriers which was being jettisoned would not release itself. Magennis immediately volunteered to free it commenting: [...] "I'll be all right as soon as I've got my wind, Sir". This he did, after seven minutes of nerve-racking work with a heavy spanner. On completion Magennis returned to XE3 for the second time, allowing the four man midget submarine to make its escape out to open sea to meet the waiting Stygian.|$|E
