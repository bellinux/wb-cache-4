5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted. Lacking sufficient reinforcements, {{the command of}} Army Group North {{made the decision to}} shorten the front line by evacuating the Demyansk Pocket <b>salient.</b> The <b>salient</b> had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as it was an important strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev <b>salient</b> (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it could potentially be used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in the situation that had developed, retaining it was no longer possible.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk <b>salient</b> to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the <b>salient.</b> As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk <b>salient</b> before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern <b>salient</b> until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E

50|$|In trench warfare, <b>salients</b> are {{distinctly}} {{defined by}} the opposing lines of trenches, and they were commonly formed {{by the failure of}} a broad frontal attack. The static nature of the trenches meant that forming a pocket was difficult, but the vulnerable nature of <b>salients</b> meant that they were often the focus of attrition battles.|$|R
5|$|On 12 July the Soviets {{launched}} Operation Kutuzov, their counter-offensive {{upon the}} Orel <b>salient,</b> which threatened the flank and rear of Model's 9th Army. The 12th Panzer Division, thus far held in reserve and {{slated to be}} committed to the northern side of the Kursk <b>salient,</b> along with the 36th Motorized Infantry, 18th Panzer and 20th Panzer Divisions were redeployed to face the Soviet spearheads.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, 9 July, {{a meeting of}} the commanders of the German forces on the northern side of the Kursk <b>salient</b> concluded that a breakthrough on the northern side of the <b>salient</b> was unlikely. Nevertheless, they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties, thereby tying down the Soviet forces there. Any level of success for Operation Citadel now depended on a breakthrough being achieved by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf on the southern side of the Kursk <b>salient.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operation Citadel {{called for}} a double envelopment, {{directed}} at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders of five armies and seal off the <b>salient.</b> Army Group Centre would provide General Walter Model's 9th Army to form the northern pincer. It would cut through the northern face of the <b>salient,</b> driving south to the hills east of Kursk, securing the rail line from Soviet attack. Army Group South would commit the 4th Panzer Army, under Hermann Hoth, and Army Detachment Kempf, under Werner Kempf, to pierce the southern face of the <b>salient.</b> This force would drive north to meet the 9th Army east of Kursk. Von Manstein's main attack was to be delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps under Paul Hausser. The XLVIII Panzer Corps, commanded by Otto von Knobelsdorff, would advance on the left while Army Detachment Kempf would advance on the right. The 2nd Army, {{under the command of}} Walter Weiss, would contain the western portion of the <b>salient.</b>|$|E

40|$|Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) can be {{considered}} as a Large Technical System (LTS) which continues to grow. However, on the other hand, Schiphol airport faces some important factors which could impede the growth of the system, including: noise pollution and limited space. Such examples raise questions about how Amsterdam Airport Schiphol addresses apparent limits to its growth. In innovation studies, Large Technical System theory offers interesting insights on how large technical systems develop by means of three core concepts: momentum, reverse <b>salients</b> and critical problems. An emerging body of literature emphasizes the importance to understand these concepts for innovation. However, unfortunately, existing research still lacks some clarity on how reverse <b>salients</b> are converted into critical problems and how the concepts can be measured. Drawing upon a causal framework of analysis developed by Thomas Hughes, this research explores whether and how the evolution of AAS as LTS can be explained in terms of momentum, reverse <b>salients</b> and critical problems. The aim of this research is twofold. First, it seeks to explore possibilities on how the concepts of momentum, reverse <b>salients</b> and critical problems could be better measured. Second, it explores how momentum, reverse <b>salients</b> and critical problems are related to each other. This research combines the use of both quantitative and qualitative research. The quantitative research explores potential measures of momentum, reverse <b>salients</b> and critical problems. The qualitative part of research investigates the relationships between the concepts by means of a detailed historical account of the forces that have resulted in the continuous growth of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol...|$|R

5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and {{an assault on}} the Rzhev <b>salient</b> near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a <b>salient</b> in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E

25|$|According to this view, the Imperial Roman {{army had}} relied on {{neutralizing}} imminent barbarian incursions {{before they reached}} the imperial borders. This was achieved by stationing units (both legions and auxilia) right on the border and establishing and garrisoning strategic <b>salients</b> beyond the borders (such as the Agri Decumates in SW Germany). The response to any threat would thus be a pincer movement into barbarian territory: large infantry and cavalry forces from the border bases would immediately cross the border to intercept the coalescing enemy army; simultaneously the enemy would be attacked from behind by crack Roman cavalry (alae) advancing from the strategic <b>salient(s).</b> This system obviously required first-rate intelligence {{of events in the}} barbarian borderlands, which was provided by a system of watch towers in the strategic <b>salients</b> and by continuous cross-border scouting operations (explorationes).|$|R

5|$|On 13 March, Hitler signed Operational Order No. 5, which {{authorised}} several offensives, {{including one}} against the Kursk <b>salient.</b> As the last Soviet resistance in Kharkov petered out, Manstein attempted to persuade Günther von Kluge, commander of Army Group Centre, to immediately attack the Central Front, which was defending the northern face of the <b>salient.</b> Kluge refused, believing that his forces were too weak to launch such an attack. Further Axis advances were blocked by Soviet forces that had been shifted down from the Central Front to the area north of Belgorod.

5|$|Operation Medak Pocket {{took place}} in a <b>salient</b> south of Gospić, from September 9–17. The {{offensive}} was undertaken by the Croatian army to stop Serbian artillery in the area from shelling nearby Gospić. The operation met its stated objective of removing the artillery threat, as Croatian troops overran the <b>salient,</b> but it was marred by war crimes. The ICTY later indicted Croatian officers for war crimes. The operation was halted amid international pressure, and an agreement was reached that the Croatian troops were to withdraw to positions held prior to September 9, while UN troops were to occupy the <b>salient</b> alone. The events that followed remain controversial, as Canadian authorities reported that the Croatian army intermittently fought against the advancing Canadian Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry before finally retreating after sustaining 27 fatalities. The Croatian ministry of defense and UN officer's testimonies given during the Ademi-Norac trial deny that the battle occurred.|$|E
