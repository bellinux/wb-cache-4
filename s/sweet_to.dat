In comparison to Australian Riesling, New Zealand produces lighter and more delicate wines that range from <b>sweet</b> <b>to</b> dry. Home of cool climate wines, Central Otago, has recently emerged as another area producing terroir driven wines.|$|E

Match referee Clive Lloyd adjudged the application of an energy <b>sweet</b> <b>to</b> the ball as a deliberate offence, although Dravid himself denied this was his intent. Lloyd emphasised that television footage caught Dravid putting a lozenge on the ball during the Zimbabwean innings on Tuesday night at the Gabba. According to the ICC's Code of Conduct, players are not allowed to apply substances to the ball other than sweat and saliva. Dravid was fined half of his match fee.|$|E

25|$|Oranges, whose flavor {{may vary}} from <b>sweet</b> <b>to</b> sour, are {{commonly}} peeled and eaten fresh or squeezed for juice. The thick bitter rind is usually discarded, {{but can be}} processed into animal feed by desiccation, using pressure and heat. It also is used in certain recipes as a food flavoring or garnish. The outermost layer of the rind can be thinly grated with a zester to produce orange zest. Zest is popular in cooking because it contains oils and has a strong flavor {{similar to that of}} the orange pulp. The white part of the rind, including the pith, is a source of pectin and has nearly the same amount of vitamin C as the flesh and other nutrients.|$|E

25|$|In Twilight, Edward meets Bella Swan, a human {{girl whose}} {{thoughts}} {{he is unable}} to read, and whose blood smells overwhelmingly <b>sweet</b> <b>to</b> him. Edward fights a growing attraction to Bella, but after saving her life on several occasions, he succumbs and eventually falls in love with her. Edward admits to Bella that he is a vampire, and that although he retains the physical body of a seventeen-year-old, he was actually born on June 20, 1901. His adoptive father, Carlisle Cullen, transformed him into a vampire in 1918 to prevent him from dying in the Spanish influenza epidemic in Chicago, Illinois by the request of Edward's mother who begged him to do whatever it took to save him. Carlisle instilled in him a sense of morality uncommon in most vampires, and central to his way of life is the refusal to consider humans as food.|$|E

500|$|While Nevin {{was with}} the Toros, the Astros asked Toros manager Rick <b>Sweet</b> <b>to</b> play Nevin as a left fielder, which would allow the Astros to promote Nevin sooner, as he and Caminiti could play {{different}} positions. Veteran first baseman Jim Lindeman served as Nevin's mentor, helping him keep his composure under significant attention and pressure to perform. Nevin started the 1993 season with a [...]247 batting average, but batted [...]309 with baserunners in scoring position and had 49 RBI. By July, he had made ten starts in left field, without committing an error. The Astros, however, were concerned that Nevin did not apply the level of intensity he had in [...] "clutch" [...] situations to cases {{where there were no}} baserunners and the score was not close.|$|E
500|$|Caymmi was {{a lifelong}} friend of Bahian author Jorge Amado, and in 1945, he set one of Amado's {{politically}} driven poems to music {{to aid the}} senatorial campaign of Luís Carlos Prestes. In the late 1970s, Caymmi again took inspiration from Amado when he composed [...] "Modinha para a Gabriela" [...] ("A Little Song for Gabriela"), a musical adaptation of Amado's novel Gabriela, Cravo e Canela (Gabriela, Cloves and Cinnamon). Perhaps the best-known product of Caymmi and Amado's collaboration is the song [...] "É Doce Morrer no Mar" [...] ("It's <b>Sweet</b> <b>to</b> Die in the Sea"), which the two wrote over dinner one night at Amado's home. Other songs they co-wrote include [...] "Beijos pela Noite" [...] ("Kisses Through the Night"), [...] "Modinha para Teresa Batista" [...] ("A Little Song for Teresa Batista"), [...] "Retirantes" [...] ("Migrants"), and [...] "Essa Nega Fulô" [...] ("This Feisty Dark Lady").|$|E

The review was concluded with the consensus the Kesha's debut [...] "reveals a knack for getting the party started." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News called the song [...] "a vintage lick of dance candy too tooth-rottingly <b>sweet</b> <b>to</b> resist" [...] that featured a [...] "stabbing synthesizer hook". Fraser McAlpine of the BBC, giving the single four {{out of a possible}} five stars, called it a [...] "dirty little ditty" [...] that had [...] "'hit' written all over it".

500|$|Legal {{action has}} been taken against Noel Gallagher and Oasis for {{plagiarism}} on three separate occasions. The first {{was the case of}} Neil Innes (formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and the Rutles) suing to prove the Oasis song [...] "Whatever" [...] borrowed from his song [...] "How <b>Sweet</b> <b>to</b> Be an Idiot". Innes was eventually awarded royalties and a co-writer credit. Noel Gallagher claimed in 2010 that the plagiarism was unintentional and he was unaware of the similarities until informed of Innes's legal case. In the second incident, Oasis were also sued by Coca-Cola and forced to pay $500,000 in damages to the New Seekers after it was alleged that the Oasis song [...] "Shakermaker" [...] had lifted words and melody from [...] "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing". When asked about the incident, Noel Gallagher joked [...] "Now we all drink Pepsi." [...] On the third and final occasion, when promotional copies of (What's the Story) Morning Glory? were originally distributed, they contained a previously unreleased bonus song called [...] "Step Out". This promotional CD was quickly withdrawn and replaced with a version that omitted the controversial song, which was allegedly similar to the Stevie Wonder song [...] "Uptight (Everything's Alright)". [...] "Step Out" [...] later reappeared as the B-side to [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger", albeit now listing [...] "Wonder, et. al" [...] as co-writers.|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and <b>sweet</b> <b>to</b> the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?" ...|$|E
500|$|Gender studies {{critics have}} argued that Rosaline's name {{suggests}} that Romeo never really forgets her but rather replaces her with Juliet. [...] Thus, when Juliet cries [...] "What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet," [...] she is ironically expressing Romeo's own view {{of her as a}} substitute for Rosaline. [...] That is to say, Rosaline, replaced in name only by Juliet, is just as <b>sweet</b> <b>to</b> Romeo. Gender critics also note that the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing Rosaline are similar to the themes of Shakespeare's procreation sonnets. In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be equated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreate—a duty he owes to society. [...] Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, similarly bringing no hope of offspring. [...] As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. [...] Rosaline reveals similarities to the subject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity. [...] Her name may be referred to in the first sonnet when the young man is described as [...] "beauties Rose." [...] This line ties the young man to both Rosaline and Romeo in Juliet's [...] "What's in a name?" [...] soliloquy. [...] When Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.|$|E
