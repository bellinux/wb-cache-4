40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard <b>plough,</b> 3 <b>furrow</b> <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> mouldboard <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for mouldboard and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughs,</b> while draught force of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> and <b>disc</b> harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased. Comparing the costs of complete tillage systems it was observed that minimum tillage decreases the operational cost per hectare by 30 % compared to a conventional system based on ploughing. Direct drilling is the cheapest way to establish a crop, but if herbicide has to be applied the cost per hectare {{is similar to that of}} minimum tillage. The costs of different sizes (102, 162, 224 kW tractors) of alternative tillage systems are similar. Namely the cost of mouldboard plough is £ 80. 33 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 48 /- 1. 93 /ha, the cost of shallow mouldboard plough is £ 68. 85 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 02 /- 1. 64 /ha, the cost of stubble cultivator is £ 42. 05 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 02 /- 1. 27 /ha, the cost of direct drill is £ 20. 76 /ha with a range of £ + 0. 89 /- 0. 75 /ha and the cost of direct drill with herbicide application is £ 43. 15 /ha with a range of £ + 0. 41 /- 0. 53 /ha...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tillage {{is a very}} {{important}} crop production activity which may affect crop performance differently. An experiment was conducted during the during the 2009 and 2010 major crop growing seasons in Kumasi, Ghana, to compare the effect of four different tillage practices on Asontem cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp) performance. The treatments consisted of <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> only, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing, disc harrowing only and no tillage. There was significant difference in Asontem cowpea growth, dry matter yield and yield components between tillage practices. <b>Disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing gave the best results producing the highest percentage seedling emergence, tallest plant, biggest stem girth and greatest number of leaves. Furthermore, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing resulted in the longest root length, highest dry matter yield, highest number of pods per plant, highest number of seeds per pod and highest 1000 seed-weight. The no tillage plots produced the shortest plant, smallest stem girth and smallest number of leaves. In addition, the no tillage plots gave the shortest root length, lowest dry matter yield, smallest number of pods per plant, smallest number of seeds per pod and smallest 1000 seed-weight. Therefore, considering the soil and weather conditions of the experiment the best tillage practice for Asontem cowpea growth and yield is <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing...|$|R

Two-year field experiment was conducted in 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of different tillage methods on the physical properties of sandy loam soil, growth and yield of water melon (Citrullus vulgaris) in a semi-arid environment. The Tillage treatments were <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> plus <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH), double <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DDP), double <b>disc</b> harrowing (DDH), <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DP) and <b>disc</b> harrowing (DH) as minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) and direct drilling method (control). The watermelon seeds were Planted manually placing three (3) seeds per hole at an interval of 1. 5 m along the rows and 50 cm between the rows at an average depth of 5 cm. The treatments were laid in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Results showed that <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> + <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH) {{was found to be}} more appropriate and profitable tillage method in improving soil physical properties and growth and yield of water melon in a sandy loam soil. Watermelon yield, fruit weight (FW), fruit length (FL), fruit diameter (FD) and leaf area index (LAI) were significantly influenced (P= 0. 05), but influence of tillage treatments were not significant on the number of fruit per plant (NFPP). A numerical value of 31. 0 t/ha, 26. 0, 5. 4 kg, 29. 0 cm, and 33. 8 cm were recorded for maximum crop yield, NFPP, FW, FD and FL respectively in DP+DH-treated plots.

40|$|In {{grassland}} reserves, managed disturbance {{is often}} {{necessary to maintain}} plant species diversity. We carried out experiments to determine the impact of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> on grassland species richness and composition in a nature reserve in semi-arid eastern Australia. Vegetation response was influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn. Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In the fire experiment, species richness and composition recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on species richness and composition. Even <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> caused only a small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of the treatment, and {{the high degree of}} natural movement and cracking in these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community. However, the ability of the Astrebla- and Dichanthium-dominated grasslands to recover quickly after disturbance, given favourable seasonal conditions, suggests that they are well adapted to natural disturbances (e. g. droughts, fire, flooding and native grazing) ...|$|R

A survey and data collection were conducted via visits to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry- Department of Agricultural Engineering, the Sudanese Harvesters Company, Central Trading Company, Alneelain Insurance Co., the Agricultural Bank (Sudan), Hilat Kuku Souk for second hand agricultural machinery and the Central Bank of Sudan, beside interviews with agricultural machinery users in both public and private sectors.

Recently, multifractal analysis provided a new insight for describing the spatial configuration of soil surface roughness. The main {{objective of this}} study was to test the ability of multifractal parameters to assess decay of initial surface roughness induced by natural rainfall under different soil tillage systems in field conditions. In addition, we evaluated the potential of the joint use of multifractal indices plus RR to improve predictions of water storage in depressions of the soil surface (MDS). Field experiments were performed on an Oxisol at Campinas, São Paulo State (Brazil). Six tillage treatments, namely, <b>disc</b> harrow, <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> chisel <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow + <b>disc</b> level, <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> + <b>disc</b> level and chisel <b>plough</b> + <b>disc</b> level were tested. In each treatment soil surface micro-topography was measured four times, with increasing amounts of natural rainfall, using a pin meter. The sampling scheme was a square grid with 25 &times; 25 mm point spacing and the plot size was 1350 &times; 1350 mm (≈ 1. 8 m 2 ), so that each data set consisted of 3025 individual elevation points. Duplicated measurements were taken per treatment and date, yielding a total of 48 experimental data sets. MDS was estimated from grid elevation data with a depression-filling algorithm. Multifractal analysis was performed for experimental data sets as well as for oriented and random surface conditions obtained from the former by removing slope and slope plus tillage marks, respectively. All the investigated microplots exhibited multifractal behaviour, irrespective of surface condition, but the degree of multifractality showed wide differences between them. Multifractal parameters provided valuable information for characterizing the spatial features of soil micro-topography as they were able to discriminate data sets with similar values for the vertical component of roughness. Both, rough and smooth soil surfaces, with high and low roughness values, respectively, can display similar levels of spectral complexity. Although in most of the studied cases trend removal produces increasing homogeneity in the spatial configuration of height readings, spectral complexity of individual data sets may increase or decrease, when slope or slope plus tillage tool marks are filtered. Increased cumulative rainfall had significant effects on various parameters from the generalized dimension, Dq, and singularity spectrum, f(α). Overall, micro-topography decay by rainfall produced was reflected on a shift of the singularity spectra, f(α) from the left side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the right side (q&lt;&lt; 0) and also on a shift of the generalized dimension spectra from the right side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the left side (q&lt;&lt; 0).

Dentro dos vários componentes da folhada, as folhas foram o que mais contribuíram para o seu total, em todos os tratamentos, seguindo-se os ouriços e a castanha. A maior produção de castanha obtevese no T 3, seguindo-se o T 2 e o T 1. A maior produção de frutos no T 2 em relação ao T 1 pode, provavelmente, ser atribuída ao facto de o escarificador ser mais {{prejudicial}} ao sistema radical que a grade de discos. A quantidade total de nutrientes na folhada foi menor no T 1, o que está relacionado não só com a menor quantidade de folhada produzida, mas também com a concentração em nutrientes nos vários componentes da folhada. Em geral, esta concentração foi mais baixa nos componentes recolhidos no T 1, principalmente nas folhas. The {{objectives of}} this study were to determine the influence of different soil tillage systems on chestnut tree (Castanea sativa) productivity. The plots, established in Macedo de Cavaleiros, were given to three treatments: chisel ploughing, three times per year (traditional system) (T 1), minimum tillage with <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> twice a year (T 2) and zero tillage (T 3). Vegetation was controlled either by sheep or by cutting. Litter was collected from April 1996 to March 1999. The largest litterfall production was obtained in T 3, which {{may be related to the}} fact of roots not being damaged. In all treatments, leaves made the highest contribution to total litter, followed by burs and nuts. In relation to the chestnut fruit, the highest production was obtained in T 3, followed by T 2 and T 1. The largest nut production in T 2 than in T 1 may be related to the more damaging effect that chisel ploughing has on the root system when compared to <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In general, the lowest nutrient concentration occurred in T 1, which is related not only with the lower litter production but also with the nutrient concentration in the different litterfall components. In general, it was the lowest in T 1, mainly in leaves...|$|R
40|$|Generally, the measurement, {{evaluation}} and optimisation of furrow irrigation {{is restricted to}} a <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> or small number of adjacent furrows. The measurement process is too intensive to be applied at the full field scale. Consequently {{it is necessary to}} assume that the infiltration characteristics and inflow rates of the measured furrow(s) represent the remainder of the field. Many people have observed or speculated upon the significance of spatial variability but few outline potential strategies to deal with the issue. Clearly, a new approach was required. Research conducted by the authors and others at the NCEA has investigated and developed potential tools and techniques to better evaluate surface irrigation accounting for spatial and temporal variability. A trial was conducted in a typical commercial cotton field to showcase the tools and techniques to evaluate and optimise irrigation performance at the field scale. The resulting data also provided an insight into the nature of spatial variability. Complete inflow, advance and runoff measurements were used to accurately determine soil infiltration rates for a small number of <b>furrows.</b> <b>Single</b> advance points were then used to predict the infiltration characteristics across the remainder of the field. Combined with the whole field simulation model IrriProb this data enabled evaluation of th...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} enamel-coating on the draught {{performance}} of an animal-drawn mouldboard plough was studied. A <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> swing mouldboard plough-Maun Series, {{and the same}} type enamel-coated plough both ox-drawn, are compared under similar working conditions such as soil moisture content, depth and width of cut and approximately constant speed of ploughing.

The percentage reduction of the plough draught for enamel-coated plough compared to uncoated plough varied from 12. 7 % at 25 % soil moisture content to 18. 1 % at 32 % soil moisture content (dry basis). It was also found that the percentage reduction of the specific draught achieved with the enamel-coated plough in comparison with the uncoated plough varied from 20. 3 % at 32 % soil moisture content to 25. 7 % at 25 % soil moisture content (dry basis) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on the {{availability}} and conditions of agricultural machinery (tractors, tillage implements, combines, planters, sprayers and threshers) in Borno State of Nigeria. A questionnaire was administered to collect information from various agricultural organisations. The state had 16 types of machinery {{with a total of}} 1, 377, as at 1998. Out of this number, 75 % were functional. The private sector possessed a higher number of agricultural machinery, both total and functional. The total number of machines in the sector was 778, out of which 83 % were functional. In the public sector, 599 machines were identified, out of which 64 % were functional. Tractors, disc harrows and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughs</b> dominated both the private and public sectors, as tillage was the main operation being mechanised in the state. The distribution of agricultural machinery among the 27 local government areas (LGAs) in the state was not even. Machinery was concentrated in Maiduguri, Marte and Biu Local Government Councils: where the major agricultural establishments and private farms were located. There are not enough agricultural machines in the state, not even those required for tillage, and the level of mechanisation is consequently too low. The article suggests ways to improve the availability of functional machinery in Borno State so as to boost its agricultural production...|$|R
40|$|Tractive force models at {{different}} tillage speeds were developed using dimensional analysis, describing the tractor tyre - soil interaction. In this research study, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> on an experimental plot at twenty different soil moisture levels in {{loamy sand soil}} was carried out using trace tractor techniques. The independent variables: drawbar pull force, rolling (motion) resistance, wheel slip, moisture content, cone index, wheel numeric, contact pressure, speed, width of plough, depth of plough, and dependent variable (Tractive force) were measured and compared to computed values. High coefficients of determination R 2 = 0. 9492, 0. 9555 and 0. 9447 for ploughing at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were obtained respectively. Standard errors of 0. 3672552, 0. 8628 and 0. 8047 and the percentage (%) errors of - 2. 272608059 and 2. 45655144,- 2. 304946155 and 2. 523126085,- 1. 424947801 and 2. 020155232 at minimum and maximum values, were obtained. These results are clear evidence of the test of goodness of fit of the models between predictive and measured parameters for ploughing {{at different}} tillage speeds.

The variables: draw-bar pull force, moisture content, cone index, tractor forward speeds, widths of cut and depths of cut were measured. In determining the effect of moisture content and forward speeds on draught forces, results revealed that at lowest moisture content of 1. 53 % draught forces of 4688. 33 N, 5708. 33 N and 6758. 33 N at tractor forward speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 2 m/s and 2. 5 m/s, were obtained.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the role of El Rawashda Natural Forest Reserve as a natural rangeland and the impact of grazing in terms of deforestation and replacement of palatable species by unpalatable species and the possibilities of finding solutions to these problems. Two types of data were user for this study; namely, primary and secondary data which were collected during the period 2008 - 2009. The primary data were collected through social survey as faceto- face interviews with pastoralists and local communities in the study area and by a field experiment on an area of 20 feddans and affected by grazing in the forest. The experimental area was divided into 5 blocks, each block consisted of 4 treatments, namely, seeds of grass and talih (Acacia seyal) were broadcast seeding just before autumn, seeding after <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing,</b> sowing using water harvesting technique and a control (no seeding). The secondary data were collected from the Range and Pasture Administration and the Forest National Corporation (FNC). There were distinct ecological changes in the study area as indicated by the deterioration of the rangelands and retrogression where some palatable weed species disappeared from the study area and were replaced by other unpalatable species due to open grazing pressure, illegal tree felling by the local people and expansion in the rain fed mechanized agricultural schemes due. Moreover, overgrazing represents a real challenge to the conservation and rehabilitation of El Rawashda Forest in the absence of proper protection and management. In addition, the number of animals is more than the carrying capacity of the forest and this resulted in the disappearance of some palatable species and the appearance of new VI unpalatable one. Frequent drought cycles (climate change and variability) and fires also contributed to the deterioration of the forest. The results of the experiment revealed significant differences among some treatments used to improve and tree cover. The seeding of the forage and talh seeds after <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> gave the best results compared to other treatments, followed by forage and talh seed sowing under water harvesting technique and broadcasting of forage and trees seeds and finally the control. In conclusion the deterioration of the natural rangelands in El Rawasha Forest Reserve is due to the existence of livestock in the forest area for a long period of time. This resulted in retrogression where palatable species were replaced by less or unpalatable species. The best method for the rehabilitation of the forest is the adoption of forage and talh seeds broadcasting with <b>ploughing</b> using <b>disc</b> harrow. Consequently, it is a must to rely on the disc harrow and the adoption of water harvesting and broadcasting of forage and talh seeds for the rehabilitation of El Rwashda Forest Reserv...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between urease activity (UA) and soil organic matter (SOM), microbial biomass N (Nbiom) content, and urea-N fertilizer assimilation by maize in a Dark Red Latosol (Typic Haplustox) cultivated for 9 years under no-tillage (NT), tillage with a <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> (DP), and tillage with a moldboard plough (MP). Two soil depths were sampled (0 - 7. 5 cm and 7. 5 - 15 cm) at 4 different times during the crop cycle. Urea was applied at four different rates, ranging from 0 to 240 kg N ha- 1. The levels of fertilizer N {{did not affect the}} UA, SOM content, and Nbiom content. No significant difference between the treatments (NT, DP, and MP) was observed for SOM during the experiment, probably because the major part of the SOM was in recalcitrant pools, since the area was previously cultivated (conventional tillage) for 20 years. The Nbiom content explained 97 nd 69 f the variation in UA in the upper and deeper soil layer, respectively. UA and biomass N were significantly higher in the NT system compared to the DP and MP systems. The highest maize productivity and urea-N recovery was also observed for the NT system. We observed that the increase in urea-N losses under NT, possibly as a consequence of a higher UA, was compensated for by the increase in N immobilized in the biomass...|$|R
