50|$|In 1919, the Hoover <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> Company {{builds a}} plant in Hamilton. and Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Canada is established.|$|E
50|$|The {{timing was}} fortuitous: With the {{automobile}} gaining popularity, William Hoover {{was concerned about}} the market for his horse collars and harnesses, and was eager to diversify. In 1908 he bought Spangler's patent, and he soon had a small staff toiling {{in the corner of his}} leather shop, turning out six <b>suction</b> <b>sweepers</b> a day. William Hoover made further improvements to the vacuum cleaner that resembled a bagpipe attached to a cake box, a novel look that was very functional. Sluggish sales of the Hoover vacuum cleaner were given a kick by Hoover’s ten-day, free home trial. Hoover came up with the idea of door-to-door salesmen who gave home demonstrations of the new vacuum cleaners. Hoover's success means that most people today associate the vacuum cleaner with him, rather than with Spangler.|$|R
50|$|Spangler, with $5000.00 {{invested}} by a friend, {{formed the}} Electric <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> Company. Ray Harned, nephew and financial representative of F.G. and W.H. Folwell, formed {{a partnership with}} Spangler {{in the fall of}} 1907. The Folwells had financed Zollingers and were financing Spangler who had filed an application for a patent in September 1907. However, in just a few months, finances were gone. Spangler didn't have the capital to mass-produce his gadget. So he showed the <b>suction</b> <b>sweeper</b> to his cousin Susan Hoover, who tried it, liked it, and extolled its virtues to her husband, William Hoover, a leather-goods manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|Spangler {{then gave}} {{one of his}} Electric Suction Sweepers to his cousin Susan Troxel Hoover (1846-1925), who used it at home. Impressed with the machine, she told her husband and son about it. William Henry [...] "Boss" [...] Hoover (August 18, 1849 - February 25, 1932) and son Herbert William Hoover Sr. (October 30, 1877 - September 16, 1954) were leather goods {{manufacturers}} in North Canton, Ohio, {{which at the time}} was called New Berlin. [...] Hoover's leather goods business was not too threatened by the introduction of the motor car, but seeing a marketing opportunity, Hoover bought the patent from Spangler in 1908, founding the Electric <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> Company with $36,000 capital, retaining Spangler as production supervisor with pay based on royalties in the new business. Spangler continued to contribute to the company, patenting numerous further <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> designs until his death in 1915, when the company name was changed to the Hoover <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> Company, with Spangler's family continuing to receive royalties from his original patent until 1925.|$|E
50|$|After Spangler {{sold the}} patents to William Hoover, {{he stayed on}} with the Hoover Company as the superintendent. Spangler's wife and {{daughter}} (Jennie Spangler Painter) made all the bags for the sweepers until 1914 when the bag making was taken to New Berlin. His son, Clarence, worked {{for about a year}} with The Electric <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> Co. in New Berlin. He became very ill and died in December 1911.|$|E
50|$|James Murray Spangler (November 20, 1848 - January 22, 1915) was an American inventor, {{salesman}} and janitor {{who invented}} the first commercially successful portable electric vacuum cleaner that revolutionized household carpet cleaning. His device {{was not the first}} vacuum cleaner. However, Spangler's device was the first that was practical for home use. It was the first to use both a cloth filter bag and cleaning attachments. Spangler improved this basic model and received a patent for it in 1908. He formed the Electric <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> Company to manufacture his device. William H. Hoover was so impressed with the vacuum cleaner that he bought into Spangler's business and patents.|$|E
50|$|The first upright {{vacuum cleaner}} was invented in June 1908 by Canton, Ohio {{department}} store janitor and occasional inventor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915). Spangler was an asthmatic, and suspecting the carpet sweeper he was using at work {{was the cause of}} his ailment, he created a basic suction-sweeper by mounting an electric fan motor on a Bissell brand carpet sweeper then adding a soap box and a broom handle. After refining the design and obtaining a patent for the Electric <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> he set about producing it himself, assisted by his son, who helped him assemble the machines, and his daughter, who assembled the dust bags. Production was slow, just two to three machines completed a week.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906 James B. Kirby {{developed}} his {{first of many}} vacuums called the [...] "Domestic Cyclone". It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions {{came to be known}} as the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915) of Canton, Ohio invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner, obtaining a patent for the Electric <b>Suction</b> <b>Sweeper</b> on June 2, 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer William Henry Hoover (1849-1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the Hoover Company. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the beater bar in 1919 ("It beats as it sweeps as it cleans"), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.|$|E
