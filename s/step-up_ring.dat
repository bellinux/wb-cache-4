5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 'Diana' labeled cameras, there are over fifty similar variants of the basic design, {{some of which may}} have been produced by other factories and/or manufacturers. The camera was sold under a variety of model names, often accomplished by merely affixing a different stick-on label to the same product. [...] In other cases, slight modifications to the basic design were incorporated. Some Diana clones use a slightly different molding and plastic composition, while other models have a 'bulb' setting for time exposures. Other variants incorporate a 6Ã—6 cm negative size (like the Diana Deluxe), while others have provision for different controls or even separate flash illumination. The 3 aperture version of the classic Diana/Diana clone has apertures of , , and , and it takes 32 mm clip-on filters. The Diana Deluxe variant offers , , and , and takes a 46-49 mm <b>step-up</b> <b>ring,</b> unusual for such a low-end camera. The modern Diana F+ offers four apertures, including a pinhole. Shutter speed is often variable due to manufacturing vagaries, and can vary from 1/200th to 1/30th of a second. [...] As there is no shutter lock, and the shutter mechanism is always held in tension by a spring, multiple exposures with the Diana can be achieved by multiple operations of the shutter release without advancing the film.|$|E
50|$|Step Up/ShadeThe Step Up/Shade {{was created}} {{to fill the gap}} of Lensbaby lenses {{incompatibility}} with standard <b>step-up</b> <b>rings.</b> This Step Up/Shade is 37-52mm and will fit on any of Lensbaby's 37mm threaded optics and allows for any 52mm filter to be screwed onto the front of the Step Up/Shade.|$|R
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of neutral-density filters {{is that to}} be entirely flexible in your shooting you need to carry a range of different NDs. This can become an expensive proposition, especially if using screw filters with different lens filter sizes, which would require carrying a set for each diameter of lens carried (although inexpensive <b>step-up</b> <b>rings</b> can eliminate this requirement). To counter this problem, some manufacturers have created variable ND filters. These work by placing two polarizing filters together, {{at least one of}} which can rotate. The rear polarizing filter cuts out light in one plane. As the front element is rotated, it cuts out an increasing amount of the remaining light, the closer the front filters comes to being perpendicular to the rear filter. By using this technique, the amount of light reaching the sensor can be varied with almost infinite control.|$|R
40|$|In {{this this}} paper, an IP driver block was {{designed}} and simulation conducted for an AMOLED display which supplies power as selected by users. The IP driver design focused on the regulation of output power, due to the OLED characteristic for diode electric current according to voltage, to be activate by pulse-skipping mode (PSM) under low loads, and 1. 5 MHz pulse-width modulation (PWM) for medium/high loads. The IP driver was designed to eliminate ringing effects appearing from the dis-continue mode (DCM) of the <b>step-up</b> converter. <b>Ringing</b> effects destroy the power switch within the IC, or increase EMI to the surrounding elements. The IP driver design minimized this through a ringing killer circuit. Mobile applications were considered to enable true shut-down capability by designing the standby current to fall below 1 uA for disable...|$|R
