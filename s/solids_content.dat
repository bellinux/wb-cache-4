25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For <b>solids</b> <b>content,</b> low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E
25|$|In high-ester pectins at soluble <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> above 60% and a pH-value between 2.8 and 3.6, {{hydrogen}} bonds and hydrophobic interactions bind the individual pectin chains together. These bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together. These form a 3-dimensional molecular net {{that creates the}} macromolecular gel. The gelling-mechanism is called a low-water-activity gel or sugar-acid-pectin gel.|$|E

The remaining liquid usually contains {{less than half of}} the original <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds. Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary treated sewage may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.|$|E

40|$|Determination of thermo-physical {{properties}} of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) juice {{is essential for}} examining, controlling, and developing numerical models of processes such as drying and concentrating. These properties are affected by changing the percentage of soluble <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> (oBrix) and temperature. Thermophysical {{properties of}} pomegranate juice including density, specific heat and thermal conductivity at temperature range from 25 to 70 oC and at the three levels of soluble <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> (12, 40 and 65 oBrix) were investigated in this research. Thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat were measured by co-axial cylinder, volumetric pycnometer and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), respectively. Results from regression analysis of output data showed that both temperature and <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> affected the thermo-physical properties of pomegranate juice; however, the soluble <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> exhibited a greater effect.

40|$|Abstract. Porous alumina ceramic was {{prepared}} using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) as foaming agent by the combination method of gel casting and foaming. The effect of <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> {{on the line}} shrinkage rate, the porosity, the fracture strength and the microscopic structure of porous aluminum ceramic were studied.

Low-ester pectins need calcium to form a gel, but can do so at lower soluble solids and higher pH-values than high-ester pectins.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} dry solids concentration {{has had a}} significant effect on the main operating variables. The steam flow increases with increasing black liquor dry <b>solids</b> <b>content.</b> Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of black liquor dry solids will be available in the furnace. The flue gas heat loss will decrease as the flue gas flow diminishes. Increasing black liquor dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by the flue gas flow.|$|E

It can be concluded that the content of PEG as a dispersing agent was 5 wt. %, dispersibility of zirconia powder and stability of slurry got its best, where viscosity of slurry improved correspondingly. <b>Solid</b> <b>content</b> of zirconia powder had an important impact on the rheological properties of slurry, when zirconia <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> was less than 30 %, the slurry showed as a pseudoplastic fluid, whereas the zirconia <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of slurry became 40 % and 50 % it exhibited plastic fluid characteristics. <b>Solid</b> <b>content</b> of slurry was 50 wt. %, the stability of slurry got the best...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{wastewater}} treatment {{is one of}} the attracting and common methods for {{wastewater treatment}} among the currently employed chemical unit processes. The use of coagulant-flocculant compound {{is one of the}} efficient methods for separating of paint and recovery of water. In this research, it was introduced and the effect of pH on removal of <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> from solution was studied experimentally. For this purpose, sludge and suspended <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of the solution were determined in a jar test by measurement of UV absorption of treated solution and solid separation percentage. The results showed that in pH range 9. 5 - 10. 5, maximum efficiency of <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> removal was up to 95 %. Consequently, maximum paint removal was obtained in this range of pH. The separation of <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of the solution was due to formation of aluminum hydroxide. As shown by the results, the reduction of potassium hydroxide as pH adjuster caused decrease of pH and consequently decrease of aluminum hydroxide and <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> removal...|$|R
25|$|The V-fold belt {{is similar}} to the belt filter press with the main {{difference}} being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.|$|E
25|$|Belt {{filters are}} less {{effective}} at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a digester, {{the use of}} belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs. Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the belt filter and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The belt filter needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time. Water and time wastage, {{as well as the}} associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using effluents.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> of the input material. Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{salinity}} on freeze/thaw conditioning of sludge {{with and without}} chemical addition were investigated in terms of specific resistance in filtration (SRF) and final <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of mechanical dewatering. The biological sludge was collected from a local sewage treatment plant. Three levels of salinity, 5000, 10 000, and 20 000 ppm were tested. Typical chemical coagulants such as alum, ferrous chloride, and polyelectrolytes were employed {{for some of the}} experiments at the optimal dosage. It was found that increasing salinity resulted an increase in SRF. For the range of the salinity tested, the SRF increased from 4 E 14 to about 8 E 12 m/kg. The chemical coagulants show insignificant effect on SRF. For the final <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of sludge, increase salinity from 5000 to 20 000 ppm can bring 3 - 4 % increase in sludge final <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> due to salting out effect. With chemical addition, the final <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of freeze/thawed sludge can only be increased slightly. Alum was found to be the best coagulant in increasing the final <b>solid</b> <b>content.</b> The nonionic polymer does not show any effect. It {{is interesting to note that}} at 20 000 ppm salinity, the final <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of freeze/thawed sludge is 34 % after adding chemicals. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E

2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of a belt press filter is often assessed {{based on the}} dry <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> of the product cake, solids recovery and lateral migration of sludge on the belt. Solids recovery is the percentage of dry solids recovered from the feed sludge. Solids recovery {{is dependent on the}} filter media which must be selected for good permeability to promote dewatering but with pore diameter sufficiently small so that solids recovery is not greatly decreased. It is important that the belt press filter has an effective belt washing section so that blinding does not decrease the permeability of the belt. Solids recovery is directly related to filtrate quality and thus the filter media and process arrangement must satisfy the desired cake and filtrate qualities. Dry <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> {{is a measure of the}} degree of dewatering. The degree of dewatering is increased when the belt speed is decreased. Lowering the belt speed reduces the capacity of the process. The following correlation relates input mass flow rate to belt speed: ...|$|E
2500|$|Cooling {{water systems}} are {{susceptible}} to fouling. Cooling water typically has a high total dissolved <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> and suspended colloidal solids. Localized precipitation of dissolved solids occurs at the heat exchange surface due to wall temperatures higher than bulk fluid temperature. Low fluid velocities (less than 3ft/s) allow suspended solids to settle on the heat exchange surface. Cooling water is typically on the tube side of a shell and tube exchanger because it's easy to clean. To prevent fouling, designers typically ensure that cooling water velocity is greater than [...] and bulk fluid temperature is maintained less than [...] Other approaches to control fouling control combine the “blind” application of biocides and anti-scale chemicals with periodic lab testing.|$|E
2500|$|Milk with {{a higher}} {{concentration}} of solids than normal milk may be used; the higher <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> produces a firmer yogurt. Solids can be increased by adding dried milk.

E. coli O157:H7 is easily destroyed by pasteurization (heating); the initial heating of the milk kills pathogens as well as denaturing proteins. The microorganisms that turn milk into yogurt can tolerate higher temperatures than most pathogens, so that a suitable temperature not only encourages the formation of yogurt, but inhibits pathogenic microorganisms. Once the yogurt has formed it can, if desired, be strained to reduce the whey content and thicken it.|$|E

In order to increase the slurry <b>solid</b> <b>content,</b> Tiron (1, 2 -dihydroxy- 3, 5 -benzene disulfonic acid disodium salt) was used as dispersant. To determine the optimum concentration of dispersant, the viscosity curves of alumina slurries containing different values of Tiron from 0 to 1. 2 wt. % (based on dry material weight) were studied. The optimum concentration of Tiron obtained for lowest viscosity was 0. 8 wt. %. Thus, the <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> in the slurry could be increased from 60 to 66 wt. %.

40|$|Experiments {{are done}} on lab scale with sludge from Garmerwolde and Heerenveen. The {{goal was to}} {{determine}} important differences between the sludges and coagulants. Garmerwolde sludge had a darker colour than Heerenveen sludge. It was also seen that Heerenveen sludge contained much more pollutions such as twigs and hairs. The odour of Heerenveen sludge was also much stronger. These differences {{can be explained by}} the fact that Garmerwolde sludge is digested and the organic material is therefore lower. An optimum dry <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> for Garmerwolde was not reached yet but with a dosage of 167. 5 g/kg sludge DSC, a dry <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of 30 % could be reached. However this dosage is too high to use it in practice. In the case of Heerenveen there was an optimum dry <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> with a dosage of 88. 5 g/kg sludge DSC. With this dosage a dry <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of 27 % is obtained. An improvement of the dry <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> is not acquired with the use of magnesium salts as coagulant. With both sludges it was seen that manually dewatering using a filter, was difficult. There were more flocs formed with MgCl 2 but still the water was more unclear than using FeCl 3. Probably the settle time needs to be increased if higher dry <b>solid</b> <b>contents</b> should be reached. Both sludges require a suitable dosage of coagulant and flocculant. Wrong amounts of coagulant and flocculant cause too large flocs. When the flocs are too thick, the sludge cake will be thicker as well because dewatering is difficult and the filtration resistance will increase. When the dosage of coagulant and flocculant is too low, it is not possible to obtain a sludge cake at all because of the absence of flocs. ...|$|R
