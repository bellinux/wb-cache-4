50|$|In electronics, soak testing {{may involve}} testing a system up to or above its maximum ratings {{for a long}} period of time. Some {{companies}} may <b>soak</b> <b>test</b> a product for a period of many months, while also applying external stresses such as elevated temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Soak {{tests are}} used {{primarily}} {{to check the}} reaction of a subject under test under a possible simulated environment for a given duration and for a given threshold.

5000|$|<b>Soak</b> <b>testing,</b> in {{the context}} of video games, {{involves}} leaving the game running for prolonged periods time in various modes of operation, such as idling, paused, or at the title screen. This testing requires no user interaction beyond initial setup, and is usually managed by lead testers. Automated tools may be used for simulating repetitive actions, such mouse clicks. Soaking can detect memory leaks or rounding errors that manifest only over time. <b>Soak</b> <b>tests</b> are one of the compliance requirements.|$|R
50|$|<b>Soak</b> <b>testing,</b> {{also known}} as {{endurance}} testing, is usually done {{to determine if the}} system can sustain the continuous expected load. During <b>soak</b> <b>tests,</b> memory utilization is monitored to detect potential leaks. Also important, but often overlooked is performance degradation, i.e. to ensure that the throughput and/or response times after some long period of sustained activity are as good as or better than {{at the beginning of the}} test. It essentially involves applying a significant load to a system for an extended, significant period of time. The goal is to discover how the system behaves under sustained use.|$|R
50|$|Before launch, most BalloonSats are {{required}} to undergo testing. These tests are designed to ensure the BalloonSat will function properly and return science results. The tests include a cold soak, drop test, function test, and weighing. The cold <b>soak</b> <b>test</b> simulates the intense cold temperatures the BalloonSat will experience during its mission. A launch and landing can be traumatic, therefore the drop test requires the BalloonSat to hold together and still function after an abrupt drop. The function test verifies the BalloonSat crew can prep the BalloonSat at the launch site.|$|E
50|$|It may be {{required}} to extrapolate the results, if not possible to conduct such an extended test. For example, if the system is required to process 10,000 transactions over 100 hours, {{it may be possible to}} complete processing the same 10,000 transactions in a shorter duration (say 50 hours) as representative (and conservative estimate) of the actual production use. A good <b>soak</b> <b>test</b> would also include the ability to simulate peak loads as opposed to just average loads. If manipulating the load over specific periods of time is not possible, alternatively (and conservatively) allow the system to run at peak production loads for the duration of the test.|$|E

40|$|The implantable {{electronic}} systems have changed our life greatly and provided crucial support {{for people who}} previously could not live an independent life otherwise. However, current implantable {{electronic systems}} are based on technologies more than 50 years old and more medical problems require advanced implantable electronic systems with small form factors and multiple electrodes. This work explores and evaluates possible alternatives of implantable electronic systems. Parylene, a widely used MEMS/CMOS process compatible material, {{is the cornerstone of}} this work. Parylene has been an ISO 10933 and USP Class VI certiﬁed biocompatible material. Parylene serves as the substrate and protective coating of the implantable electronic systems developed in this work. Thin ﬁlm pentacene is studied in this work and thin ﬁlm pentacene transistors are developed. The thin ﬁlm pentacene transistor uses Parylene as the ﬂexible substrate, the gate insulator and the protective coating. Studies of parylene surface are carried out. And based on this study, pentacene hole mobility is improved using spin-cast smoothing layers and top-contact conﬁgurations. To evaluate the long term reliability and stability of the thin ﬁlm pentacene transistors, saline <b>soaking</b> <b>tests</b> are performed. The results are less than satisfactory. In addition, thin ﬁlm amorphous silicon is studied and thin ﬁlm amorphous silicon transistors are developed. This thin-ﬁlm amorphous silicon uses Parylene HT®, a Parylene variant with high temperature stability, as the ﬂexible substrate. To evaluate the long term reliability and stability of the thin ﬁlm amorphous silicon transistor, room temperature saline <b>soaking</b> <b>tests</b> and 80 ◦ C accelerated saline <b>soaking</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out.

40|$|The {{cold test}} {{is one of}} the oldest and most {{acceptable}} vigour tests as it is used to simulate stress conditions commonly occurring in the field. In recent years, some of South Africa’s top maize hybrids, with high cold test scores, have shown emergence problems under cold, wet planting conditions. It resulted in major complaints from commercial maize producers with sizable claims involved. Therefore, the need arose to find a more sensitive vigour test that takes into account cold, wet conditions. In practice, South African maize producers would not plant if it is too cold and wet. However, cold, wet conditions are commonly experienced during planting time in the main maize production regions of South Africa, especially during October and even November. Furthermore, in most of the commercial maize production areas, such as the western Free State, chances of thunder and hailstorms are high during the planting period. These weather conditions are major causes for sudden drops in temperature and flooding which can expose maize seed and emerging maize seedlings to stress conditions The effects of cold, wet conditions on germination and emergence of nine maize hybrids were investigated in laboratory, glasshouse and field experiments. Growth chamber and glasshouse experiments were conducted under 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C and 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours flooding. Field experiments were conducted under different climatic conditions, resulting in cool and wet, cold and wet and favourable conditions during planting. The objectives were to investigate the correlations between different laboratory vigour tests and field emergence of maize hybrids under cold, wet conditions in order to identify the most suitable laboratory vigour test for predicting field emergence under cold, wet conditions. Eight different vigour tests were conducted and each was compared with field emergence under cold, wet conditions. The eight tests conducted, were the cold test, <b>soak</b> <b>test,</b> complex stressing vigour test, electrical conductivity test, accelerated ageing test, tetrazolium test, fast green test and emergence rate test. The <b>soak</b> <b>test</b> was the most sensitive vigour test when considering cold, wet conditions, as it measures seed germination, based on the warm test, after a 48 hour soak in water at 27 °C. Correlations found between the <b>soak</b> <b>test</b> and field emergence (53 %) under cold, wet conditions was unexpected, since the <b>soak</b> <b>test</b> does not account for low temperatures. The complex stressing vigour test was conducted to study the effect of fluctuating soaking temperatures on germination of maize seed. Seeds of nine maize hybrids were soaked for 48 hours at a moderate temperature (25 °C), followed by another 48 hours soak at a low temperature (5 °C), and then planted in sand and grown for 4 days at 25 °C, before evaluation. Highly significant correlations were found between the complex stressing vigour test and simulated field emergence under both controlled conditions in a glasshouse (89. 9 %) and cold, wet conditions in the field (90. 0 %). The complex stressing vigour test was the best test to predict field performance under a wide range of climatic conditions, especially cold, wet conditions. Implementation of the complex stressing test as a routine vigour test, will be to the advantage of maize seed companies, especially in being proactive in predicting emergence of maize hybrids under cold, wet conditions.

In the maritime industry, e. g. ships, {{many of the most}} important dynamic mechanical systems are located {{beneath the surface of the}} sea. Examples of equipment are thrusters, stern tubes and ship stabilizers. All these components are dependent on proper lubrication to perform optimally and secure a long service-life. In the interface between the seawater moving parts, a seal is required to separate the oil and seawater from each other. Due to new requirements, conventional mineral oil shall be exchanged with an environmentally acceptable lubricant (EAL). In this study dierent elastomers were tested against dierent steels (S 355 -steel and NiCrsteel) with two dierent oils (Shell Omala 68 and Kl uberbio EG 2 - 68). The motivation for performing the tests was to identify the tribological properties of the elastomers in the required EAL compared to the oil in use, and occurring mechanisms and the chemomechanical eects of the lubricants in interaction with the seal. The testing was performed at lab scale using a "Pin-on-plate" conguration in a tribomachine. To investigate the eect of the lubricants on the elastomers two <b>soaking</b> <b>tests</b> were performed, and soaked samples were tribologically evaluated. The result from this study showed that the conventional mineral oil give the lowest coecient of friction (COF) when comparing the two oils. When comparing the elastomers, NBR showed a lower COF than FKM. It was concluded that all the elastomers are operating in a boundary/mixed lubrication regime. NBR exhibit higher wear compared to FKM in most situations, exceptions are when adding abrasive particles (Silicon Carbides) to the lubricant and the contact pressure (CP) is low.

The PLLA/SiV film suppressed the early corrosion and enhanced cytocompatibility on metallic magnesium...|$|R
