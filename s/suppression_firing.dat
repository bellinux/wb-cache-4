30|$|It is {{important}} to understand that although absolute fire exclusion has been attempted, those attempts have not and never will be successful on a landscape or historical scale given the abundance of natural and human ignition sources within a combustible natural and human environment. One of the greatest paradoxes of fire suppression {{is that it is a}} significant source of human-caused fire reintroduction. Firing operations such as “burnout” and “backfires” are routine activities on every large wildland fire. Unfortunately, reintroducing fire through <b>suppression</b> <b>firing</b> operations often occurs under severe weather and adverse fuel conditions, resulting in high fire intensity and severity.|$|E
30|$|A more ecologically {{beneficial}} use for fuelbreaks {{would be to}} use them for fire reintroduction through proactive prescribed burning rather than reactive wildfire <b>suppression.</b> <b>Firing</b> operations conducted {{under the best of}} conditions instead of the worst would enable managers to have greater control over desired fire behavior and effects. Using fuelbreaks primarily for prescribed burning instead of solely for wildfire suppression would conceivably alter the design of fuelbreaks. For example, fuelbreaks proposed under the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act are up to 402 meters (0.25 mile) in width because they are intended for use in wildfire suppression during worst-case conditions, but fuelbreaks could conceivably be just a few meters in width if they were intended for use in prescribed burning during desired “best-case” conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Wildland fires have {{occurred}} for centuries in North America and other selected countries {{and can be}} segregated into three periods: prehistoric (presuppression) <b>fires,</b> <b>suppression</b> period <b>fires,</b> and fire management period fires. Prehistoric fires varied in size and damage but were probably viewed fatalistically. <b>Suppression</b> period <b>fires</b> were based on policy that excluded fire from many ecosystems where it played an important role; the view of fire as an undesirable wildland disturbance was fostered during this period. Recognition of fire’s roles led to a managed use of fire; however, large and disastrous fires still occur because of large fuel accumulations during the <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> period. <b>Fires</b> burning in vegetation have been termed “forest ” fires, or, more recently, “wildland ” fires. If these fires also involve structures, they have been termed “urban, ” “interface,” or “intermix; ” i. e., “urban/wildland ” fires. Although thes...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{resources}} invested in <b>fire</b> <b>suppression,</b> {{the impact of}} wildfires has considerably increased across the Mediterranean region since {{the second half of}} the 20 th century. Modulating <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> efforts in mild weather conditions is an appealing but hotly-debated strategy to use unplanned fires and associated fuel reduction to create opportunities for <b>suppression</b> of large <b>fires</b> in future adverse weather conditions. Using a spatially-explicit fire–succession model developed for Catalonia (Spain), we assessed this opportunistic policy by using two <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies that reproduce how firefighters in extreme weather conditions exploit previous fire scars as firefighting opportunities. We designed scenarios by combining different levels of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> efficiency and climatic severity for a 50 -year period (2000 – 2050). An opportunistic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> policy induced large-scale changes in fire regimes and decreased the area burnt under extreme climate conditions, but only accounted for up to 18 – 22 % of the area to be burnt in reference scenarios. The area suppressed in adverse years tended to increase in scenarios with increasing amounts of area burnt during years dominated by mild weather. Climate change had counterintuitive effects on opportunistic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies. Climate warming increased the incidence of large fires under uncontrolled conditions but also indirectly increased opportunities for enhanced <b>fire</b> <b>suppression.</b> Therefore, to shift <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> opportunities from adverse to mild years, we would require a disproportionately large amount of area burnt in mild years. We conclude that the strategi...|$|R

40|$|Available {{data show}} that future changes in global change drivers may lead to an {{increasing}} impact of fires on terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Yet, fire regime changes in highly humanised fire-prone regions are difficult to predict because fire effects may be heavily mediated by human activities We investigated the role of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies in synergy with climate change on the resulting fire regimes in Catalonia (north-eastern Spain). We used a spatially-explicit fire-succession model at the landscape level to test whether the use of different firefighting opportunities related to observed reductions in fire spread rates and effective fire sizes, and hence changes in the fire regime. We calibrated this model with data from a period with weak firefighting and later assess the potential for suppression strategies to modify fire regimes expected under different levels of climate change. When comparing simulations with observed fire statistics from an eleven-year period with firefighting strategies in place, our results showed that, at least {{in two of the}} three sub-regions analysed, the observed fire regime could not be reproduced unless taking into account the effects of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression.</b> <b>Fire</b> regime descriptors were highly dependent on climate change scenarios, with a general trend, under baseline scenarios without <b>fire</b> <b>suppression,</b> to large-scale increases in area burnt. <b>Fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies had a strong capacity to compensate for climate change effects.
