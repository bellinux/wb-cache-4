40|$|Directional {{relations}} are fundamental to spatial data queries, analysis and reasoning. Consequently {{there has been}} a significant amount of effort to determine directional relations between two regions. However, many existing methods do not perform well when the regions are neighboring or intertwined. In this paper we introduce a new model for directional relations which is based on a <b>splitting</b> <b>line</b> separating the two regions in question. We identify essential quality criteria for directional relation models and translate them into measurable properties of a given <b>splitting</b> <b>line.</b> We present an efficient algorithm that computes an optimal <b>splitting</b> <b>line</b> for two regions and perform extensive experiments. Our results show that the <b>splitting</b> <b>line</b> model captures directional relations very well and that it clearly outperforms existing approaches on pairs of neighboring or intertwined regions...|$|R

From the Anspach part of it (at that time in sore scarcity of cash) came Queen Caroline, famed in our George the Second's time. [See a Synoptic Diagram of these Genealogies, infra, p. 388a.] From it too came an unmomentous Margraf, who married a little Sister of Wilhelmina's and Fritz's; of whom we shall hear. There is lastly a still more unmomentous Margraf, only son of said Unmomentous and his said Spouse; who again combined the two Territories, Baireuth having failed of heirs; and who, himself without heirs, and with a frail Lady Craven as Margravine,--died at Hammersmith, close by us, in 1806; and so ended the troublesome affair. He had already, in 1791, sold off to Prussia all temporary claims of his; and let Prussia have the Heritage at once without waiting farther.

50|$|Although conical {{scanning}} allowed accurate {{measurement of the}} angle of the target, it did not directly indicate which direction to turn the antenna to center it - this could be seen in the rising and falling blip strength, but in practice this was far too fast to follow visually. For this purpose, the Mk. III adopted a display system known as a <b>split</b> <b>line</b> display on the CRTs. The output from the amplifiers was split into two output leads. One output is sent to the range display as normal. The second is fed into a mechanical switch that is synchronized to the rotation of the antenna, only connecting to a display input when the antenna is at certain points - when it is roughly horizontal it is sent to the bearing display, and when roughly vertical to the elevation display.|$|E

50|$|The {{duration}} of the Helical Camshaft is changed by moving the outer shaft of the coaxial arrangement in a lengthwise (or axial) direction. The helix angle of the Helical Camshaft is probably {{always going to be}} around 30 to 35 degrees. The helix angle has its origin in the width of the segment used (normally about 10 mm) and the 20-degree region of constant radius on the nose of the lobe (this usually measures about 7 mm in circumference). The diagonal <b>split</b> <b>line</b> across this area thus must generally be at about 35 degrees to the axis of the camshaft. This translates to a figure of around 3.5 (crankshaft) degrees per millimetre of axial movement. 30 mm of movement would give 105 degrees of duration change. Although the Helical Camshaft is capable of far more than this, it has been found in testing that this amount is sufficient for most purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Features: - {{the round}} Yamaha logo on the {{headstock}} {{is not a}} decal, it's a die cast metal piece with chrome tuning forks (the Yamaha logo) raised above a black background. You can turn it with your fingers on my guitar but it doesn't come off - you can also see in the picture that the Yamaha brand name appears on the neck plate. This is also chrome and black but is a stamping not a casting. And this isn't actually a neck plate because it doesn't hold the neck on. If you remove the four screws this plate comes off, you will then see the actual neck plate which has four larger screws holding the neck on. The neck plate has a rectangular [...] "window" [...] in it {{to allow you to}} access the truss rod through a hole through the body {{into the back of the}} neck (that's right, the truss is accessed through the back of the neck). - All three pickups are identical. They have adjustable pole piece screws. The black and silver areas that you see are actually the tops of the pickup bobbins themselves. The black and silver areas are covered by a domed clear plastic piece. I took the guitar apart a few years ago to give it a good cleaning. I found that the pickups are not held in place with springs at the height adjustment screws like normal pickups, but instead had a large foam rubber block under the body of each pickup. The fretboard is quite thin. Thin enough that the side dots are actually located on the <b>split</b> <b>line</b> between the fretboard material and the wood of the neck. The guitar's serial number is stamped directly into the fretboard between two of the lower frets. - Yamaha was obviously proud of this guitar, and put their name and logo all over it. Besides the Yamaha name on the tuning machines, it has the Yamaha decal and die cast logo on the headstock, the name and logo on the neck plate and the name and logo are molded into the bridge pickup ring between the two bridge pickups. - The SG2 and SG3 were Yamaha's first electric guitar models, and finish details (as described above) are amazing for a 1965 Japanese guitar. If I lay it down next to my Strat, the Strat looks like a bargain basement model by comparison. Later 1960s models in Yamaha's SG series have far cruder appointments. - As was already noted, the bridge has roller saddles and each saddle is height adjustable. The bridge also has the normal coarse height adjustment screws on each end. There are two sheet metal springs on the ends of the bridge pinching the saddles together so they don't move side-to-side. - The guitar shown here has either a metal or black plastic nut, mine is white plastic. There is, of course, a zero fret. - The string tree is also a good quality chrome plated die casting, not a metal stamping like many guitars of the period. - The main knobs are chrome-plated metal with plastic skirts. As for the roller controls, the mysterious 3rd thumbwheel nearest to the bridge pickup is a balance control for the two bridge pickups. This functions whether the slide switch is in the up or down position. - The remaining two thumbwheels are just like their Fender counterparts; they're a volume control and a tone control that override the main volume and tone controls when the slide switch is in the up position. [...] Supposedly most of them were sold in Japan, and only a few were exported to the US.|$|E
