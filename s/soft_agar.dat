40|$|Decreasing the agar {{concentration}} of a counting medium {{from the usual}} 1. 5 % resulted in larger colonies with less interference from gas in Clostridium botulinum 115 B and C. sporogenes PA 3679. Optimal agar concentration was 0. 65 % for C. botulinum with 24 -hr incubation and 0. 50 % for C. sporogenes with 48 -hr incubation. Lower concentrations yielded growth too diffuse for counting. Motility was considered the explanation for increased colony size in <b>softer</b> <b>agar.</b> The greater the degree of motility, the greater would be the diffusibility expected, and thus the higher the agar concentration required to insure discrete colonies.

40|$|We show in {{this study}} that Salmonella cells, which do not upregulate flagellar gene {{expression}} during swarming, also do not in-crease flagellar numbers permof cell length as determined by systematic counting of both flagellar filaments and hooks. In-stead, doubling of the average length of a swarmer cell by suppression of cell division effectively doubles the number of flagella per cell. The highest agar concentration at which Salmonella cells swarmed increased from the normal 0. 5 % to 1 %, either when flagella were overproduced or when expression of the FliL protein was enhanced in conjunction with stator proteins MotAB. We surmise that bacteria use the resulting increase in motor power to overcome the higher friction associated with harder agar. Higher flagellar numbers also suppress the swarming defect of mutants with changes in the chemotaxis pathway that were previ-ously shown to be defective in hydrating their colonies. Here we show that the swarming defect of these mutants can also be sup-pressed by application of osmolytes to the surface of swarm agar. The “dry ” colony morphology displayed by chemutants was also observed with other mutants that do not actively rotate their flagella. The flagellum/motor thus participates in two func-tions critical for swarming, enabling hydration and overriding surface friction. We consider some ideas for how the flagellum might help attract water to the agar surface, where there is no free water. Swarming bacteria may be divided into two categories: robustswarmers, which can navigate across a hard agar surface (1. 5 % agar and above), and temperate swarmers, which can swarm only on a <b>softer</b> <b>agar</b> surface (0. 5 to 0. 8 % agar) (1 – 3).

A total of 1, 914 swabs from different sample sites of 81 patients were dipped into SSMAC tubes, and after 24 h of incubation (in an incubator located near the intensive-care unit), an evident color change was considered by the intensive-care-unit personnel to be an MRSA alarm. Sixty-three (3. 3 %) SSMAC tubes were considered positive for MRSA, 1, 827 (95. 4 %) were considered negative, and 24 (1. 2 %) were considered intermediate. Compared with values for parallel conventional surveillance cultures for MRSA, excluding tubes with intermediate results, the SSMAC test had a sensitivity of 72. 7 %, a specificity of 99. 2 %, a positive predictive value of 76. 2 %, and a negative predictive value of 99. 0 %. When intermediate tubes were considered positive, the corresponding values were 75. 3, 98. 2, 63. 2, and 99. 0 %, respectively.

The Fla 2 motility pattern was signiﬁcantly different to Fla 1 when measured on <b>soft</b> nutrient <b>agar</b> and by analysing free swimming cells. Fla 2 + strains swam in a corkscrew-like pattern which may favour movement through bioﬁlms. Fla 2 + AM 1 and N 29 were signiﬁcantly deﬁcient in their capacity to form bioﬁlms compared to Fla 1 + WS 8 N. AM 1 and N 29 were found to contain mutations in cckA and plasmids expressing these mutations were able to switch expression of Fla 1 in WS 8 N to Fla 2. Expression of mutant cckA also affected cheOp 2 and cheOp 3 expression and induced expression of che Op 1. Some members of the α-proteobacteria are known to engage in lifestyle switches from motile to sessile growth. It is suggested that a similar switch occurs in R. sphaeroides which uses the Fla 1 system for motility in liquid environments and for the initial attachments to surfaces and the Fla 2 system for movement through the highly-viscous bioﬁlm.

Here, we analyzed in vitro and in vivo, how CCR 6 expression could alter the behavior of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, which were shown to express low levels of the CCR 6 ligand, CCL 20 (LARC), both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of CCR 6 significantly decreased the number of metastases in immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice, without affecting the tumor-forming ability of LLC cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial {{motility}} is {{a crucial}} factor in the colonization of natural environments. Escherichia coli has two flagella-driven motility types: swimming and swarming. Swimming motility consists of individual cell movement in liquid medium or <b>soft</b> semisolid <b>agar,</b> whereas swarming is a coordinated cellular behaviour leading to a collective movement on semisolid surfaces. It is known that swimming motility can be influenced by several types of environmental stress. In nature, environmentally induced DNA damage (e. g. UV irradiation) {{is one of the}} most common types of stress. One of the key proteins involved in the response to DNA damage is RecA, a multifunctional protein required for maintaining genome integrity and the generation of genetic variation. Results The ability of E. coli cells to develop swarming migration on semisolid surfaces was suppressed in the absence of RecA. However, swimming motility was not affected. The swarming defect of a Δ recA strain was fully complemented by a plasmid-borne recA gene. Although the Δ recA cells grown on semisolidsurfaces exhibited flagellar production, they also presented impaired individual movement as well as a fully inactive collective swarming migration. Both the comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in wild-type and Δ recA cells grown on a semisolid surface and the motility of lexA 1 [Ind-] mutant cells demonstrated that the RecA effect on swarming does not require induction of the SOS response. By using a RecA-GFP fusion protein we were able to segregate the effect of RecA on swarming from its other functions. This protein fusion failed to regulate the induction of the SOS response, the recombinational DNA repair of UV-treated cells and the genetic recombination, however, it was efficient in rescuing the swarming motility defect of the Δ recA mutant. The RecA-GFP protein retains a residual ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity but does not perform DNA strand exchange. Conclusion The experimental evidence presented in this work supports a novel role for RecA: the promotion of swarming motility. The defective swarming migration of Δ recA cells does not appear to be associated with defective flagellar production; rather, it seems to be associated with an abnormal flagellar propulsion function. Our results strongly suggest that the RecA effect on swarming motility does not require an extensive canonical RecA nucleofilament formation. RecA is the first reported cellular factor specifically affecting swarming but not swimming motility in E. coli. The integration of two apparently disconnected biologically important processes, such as the maintenance of genome integrity and motility in a unique protein, may have important evolutive consequences. </p...|$|R
50|$|An {{epithelial}} to mesenchymal transition was mimicked in metastatic cells by adapting PC-3 {{prostate cancer}} cells from adherent to suspension culture and then examined to investigate changes in gene expression concurrent with this adaption to suspension. It {{was found that}} the asparagine synthetase expression was sixfold greater in the suspension cells than in the adherent cells. In xenografts from a human breast cancer cell line in an established metastatic mouse model, asparagine synthetase was elevated in circulating tumor cells isolated from the mouse blood compared with the parental cell line. When these circulating tumor cells were returned to an in vitro culture and exposed to hypoxia, they showed higher basal expression and greater induction of asparagine synthetase than their parental cell line. These circulating tumor cells were also found to have an increased capacity for colony formation in <b>soft</b> <b>agar</b> assays under hypoxic conditions and grew faster when reimplanted as xenografts.

5000|$|The {{biological}} function of ERGIC2 protein is unknown, {{although it was}} initially identified as a candidate tumor suppressor of prostate cancer, and {{has been shown to}} induce cell growth arrest and senescence, to suppress colony formation in <b>soft</b> <b>agar,</b> and to decrease invasive potential of human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3 cells). [...] It is now believed to be a chaperon molecule involved in protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi. The protein contains two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that help anchoring the molecule on the ER membrane, such that its large luminal domain orients inside the ER lumen and both the N- and C-termini are facing the cytosol. ERGIC2 forms a complex with two other proteins, ERGIC3 and ERGIC32, resulting in a shuttle for protein trafficking between ER and Golgi. [...] It has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, such as beta-amyloid, protein elongation factor 1alpha, and otoferlin. Therefore, it may {{play an important role in}} cellular functions besides of being a component of a protein trafficking shuttle.More recently, a variant transcript of ERGIC2 has been reported. [...] It has a deletion of four bases at the junction of exons 8 and 9, resulting a frame-shift mutation after codon #189. The variant transcript encodes a truncated protein of 215 residues, which loses 45% of the luminal domain and the transmembrane domain near the C-terminus. This effectively abrogates its function as a protein transporter. A similar variant is also reported in armadillo. So this is not a random mutation. The function of this truncated protein is unknown.|$|E

The gaps between these were filled by primer walking and PCR to give a continuous contig of 11554 bp. Two viruses A 1 and A 2 and their bacterial host were isolated from the human mouth. The 16 S rRNA gene sequence of the host had a 99 % identity to several Neisseria sp. The A 1 virus was found to appear spontaneously on <b>soft</b> top <b>agar</b> plates, and might be a lysogenic virus. The A 2 virus was a lytic virus. The two viruses have different morphological shapes. A 1 has a varied isometric head size that ranges from 32 to 58 nm and no tail; it may belong to the Tectiviridae family. It has a linear dsDNA genome with a size between 12 kb and 23 kb. A limited amount of the genome of the A 1 virus was sequenced. The A 2 virus has an icosohedral head with size of 60 ± 3 nm and a sheathed rigid tail about 175 nm long with no detectable base plate or tail fibres. It can be classified into the order Caudovirales family Siphoviridae. The size of the A 2 virus genome is estimated to be 35 to 40 kb. 31703 bp of unique sequence has been determined and sorted into three contigs and 14 single sequences. Further attempts at gap filling using primer walking and PCR were unsuccessful. It has a linear dsDNA genome, with a GC content of 49 mol%. A latent period of 25 min and a burst size of 25 ± 2 particles were determined by a single step growth curve. Bioinformatic approaches were used to identify ORFs in the genome. A 2 virion associated proteins were analysed by SDS–PAGE gel electrophoresis, and some proteins sequences were directly related to the translated genomic sequence.

40|$|Background: Bacterial {{motility}} is {{a crucial}} factor in the colonization of natural environments. Escherichia coli has two flagella-driven motility types: swimming and swarming. Swimming motility consists of individual cell movement in liquid medium or <b>soft</b> semisolid <b>agar,</b> whereas swarming is a coordinated cellular behaviour leading to a collective movement on semisolid surfaces. It is known that swimming motility can be influenced by several types of environmental stress. In nature, environmentally induced DNA damage (e. g. UV irradiation) {{is one of the}} most common types of stress. One of the key proteins involved in the response to DNA damage is RecA, a multifunctional protein required for maintaining genome integrity and the generation of genetic variation. Results: The ability of E. coli cells to develop swarming migration on semisolid surfaces was suppressed in the absence of RecA. However, swimming motility was not affected. The swarming defect of a ΔrecA strain was fully complemented by a plasmid-borne recA gene. Although the ΔrecA cells grown on semisolidsurfaces exhibited flagellar production, they also presented impaired individual movement as well as a fully inactive collective swarming migration. Both the comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in wild-type and ΔrecA cells grown on a semisolid surface and the motility of lexA 1 [Ind-] mutant cells demonstrated that the RecA effect on swarming does not require induction of the SOS response. By using a RecA-GFP fusion protein we were able to segregate the effect of RecA on swarming from its other functions. This protein fusion failed to regulate the induction of the SOS response, the recombinational DNA repair of UV-treated cells and the genetic recombination, however, it was efficient in rescuing the swarming motility defect of the ΔrecA mutant. The RecA-GFP protein retains a residual ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity but does not perform DNA strand exchange. Conclusion: The experimental evidence presented in this work supports a novel role for RecA: the promotion of swarming motility. The defective swarming migration of ΔrecA cells does not appear to be associated with defective flagellar production; rather, it seems to be associated with an abnormal flagellar propulsion function. Our results strongly suggest that the RecA effect on swarming motility does not require an extensive canonical RecA nucleofilament formation. RecA is the first reported cellular factor specifically affecting swarming but not swimming motility in E. coli. The integration of two apparently disconnected biologically important processes, such as the maintenance of genome integrity and motility in a unique protein, may have important evolutive consequences.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Sesötesi cihazlar ülkemizde teşhis amaçlı olarak yaygın bir şekilde kullanılmaktadır. Sesötesi teşhis cihazlarının pozisyon doğrulama (kalibrasyon), mevcut sistemlerin sinyal ve gürültü oranlarının iyileştirilmesinde, kullanıcıların cihaz kullanımları öncesi pratik çalışmalarında ve uygulama esnasında alınan görüntülerin bilinirliği ve yorumlama kolaylığı sağlanması amacıyla fantomlara ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. Sesötesi uygulamalarında insan dokularının özel karakteristiğini tasvir edebilecek test materyallerine fantom veya doku simülatörü denir. Literatürde çeşitli dokuların tasvir edilmesi amacıyla değişik materyaller kullanılarak fantomlar oluşturulmuştur. Özellikle yumuşak dokuların tasvir edilmesi amacıyla agar, jelatin, magnezyumsilikat, yağ jel, poliüretan, epoksi reçine, polivinil alkol (PVA), polisakkarit jelleri gibi materyaller ile oda sıcaklığında sertleşebilen silikonlar (RTV) kullanılanlardandır. Su temelli materyaller özellikle agar ve jelatin gibi hidrojel olarak adlandırılabilecek malzemeler iyi performans, herhangi bir zararlı kimyasal içermemeleri, kolay kullanım, uygulamada sağladıkları esneklik ve akustik özellikleriyle öne çıkabilmektedirler. Fantomların üretilmesinde en önemli kriterler simule edilmek istenilen dokuların akustik özelliklerine sahip olunmasının sağlanabilmesidir. Bunların başında dokudaki ses hızı, akustik empedansı, zayıflatma ve gerisaçılım katsayıları ile dokunun basınç altındaki değişime tepkisidir. Ticari olarak üretilen fantomlar birçok pazar ve belli başlı uygulamalar için üretilmiş olup kişiselleştirilememektedir. Birçok dokuyu ve organı temsili olarak oluşturan bu fantomların fiyatları yüksek değerlere ulaşabilmektedir. Bu sebeple uygulama yapılacak dokulara en yakın özellikte, kullanımı kolay ve maliyeti düşük fantomların üretilmesi önem taşımaktadır. Jelatin gibi materyaller ile oluşturulmuş fantom veya doku modellerinde yaşanan en temel sorunlar; mikrobiyolojik unsurların (bakteri ve mantarların) zaman içinde gelişmesi ve hassas yapıları nedeniyle fantomların fiziksel ve akustik özelliklerini kaybedebilmeleridir. Çalışmada yapımı kolay, herhangi bir zararlı kimyasal içermeyen hayvansal bir ürün olan jelatin kullanarak, maliyeti düşük sesötesi fantomlar oluşturarak ölçümler alındı. Ölçümlerin alınmasında darbe-yankı metodu ve A tipi tarama kullanılarak, fantomların içerisine yerleştirdiğimiz kitle ve kist tasvirlerinin konum, boyut gibi özelliklerinin tespit edilmesine çalışıldı. Fantomdaki ses hızının ölçümü ve bu hızın insan yumuşak dokularındaki hız değerine (&# 8776; 1540 m/s) ulaştırılması için çalışma yapıldı. Ayrıca; doku içerisinde bulunması muhtemel saçıcı ve dağıtıcı tasvirlerini de katmak suretiyle ölçümlerimizin gerçekliği arttırılmaya çalışıldı. Medical imaging {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} {{developing}} areas in medicine. One of the major factors of this development is examining the tissues without physical intervention. The most frequently used technique in medical imaging is the use of ultrasonic systems due to its damage-free nature to tissues, easy to use, getting real time images, and non-radiation technique, which is relatively low cost comparing with other imaging methods. Ultrasound systems use sound waves to examine tissues. When sound waves meet different impedance inside the human body, they are scattered or backscattered where the same transducer collects the backscattered waves. When one transducer makes this process, is called A type scan. In practice instead of a single transducer an array of transducers are used whose outputs can be combined to produce two-dimensional images, which are called B scan. The B scan works as A type scan mode but plots the strength of the scattered or backscattered signals as changes in brightness. Strong reflections are brighter than the weaker reflections. While transducer is moving on human body, a two-dimensional image is built by these reflections. Today, mostly ultrasonic system imaging uses B type scan. Ultrasound phantom or tissue simulators are testing objects that illustrate or simulate the special characteristics of human tissues in ultrasonic applications. Hospitals, clinics and research centers use phantoms to calibrate and initial testing of their systems, additionally training of ultrasound technicians prior to the practical work. Optimizing signal to noise ratios of the existing systems and getting familiar before real applications are also necessary. In literature, various materials and many techniques have been proposed to produce phantoms. Specifically, for mimicking <b>soft</b> tissues <b>agars,</b> gelatin, magnesium silicate, oil gel, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyester and epoxy resins, and room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone are frequently used. Water based substitutes, agars and gelatin based soft tissue substitutes (also called hydrogels) are the most widely used materials that have advantages of being easy to prepare, and easy to use. Moreover, well performance, containing no harmful chemicals, flexibility and acoustic properties come into prominence at usage. The ideal ultrasound phantom should have same acoustical properties as those simulated tissues. The most important characteristics are sound speed in tissue, acoustical impedance, attenuation, backscatter coefficient and nonlinearity parameter. The speed of sound in tissue typically determined by the time of flight measurements through a material of given thickness. Acoustic impedance can be calculated by speed of sound in tissue and measured density of material. The attenuation coefficient can be measured using through-transmission method, especially for low attenuation materials. Acoustic properties of soft tissue phantoms are highly dependent on preparation technique and handling. Mostly measurements of acoustic properties of tissues are taken in room temperature, however these will be highly dependent on tissue substitutes and temperature varies. The most important problem encountered in the use of such materials in phantoms is microbiological factors (i. e., bacteria and fungus) which may evolve over time due to the sensitivity nature of losing physical specifications and acoustical characteristics that change with time. Many commercially produced phantoms, which are used by a wide range of markets, are not customized but manufactured for particular applications. Customize designed phantoms are either expensive or cannot simply developed by the user. To overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages and to have the closest features to the tissues one may need to produce his/her own easily produced and low cost phantom. In this thesis; gelatin, which is an animal product that contains no harmful chemicals, has been used as low-cost, homemade ultrasonic phantoms. The pulse-echo measurements of A type scanning is preferred. Note that the pulse-echo method is the most frequently used and simply method. This method relies on sending sound waves from a transducer and getting echoes from the same one. Among various available 1 MHz surface type transducers in our laboratory, a transducer with the best frequency response has been chosen for experiments whose center frequency was at 870 kHz with a bandwidth of 485 kHz. Vegetable oil and vaseline are used as couplant. As these couplant materials cause defect during the tests, simply water is used also. For those, the selection criteria should be the same as the impedance value with applied tissues additional non-reacting chemical selection. In this study, the cartridge of silicon has been considered as the tissue mimicking phantom material, which can be easily found in the market. 200 bloom of beef gelatin is used in this study, which is low cost, contains no harmful chemical and can easily be found in vendors. To simulate a mass and a cyst in a tissue, an olive and a grape have been chosen respectively. Both of are considered in literature also. Moreover, water filled balloons may be used for depiction of cyst and fruit or vegetable pieces may be used for depiction of soft tissue mass also. The probable scatters within tissue are simulated (to strengthen the reliability of the measurements) by local dehumidifier silicagels. Existing laboratory tools such as an ultrasound pulse sender/receiver, a surface type transducer, an oscilloscope and by labview program controlled computer have been used as the experimental setup. Ultrasonic velocity measurements and position determination of foreign objects (such as money) are studied for our homemade produced phantom. Then, in another homemade produced phantom cyst depiction is formed and its location is determined. Similarly, mass simulated measurements have been performed. In order to achieve the same range of ultrasonic velocity (approx. 1540 m/s) in human soft tissues ethanol (70 %) is added to the phantom. Ethanol addition to measurements shows an effect of rate increase. Another ethanol added gelatin mixture has been prepared for re-measurements to simulate scatters in the tissues by using silicagels, which are distributed as possible as homogenously whose radial dimensions are 2 - 4 mm. In fact, it is rather difficult to create a desired distribution of silicagels in the gelatin and ethanol liquid mixture homogenously. The silicagels that are added to create the noise in the phantom but did not. Silicagel’s radial dimensions are much bigger than sound wavelength, since backscattered waves amplitude are decreased; instead of silicagels, more highly reflective materials should be used is concluded. In this thesis, measurement of depth has achieved correctly for depicted materials in soft tissue phantoms, which are made by gelatin. Additionally, adding ethanol to gelatin mixture has increased the sound speed in the phantom to as approximate as real soft tissue values. Further study may be necessary to investigate the effect of increasing the concentration of ethanol mixture to phantoms to see the effect of sound speed. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
