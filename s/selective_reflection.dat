5000|$|Melanin is yellowish-brown to {{dark brown}} in the stromal pigment cells, and {{black in the}} iris pigment epithelium, which lies in a thin but very opaque layer {{across the back of}} the iris. Most human irises also show a {{condensation}} of the brownish stromal melanin in the thin anterior border layer, which by its position has an overt influence on the overall color. The degree of dispersion of the melanin, which is in subcellular bundles called melanosomes, has some influence on the observed color, but melanosomes in the iris of humans and other vertebrates are not mobile, and the degree of pigment dispersion cannot be reversed. Abnormal clumping of melanosomes does occur in disease and may lead to irreversible changes in iris color (see heterochromia, below). Colors other than brown or black are due to <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> and absorption from the other stromal components.

5000|$|Starting with {{a liquid}} crystal in the nematic phase, the desired helical pitch (the {{distance}} along the helical axis for one complete {{rotation of the}} nematic plane subunits) {{can be achieved by}} doping the liquid crystal with a chiral molecule. For light circularly polarized with the same handedness, this regular modulation of the refractive index yields <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> of the wavelength given by the helical pitch, allowing the liquid-crystal laser to serve as its own resonator cavity. Photonic crystals are amenable to band theory methods, with the periodic dielectric structure playing the role of the periodic electric potential and a photonic band gap (reflection notch) corresponding to forbidden frequencies. The lower photon group velocity and higher density of states near the photonic bandgap suppresses spontaneous emission and enhances stimulated emission, providing favorable conditions for lasing. If the electronic band edge falls in the photonic bandgap, electron-hole recombination is strictly suppressed. This allows for devices with high lasing efficiency, low lasing threshold, and stable frequency, where the liquid-crystal laser acts its own waveguide. [...] "Colossal" [...] nonlinear change in refractive index is achievable in doped nematic-phase liquid crystals, that is the refractive index can change with illumination intensity {{at a rate of about}} 103cm2/W of illumination intensity. Most systems use a semiconductor pumping laser to achieve population inversion, though flash lamp and electrical pumping systems are possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of cholesteric liquid crystals {{can be controlled}} by light irradiation if conformationally photo-active molecules are present. Recently, control of the <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> band (spiral pitch) in nemato-chiral mixtures was demonstrated when photosensitive molecules, namely nematic azoxy-based compounds, were used as the host material. In this report, the investigation of light induced effects in cholesterics with azoxy-based host materials is continued to highlight the mechanisms of the response. Different non-photosensitive chiral materials were added to different azoxy-nematic liquid crystals and the pitch change caused by UV irradiation was investigated. A change in the pitch of 50 - 210 nm was observed depending on the exposure time {{and the intensity of}} the light. This effect is reversible: under illumination at wavelengths greater than 410 nm, the pitch shifts in the opposite direction. The dependence of the <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> band and the full-width-at-half-maximum of the band on the exposure time and the temperature dependence of the <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> band were investigated. The lowering of the phase transition temperature and narrowing of the width of the <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> band can be explained by a decrease in the orientational order parameter. The blue shift of the <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> band is due to a decrease in both the order parameter and the concentration of linear nematogenic molecules...|$|E
40|$|Liquid crystal polarizers (LCPs) {{are used}} in OMEGA to control circularly {{polarized}} light due to their unique optical property of <b>selective</b> <b>reflection,</b> whereby light of a specific wavelength and handedness is reflected.

40|$|Characteristics of {{a liquid}} crystal system, {{comprised}} of a shear-sensitive cholesteric-monomer liquid crystal thin-film coated on a liquid-crystal polymer substrate, are described. The system provides stable Grandjean texture, a desirable feature for shear-stress measurements using <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> from the monomer liquid-crystal helix structure. Impingement of gas or air flow on the monomer liquid-crystal free surface changes the wavelength of the <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> for an incident white light from red toward blue with {{increase in the}} rate of gas flow. The contrast of the selectively reflected light improves considerably by providing a thin black coating of about 5 microns at the monomer-polymer interface. The coating thickness is such that the steric interactions are still sufficiently strong to maintain Grandjean texture. For a small angle of incidence of a monochromatic light, the measurement of the reflected light intensity normal to the monomer-polymer liquid-crystal interface enables the determination of the wavelength for <b>selective</b> <b>reflection</b> {{as a function of the}} gas-flow differential pressure applied in the plane of the interface. The variation of the wavelength with the pressure is linear with a slope of about 2 nm/mmHg. Furthermore, the shear-stress effects are reversible unlike for monomer liquid crystal-metal systems used for flow visualization on wind-tunnel model surfaces.
