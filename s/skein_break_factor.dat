Previous {{research suggests that}} a highly heritable general externalizing factor contributes to individual differences {{in a range of}} behaviors marked by impulsivity and disinhibition, such as rule-breaking and aggression. Relational aggression {{has been found to be}} moderately heritable and to share common genetic and environmental influences with physical aggression, though no prior studies have examined the etiological commonality between relational aggression and a more broadly construed externalizing domain. Using a sample of 499 like-sex twin pairs, the present study confirmed that six measures of externalizing-related behaviors formed two distinct subfactors of rule-breaking and aggression. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed that relational aggression correlated nearly equally with both factors. Factors of aggression, rule-breaking, and relational aggression were fit in an independent pathway model which revealed that relational aggression was influenced by additive genetics and non-shared environmental effects (a 2 =. 31 and e 2 =. 69). A majority of the heritability of relational aggression (72 %) was shared with the aggression and rule <b>breaking</b> <b>factors,</b> whereas the majority of the non-shared environmental influence (88 %) was specific to relational aggression. Findings suggest that relational aggression should be included in the broader externalizing domain, and that it may be its own distinct subfactor of externalizing, rather than simply being an alternate form of aggression...|$|R

Genotype-by-environment interaction effects can make relative performance unpredictable and may hamper selection for resistance to European corn borer. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of environment on genotypic reaction to European corn borer resistance in maize. A set of 12 maize inbred lines was chosen to represent a range of European corn borer responses. Eleven testing environments ranged from Delaware, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, to Mississippi. For length of stalk tunneling, environmental and genotypic main effects (estimated by restricted maximum likelihood) were 3 ̆e 20 - and 10 -fold larger than their interaction effect, respectively.

By <b>breaking</b> <b>factors</b> and the interaction into single degree of freedom components, we observed that GEMS- 0001 had significant crossover interactions toward less susceptibility in both Mississippi and the Nebraska environments.

In this editorial, I would like to expand that discussion {{with the help of}} the MISQ Associate Managing Editor, Chad Anderson. Our goals with respect to (hopefully) informing the IS community are to argue for the criticality of assessing journal quality, to enumerate key characteristics of commonly used metrics, to suggest how and when these metrics should be used, and to call for a broader field of study within which constructs like journal quality can be positioned. The Importance of Assessing Journal Quality The value of journal quality rankings to the academic community is complicated. Individual scholars publish their work to inform and engage with their chosen research community. A journal’s perceived quality will typically influence the number of readers of that journal and therefore authors will want to publish in top-quality journals to maximize the potential viewers of their work. Publication is also necessary for promotion and tenure, and at many institutions the quality of the journals in which a researcher’s work appears is a make or <b>break</b> <b>factor</b> when the merits for promotion and tenure are considered. Finally, while publication in a top quality journal does not guarantee that an article will be highly influential, articles published in top journals will often gain at least a temporary “halo ” effect from the journal’s perceived quality. These factors, among others, help explain why authors, editors, institutions, and the research community as a whole have a vested interest in the assessment of journal quality and the relative quality ranking of journals in the field...|$|R

In the PP sector, the color-suppressed tree amplitude is found to be larger than previously known and has a strong phase of - 70 ^o relative to the color-favored tree amplitude. We have extracted {{for the first time the}} W-exchange and penguin-annihilation amplitudes. The former has a size of about the QCD-penguin amplitude and a phase opposite to that of the color-favored tree amplitude, while the latter is suppressed in magnitude but gives the dominant contribution to the B_s^ 0 →π^+ π^- and π^ 0 π^ 0 decays. In the VP sector, one striking feature is that the color-suppressed tree amplitude with the spectator quark ending up in the vector meson has a large size and a strong phase of - 90 ^o relative to the color-favored tree amplitudes. The associated electroweak penguin amplitude also has a similar strong phase and a magnitude comparable to the corresponding QCD penguin amplitude. This leads to a large branching fraction of order 10 ^- 6 for B_s^ 0 →ϕπ^ 0. In contrast, the color-suppressed tree, QCD penguin, and electroweak penguin amplitudes with the spectator quark ending up in the pseudoscalar meson have magnitudes more consistent with naive expectations. Besides, current data are not sufficiently precise for us to fix the W-exchange amplitudes.
