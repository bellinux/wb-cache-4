2500|$|With his {{precise and}} {{analytical}} mind, Paolo Uccello tried {{to apply a}} scientific method to depict objects in three-dimensional space. In particular, some of his studies of the perspective foreshortening of the torus are preserved, and one <b>standard</b> <b>display</b> of drawing skill was his depiction of the mazzocchio. [...] The perspective in his paintings has influenced many famous painters, such as Piero della Francesca, Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, to name a few.|$|E
2500|$|The NES uses a {{custom-made}} Picture Processing Unit (PPU) {{developed by}} Ricoh. All {{variations of the}} PPU feature 2kB of video RAM, 256bytes of on-die [...] "object attribute memory" [...] (OAM) to store the positions, colors, and tile indices of up to 64 sprites on the screen, and 28bytes of on-die palette RAM to allow selection of background and sprite colors. The console's 2kB of onboard RAM {{may be used for}} tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. The system has an available color palette of 48 colors and 6 grays. Up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame: a background color, four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors. The NES palette is based on NTSC rather than RGB values. A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen. The <b>standard</b> <b>display</b> resolution of the NES is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels.|$|E

50|$|The LINC {{hardware}} {{allowed a}} 12-bit word to be rapidly and automatically {{displayed on the}} screen as a 4-wide by 6-high matrix of pixels, {{making it possible to}} display full screens of flicker-free text with a minimum of dedicated hardware. The <b>standard</b> <b>display</b> routines generated 4 by 6 character cells, giving the LINC one of the coarsest character sets ever designed.|$|E
50|$|To promote {{identical}} {{grayscale image}} display on different monitors and consistent hard-copy images from various printers, the DICOM committee developed a lookup table to display digitally assigned pixel values.

50|$|Drawing an ellipse as a {{graphics}} primitive {{is common}} in <b>standard</b> <b>display</b> libraries, such as the MacIntosh QuickDraw API, and Direct2D on Windows. Jack Bresenham at IBM is most famous for the invention of 2D drawing primitives, including line and circle drawing, using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit. M. L. V. Pitteway extended Bresenham's algorithm for lines to conics in 1967. Another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in 1984 by Jerry Van Aken.|$|E

5000|$|The {{touch screen}} is the <b>standard</b> <b>display</b> method for tablet PC and smaller IAs. Color {{may or may}} not be {{important}} to the user but can be an aid in directing the user. The screen size is perhaps the most important consideration. Organization of the screen is challenging on the small screen and the user should be considered when designing the interface. See section 2.2 and 2.3 in Ben Shneiderman's [...] "Designing the user interface" [...] (...) concerning design of the interface.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{was developed by}} Philips Research and uses <b>standard</b> <b>display</b> glass as used in TFT-LCD processing plants. It is coated {{with a layer of}} polyimide using a standard spin-coating procedure used in the production of AM-LCD displays. This polyimide coating can now have a regular TFT matrix formed on top of it in a standard TFT processing plant to form the plastic display, which can then be removed using a laser to finish the display and the glass reused thus lowering the total cost of manufacture.|$|E
50|$|While {{it is not}} {{possible}} to create a stereo image on a <b>standard</b> <b>display</b> without special equipment, it is possible to create an image with enhanced texture and depth. The parallax scanning lens technology creates autostereoscopic moving images with enhanced texture and depth on standard displays (television, movie screens and computer monitors) without the necessity of special screens or the use of viewing glasses. Images can be recorded on normal film or videotape using industry standard camera systems. The image depth enhancement is accomplished entirely by the lens using parallax scanning technology.|$|E
50|$|Various {{computer}} <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> or <b>display</b> modes {{have been}} used {{in the history of the}} personal computer. They are often a combination of aspect ratio (specified as width-to-height ratio), display resolution (specified as the width and height in pixels), color depth (measured in bits per pixel), and refresh rate (expressed in hertz). Associated with the screen resolution and refresh rate is a display adapter. Earlier display adapters were simple frame-buffers, but later <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> also specified a more extensive set of display functions and software controlled interface.|$|R
