5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human <b>stool</b> <b>and</b> possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E
5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his <b>stool</b> <b>and</b> hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose and walked up to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a <b>stool,</b> <b>and</b> a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of pale <b>stools</b> <b>and</b> dark urine suggests an obstructive or post-hepatic cause as normal feces get their color from bile pigments. However, although pale <b>stools</b> <b>and</b> dark urine are {{a feature of}} biliary obstruction, they can occur in many intra-hepatic illnesses and are therefore not a reliable clinical feature to distinguish obstruction from hepatic causes of jaundice.|$|R

25|$|The fecal {{incontinence}} severity index {{is based on}} four types of leakage (gas, mucus, liquid stool, solid <b>stool)</b> <b>and</b> five frequencies (once to three times per month, once per week, twice per week, once per day, twice or more per day). Other severity scales include: AMS, Pescatori, Williams score, Kirwan, Miller score, Saint Mark's score and the Vaizey scale.|$|E
25|$|Advantages of {{consuming}} fiber are {{the production of}} healthful compounds during the fermentation of soluble fiber, and insoluble fiber's ability (via its passive hygroscopic properties) to increase bulk, soften <b>stool,</b> <b>and</b> shorten transit time through the intestinal tract. A disadvantage of a diet high in fiber {{is the potential for}} significant intestinal gas production and bloating.|$|E
25|$|The worms of S. mansoni and S. japonicum {{migrate to}} the veins of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and liver. Eggs in the gut wall can lead to pain, blood in the <b>stool,</b> <b>and</b> diarrhea (especially in children). Severe disease can lead to narrowing of the colon or rectum. Eggs also {{migrate to the}} liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 percent of people with chronic infection, mainly those with long term heavy infection.|$|E

50|$|A study {{looked at}} the effects of calcium {{polycarbophil}} on general irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Fourteen patients with IBS-diarrhea and twelve with IBS-constipation were given calcium polycarbophil for eight weeks and their colon transit times were measured with radiopaque markers in the colon. The patients with diarrhea reported fewer bowel movements, more solid <b>stools</b> <b>and</b> reduced abdominal pain. Patients with constipation reported more frequent bowel movements, looser <b>stools</b> <b>and</b> less pain.|$|R

25|$|As most porphyrias {{are rare}} conditions, general {{hospital}} labs typically {{do not have}} the expertise, technology, or staff time to perform porphyria testing. In general, testing involves sending samples of blood, <b>stool,</b> <b>and</b> urine to a reference laboratory. All samples to detect porphyrins must be handled properly. Samples should be taken during an acute attack; otherwise a false negative result may occur. Samples must be protected from light and either refrigerated or preserved.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{looked at}} the {{differentiated}} effects of being raised with only either a wire-mother or a cloth-mother. Both groups gained weight at equal rates, but the monkeys raised on a wire-mother had softer <b>stool</b> <b>and</b> trouble digesting the milk, frequently suffering from diarrhea. Harlow's interpretation of this behavior, which is still widely accepted, was {{that a lack of}} contact comfort is psychologically stressful to the monkeys, and the digestive problems are a physiological manifestation of that stress.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stool</b> <b>and</b> swab samples {{collected}} in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is V. cholerae O1. If V. cholerae serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for V. cholerae O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, {{it is necessary to}} send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} {{versions}} of stoolball. In the earliest versions, {{the object was}} primarily to defend the stool. Successfully defending the stool counted for one point, and the batter was out if the ball hit the stool. There was no running involved. Another version of stoolball involved running between two <b>stools,</b> <b>and</b> scoring {{was similar to the}} scoring in cricket. In perhaps yet another version there were several <b>stools,</b> <b>and</b> points were scored by running around them as in baseball.|$|R
25|$|Most {{immunodiagnostic}} tests will detect {{infection and}} have a sensitivity above 90% during all stages of the diseases. In addition antibody concentration quickly drops post treatment and no antibodies are present one year after treatment, {{which makes it a}} very good diagnostic method. In humans, diagnosis of fasciolosis is usually achieved parasitologically by findings the fluke eggs in <b>stool,</b> <b>and</b> immunologically by ELISA and Western blot. Coprological examinations of stool alone are generally not adequate because infected humans have important clinical presentations long before eggs are found in the stools.|$|E
25|$|Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was {{responsible}} for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen <b>stool</b> <b>and</b> in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Pancreatitis is {{inflammation}} of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes {{and a number of}} hormones. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty <b>stool,</b> <b>and</b> diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs.|$|E

25|$|Overt {{hyperthyroidism}} {{is associated}} with accelerated bone remodeling (resulting in increased porosity of cortical bone and reduced volume of trabecular bone), a generally reduced bone density, osteoporosis, {{and an increase in}} fracture rate. The changes in bone metabolism are connected with negative calcium balance, an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine (hypercalciuria) and <b>stool,</b> <b>and,</b> rarely, hypercalcemia. In hyperthyroidism, the normal cycle duration of bone resorption of approximately 200 days is halved, and each cycle {{is associated with}} a 9.6 percent loss of mineralized bone. In hypothyroidism, cycle length approximates 700 days and is associated with a 17 percent increase in mineralized bone.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Golden Stool (Sika ɗwa) was a means of centralization under Osei Tutu. According to legend, a meeting of all the clan heads {{of each of the}} Ashanti settlements was called just prior to declaring independence from Denkyira. In this meeting the Golden Stool was commanded down from the heavens by Okomfo Anokye, chief-priest or sage advisor to Asantehene Osei Tutu I and floated down from the heavens into the lap of Osei Tutu I. Okomfo Anokye declared the stool to be symbolic of the new Asante Union (the Ashanti Kingdom), and allegiance was sworn to the <b>stool</b> <b>and</b> to Osei Tutu as the Asantehene. The newly declared Ashanti union subsequently waged war against and defeated Denkyira. The stool remains sacred to the Ashanti as it is believed to contain the Sunsum — spirit or soul of the Ashanti people.|$|E
