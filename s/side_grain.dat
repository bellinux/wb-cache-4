This lane and the one to the mill site are clearly shown on the 1895 OS map, published in 1897. Laigh Castleton could also have been the miller's dwelling and farm, however it does not appear on a map by name until around 1828 and it is missing from Aitken's in 1829; the 1775 map has a building indicated, but it is named Mill, despite being set well back from the river. The name Mill could be interpreted as meaning that Laigh Castleton was linked with a mill though being the miller's dwelling. A 1779 Estate map of Lainshaw shows that lands to the East of the lane to the supposed mill belonged to Lambroughton.|$|E

50|$|Cross flow dryers {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{continuous}} flow dryers. In the cross flow dryer, the airstream is perpendicular to the grain flow. Then the grain near the drying air is over dried, while on the other <b>side,</b> <b>grain</b> is under dried. Moisture gradient exists when drying is complete. In reality, the lower the airflow rate, the higher the grain moisture content variation between two sides of the column.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Bewick {{developed}} the wood engraving technique {{at the end}} of the 18th century. His work differed from earlier woodcuts in two key ways. First, rather than using woodcarving tools such as knives, Bewick used an engraver's burin (graver). With this, he could create thin delicate lines, often creating large dark areas in the composition. Second, wood engraving traditionally uses the wood's end grain—while the older technique used the softer <b>side</b> <b>grain.</b> The resulting increased hardness and durability facilitated more detailed images.|$|E

50|$|In all but {{the lowest}} quality pianos the {{soundboard}} is made of solid spruce (that is, spruce boards glued together along the <b>side</b> <b>grain).</b> Spruce's high ratio of strength to weight minimizes acoustic impedance while offering strength sufficient to withstand the downward force of the strings. The best piano makers use quarter-sawn, defect-free spruce of close annular grain, carefully seasoning it {{over a long period}} before fabricating the soundboards. This is the identical material that is used in quality acoustic guitar soundboards. Cheap pianos often have plywood soundboards.|$|E
50|$|In an aeolian environment, cross beds often exhibit inverse grading due {{to their}} {{deposition}} by grain flows. Winds blow sediment along the ground until they start to accumulate. The side that the accumulation occurs on is called the windward side. As it continues to build, some sediment falls over the end. This side is called the leeward <b>side.</b> <b>Grain</b> flows occur when the windward side accumulates too much sediment, the angle of repose is reached and the sediment tumbles down. As more sediment piles on top the weight causes the underlying sediment to cement together and form cross beds.|$|E

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{computer}} simulation technique, {{in which a}} continuum system is modeled employing a discrete lattice, {{has been applied to}} the problem of recrystallization. Primary recrystallization is modeled under conditions where the degree of stored energy is varied and nucleation occurs homogeneously (without regard for position in the microstructure). The nucleation rate is chosen as site saturated. Temporal evolution of the simulated microstructures is analyzed to provide the time dependence of the recrystallized volume fraction and grain sizes. The recrystallized volume fraction shows sigmoidal variations with time. The data are approximately fit by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation with the expected exponents, however significant deviations are observed for both small and large recrystallized volume fractions. Under constant rate nucleation conditions, the propensity for irregular grain shapes is decreased and the density of two <b>sided</b> <b>grains</b> increases...|$|R

Chikwaikwai's strength lies in his speed, football brains, close ball control and good sense of positioning.He played alongside his oldest brother Manyowa for Rusape <b>side</b> <b>Grain</b> Masters between 2000 and 2004 before coming to Harare for trials with premiership side CAPS United.The move was stalled when he sustained a career threatening ankle injury during a training session.The former Njube Sundowns striker was named Zimbabwe's 2008/9 'Soccer Star of the Year' after he finished as the league's top goal-scorer with 23 goals in 28 games.He donated part of his prize money for Soccer Star of the Year to Maggies Day Centre,an orphanage at his home area of Rusape.

A 1779 Estate map of Lainshaw shows that lands to the East of the lane to the supposed mill belonged to Lambroughton.Thirlage was the feudal law by which the laird could force all those farmers living on his lands to bring their grain to his mill to be ground. Additionally they had to carry out repairs on the mill, maintain the lade and weir, as well as conveying new millstones to the site. The Thirlage Law was repealed in 1779 and after this many mills fell out of use as competition and unsubsidised running costs took their toll. This may explain why no sign of the mill is visible on Thomson's 1828 map, Aitken's 1829 map, or the 1858 OS map. Other mills, such as Dalgarven Mill near Kilwinning, survived almost to the present day through a mixture of luck, a reliable water supply and investment at the right time. Dalgarven Mill is now a museum. The last unrestored working mill in Ayrshire was Coldstream near Beith which last worked in 1979; the last traditional Ayrshire miller being Andrew Smith.|$|E

40|$|Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L,) Moench] hybrids {{containing}} the stay-green trait retain more photosynthetically active leaves under drought than do hybrids {{that do not}} contain this trait. Since the Longevity and photosynthetic capacity of a leaf are related to its N status, {{it is important to}} clarify the role of N in extending leaf greenness in stay-green hybrids. Field studies were conducted in northeastern Australia to examine the effect of three water regimes and nine hybrids on N uptake and partitioning among organs. Nine hybrids varying in the B 35 and KS 19 sources of stay-green were grown under a fully irrigated control, post-flowering water deficit, and terminal water deficit. For hybrids grown under terminal water deficit, stay-green was viewed {{as a consequence of the}} balance between N demand by the grain and N supply during gain filling. On the demand <b>side,</b> <b>grain</b> numbers were 16 % higher in the four stay-green than in the five senescent hybrids. On the supply side, age-related senescence provided an average of 34 and 42 kg N ha(- 1) for stay-green and senescent hybrids, respectively. In addition, N uptake during grain filling averaged 116 and 82 kg ha(- 1) in stay-green and senescent hybrids. Matching the N supply from these two sources with grain N demand found that the shortfall in N supply for grain filling in the stay-green and senescent hybrids averaged 32 and 41 kg N ha(- 1) resulting in more accelerated leaf senescence in the senescent hybrids. Genotypic differences in delayed onset and reduced rate of leaf senescence were explained by differences in specific leaf nitrogen and N uptake during grain filling. Leaf nitrogen concentration at anthesis was correlated with onset (r = 0. 751 **, n = 27) and rate (r = - 0. 783 **, n = 27) of leaf senescence ender terminal water deficit...|$|E
