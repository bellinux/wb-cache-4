Spectrum sensing performed by secondary users to detect unoccupied spectrum bands, {{is a key}} enabling technique for cognitive radio. This paper proposes a truncated sequential spectrum sensing scheme, namely the <b>sequential</b> shifted <b>chi-square</b> <b>test</b> (SSCT). The SSCT has a simple test statistic and does not rely on any deterministic knowledge about primary signals. As figures of merit, the exact false-alarm probability is derived, and the miss-detection probability {{as well as the}} average sample number (ASN) are evaluated by using a numerical integration algorithm. Corroborating numerical examples show that, in comparison with fixed-sample size detection schemes such as energy detection, the SSCT delivers considerable reduction on the ASN while maintaining a comparable detection performance.

Confirm previously described co-variance patterns of TCD/ICP indices, and B. Describe thresholds for Sx (correlation between systolic flow velocity (FVs) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)) associated with outcome. Retrospective cohort of {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) patients: with TCD and ICP monitoring, we calculated various continuous indices of cerebrovascular reactivity: A. ICP (PRx – correlation between ICP and mean arterial pressure (MAP), PAx – correlation between pulse amplitude of ICP (AMP) and MAP, RAC – correlation between AMP and CPP), B. TCD (Mx – correlation between mean flow velocity (FVm) and CPP, Mx_a – correlation between FVm and MAP, Sx – correlation between FVs and CPP, Sx_a – correlation between FVs and MAP, Dx – correlation between diastolic flow velocity (FVd) and CPP, Dx_a – correlation between FVd and MAP). We assessed the relationships via various statistical techniques, including: principal component analysis, agglomerative hierarchal clustering and k-means cluster analysis. We performed <b>sequential</b> <b>chi-square</b> <b>testing</b> to define thresholds associated with outcome for Sx/Sx_a. Outcome was assessed at 6 months via dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scores: A. Favourable (GOS 4 or 5) vs. Unfavourable (GOS 3 or less), B. Alive vs. Dead. We analyzed 410 recordings in 347 patients. All analysis confirmed our previously described co-variance of Sx/Sx_a with ICP derived indices. Sx displayed thresholds of - 0. 15 for unfavourable outcome (p< 0. 0001) and - 0. 20 for mortality (p< 0. 0001). Sx_a displayed thresholds of + 0. 05 (p= 0. 019) and - 0. 10 (p= 0. 0001) for alive/dead and favourable/unfavourable outcomes. TCD systolic indices are most closely associated with ICP indices. Sx and Sx_a likely provide better approximation of ICP indices, compared to Mx/Mx_a/Dx/Dx_a. Sx provides superior outcome prediction, versus Mx, with defined thresholds.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{sequential}} spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio systems, which we term the <b>sequential</b> shifted <b>chi-square</b> <b>test</b> (SSCT). SSCT has the following attractive features for practical implementations. First, SSCT employs a simple test statistic and thus {{has a low}} implementation complexity. Secondly, SSCT is a sequential detection algorithm and is capable of achieving performance comparable to fixed sample size detection algorithms such as energy detection but with much reduced sensing time. Thirdly, SSCT is essentially a non-coherent detection algorithm {{in the sense that}} it does not require any deterministic knowledge of the primary signals. Lastly, SSCT is able to strike a desirable trade-off between sensing performance and sensing time particularly in the signal-to-noise ratio mismatched case. To evaluate sensing performance, we derive the exact false-alarm probability for SSCT, and develop numerical integration algorithms to compute misdetection prob-ability and the average sample number. We further demonstrate the performance of SSCT with several numerical examples. Index Terms—Cognitive radio, energy detection, hypothesis testing, spectrum sensing, sequential detection. I...|$|R

Among the several existing methodologies to monitor oxidation in foods, sensory analysis stands out because of the sensitivity of responses.
