As Germany's military situation became impossible by early 1945, Riefenstahl left Berlin and was hitchhiking {{with a group of}} men, trying to reach her mother, when she was taken into custody by American troops. She walked out of a holding camp, beginning a series of escapes and arrests across the chaotic landscape. At last making it back home on a bicycle, she found that American troops had seized her house. She was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> kindly they treated her.|$|E

They were written to Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, directing the brothers and militants to conduct an armed revolt. Government sources believe {{that as many as}} 18 foreign fighters from Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Afghanistan had arrived weeks before the final confrontation and established firing ranges to teach the students, including children, how to handle weapons properly. Diplomats were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of foreign fighters for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. According to government sources and western diplomats, the Al-Qaeda fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E

His {{revision}} was very light, {{as he did}} not want to make the language wholly contemporary, but rather wanted to correct flaws he disagreed with as an educator. Other, less orthodox Americans were bringing out their own versions of the New Testament, but he had no interest in theologically motivated changes.

500|$|Jasmine's {{singing voice}} is {{provided}} by Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga. Salonga's Tony Award-winning performance in the musical Miss Saigon helped her garner the interest of casting director Albert Tavares, who proceeded to leave a note for the singer on the stage door before leaving a show he had attended. Salonga's agent then scheduled her audition, at which she performed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] from The Little Mermaid. Salonga finally began recording a demo of [...] "A Whole New World" [...] a few days later. With the casting of Salonga, Larkin became one of Disney's first voice actors to not provide the singing voice of the character she voices, and thus Jasmine {{marked the first time}} Disney decided to separate a character's speaking and singing voices.

500|$|The {{similarities}} between the design of Vaan and Tetsuya Nomura's have been criticized, which artist Akihiko Yoshida noted was likely due to the similar colours used. In the book Final Fantasy and Philosophy: The Ultimate Walkthrough, he is described by Greg Littmann as a pick pocket and, unlike many of Final Fantasys protagonists, lacking in a [...] "sense of honesty and justice". GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described Vaan as the [...] "token androgynous male lead", also describing him as an [...] "Aladdin-type". G4 TV editor Greg Orlando described him as [...] "eminently likable" [...] due to the game's focus on [...] "political intrigue" [...] and Vaan trying to understand it all.

Kotaku's Jason Schreir considered Vaan and Penelo the game's weak points as they compared them with other characters such as Balthier and Asche whose actions were [...] "interesting".

500|$|The British {{entry into}} the {{maritime}} fur trade dates to 1778 and the third voyage of Captain James Cook. While sailing north {{to search for the}} fabled Northwest Passage, Cook discovered the Hawaiian Islands. On the Northwest Coast, he spent a month in Nootka Sound, during which he and his crew traded with the Nuu-chah-nulth from the village of Yuquot. They ended up with over 300 furs, mostly sea otter, but thought them of no great value. Later, after Cook had been killed in Hawaii, the expedition visited Canton and were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> much money the Chinese were willing to pay for the furs. A profit of 1,800% was made. James King, one of the commanders after Cook's death, wrote, [...] "the advantages that might be derived from a voyage to that part of the American coast, undertaken with commercial views, appear to me of a degree of importance sufficient to call for the attention of the public." [...] The crews of the two ships were so eager to return to Nootka Sound and acquire more furs, they were [...] "not far short of mutiny". Nevertheless, they sailed for England, arriving there in October 1780. Accounts of Cook's voyage and the sea otter trade were published in the 1780s, triggering a rush of entrepreneurial voyages to the Northwest Coast.|$|E

Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained.

Principal record producer and bass guitarist of the group, A.B. Quintanilla, discovered then 17-year old Chris Pérez, {{who at the}} time was the guitarist for Tejano music singer Shelly Lares. Pérez auditioned {{to be part of the}} group, finding A.B.'s music production style to be his original inspiration in wanting to become part of Selena y Los Dinos. At first, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.—the manager of the group, and the father of A.B., Suzette Quintanilla, and Selena—dismissed Pérez, seeing him as more of a rocker and found him to be unequipped for a Tejano band. Betty Cortina, editor-at-large for People magazine, stated that Pérez was the antithesis of Abraham's [...] "clean cut good kids" [...] image. A.B persuaded Abraham that Pérez was capable of performing Tejano music, adding that Pérez's rocker image was harmless. Pérez was then hired as the band's guitarist after the band finished recording Ven Conmigo. Pérez was surprised at how the group worked during the entire production of Entre a Mi Mundo. During pre-production, keyboardist Ricky Vela would sequence the music—Pérez was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> much importance the group put on this—while A.B. would work alongside Vela with any technical problems they faced, as well as choosing the compositions that would be recorded by Selena.|$|E
