5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, {{mortality rates}} at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that is, five years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates {{could have been avoided}} if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. <b>Streptomycin,</b> the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E
25|$|<b>Streptomycin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} drug, {{the first of}} a class of drugs called aminoglycosides to be discovered, and was the first antibiotic remedy for tuberculosis. <b>Streptomycin</b> cannot be given orally as it must be administered by regular intramuscular injection. In 1943, Albert Schatz discovered <b>Streptomycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|If treated early {{antibiotics}} {{for eight}} weeks are effective in 80% of people. This often includes the medications rifampicin and <b>streptomycin.</b> Clarithromycin or moxifloxacin are sometimes used instead of <b>streptomycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{people are}} treated early, {{antibiotics}} {{for eight weeks}} are effective in 80%. The treatment often includes the medications rifampicin and <b>streptomycin.</b> Clarithromycin or moxifloxacin are sometimes used instead of <b>streptomycin.</b> Other treatments may include cutting out the ulcer. After the infection heals, the area typically has a scar.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{for treatment}} brucellosis is combination of doxycycline and <b>streptomycin</b> and the second-line is combination of doxyxycline and rifampicin (rifampin).|$|E
25|$|In 1944 Albert Schatz, Elizabeth Bugie, and Selman Waksman {{isolated}} <b>streptomycin</b> {{produced by}} a bacterial strain Streptomyces griseus. <b>Streptomycin</b> was the first effective antibiotic against M. tuberculosis. This discovery is generally considered {{the beginning of the}} modern era of tuberculosis, although the true revolution began some years later, in 1952, with the development of isoniazid, the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of rifampin in the 1970s hastened recovery times, and significantly reduced the number of tuberculosis cases until the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Treatments for {{primidone}} overdose {{have included}} hemoperfusion with forced diuresis, {{a combination of}} bemegride and amiphenazole; and a combination of bemegride, spironolactone, caffeine, pentylenetetrazol, strophanthin, penicillin and <b>streptomycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and either <b>streptomycin</b> or ethambutol. It is not generally recommended {{for the treatment of}} latent tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|If {{diagnosed}} {{in time the}} various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are <b>streptomycin,</b> chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, gentamicin and doxycycline have proven effective in monotherapeutic treatment of plague.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{antibiotics}} act by inhibiting translation. These include anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, <b>streptomycin,</b> erythromycin, and puromycin. Prokaryotic ribosomes {{have a different}} structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any harm to a eukaryotic host's cells.|$|E
25|$|Several {{classes of}} {{antibiotics}} {{are effective in}} treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as <b>streptomycin</b> and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1–15%, compared to a mortality of 40–60% in untreated cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{best way}} to control a disease is an use of healthy seeds {{that have already been}} acid extracted. In addition, using {{chemical}} treatments such as copper hydroxide or <b>streptomycin</b> in the seed bed, removing or isolating diseased crops can be helpful to reduce the rate of infection.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, <b>streptomycin,</b> and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} drug <b>streptomycin</b> had been {{developed}} and shown to kill mycobacterium tuberculosis, this medicine was not available to Indians who were patients at Indian sanatoria, {{at the time of}} Madonna Swan’s confinement. Both the poor living conditions and the lack of medicine were common, as health care for the American Indian was substandard due to discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Aminoglycoside {{antibiotics}} (gentamicin) {{can be used}} {{to treat}} Ménière's disease. Systemic <b>streptomycin</b> (given by injection) and topical gentamicin (given directly to the inner ear) are useful for their ability to affect the hair cells of the balance system. Gentamicin also can affect the hair cells of the cochlea, though, and cause hearing loss in about 10% of patients. In cases that do not respond to medical management, surgery may be indicated.|$|E
25|$|Aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as kanamycin, gentamicin, <b>streptomycin,</b> etc., {{were once}} {{effective}} against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides' action, which occurs via protonated amine and/or hydroxyl {{interactions with the}} ribosomal RNA of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted: aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, ribosomal mutations, and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Hill had a {{distinguished}} career {{in research and}} teaching and as author of a very successful textbook, Principles of Medical Statistics, but he is famous for two landmark studies. He was the statistician on the Medical Research Council <b>Streptomycin</b> in Tuberculosis Trials Committee and their study evaluating the use of <b>streptomycin</b> in treating tuberculosis, is generally accepted as the first randomised clinical trial. The use of randomisation in agricultural experiments had been pioneered by Ronald Aylmer Fisher. The second study was rather {{a series of studies}} with Richard Doll on smoking and lung cancer. The first paper, published in 1950, was a case-control study comparing lung cancer patients with matched controls. Doll and Hill also started a long-term prospective study of smoking and health. This was an investigation of the smoking habits and health of 40,701 British doctors for several years (British doctors study). Fisher was in profound disagreement with the conclusions and procedures of the smoking/cancer work and from 1957 he criticised the work in the press and in academic publications.|$|E
25|$|The health reforms {{coincided with}} the {{development}} of a new vaccine and of new drugs (e.g. BCG and penicillin) that helped to treat a previously untreatable group of medical conditions. Browne introduced mass free screening for tuberculosis sufferers and launched a huge construction program to build new hospitals and sanitoria, financed by the income and accumulated investments from the Health Department-controlled Hospital Sweeps funds. This, along with the introduction of <b>Streptomycin,</b> helped dramatically reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|If E. coli {{bacteria}} {{escape the}} intestinal tract through a perforation (for example from an ulcer, a ruptured appendix, or {{due to a}} surgical error) and enter the abdomen, they usually cause peritonitis that can be fatal without prompt treatment. However, E. coli are extremely sensitive to such antibiotics as <b>streptomycin</b> or gentamicin. Recent research suggests treatment of enteropathogenic E. coli with antibiotics may not improve {{the outcome of the}} disease, as it may significantly increase the chance of developing haemolytic-uremic syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonspecificity}} of Jaffe's reaction causes falsely elevated creatinine {{results in}} the presence of protein, glucose, acetoacetate, ascorbic acid, guanidine, acetone, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (mainly <b>streptomycin),</b> ketone bodies, α-keto acids, and other organic compounds. Ammonium is also an interferent; if the sample is plasma, care needs to be taken that ammonium heparin has not been used as an anticoagulant. Nonspecificity is markedly decreased in urine samples since urine creatinine levels are much higher than blood and it generally does not contain significant levels of interfering chromogens.|$|E
25|$|Orwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947. In July {{he ended}} the lease on the Wallington cottage. Back on Jura {{he worked on}} Nineteen Eighty-Four and made good progress. During that time his sister's family visited, and Orwell led a {{disastrous}} boating expedition, on 19 August, which nearly led to loss of life whilst trying to cross the notorious gulf of Corryvreckan {{and gave him a}} soaking which was not good for his health. In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, then a small village in the countryside, on the outskirts of Glasgow. Tuberculosis was diagnosed and the request for permission to import <b>streptomycin</b> to treat Orwell went as far as Aneurin Bevan, then Minister of Health. David Astor helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of <b>streptomycin</b> on 19 or 20 February 1948. By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of Nineteen Eighty-Four. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium at Cranham, Gloucestershire, escorted by Richard Rees.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{is through}} public health {{measures}} such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common. Vaccines have not {{been found to be}} very useful for plague prevention. Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including <b>streptomycin,</b> gentamicin, and doxycycline. Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected. Death, if it occurs, is typically within ten days. With treatment the risk of death is around 10%. Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~120 deaths. The disease is most common in Africa.|$|E
25|$|Sensitivity {{may also}} be {{controlled}} by varying the dependency of the cells on their reporter genes. For example, this may be affected by altering the concentration of histidine in the growth medium for his3-dependent cells and altering the concentration of <b>streptomycin</b> for aadA dependent cells. Selection-gene-dependency {{may also be}} controlled by applying an inhibitor of the selection gene at a suitable concentration. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) for example, is a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3-gene product and {{may be used to}} titrate the minimum level of HIS3 expression required for growth on histidine-deficient media.|$|E
25|$|January 1991 – September 1994: Outbreak in South America, {{apparently}} initiated when a Chinese ship discharged ballast water. Beginning in Peru, {{there were}} 1.04million identified cases and almost 10,000 deaths. The causative agent was an O1, El Tor strain, with small differences from the seventh pandemic strain. In 1992 a new strain appeared in Asia, a non-O1, nonagglutinable vibrio (NAG), which was named O139 Bengal. It was first identified in Tamil Nadu, India {{and for a}} while displaced El Tor in southern Asia. It decreased in prevalence from 1995 to around 10% of all cases. It is considered to be an intermediate between El Tor and the classic strain, and occurs in a new serogroup. Scientists warn of evidence of wide-spectrum resistance by cholera bacteria to drugs such as trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and <b>streptomycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{secondary}} metabolites from endophyte-plant interactions {{have also}} been isolated and used in raw or derived forms to produce a variety of drugs treating many conditions. The toxic properties of ergot alkaloids also make them useful {{in the treatment of}} headaches and throughout the process of giving birth by inducing contractions and stemming hemorrhages. Drugs used to treat Parkinson's Disease have been created from isolates of ergot toxins, although health risks may accompany their use. Ergotamine has also been used to synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide because of its chemical similarity to lysergic acid. The generally chemically-based defense properties of endophytic fungi make them a perfect group of organisms to search for new antibiotic compounds within, as other fungi have in the past yielded such useful drugs as penicillin and <b>streptomycin</b> and plants use their antibiotic qualities as a defense against pathogens.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and <b>streptomycin.</b> To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, {{rates of}} {{tuberculosis}} {{began to rise}} in the early 1600s to a peak level in the 1800s, when it caused nearly 25% of all deaths. By the 1950s, mortality in Europe had decreased about 90%. Improvements in sanitation, vaccination, and other public health measures began significantly reducing rates of tuberculosis even {{before the arrival of}} <b>streptomycin</b> and other antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat. In 1946, the development of the antibiotic <b>streptomycin</b> made effective treatment and cure of TB a reality. Prior to the introduction of this medication, the only treatment was surgical intervention, including the [...] "pneumothorax technique", which involved collapsing an infected lung to [...] "rest" [...] it and allow tuberculous lesions to heal.|$|E
500|$|On 6 July 1948, Jinnah {{returned}} to Quetta, {{but at the}} advice of doctors, soon journeyed to an even higher retreat at Ziarat. [...] Jinnah had always been reluctant to undergo medical treatment, but realising his condition was getting worse, the Pakistani government sent the best doctors it could find to treat him. Tests confirmed tuberculosis, and also showed evidence of advanced lung cancer. Jinnah was informed and asked for full information on his disease and for care in how his sister was told. He was treated with the new [...] "miracle drug" [...] of <b>streptomycin,</b> {{but it did not}} help. Jinnah's condition continued to deteriorate despite the Eid prayers of his people. He was moved to the lower altitude of Quetta on 13 August, the eve of Independence Day, for which a statement ghost-written for him was released. [...] Despite an increase in appetite (he then weighed just over [...] ), it was clear to his doctors that if he was to return to Karachi in life, he would have to do so very soon. Jinnah, however, was reluctant to go, not wishing his aides to see him as an invalid on a stretcher.|$|E
2500|$|The 1952 prize, awarded {{solely to}} Selman Waksman for his {{discovery}} of <b>streptomycin,</b> omitted the recognition some felt {{due to his}} co-discoverer Albert Schatz. There was [...] litigation brought by Schatz against Waksman over the details and credit of the <b>streptomycin</b> discovery; [...] Schatz was awarded a substantial settlement, and, together with Waksman, Schatz was to be officially recognized as a co-discoverer of <b>streptomycin</b> as concerned patent rights. However, he is not recognized as a Nobel Prize laureate.|$|E
