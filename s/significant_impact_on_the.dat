A total of 287 respondents in Palestine responded to the survey. The results show that performance expectancy has a <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intention to shop online. A <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> of effort expectancy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intention to shop online is also observed.

The results also show that the attitude toward shopping for products or services via online shopping is salient in determining the intention to shop online. Trust has a <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> attitude towards shopping online.
