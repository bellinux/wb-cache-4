5000|$|The {{concept of}} picking players {{and running a}} contest based on their {{year-to-date}} stats {{has been around since}} shortly after World War II. One of the earliest published accounts of fantasy sports involved Oakland businessman and one time Oakland Raiders limited partner Wilfred [...] "Bill" [...] Winkenbach. He devised fantasy golf {{in the latter part of}} the 1950s. [...] Each player selected a team of professional golfers and the person with the lowest combined total of strokes at the end of the tournament would win. Golf is a simple fantasy game to administer and keep tabs on, <b>since</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> is concerned only with the scores of his or her team members without anything else to complicate it. However, it was never organized into a widespread hobby or formal business.|$|E

In TPR 2.0, individual member profile pages were brought into existence on the site.Signing up is free, and at present so is participation. Each submission that a member wishes to have considered requires them to electronically sign an agreement which covers copyrights and employment <b>since</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> is considered an employee for hire with the possibility of being asked to do more in promoting the site as well as themselves. In most cases, participation is considered for charitable causes. However, there have been instances where a member is contacted and offered more, such as a percentage of copyright in a recording contract for their submission(s) or artistic contribution(s).|$|E
5000|$|The game of bingo {{has been}} able to sidestep many of the laws which ban {{gambling}} online. In England, for instance, section 65 of the 1928 Royal Commission Report on Gambling states, “Bingo is a lottery played as a game.” [...] The report details that a game of chance is different than that of casino games, even requiring separate licensing. <b>Since</b> <b>each</b> bingo <b>participant</b> receives a random set of numbers, the chances of winning for <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> are equal. The Royal Commission Report has given the game of bingo a chance to thrive in the highly contested cyber gambling community.|$|R

All are welcome and the group has grown and shrunk over the years, from a lowest attendance of five to a peak of 24 attendees. Currently they average twelve to fifteen attendees a month.|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} a distinctive class of combinatorial auction pro-tocols called a Price-oriented, Rationing-free (PORF) pro-tocol, {{which can be}} used as a guideline for developing strategy/false-name proof protocols. A PORF protocol is automatically guaranteed to be strategy-proof, i. e., for each agent, declaring its true evaluation values is an optimal strat-egy regardless of the declarations of other agents. Further-more, if a PORF protocol satisfies additional conditions, the protocol is also guaranteed to be false-name-proof, that is, it eliminates the benefits from using false-name bids, i. e., bids submitted under multiple fictitious names such as multiple e-mail addresses. For Intemet auction protocols, being false-name-proof is important <b>since</b> identifying <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> on the Intemet is virtually impossible. The characteristics of a PORF protocol are as follows. For each agent, the price of each bundle of goods is presented. This price is determined based on the declared evaluation val-ues of other agents, while it is independent of its own declara-tion. Then, each agent can choose the bundle that maximizes its utility independently of the allocations of other agents (i. e., mOoning-free). We show that an existing false-name-proof protocol can be represented as a PORF protocol. Further-more, we develop a new false-name-proof PORF protocol...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{researchers}} have demonstrated a general evaluative bias against women. [...] In an audit {{study in which}} they sent email requests to meet to professors in doctoral programs at the top 260 U.S. universities, researchers found evidence for discrimination against ethnic minorities and women relative to Caucasian men. [...] While {{it was impossible to}} determine whether any particular individual in this study was exhibiting discrimination, <b>since</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> only viewed a request from one potential graduate student, the overall tendency to favor Caucasian men over all other groups indicates that discrimination is still very much an issue. In another study, science faculty were sent the materials of student who was applying for a lab manager position at their university. The materials were the same for each participant, but each participant was randomly assigned either a male or a female name. The researchers found that faculty members rated the male candidate as both more competent and more hirable than the female candidate, {{despite the fact that the}} applications were identical except for the applicant's gender. Again, it is impossible to say whether any of the individual faculty members were acting in a discriminatory fashion, but it is apparent that there is still a widespread bias against women in science fields. Another study by Ceci, Ginther, Kahn, and Williams (2014) reported a that men are favored in some domains, such as, tenure rates in biology, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair; the authors interpreted this to suggest that the underrepresentation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration. In a subsequent article by Wendy Williams and Stephen Ceci, 872 faculty at 371 institutions and in all fifty states were studied. They found that faculty strongly preferred to hire an assistant professor who was a woman over an identically-qualified competitor who was a man. Moreover, they showed that in the real world of professorial hiring, there has been a similar preference for hiring women dating back to the 1990s.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine whether {{analogue}} patients agree with assessments of medical students’ communication skills by examiners and standardized patients. Furthermore, we aim to examine whether gender, age, health status and trust in medical care influenced analogue patients evaluations and agreement with examiner and standardized patient ratings. Method: Videotaped consultations from medical students’ communication exams were evaluated by 34 men and 29 women who were recruited from the general public. <b>Since</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> rated four consultations, which varied with regard to assessments of examiners and standardized patients, in total 252 evaluations were given. Results: Multilevel analyses revealed no main effects of standardized patient or examiner ratings, but an interaction effect between those two variables on analogue patient ratings. No gender differences, or influences of age, health status or trust were found in evaluations of communication, nor in the agreement with examiners and standardized patients evaluations. Conclusion: Analogue patients show little agreement with the evaluations of physicians’ communication skills by examiners and standardized patients. In this study, no indications were found for differences between men and women in the agreement with standardized patient and examiners’ assessments of clinical communication...|$|E

30|$|This study uses a {{cross-over}} design {{to compare the}} two different therapy intervention programs: robotic assisted gait training (Lokomat) versus gait-focused PT (see Fig.  1). The order of treatment (Lokomat or PT first) is designated by random assignment. Children cross-over to the second intervention arm following a six-week non-treatment break between interventions. The second intervention arm begins after a second baseline assessment completed {{at the end of}} the break to re-establish the child’s abilities. The use of a {{cross-over design}} helps to reduce the impact of confounding variables outside of the control of the study itself, <b>since</b> <b>each</b> cross-over <b>participant</b> acts as his/her own control (i.e., reduces between subject variation) (Senn 2002). Cross-over designs are also more efficient than standard RCTs or repeated measure designs, requiring fewer participants (Louis et al. 1984). While there may be concern that the extended length of involvement in the trial to complete both phases may be an obstacle for enrolment or adherence, cross-over designs have been successfully employed in CP and Lokomat research (McNee et al. 2007; Mayr et al. 2007). Furthermore, the opportunity to receive both intervention arms and be assured access to the Lokomat is thought to outweigh any perceived burden of the time commitment (Law et al. 1997).|$|R
