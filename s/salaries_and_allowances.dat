2500|$|India paid 176 crore to its 543 Lok Sabha {{members in}} {{salaries}} and expenses over 2015, or just over 2.7 lakh a month per Member of Parliament. The Salary, allowances and pension of Member of the Lok Sabha {{is governed by}} [...] "Members of Parliament Act, 1954". The act is in pursuance to the constitutional provisions where article 106 of the Constitution of India provides {{that the members of}} either House of Parliament shall be entitled to receive such <b>salaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> as may from time to time be determined by Parliament by law.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, judges {{should be}} {{independent}} from the pressures exerted by third parties {{such as the}} general public, the media and non-governmental organizations. To reduce direct third-party influence on judges, the SCA and SCJA provide that judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court, cannot take any office of [...] (that is, a paid position), carry out any business directly or indirectly, or accept fees for any office, , emoluments or advantages {{in addition to their}} <b>salaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b> While judges cannot join private legal practice during their tenure, Singapore law does not forbid judges who have resigned or retired to return to private practice. It has been said that this causes potential executive interference with judicial independence to be counterproductive, and may give a judge more confidence to decide disputes without fear or favour.|$|E
6000|$|XCI. That {{the said}} Warren Hastings, {{in order to}} ruin the Resident Bristow, and to justify himself for his former {{proceedings}} respecting him, did bring before the board a new charge against him, for having paid a large establishment of offices and pensions to the Company's servants from the revenues of Oude; and the said Bristow, in making his defence against the charge aforesaid, did plead, {{that he had found}} all the allowances on his list established before his last appointment to the Residency,--that they had grown to that excess in the interval between his first removal by the said Warren Hastings and his reappointment; and having adduced many reasons to make it highly probable that the said Hastings was perfectly well acquainted with it, and did approve of the expensive establishments which he, the said Bristow, simply had paid, but not imposed, he did allege, besides the official assurances of his predecessor, Middleton, certain facts, as amounting to a direct proof that the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, was not averse to the Vizier's granting large salaries to more than one European gentleman. And the first instance was to Mr. Thomas, a surgeon, who, exclusive of his pay from the Company, which was 1,440l. a year, claimed from the Vizier, with Mr. Hastings's knowledge, the sum of 9,763l. a year, and upwards, making together 11,203l. per annum. The next was Mr. Trevor Wheler, who did receive, upon the same establishment, when he was Fourth Assistant at Oude, 6,000l. a year; and which last fact the said Hastings has admitted upon record [...] "that the accusations of Mr. Bristow and Mr. Cowper did oblige and compel him to acknowledge,"--denying, at the same time, that the allowances of the Residents Middleton and Bristow, except in this single instance, were ever authorized by him; whereas his own agent, Palmer, did, in his letter of the 27th of March, 1785, represent, that the said <b>salaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> (if not more and larger) were by him authorized or confirmed.|$|E

60|$|First, I beg {{leave to}} observe that what I shall think {{necessary}} to state, as matter of preliminary explanation, {{in order to give}} your Lordships a true idea of the scene of action, of the instruments which Mr. Hastings employed, and the effects which they produced,--all this I wish to be distinguished from matter brought to criminate. Even the matter, as stated by me, which may be hereafter brought to criminate, so far as it falls to my share at present, is only to be considered, in this stage of the business, as merely illustrative. Your Lordships are to expect, as undoubtedly you will require, substantial matter of crimination to be laid open for that purpose at the moment when the evidence to each charge is ready to be produced to you. Thus your Lordships will easily separate historical illustration from criminal opening. For instance, if I stated yesterday to your Lordships, as I did, the tyranny and cruelty of one of the usurping viceroys, whose usurpation and whose vices led the way to the destruction of his country and the introduction of a foreign power, I do not mean to charge Mr. Hastings with any part of that guilt: what bears upon Mr. Hastings is his having avowedly looked to such a tyrant and such a usurper as his model, and followed that pernicious example with a servile fidelity. When I have endeavored to lay open to your Lordships anything abusive, or leading to abuse, from defects or errors in the constitution of the Company's service, I did not mean to criminate Mr. Hastings on any part of those defects and errors: I state them to show that he took advantage of the imperfections of the institution to lot in his abuse of the power with which he was intrusted. If, for a further instance, I have stated that in general the service of the India Company was insufficient in legal pay or emolument and abundant in the means of illegal profit, I do not state that defect as owing to Mr. Hastings; but I state it as a fact, to show in what manner and on what pretences he did, fraudulently, corruptly, and for the purposes of his own ambition, take advantage of that defect, and, under color of reformation, make an illegal, partial, corrupt rise of emoluments to certain favored persons without regard to the interests of the service at large,--increasing rather than lessening the means of illicit emolument, as well as loading the Company with many heavy and ruinous expenses in avowed <b>salaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b>|$|E
