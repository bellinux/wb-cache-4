50|$|Catch basins are {{commonly}} designed with a <b>sump</b> <b>area</b> below the outlet pipe level {{which is a}} reservoir for water and debris to help prevent the pipe from clogging. Unless they are constructed with permeable bottoms to allow water to infiltrate into the underlying soil, this subterranean basin can become a perfect mosquito breeding area because it is cool, dark, and retains stagnant water {{for long periods of}} time. Combined with standard grates which have holes large enough for mosquitoes to enter and leave the basin, this is a major problem in mosquito control.|$|E

40|$|The Benson Beach {{littoral}} drift restoration {{project is}} a demonstration project that will replenish sand on Benson Beach, the public beach north of the North Jetty {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia River (MCR), using material dredged from the river during normal maintenance dredging of the navigational channel. A U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) proposal involves pumping the material from a <b>sump</b> <b>area</b> on the south side of the jetty to Benson Beach using a cutter suction dredge, also known as a pipeline dredge. If this one-time demonstration project proves feasible and successful, up to a million cubic yards of sediment could be used to replenish the outer coast littoral drift system in successive years by the same process. The primary goal of this study was to assess the potential risk of impacts to Dungeness crab from the proposed Benson Beach littoral drift restoration process of using the cutter suction dredge to move sediment from the proposed <b>sump</b> <b>area</b> on one side of the North Jetty to the beach on the other side of the jetty. Because there are no direct measurements of crab entrainment by pipeline dredge operating outside of the lower Columbia River navigation channel, dredge impacts for the proposed demonstration project were estimated using a modification of the dredge impact model (DIM) of Armstrong et al. (1987). The model estimates adult equivalent loss (AEL) of crabs using crab population density from trawl surveys, dredge project information (gear type, season, location, volume), and an entrainment function relating crab population density to entrainment by the dredge. The input used in applying the DIM to the Benson Beach littoral drift restoration included the specific dredging scenario provided by the Corps, existing data on crab density in previously proposed sump areas, and a series of entrainment functions. A total of fourteen scenarios were modeled and the outcomes compared with six reference scenarios intended to represent realistic to worst cases. Dungeness crab entrainment and subsequent loss of recruitment to adult age classes and the crab fishery estimated for the Benson Beach littoral drift restoration project varied widely (over three orders of magnitude) because of the range of assumptions about initial crab density, dredging scenarios, and entrainment functions. Although the comparison to reference scenarios helps put the results in perspective, losses to the crab fishery could still span two orders of magnitude. This uncertainty can only be assessed by direct measurements of crab entrainment during the demonstration project if crab losses are to be more accurately estimated for the demonstration, which is recommended in order to evaluate cumulative crab losses from successive replenishment efforts...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} has {{consequences for}} surface water quality. Stormwater {{is a large}} component of urban water degradation that is poorly understood. Precipitation is quickly transported via underground pipes, from the land to the stream without following water 2 ̆ 7 s natural flow path. Studies have correlated detention ponds with improved water quality and impervious surface cover with degraded water quality. However, other physical characteristics within a storm sewer shed including the presence of <b>sump</b> pumps, <b>area</b> and pipe miles may also affect the stormwater quality. We chose 18 storm sewer systems in Bloomington, IL. We measured pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, and total suspended solids Relationships and differences among the physical characteristics and water quality was determined using correlation and ANOVA analyses. We found {{that the presence of}} a pond significantly lowered total suspended solids and the greater the length of pipe the lower the concentration of nitrate. This research could contribute to how storm sewers are built and retrofitted in the future to decrease the water quality degradation from storm events...|$|R

40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit 252 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 252 consists of Corrective Action Site (CAS) 25 - 07 - 02, Engine Test Stand- 1 (ETS- 1) Decontamination Pad. Located in Area 25 {{at the intersection of}} Road H and Road K at the Nevada Test Site, ETS- 1 was designed for use as a mobile radiation checkpoint and for vehicle decontamination. The CAS consists of a concrete decontamination pad with a drain, a gravel-filled sump, two concrete trailer pads, and utility boxes. Constructed in 1966, the ETS- 1 facility was part of the Nuclear Rocket Development Station (NRDS) complex and used to test nuclear rockets. The ETS- 1 Decontamination Pad and mobile radiation check point was built in 1968. The NRDS complex ceased primary operations in 1973. Based on site history, the focus of the field investigation activities will be to determine if any primary contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) (including radionuclides, total volatile organic compounds, total semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, total pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls) are present at this site. Vertical extent of migration of suspected vehicle decontamination effluent COPCs is expected to be less than 12 feet below ground surface. Lateral extent of migration of COPCs is expected to be limited to the <b>sump</b> <b>area</b> or near the northeast corner of the decontamination pad. Using a biased sampling approach, near-surface and subsurface sampling will be conducted at the suspected worst-case areas including the sump and soil near the northeast corner of the decontamination pad. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible e valuation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Oil and gas {{exploration}} {{conducted in}} the 1970 s left a legacy of abandoned test wells with sumps, containing drilling waste, in the Mackenzie Delta region of Canada’s Northwest Territories. One to {{two years after the}} test wells were decommissioned, a set of sites were seeded with non-native grasses and fertilized to test whether these treatments could accelerate vegetation recovery and prevent erosion. We sampled seeded and unseeded sumps and adjacent tundra vegetation in the Mackenzie Delta region three decades later to examine the impact of post-disturbance seeding treatments on site recovery. Plant species composition and environmental data were collected at 12 sump sites (6 seeded and fertilized and 6 unseeded and unfertilized) in lowland and upland tundra. Multivariate analyses using NMDS and perMANOVA indicated that in the lowlands, seeding and fertilization treatments had small but significant effects on plant species composition that differentiated seeded from unseeded sump caps. Plant communities on sump caps for all treatment types were significantly different from surrounding undisturbed tundra, even after more than 30 years of recovery. Seeded non-native grasses were found on both seeded and unseeded sumps, but not in the surrounding undisturbed tundra. Undisturbed tundra appears resistant to the spread of introduced agronomic grasses, but disturbed <b>areas,</b> such as <b>sumps,</b> provide <b>areas</b> of suitable habitat where non-native plants can persist.

40|$|The {{lubrication}} system {{of an internal}} combustion engine serves many purposes. It lubricates moving parts, cools the engine, removes impurities, supports loads, and minimizes friction. The entrapment of air in the lubricating oil is called oil aeration. Oil aeration can be detrimental to internal combustion (IC) engines. This study attempts to determine a means to reduce the level of aeration in a typical IC engine. Experiments were performed on a motored Ford 3. 0 L V 6 DOHC engine which was capable of reaching speeds up to 8000 rpm. Oil was sampled from the sump in the pump pick up <b>area.</b> <b>Sump</b> temperature, oil volume, and engine speed were continuously monitored. Aeration measurements were made via an x-ray absorption technique using a machine called Air-X. A repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) study was performed initially. This study determined that the measurement technique was sufficiently repeatable within the tolerance of the Air-X machine. Tests were then performed which varied parameters such as engine speed, oil volume, and hardware design. Specifically, multiple designs of the windage tray, an engine component that separates the oil sump from the rotating crankshaft, were tested. Testing revealed that within the tolerance of the Air-X machine, {{the extent of the}} windage tray open area has no significant affect on the aeration level. by Bridget A. Baran. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 543 : Liquid Disposal Units {{is listed}} in Appendix III of the ''Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order'' (FFACO) which was agreed to {{by the state of}} Nevada, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the U. S. Department of Defense (FFACO, 1996). CAU 543 sites are located in Areas 6 and 15 of the Nevada Test Site (NTS), which is {{approximately}} 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. CAU 543 consists of the following seven Corrective Action Sites (CASs) (Figure 1) : CAS 06 - 07 - 01, Decon Pad; CAS 15 - 01 - 03, Aboveground Storage Tank; CAS 15 - 04 - 01, Septic Tank; CAS 15 - 05 - 01, Leachfield; CAS 15 - 08 - 01, Liquid Manure Tank; CAS 15 - 23 - 01, Underground Radioactive Material Area; and CAS 15 - 23 - 03, Contaminated <b>Sump,</b> Piping. All <b>Area</b> 15 CASs are located at the former U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Farm, which operated from 1963 to 1981 and was used to support animal experiments involving the uptake of radionuclides. Each of the Area 15 CASs, except CAS 15 - 23 - 01, is associated with the disposal of waste effluent from Building 15 - 06, which was the primary location of the various tests and experiments conducted onsite. Waste effluent disposal from Building 15 - 06 involved piping, sumps, outfalls, a septic tank with leachfield, underground storage tanks, and an aboveground storage tank (AST). CAS 15 - 23 - 01 was associated with decontamination activities of farm equipment potentially contaminated with radiological constituents, pesticides, and herbicides. While the building structures were removed before the investigation took place, all the original tanks, sumps, piping, and concrete building pads remain in place. The Area 6 CAS is located at the Decontamination Facility in Area 6, a facility which operated from 1971 to 2001 and was used to decontaminate vehicles, equipment, clothing, and other materials that had become contaminated during nuclear testing activities. The CAS includes the effluent collection and distribution systems for Buildings 6 - 605, 6 - 606, and 6 - 607, which consists of septic tanks, sumps, piping, floor drains, drain trenches, cleanouts, and a concrete foundation. Additional details of the site history are provided in the CAU 543 Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) (U. S.

40|$|This Corrective Action Decision Document {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 322, Areas 1 and 3 Release Sites and Injection Wells, Nevada Test Site, Nevada, {{in accordance with the}} ''Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order'' (1996). Corrective Action Unit 322 is comprised of the following corrective action sites (CASs) : (1) 01 - 25 - 01 - AST Release Site; (2) 03 - 25 - 03 - Mud Plant and AST Diesel Release; and (3) 03 - 20 - 05 - Injection Wells and BOP Shop. The purpose of this Corrective Action Decision Document is to identify and provide the rationale for the recommendation of a corrective action alternative for each CAS within CAU 322. Corrective action investigation activities were performed from April 2004 through September 2004, as set forth in the Corrective Action Investigation Plan. The purposes of the activities as defined during the data quality objectives process were: (1) Determine if contaminants of concern (COCs) are present; (2) If COCs are present, determine their nature and extent; and (3) Provide sufficient information and data to recommend appropriate corrective actions for the CASs. Analytes detected during the corrective action investigation were evaluated against appropriate preliminary action levels to identify contaminants of concern for each corrective action site. Radiological field measurements were compared to unrestricted release criteria. Assessment of the data generated from investigation activities revealed the following: (1) CAS 01 - 25 - 01 contains an AST berm contaminated with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) diesel-range organics (DRO). (2) CAS 03 - 25 - 03 includes two distinct areas: Area A where no contamination remains from a potential spill associated with an AST, and Area B where TPH-DRO contamination associated with various activities at the mud plant was identified. The Area B contamination was found at various locations and depths. (3) CAS 03 - 25 - 03 Area B contains TPH-DRO contamination at various locations and depths in the area associated with the Mud Plant. (4) CAS 03 - 20 - 05 contains TPH-DRO, metals, and radiological contamination within the injection well casing soil and TPH-DRO contamination at the depth coincidental with the bottom of the injection well sump. Based on the evaluation of analytical data from the corrective action investigation, review of future and current operations in Areas 1 and 3 of the Nevada Test Site, and the detailed and comparative analysis of the potential corrective action alternatives, the following corrective actions are recommended for the Corrective Action Unit 322 CASs. Closure in Place with Administrative Controls is the preferred corrective action for the following CASs: (1) CAS 01 - 25 - 01, removal of TPH-DRO contamination would pose a significant safety hazard due to the site location. (2) CAS 03 - 25 - 03 No contamination remains at Area A (AST Berm); and thus, no further action is the preferred alternative at this part of the CAS. However at Area B, TPH-DRO contamination is varied in concentration and location and the footprint of the CAS is large, removal of contaminated ''pockets'' would be laborious and cost prohibitive. The plutonium- 239 surface contamination identified at CAS 03 - 25 - 03 Area B has been removed and drummed as a best management practice. (3) CAS 03 - 20 - 05, TPH-DRO, metals, and radiological contamination are present in the injection well casing soils. Recommend corrective action includes removal of the liquid in the injection well sump (approximately 3 feet (ft) of liquid at 60 ft below ground surface), grouting the <b>sump,</b> and the <b>area</b> within the injection well casing. The plutonium- 239 surface contamination identified at CAS 03 - 20 - 05 has been removed and drummed as a best management practice and will be disposed of as low-level radioactive waste. It is recommended that the liquids be removed from the holding tank wells and the sumps of the two outer holding tanks within the BOP Shop, and the sumps be grouted, and the holding tanks filled in to the BOP Shop floor surface. The preferred corrective action alternatives were evaluated on technical merit focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety. The alternatives were judged to meet all requirements for the technical components evaluated. The alternatives meet all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and will reduce potential future exposure pathways to the contaminated media at Corrective Action Unit 322...|$|R
