40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} gender differences in self-concept, self-esteem, and depression among gifted (n= 68) and non-gifted (n= 174) adolescents in Lebanon. Participants were 242 adolescents (110 males and 132 females), with a mean age of 13. 9 years. Four measures were used: DISCOVER assessment, Piers-Harris 2 self-concept scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (RSE), and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). The 2 -way MANOVAs yielded significant main effects for gender and student type (gifted vs. non-gifted). Further univariate analyses showed that participants had mostly average levels of global self-concept and self-esteem, and low levels of depressive symptoms. Also, gifted participants had <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> scores <b>on</b> RSE, global self-concept, and academic self-concept. Males had <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> scores <b>on</b> Physical Image, Happiness and Satisfaction, and Freedom from Anxiety subscales, whereas girls had <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> scores <b>on</b> BDI.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between hardiness and exercise habits. 468 undergraduates participated. They answered questionnaires measured by the Hardiness Scale. We asked participants whether they exercised daily, their exercise time and frequency, and whether they belong to an athletic club activity or exercise circle. Participants were then divided into groups according to their answers about exercise habits. The results indicate that the Exercise group has <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> scores <b>on</b> the three general components of hardiness (Commitment, Control, and Challenge) than the Non-Exercise group. The Athletic Club Activity group has a <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> score <b>on</b> Commitment than the Exercise Circle and Non-Exercise groups, and a <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> score <b>on</b> Control than the Non-Exercise group.
