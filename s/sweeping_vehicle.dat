NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the <b>sweeping</b> <b>vehicle</b> modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during gliding flight, but this system would not have been usable in the Challenger situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to {{develop an understanding of}} the brushing process for a road sweeper so that a theoretical model of the process can be developed. The brush model has been confined to the kerb operating channel brush that usually sweeps about 80 % of the debris on the road in the region of the kerb. The other 20 % is swept by a roller brush beneath the vehicle. This has not been included in the study. A concept for a semi-autonomous road <b>sweeping</b> <b>vehicle</b> has also been proposed in order to sweep debris efficiently with minimum fatigue for the vehicle driver, although the debris sensing and control system have not been developed in this thesis. The metal tines of road sweeping brushes are usually rectangular in section (unlike cleaning brushes which are circular in section), giving rise to two commercial brush types. These are the flicking brush (major axis in the radial direction) and cutting brush (major axis in the tangential direction). A theoretical steady-state model of these two brushes has been developed which allows the calculation of brush axial loads, torques and tine deflection geometry as the brush rotates. The theoretical model has been validated experimentally within acceptable limits although this does require an experimental choice of the co-efficient of friction between the tines and the ground, usually between 0. 6 and 0. 7 for commercial brushes sweeping on concrete and tarmacadam surfaces. A dominant feature of the brush characteristics is the tine wear, as the brush stiffness increases over 120 % as the tine shortens by 40 %, which is the recommended minimum length taking into account brushing efficiency and damage to the road surface. The model can also be used as a tool to design new brushes so that, for example, by rotating the tine by 30 to 40 ° from the cutting brush configuration a 20 % improvement in mechanical efficiency is predicted. In order to assess the mechanism of debris removal from the road and its subsequent collection by the vacuum unit, the brush model has been incorporated into a brush sweep-gear linkage used by commercial vehicles to track the edge of the kerb. It has been shown that a constant brush contact arc on the road can be maintained by adjusting the brush angle of attack and brush height and that this relationship is independent of the vehicle speed and brush linkage with respect to the kerb. Under these contact conditions efficient sweeping may be expected. In the case of the Johnston 600 <b>sweeping</b> <b>vehicle</b> the brush contact arc angle is 150 °. This parameter is used as the output criterion for automatic control schemes that have been proposed to improve brushing efficiency and reduce driver fatigue. These will require the development of an on-line brush height sensor that can also measure brush wear...|$|E

40|$|Researchers are {{developing}} mobile sensing platforms to facilitate {{public awareness of}} environmental conditions. However, turning such awareness into practical community action and political change requires more than just collecting and presenting data. To inform research on mobile environmental sensing, we conducted design fieldwork with government, private, and public interest stakeholders. In parallel, we built an environmental air quality sensing system and deployed it on street <b>sweeping</b> <b>vehicles</b> in a major U. S. city; this served as a "research vehicle" by grounding our interviews and affording us status as environmental action researchers. In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis of the landscape of environmental action, focusing on insights that will help researchers frame meaningful technological interventions.

Sea salt may not be used, as it is too fine and dissolves too quickly, so all salt used in gritting comes from salt mines, a non-renewable source. As a result, some road maintenance agencies have networks of ice prediction stations, to prevent unnecessary gritting which not only wastes salt, but can damage the environment and disrupt traffic.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{continuously}} harvest citrus fruit using on-going harvesting machines such as canopy shakers, the catching system should catch and collect fruits continuously. In this thesis, three concepts were explored for a catching system {{appropriate for the}} canopy harvesting system. The first concept is a brush catching concept applied to low profile catching systems. Strip brush brooms were mounted {{at the end of}} collecting beds to make seals around tree trunk and along the narrow space between trees. The strip brush brooms used in this project were originally manufactured for street <b>sweeping</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Each brush could tilt from 30 degrees up to 45 degrees using an electrical linear actuator. The second concept is to adjust catching unit to an irregular tree row using tree position measured by range sensor. Brush catching units are moved laterally using actuators controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC). As the tree approaches the front of catching system, its distance is measured by range sensor. An output signal from range sensor is filtered and modulated as continuous step signal. Based on this data, brush catching units can move to accommodate tree misalignment within the row. The last concept is a kind of selective catching concept. This concept was not fully completed in this project. It required two procedures to execute; 1) skip catching mode using actuators; and 2) identifying sensing for immature or diseased trees. The first required procedure could be solved by making enough space between brush catching units for the rejected tree to pass through without catching fruits. Actuating times for skipping mode were studied and preset to PLC. Otherwise, the maturity of trees can be determined using a DGPS based tree fruit harvest selection map. A timer-based method was used to order the trees for selective rejection of immature trees in this study. The efficiency of this catching system was measured in terms of collecting rate and skipping rate under the simulated catching environment. Mean percentage in catching tennis balls (substituted for fruits) was reported as 98. 55 %, while the effectiveness for skipping immature fruits was 68 %...|$|R

50|$|The livery {{established}} in 1985 was yellow {{with a broad}} diagonal green panel on each side (about {{a third of the}} <b>vehicle)</b> <b>sweeping</b> up and forward. The name was in green serif letters, repeating along a white band above the lower deck windows (at roof level on single deck buses) interspersed with a badger logo. Some vehicles carried a white livery with one band each of yellow and green, horizontal along most of the side but up swept at the rear. These were branded for specific services: minibuses were being branded 'Mini Link' and buses with coach seats 'Swift Link', although this brand was soon dropped as it was difficult to always roster branded vehicles to Swift Link routes. Coaches that were not in Roman City, National Express or National Holidays livery were painted white, yellow and green in broad diagonal panels but these sloped backwards, opposite to ordinary buses. Open top vehicles in Bath carried Roman City livery for a while but were then changed to primrose yellow with olive and Brunswick green bands with both Badgerline and Guide Friday logos.|$|R
