5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known <b>sample</b> <b>using</b> the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under {{the name}} of Edwin Carter) was {{admitted}} for further investigation at Barnet General Hospital, London. After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine <b>sample</b> <b>using</b> spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E

25|$|Two main {{statistical}} methods {{are used in}} data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a <b>sample</b> <b>using</b> indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes {{the extent to which}} members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.|$|E
25|$|In 1785 Cavendish {{carried out}} an {{investigation}} of the composition of common (i.e. atmospheric) air, obtaining impressively accurate results. He conducted experiments in which hydrogen and ordinary air were combined in known ratios, and then exploded with a spark of electricity. Furthermore, he also described an experiment in which he was able to remove, in modern terminology, both the oxygen and nitrogen gases from a sample of atmospheric air until only a small bubble of unreacted gas was left in the original <b>sample.</b> <b>Using</b> his observations, Cavendish observed that, when he had determined the amounts of phlogisticated air (nitrogen) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen), there remained a volume of gas amounting to 1/120 of the original volume of nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of prior probabilities depends on available {{data from the}} genome being studied, {{and the type of}} analysis being performed. For studies where good reference data containing frequencies of known mutations is available (for example, in studying human genome data), these known frequencies of genotypes in the population can be used to estimate priors. Given population wide allele frequencies, prior genotype probabilities can be calculated at each locus according to the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. In the absence of such data, constant priors can be used, independent of the locus. These can be set using heuristically chosen values, possibly informed by the kind of variations being sought by the study. Alternatively, supervised machine-learning procedures have been investigated that seek to learn optimal prior values for individuals in a <b>sample,</b> <b>using</b> supplied NGS data from these individuals.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of fillers on the transfer properties of UV waterless offset ink, four ink samples compound with different fillers(SiO 2, CaCO 3 and Talc) were prepared, the flow curve, thixotropy and ink transferred ratio were tested, {{and the effects of}} rheological properties on ink-transfer were discussed.

25|$|Protein NMR {{utilizes}} multidimensional nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} experiments to obtain information about the protein. Ideally, each distinct nucleus in the molecule experiences a distinct electronic environment and thus has a distinct chemical shift by which it can be recognized. However, in large molecules such as proteins the number of resonances can typically be several thousand and a one-dimensional spectrum inevitably has incidental overlaps. Therefore, multidimensional experiments that correlate the frequencies of distinct nuclei are performed. The additional dimensions decrease the chance of overlap and have a larger information content, since they correlate signals from nuclei within a specific part of the molecule. Magnetization is transferred into the <b>sample</b> <b>using</b> pulses of electromagnetic (radiofrequency) energy and between nuclei using delays; the process is described with so-called pulse sequences. Pulse sequences allow the experimenter to investigate and select specific types of connections between nuclei. The array of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} experiments used on proteins fall in two main categories — one where magnetization is transferred through the chemical bonds, and one where the transfer is through space, irrespective of the bonding structure. The first category is used to assign the different chemical shifts to a specific nucleus, {{and the second is}} primarily used to generate the distance restraints used in the structure calculation, and in the assignment with unlabelled protein.|$|E

2500|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} is {{a technique}} {{that is used to}} assay a <b>sample</b> <b>using</b> a fluorescent probe. [...] DNA nucleotides themselves are not good candidates for this technique because they do not readily re-emit light upon light excitation. [...] A fluorescent marker is needed to detect base flipping. 2-Aminopurine is a base that is structurally similar to adenine, but is very fluorescent when flipped out from the DNA duplex. [...] It is commonly used to detect base flipping and has an excitation at 305‑320nm and emission at 370nm so that it well separated from the excitations of proteins and DNA. [...] Other fluorescent probes used to study DNA base flipping are 6MAP (4‑amino‑6‑methyl‑7(8H)‑pteridone) [...] and Pyrrolo‑C (3--6-methylpyrrolopyrimidin-2(3H)-one). [...] Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is also employed to provide a more detailed picture of the extent of base flipping as well as the conformational dynamics occurring during base flipping.|$|E
