40|$|Abstract [...] In this paper, full {{real-time}} digital {{simulation of}} a static modular multilevel converter (MMC) HVDC link interconnecting two AC networks is discussed. The converter has 60 cells per arm; each cell has two power switches with anti-parallel diodes and one capacitor. The simulated {{model can be}} used to study the natural rectifying mode, which is very important in the energizing process of the converter, whether a ramping voltage or a charging resistance is used. The model also incorporates a simple controller to show the system behavior in different operating conditions. The converter model and the controller are simulated on two independent real-time simulators and connected though their respective IO and physical signal cables to perform Hardware-in-the-Loop testing. All capacitor voltages are supplied to the controller using digital to analog converters. Firing signals from the controller are sent using digital signals with opto-couplers, as would be the case with a real setup. By doing so, a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is obtained. The main challenges of this setup are the very high number of IOs, which reaches over 730, considering both controller and converter, and the processing power required to simulate the 360 cells within a small time-step of 50 µs or less, as required for electromagnetic transient analysis. The simulation is achieved with a time-step of 20 µs using 10 INTEL 3. 2 -Ghz processor cores. Different faults are applied to determine their effects on the controller and the converter.

The development of fluorescent lamps is the major advancement in the field of small scale lighting. They have become very popular because of their efficiency and their ability to emit bright white light. Fluorescent lamps have less impact on human eyes compared to incandescent lamps. Recently, high intensity discharge lamps have been developed because of their ability to emit light at various colors. They have applications in overhead, computers and video projectors. The extensive use of arc discharge lamps in many lighting systems has led to the demand for dimmable electronic ballasts for energy saving and specific lighting needs. Today's electronic ballasts use various dimming control systems to achieve dimming to 5 % of full light. The most common dimming method is to shift the switching frequency of the inverter further away from the natural frequency of the output inverter tank. By doing this the energy transferred to the lamp is adjusted. This thesis presents a low-cost solution for modifying a non-dimmable self-oscillating electronic ballast into a dimmable one. A parallel resonant circuit is used instead of a series resonant circuit. The main idea of the technique used is to adjust the operating point of the <b>saturable</b> <b>transformer</b> in the self-oscillating circuit, such that the switching frequency is varied. The frequency modulation is achieved by introducing extra dc current to the nonlinear transformer which is fed back from the same resonant tank circuit. The amount of dc current fed back is controlled by adjusting the biasing condition of transistor operating in active region. The time for which the current is fed back is controlled by the multilevel switching technique...|$|E

40|$|There is {{ever-increasing}} {{demand in}} telecommunication system, data server and computer equipment for low voltage, high current power supply. LLC resonant converter {{is a good}} topology on primary side of the converter because it has soft switching and resonant conversion. However, the passive rectifier in the secondary side has high power dissipation. Synchronous rectifier is a popular method to reduce this rectification loss. Although there are many types of synchronous rectifier for PWM converter, {{most of them do}} not function well in LLC resonant converters. It is because the wave form of LLC resonant converter is different from PWM. The objective of this research is to reduce the power dissipation and physical size at the same time. In this thesis, a novel current driven synchronous rectifier with <b>saturable</b> current <b>transformer</b> and dynamic gate voltage control for LLC resonant Converter is presented. This novel circuit reduces the rectification loss and size of the current transformer in the synchronous rectifier. This synchronous rectifier has several outstanding characteristics compared with generic voltage driven and current driven synchronous rectifier. The saturable feature reduces the current transformer turns. Inherent dynamic gate voltage controlled by <b>saturable</b> current <b>transformer</b> reduces gate loss in the MOSFET. A novel driving circuit is proposed for accurate turn off time. It reduces loss significantly. This synchronous rectifier is completely self-contained which can replace the rectifier diode as a drop in replacement. It is insensitive to parasitic inductance. In order to explain the current <b>transformer</b> <b>saturable,</b> a model of <b>saturable</b> current <b>transformer</b> is proposed. A prototype demonstrates the advantages of the proposed current driven synchronous rectifier. Furthermore, a novel integrated synchronous rectifier is presented which provides a more compact system. The synchronous rectifier current transformer is integrated with the main transformer which reduces the number of circuit joints in power path. Each soldering joint generates significance loss in power converter. A pair of 0. 5 mΩ soldering joint in 25 A current path produces 0. 62 W loss. The placement of the integrated current transformer is important. A criterion for the placement of the current transformer within the main transformer is to avoid interference to the current transformer from the magnetic flux of the main transformer. Thus, a placement method to integrate the current transformer into the main transformer is proposed. An integrated current transformer model is suggested to explain the operation of the integrated synchronous rectifier.

40|$|Topside Variable Speed Drive (VSD) {{feeding a}} subsea load via a long cable {{is not a}} new {{technological}} challenge and many features in systems feeding asynchronous machines are well known. For a synchronous machine the situation is different as a net positive machine torque is not guaranteed. Therefor an analysis of the start sequence of such machine is of interest. In this work starting of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) powered by a VSD via a long subsea cable have been studied. Long transfer distance gives need for increased cable voltage, and thus transformers are introduced. A dynamic simulation model has been developed in SIMULINK? SimPowerSystems? consisting of voltage source, <b>saturable</b> <b>transformers,</b> cable, machine and mechanical load. To synchronize the machine the electrical frequency is lowered as suggested in literature with the result that the system impedances change compared to steady state and resistance become the dominant parameter. Source voltage amplitude must also be reduced accordingly to avoid iron core saturation. The consequence is that the large cable voltage drop result in insufficient start up torque produced by the machine when a stiction torque around 30 % is present. The mentioned dynamic simulation model has been used to compare system modifications proposed in literature to an unmodified base case with a cable length of 50 km. This have been done to investigate how stiction torque affects the start sequence and to draw conclusions about which method gives the most benefits for this type of machine. The main cases tested are increased voltage/frequency ratio, reduced cable resistance and machine damping. If the electromagnetic torque produced overcomes stiction torque the rotor is set into motion. Because of the rotor and load inertia and the high opposing friction torque rotor oscillations around zero speed is not avoided for any of the cases when stiction torque is applied. Oscillation motion is assumed to heat up the bearing oil such that the static torque is reduced and eventually synchronous operation is achieved after several seconds. It is shown in this work that what separates the cases where sufficient torque is produced is the time the machine uses to reach synchronism. All modifications shows improvement compared to the base case. Damping and voltage boost are the modifications with the most promising results for a broad range of stiction torques. This is expected as damping gives a net positive torque as in an induction machine, and that voltage boost directly increases the machine current. Higher voltage boost is better, but may easily lead to transformer saturation so this method must be used with great care. A rotor design with very high damping may result in a machine with lower air gap magnetic flux and conversely lower electromagnetic torque. The tradeoff between the modifications must be considered for each specific system. Oscillations are found to be present to the same degree independent of initial power angle. This means that as long as no dynamic control strategy is applied one does not {{have to take into account}} the initial angle of the rotor relative to the stator field. The assumption about reduction in static friction in the mechanical load should be tested in laboratory or existing installations. No cost- or sizing considerations are included in this work. In relation to offshore installations space requirements may often be an issue, but this has to be considered in each specific case. Resonance conditions must be treated with great care in such system and could be subject for further studies. Off special interest are multilevel inverters producing a very low harmonic output. A great challenge is to achieve general results and models that may be part of a tool box for system development in the future. The model developed here may be a part of such tools...|$|R
