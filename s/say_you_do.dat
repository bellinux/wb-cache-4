500|$|Tainton and {{the other}} white opponents of the {{concession}} contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of [...] "full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure" [...] the mining yield. William Mzisi, a Fengu from the Cape, who {{had been to the}} diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: [...] "You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not want any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?" [...] Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.|$|E
2500|$|Herzen was disliked by Russian {{radicals}} as too moderate. Radicals such as Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Nikolay Dobrolyubov {{wanted more}} commitment towards violent revolution from Herzen and {{the withdrawal of}} any hope in the reformist Tsar. Radicals asked Herzen to use The Bell as a mouthpiece for violent radical revolution, but Herzen rejected these requests. He argued that the Russian Radicals were not united and strong enough to seek successful political change, stating, [...] "You want happiness, I suppose? I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> Happiness has to be conquered. If you are strong, take it. If you are weak, hold your tongue". Herzen feared a new revolutionary government would merely replace the dictatorship with another dictatorship.|$|E

'Do you think they'll reprieve {{me in the}} night, brother? I've known reprieves come in the night, afore now. I've known 'em come as late as five, six, and seven o'clock in the morning. Don't you think there's a good chance yet,--don't you? <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> young man,' whined the miserable creature, with an imploring gesture towards Barnaby, 'or I shall go mad!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{was it you}} said, then? I <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> {{proposed}} to me,--to me a priest of God's altar,--a false counterfeit marriage, so that those two poor women, who you are afraid to face, might be cajoled and chaited and ruined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You know, you know. Oh, husband, my Lord, you do {{not believe}} it. <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe it. Send the {{whispering}} fiend away. He has hidden my sisters.' ...|$|E
