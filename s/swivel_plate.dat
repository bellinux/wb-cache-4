50|$|The bevel {{protractor}} {{is used to}} establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12° and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°. The {{bevel protractor}} consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a <b>swivel</b> <b>plate</b> (with Vernier scale) by thumb nut and clamp. When {{the edges of the}} beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the <b>swivel</b> <b>plate</b> coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the <b>swivel</b> <b>plate.</b> To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way. Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the course materials developed for biology teaching in Instructional Technologies and Material Design course by the pre-service biology teachers. The research group consist of 34 students who attending Instructional Technologies and Material Design course and studying at Department of Biology Education of Ziya Gökalp Education Faculty in Dicle University. The evaluation questionnaire which includes 17 items developed by İşman (2008) was used as data collection tool. Materials are organized as follows: Classical Educational Technologies 1 (black board, white board, magnetic board, <b>swivel</b> <b>plate,</b> etc.); Classical Educational Technologies 2 (graphics, modelsampling, posters, etc.).; Modern Educational Technologies (video-TV, overhead projector, data projector, smart board, etc.). The findings of the means as follows: Classical Education Technology 1 X = 3. 62; Classic Educational Technology 2 X = 3. 64, respectively Modern Education Technology X = 3. 81. As a result, pe-service biology teachers’ views about Modern Education Technology were more positive. Technology laboratories can be established for the students to prepare the materials. Also; the course time can be increase...|$|E
