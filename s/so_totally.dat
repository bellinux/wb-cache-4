500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was not universally affirmative, but Richard Corliss of Time stated that Spielberg [...] "has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density {{of images and}} emotions." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film [...] "a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable." [...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically {{a good idea for}} a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's <b>so</b> <b>totally</b> confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, if it wants to say something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film, so you've got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war. I don't know what Spielberg wanted to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, Wilson {{commenced}} recording {{sessions for}} the Beach Boys' forthcoming album Pet Sounds, which {{was largely a}} collaboration with lyricist Tony Asher. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with {{a substantial portion of}} a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. [...] According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but neither their brother Dennis nor Love were, while Asher recalls that Dennis, Love, and Al Jardine [...] "certainly" [...] expressed frustration with the new music and its lyrics. Love said: [...] "When it got to that period of Brian's life that's when he started doing a lot of drugs. We were touring a lot and we'd come back in and do an album like Pet Sounds, for instance, and some of the words were <b>so</b> <b>totally</b> offensive to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] One of his specific points of objection was the original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", then known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", a reference to the ego deaths associated with psychedelics. Brian also believed that the band was worried about him separating from the group, and that they [...] "resisted" [...] the increasing number of vocal roles he had given to himself. Love wrote that he [...] "would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with". Dennis denied that the band disagreed with Brian's direction on Pet Sounds, calling the rumors [...] "interesting," [...] that there was [...] "not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent," [...] and that he [...] "couldn't imagine who" [...] would have resisted Brian's leadership.|$|E

2500|$|Foucault is {{sometimes}} criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social constructionism, which some see as {{an affront to}} the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating [...] "He struck me as completely amoral, I’d never met anyone who was <b>so</b> <b>totally</b> amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him.

He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before."
