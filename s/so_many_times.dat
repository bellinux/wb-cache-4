5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been required to do <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, {{in which he was}} held for another five years.|$|E

Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other main-line railway companies, the LB had {{to share}} both its London termini with its rivals, London Bridge with the SER and Victoria with the LCDR. The rapid {{increase}} in commuting {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century created an urgent need to expand the cramped and limited facilities at Victoria. During the first decade of the new century the line between Grosvenor Bridge and Victoria was widened and the station rebuilt on a much larger scale. A new turntable and locomotive servicing facilities enabled the use of more powerful locomotives. During the same period LB facilities at London Bridge were enlarged, but since the station had been rebuilt <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> it remained a ‘’sprawling confusion'’.|$|E

Instead of explicitly representing every atom of the system, one uses [...] "pseudo-atoms" [...] to represent groups of atoms. MD simulations on very large systems may require such large computer resources that they cannot easily be studied by traditional all-atom methods. Similarly, simulations of processes on long timescales (beyond about 1 microsecond) are prohibitively expensive, because they require <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> steps. In these cases, one can sometimes tackle the problem by using reduced representations, which are also called coarse-grained models.|$|R

25|$|Essex and Worcestershire {{took notice}} of the bad weather forecasts, racking up runs swiftly at Chelmsford. The Essex batting effort was not very spectacular, and only Ronnie Irani's 85 saved some grace for Essex as wickets tumbled amid showers on the first day. They {{finished}} 220 all out as Worcestershire's bowlers teamed up, Matthew Mason the best with four for 48. In reply, Ben Smith made a century including fourteen fours, and with help of Gareth Batty (54) and Kabir Ali (53), both former England players, Worcestershire got to 383 all out - a lead of 163. Alastair Cook, Essex' 20-year-old prodigy, made a quick 46, but it was their 37-year-old Zimbabwean Andy Flower who, as <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> before, was the top scorer and the rock of the Essex innings with 85 - which led them to 329.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Pakistan, Lahore was made capital of the Punjab province in the new state of Pakistan. Almost immediately, large scale riots broke out among Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus, causing many deaths as well as damage to historic monuments—including the Lahore Fort, Badshahi mosque and colonial buildings. After independence and its deep impact, Lahore as <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> before, once again gained its significance as an economic and cultural powerhouse of the region, through government reforms. The second Islamic Summit Conference {{was held in the}} city in 1974. With United Nations assistance, the government was able to rebuild Lahore, and most scars of the communal violence of independence were erased. Less than 20 years later, however, Lahore once again became a battleground in the War of 1965. The battlefield and trenches can still be observed today close to the Wagah border area. In 1996, the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup final match was held at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.|$|E

From there, since mid September, Kapaun and the division were constantly on the move northward. On October 9, the division crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea and advanced within 50 miles of the Chinese border. His main complaint was lack of sleep for several weeks at a time.

25|$|On 11 July, at {{her first}} outdoor {{competition}} of the season, Rome's Golden Gala, Isinbayeva broke her own world record, clearing 5.03metres. This {{was her first}} world record outdoors since the 2005 World Championships. Isinbayeva stated that she had tried 5.02metres <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> unsuccessfully that her coach told her to change something and so she attempted 5.03metres. This record came just as people began to speculate her fall {{from the top of}} pole vaulting, as American Jennifer Stuczynski cleared 4.92metres at the American Olympic Trials. Isinbayeva stated that this motivated her to maintain her reputation as the world's greatest female pole vaulter. A few weeks later, at the Aviva London Grand Prix, Isinbayeva and Stuczynski competed {{together for the first time}} of the outdoor season. Isinbayeva won the competition, with Stuczynski finishing second. Both attempted a new world record of 5.04metres. Isinbayeva was tantalizingly close on her final attempt, with the bar falling only after Isinbayeva had landed on the mat.|$|E

Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
25|$|The {{daylight}} {{bombing of}} Schaffhausen on 1 April 1944 by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) {{was the most}} serious of all incidents. Approximately 50 B-24 Liberators of a larger force misidentified Schaffhausen as their target Ludwigshafen am Rhein near Mannheim (about 235km north of Schaffhausen), and dropped sixty tons of bombs on the town. Although an air raid alarm sounded in Schaffhausen, air raid sirens had been set off <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> without any attack that the locals felt safe, and many failed to take cover. A total of 40 {{people were killed and}} about 270 injured, and large parts of the town were destroyed. At the insistence of the Swiss government for an explanation, Allied investigations into the incident found that bad weather broke up the American formation over France, and that high winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the bombers confused the navigators. (Two other widely scattered cities in Germany and France were also mistakenly bombed during the same mission.) As Schaffhausen is situated on the right bank (north side) of the Rhine river, it was apparently assumed to be the German city. By October 1944, 4 million dollars had been paid in restitution.|$|E
25|$|The early French {{withdrawal}} has {{led some}} to speculate that Kapisa will become a security vacuum just outside Kabul. This would be no small matter: the “ring of steel” that surrounds Afghanistan’s capital has been broken <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that few {{have faith in the}} capital’s safety anymore. Several of those early attacks, before the influx of French troops, were planned and supported out of the Tagab Valley. The French presence there had reduced the ability of militants in Kapisa to launch attacks into Kabul. When the French leave, the U.S. would not have the troops to fill in the gap, leaving a big opportunity for militants north of Kabul to strike back.Most of the province population believe that the long-term presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan can only serve to perpetuate the war cycle and the departure of the French will weaken the Taliban stance. Over 60 French soldiers have been killed in Kapisa since 2008, with hundreds more injured severely. With the help of Afghan National Army, French forces conducted operations to repel the insurgents and Afghan forces were able to gain a foothold in Kapisa valleys. They oversaw the formation of the 3rd Brigade of the 201st Afghan corps that is now deployed in Kapisa and of the Afghan police who now are solely responsible for providing the province’s security.|$|E
