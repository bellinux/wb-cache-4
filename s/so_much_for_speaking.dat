6000|$|But, {{strange to}} say, {{although}} he affected to believe so firmly {{in his own}} style of art and hold Ida's in such cheap regard, {{it was a little}} painting of the latter's that he valued most, and which was oftenest put upon his easel for purposes of solitary admiration. It was one of those very impressionist productions that faded away in the distance, and full of soft grey tints, such as his soul loathed. There was a tree with a blot of brown colour on it, and altogether (though {{as a matter of fact}} a clever thing enough) from his point of view of art it was utterly [...] "anathema." [...] This little picture in oils faintly shadowed out himself sitting at his easel, working in the soft grey of the autumn evening, and Ida had painted it and given it to him, and that was why he admired it <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> <b>For</b> to <b>speak</b> the truth, our friend the Colonel was going, going fast--sinking out of sight of his former self into the depths of the love that possessed his soul.|$|R
60|$|We {{went into}} all the schools of the college, and made {{ourselves}} fully aware {{that the amount of}} learning imparted was far above our comprehension. It always occurs to me, in looking through the new schools of the present day, that I ought to be thankful to persons who know <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> condescending to <b>speak</b> to me at all in plain English. I said a word to the gentleman who was with me about horses, seeing a lot of lads going to their riding lesson. But he was down upon me, and crushed me instantly beneath the weight of my own ignorance. He walked me up to the image of a horse, which he took to pieces, bit by bit, taking off skin, muscle, flesh, nerves, and bones, till the animal was a heap of atoms, and assured me that the anatomy of the horse throughout was one of the necessary studies of the place. We afterward went to see the riding. The horses themselves were poor enough. This was accounted for by the fact that such of them as had been found fit for military service had been taken {{for the use of the}} army.|$|R

We ought to allow <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> conveyance, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> hotel bills, and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> losses, and then calculate on the losses {{just as much as}} we do on the payment of the railroad fares and hotel bills.

But come, Eva," [...] he said; and taking the hand of his daughter, he stepped across the boat, and {{carelessly}} putting {{the tip of his}} finger under Tom's chin, said, good-humoredly, [...] "Look-up, Tom, and see how you like your new master." ...|$|R
