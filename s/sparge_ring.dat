40|$|During-vitrification {{operations}} in the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP), some feed components will be vented from the melter to the melter offgas cleaning equipment. The current HWVP reference process for melter off. -gas treatment includes a submerged bed scrubber (SBS) to provide {{the first stage of}} off-gas scrubbing and quenching. During most melter/off-gas test runs at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) with the Pilot Scale Ceramic Melter (PSCM) and at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP), no significant quantities of sedimentation were accumulated in the SBS scrub tank. However, during test run SF- 12, conducted at West Valley, approximately 6 in. of sedimentation accumulated in the scrub tank. This raised concerns that a similar accumulation could occur with the HWVP SBS, If such an accumulation rate occurred during a sustained melter run, the SBS would soon cease to function. To alleviate the potential for sedimentation buildup, the HWVP SBS design includes a <b>sparge</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the bottom of the}} scrub tank. The <b>sparge</b> <b>ring</b> will be operated intermittently to prevent buildup of solids which could interfere with circulation with the SBS Scrub tank. This report presents the results of testing conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the HWVP <b>sparge</b> <b>ring</b> design. Section 2 contains-the conclusions and recommendations; Section 3 summarizes the objectives; Section 4 describes the equipment and materials used; Section 5 gives the experimental approach; and Section 6 discusses the results.

40|$|Since late 1997, the {{floating}} crust layer in Hanford Tank 241 -SY- 101 (SY- 101) has grown about two meters by gas accumulation. To reverse crust growth and reduce its retained gas volume, the waste in SY- 101 will be diluted by transferring at least 300, 000 gal of waste {{out of the}} tank {{and replacing it with}} water. In the fall of 1999, approximately 100, 000 gal of this waste will be transferred into Tank SY- 102; within a few days of that initial transfer, approximately 100, 000 gal of water will be added to SY- 101. This initial back-dilution is being planned to ensure that the base of {{the floating}} crust layer will be lifted away from the mixer pump inlet with minimal effect on the crust itself. The concern is that the added water will pool under the crust, so the resulting fluid mixture will be too light to lift the crust away from the mixer pump and dissolution at the crust base could cause unwanted gas release. To ensure sufficient mixing to prevent such stratification, water will be added near the tank bottom either through an existing <b>sparge</b> <b>ring</b> on the base of the mixer pump or through the dilution line at the inlet of the transfer pump. A number of simulations using the TEMPEST code showed that the mixing of the water and waste by this method is rapid, and the water does not pool under the crust. Although a density gradient is present, its magnitude is small compared with the difference between the slurry and water density. The result is essentially the same whether water is introduced {{at the base of the}} mixer pump or at the transfer pump. There is little effect of water flowrate up to the 500 gpm studied. In all cases, the minimum density remained above that required to float the crust and well above the density of saturated liquid. This indicates that the base of the crust will rise during back-dilution and there will be little or no dissolution of the crust base because the water will be close to saturation from the dissolution of solids in the mixed slurry...|$|E

40|$|In this research, a {{bioreactor}} experimental rig was designed, {{constructed and}} finally commissioned {{in order to}} measure the kLa and kap of oxygen in Newtonian fluid. Distilled water was used as a sample of Newtonian fluid. The design of the rig was based on the standard geometry of a stirred tank reactor. Standard geometrical ratios of a stirred tank reactor with two Rushton disc turbine (RDT) impellers was used to design a system that can provide good mixing for a gas-liquid system. Two sets of RDT impellers were used to disperse the gas <b>sparged</b> by a <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> into the liquid content in the tank. The construction of this rig was done {{with the help of the}} Assistant Training Vocational Officer in the engineering workshop. The tank was built using transparent Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) while the two impellers and four equally spaced baffles were constructed using stainless steel. The effect of two variables, namely impeller speed and air flow rate on the volumetric transfer coefficient of oxygen from gas to the bulk liquid, kLa and on the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen from bulk liquid to the oxygen electrode, kap were studied. From the result, the increase in impeller speed and air flow rate will both increase the value of kLa and kap. The values of kLa and kap were predicted by fitting the mass transfer equation of oxygen to the experimental data by using sum of squared error minimization of the difference between the actual and predicted data using MATLAB programming...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the interactions between gas bubbles and the liquid phases in bubble column reactors (BCR), which enhance the heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions, will greatly assist {{in the design and}} optimization of the reactor. Despite of wide researches on industrial BCRs, there are still many design aspects of the reactor and sparger (e. g., sparger types, position and velocity, as well as orifice size of the sparger) that require further investigation. A proper selection of BCR and spargers for different industries would greatly improve BCR efficiency and productivity. In addition, an accurate prediction of BCR hydrodynamics with less computational efforts is a major concern in the design and optimization process. In this study, the effect of <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> diameters, superficial gas velocities and number of sparger holes on the flow pattern and gas dynamics in BCR have been investigated. The two-phase Eulerian-Eulerian method embedded in the Commercial Computational Fluid Dynamic software, ANSYS CFX, V 14 has been adopted to study the macroscopic hydrodynamics inside a cylindrical BCR. Relevant literature on experimental and numerical results and empirical correlations has been used for validation. Changing the <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> diameter and the superficial velocity has a significant effect on the results in comparison to that of the case of the different number of sparger holes. The influence of microscopic parameters such as orifice size, inlet gas velocity, distance between orifices and number of orifices on a single bubble formation, rising, as well as bubble coalescence process are studied using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method which is embedded in ANSYS FLUENT, V 14. In addition, an experimental work has been carried out to validate some of the CFD cases investigated and also to study the effect of inlet flowrate and orifice size on bubble detachment from an orifice. iv An {{increase in the number of}} orifices (more than two) resulted in faster bubble detachment from the orifices. This also lead to the production of large bubbles with non-uniform shapes. By determining the specific distance between orifices resulted in bubble formation without coalescence and a uniform size and shape of bubbles. For the first time, the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model has been developed to predict the microscopic and macroscopic parameters of BCR hydrodynamics. Some of the CFD results from the previous chapters have been used for the development, training, testing and validation of the ANFIS model. The developed ANFIS model is used to predict the liquid flow pattern and gas dynamics for different <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> diameters and BCR heights. ANFIS model is also developed for the prediction of the bubble formation from an orifice and to investigate the bubble rise characteristics. Some limitations are found in ANFIS model and this is discussed. As a conclusion, ANFIS method can be employed to predict microscopic and macroscopic results for various operational conditions of BCRs. Unlike the CFD implementation process, ANFIS model has the capability to predict the required results fast and requires less computational effort in providing a non-discrete (continuous) result...|$|R
40|$|The {{bioreactor}} configuration {{including a}} dual-impeller combination, spacing between the impellers, and {{the diameter of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> is optimized based on solid suspension (N-jsg) and gas dispersion (N-f and k(L) a) in this work. Then, the solid suspension and gas dispersion performance in this optimized bioreactor are systematically studied. It is found that a smaller sparger (D-s/T = 0. 32) achieves better performance in gas dispersion. A pitched-blade disc turbine down-pumping (PDTD) as a bottom impeller achieves the lowest N-jsg value, and has lower N-f value compared with PBTD (pitched blade turbine down-pumping) and TBHA (three-bladed helical agitator). Techmix 335 hydrofoil impeller down-pumping (TXD) as an upper impeller provides higher k(L) a values. TXD+PDTD are more suitable for the requirements of a bioreactor. k(L) a decreases slightly with increasing solid loading, which is beneficial to good gas dispersion in such bioleaching reactors with higher solid loadings (> 20 wt%) ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this study is the {{mathematical}} modelling of bubble size distributions in an aerated stirred tank using the population balance method. The air-water system consisted of a fully baffled vessel with a diameter of 0. 29 m, which was equipped with a six-bladed Rushton turbine. The secondary phase was introduced through a <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> situated under the impeller. Calculations were performed with the CFD software CFX 14. 5. The turbulent quantities were predicted using the standard k-Îµ turbulence model. Coalescence and breakup of bubbles were modelled using the MUSIG method with 24 bubble size groups. For the bubble size distribution modelling, the breakup model by Luo and Svendsen (1996) typically has been used in the past. However, this breakup model was thoroughly reviewed and its practical applicability was questioned. Therefore, three different breakup models by MartÃ­nez-BazÃ¡n et al. (1999 a, b), Lehr et al. (2002) and Alopaeus et al. (2002) were implemented in the CFD solver and applied to the system.

40|$|Stirred bubble column {{are widely}} used in {{chemical}} and allied processes industries. Stirred bubble column reactor promotes significant liquid hold-up and long liquid residence time. It is used when a large mass transfer area and high mass transfer coefficient in both phases are desired. These columns can operate continuously with a concurrent and counter current phase flow where high interfacial areas between phases are possible with low investment cost. An experimental work was undertaken to focus the effect of various parameters like Height to Diameter ratio (H/D), Gas flow rate and Speed of the stirrer (N) on mass transfer coefficient in stirred bubble column reactor. For this purpose, experiments were conducted in 0. 14 m i. d column having 2 m height. The column with <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> having 67 % active area is used as sparger for dispersing the dispersed phase into the continuous phase.

30|$|This {{part of the}} {{experiment}} was performed in a 5 L fermentor (GBCN- 5 C, Zhenjiang East Biotech Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd, China) with a working volume of 3 L. The fermentor was equipped with a temperature probe, pH sensor and dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor. The height and diameter of the 5 L fermentor were 0.35 and 0.2 Â m, respectively. The agitation system was a coupling of stirrer that consisted of two propellers on one axle and each propeller had four flat-blades. The agitation rate was controlled by electromagnetic impulse. The aeration system was an air inlet through a <b>ring</b> <b>sparger</b> with air-flow meter and filter. The fermentor and all its parts containing 3 litre medium was sterilized at 121 Â Â°C for 30 Â min. After sterilization, the fermentation medium was inoculated with 5 % (v/v) seed medium. Diluted antifoaming agent was added when foam appeared in the fermentor during the fermentation process. The temperature and aeration rate were maintain at 28 Â Â°C and 3 Â L/min during the whole fermentation process, respectively. The agitation speed was controlled {{in the range of}} 150 â€“ 300 Â rpm to maintain the DO concentrations over 20 % saturation, which made sure that oxygen supply was enough for cell growth. Samples were acquired from fermentor at every 24 Â h interval for analysis of GP- 1 production and dry cell weight (DCW).|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{experimental}} oxygen {{mass transfer}} coefficient, {{a measure of}} how quickly oxygen travels from a gas bubble to the bulk liquid, is important for comparing performance and for evaluating the oxygen transfer capability of a fermentor. Delays in probe response and changing gas volumes upon start-up of gassing affect the accuracy of oxygen transfer measurements. To mitigate these inaccuracies, a standard correction procedure for oxygen mass transfer data was established for highly oxygenated, well-mixed fermentation systems. Probe response time correction was generated by applying a second-order response model to dissolved oxygen probes and shown to be effective within 4 %. By using a derived model for transient volume rise, the effect of changing gas volume at start-up was shown to cause very minimal error (1 - 2 %) in kLa. The unsteady-state method of kLa determination was used to compare design aspects of a hypothetical fermentor, including gas sparging devices and locations, baffle geometries and quantities, and impeller configurations. It was shown that locating the sparging device {{in the center of the}} tank, directly below the drive shaft and bottom impeller, is optimal for oxygen mass transfer. Sparger type was shown to have little effect on oxygen mass transfer values, although an open-pipe sparger was shown to provide slightly more oxygen mass transfer than a <b>ring</b> <b>sparger.</b> The use of rounded baffles in place of traditional rectangular baffles resulted in a 67 - 80 % decrease in oxygen mass transfer coefficient. A comparison of three and four traditional baffles showed that three baffles produced a higher oxygen mass transfer than four. Correlation of baffle ratio and oxygen mass transfer coefficient indicated that the optimum baffle ratio is approximately one. Radial impellers were observed to provide better mixing, and thus higher oxygen mass transfer coefficients than axial impellers. In seven of ten comparisons, an impeller quantity ratio of 1. 33 instead of 1. 00 provided significant improvement in kLa. Additionally, only two of ten comparisons showed a difference between traditional Rushton turbine impellers and Smith turbine impellers, indicating that the difference in oxygen mass transfer capability of the two is negligible...|$|R
