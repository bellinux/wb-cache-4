When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the fire alarm. Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when suddenly he is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to <b>Singa.</b> Soon afterward, a spaceship appears. Kyle throws a stone and the spaceship fires back, propelling Kenny into the road. As he gets back up, he is trampled over by a herd of cows, but survives. A police car then runs Kenny over and kills him.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{became a}} writer for the {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and <b>Singa</b> Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E

5|$|On 11 June 1975 several {{military}} officers {{were arrested in}} {{what became known as}} the coup monté et manqué. Amongst those arrested were Générals Daniel KATSUVA wa Katsuvira, Land Forces Chief of Staff, UTSHUDI Wembolenga, Commandant of the 2nd Military Region at Kalemie; FALLU Sumbu, Military Attaché of Zaïre in Washington, Colonel MUDIAYI wa Mudiayi, the military attaché of Zaïre in Paris, the military attache in Brussels, a paracommando battalion commander, and several others. The regime alleged these officers and others (including Mobutu's civil secrétaire particulier) had plotted the assassination of Mobutu, high treason, and disclosure of military secrets, among other offences. The alleged coup was investigated by a revolutionary commission headed by Boyenge Mosambay <b>Singa,</b> at that time head of the Gendarmerie. Writing in 1988, Michael Schatzberg said the full details of the coup had yet to emerge.|$|E

25|$|The Friend of <b>Singa</b> Award was {{the brain}} child of Vincent Lam, {{a member of}} the Singapore Courtesy Council in 1991 as a means to {{recognise}} courteous conduct by students, and to function symbiotically with the school's efforts to teach courteous behaviour within students as well. It was established with the hope that other students would see winners of the Friend of <b>Singa</b> Award as role models, and follow the example set by them as well. The award, opened to any school in Singapore, involved the nomination of a student from each school by recounting the respective student's act of kindness and courtesy. Among all the nominations, a student would then be chosen for the Most Courteous Student Award and 10 other students for Merit Awards.|$|E

25|$|Represented by a Smiley logo as the {{campaign}} kick started, the National Courtesy Campaign had <b>Singa</b> the Courtesy Lion replace the Smiley logo in 1982.

25|$|While Singaporean {{literary}} works {{may be considered}} as also belonging to the literature of their specific languages, the literature of Singapore {{is viewed as a}} distinct body of literature portraying various aspects of Singapore society and forms {{a significant part of the}} culture of Singapore. Literature in all four official languages has been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal <b>Singa,</b> that was published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including Edwin Thumboo and Koh Buck Song, as well as in multilingual anthologies such as Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each into the three languages. A number of Singaporean writers such as Tan Swie Hian and Kuo Pao Kun have contributed work in more than one language. However, such cross-linguistic fertilisation is becoming increasingly rare and it is now increasingly thought that Singapore has four sub-literatures instead of one.|$|E
500|$|The {{island nation}} of Singapore derives {{its name from}} the Malay words [...] (lion) and [...] (city/fortress), which in turn is from the Tamil-Sanskrit சிங்க <b>singa</b> [...] and [...] புர , which is cognate to the Greek , pólis. According to the Malay Annals, this name was given by a fourteenth-century Sumatran Malay prince Sang Nila Utama, who, on {{alighting}} the island after a thunderstorm, spotted an auspicious beast on shore that appeared to be a lion.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, Thumboo wrote mostly lyrical poetry {{based on}} {{personal}} experiences. Displaying {{the influence of the}} English literary tradition on him, they dealt with aesthetic and metaphysical themes. By the mid-1970s, he had shifted his focus to the public sphere, believing that poets of post-independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature. Singapore's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry Gods Can Die (1977), and {{it has been said that}} the subsequent anthologies Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993) [...] "established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore". Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes, notably 9 August – II (1977), and Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) which was published in the anthology of the same name, as well as his role in promoting Singapore literature, for example, through his work as General Editor of the literary journal <b>Singa.</b> Ulysses, which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the Merlion that faces Marina Bay, was inspired by the use of Irish mythology and history by W. B. Yeats. The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo, as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland's nationalistic struggle and Singapore's breakaway from colonialism. He describes himself as a myth-inspired poet, and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society. Ulysses has prompted other Singaporean poets such as Alfian Sa'at, Vernon Chan, David Leo, Felix Cheong, Gwee Li Sui, Koh Buck Song, Lee Tzu Pheng, Alvin Pang and Daren Shiau to write their own Merlion-themed verses; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a [...] "Merlion poem". A copy of Ulysses is installed on a plaque near the statue.|$|E
2500|$|If closed, the pustaha takes {{form of a}} beast {{standing}} on its four hooves. The top panel is surmounted with a carved representation of the serpent-like animal {{with the head of}} a <b>singa.</b> At the bottom panel is four legs or hooves. Achim Sibeth commented that the animal is the representation of the Naga Padoha, a primordial water serpent that rules the underworld. A Batak creation myth told that {{back in the days when}} there was only sea, the serpent stirred up sand from the ocean bed to create the first islands which create the islands of Indonesia. Other expert thinks that the figure represents the <b>singa.</b> The word <b>singa,</b> borrowed from Sanskrit <b>singa</b> meaning [...] "lion", dates back to contact with Hindu traders in the southern Batak area. In Batak culture however, the <b>singa</b> itself is a complicated mythical creature related to the female serpent. An example of the representation of a <b>singa</b> can be found in a wooden animal head that was collected by Tassilo Adam, a German planter who is also an enthusiast in Batak Toba culture.|$|E

2500|$|By the 15th century, {{many of the}} Bantu-speakers, {{including}} both Hutu and Tutsi, had organized themselves into small states. [...] According to Ogot, these included at least three. The oldest state, which has no name, was probably established by the Renge lineages of the <b>Singa</b> clan and covered most of modern Rwanda, besides the northern region. [...] The Mubari state of the Zigaba (Abazigaba) clan also covered an extensive area. The Gisaka state in southeast Rwanda was powerful, maintaining its independence until the mid-19th century. [...] However, the latter two states are largely unmentioned in contemporary discussion of Rwandan civilization.|$|E
2500|$|The name Singapura {{is derived}} from Sanskrit meaning [...] "Lion City". <b>Singa</b> comes from the Sanskrit word siṃha, which means [...] "lion", and pūra means [...] "city" [...] in Sanskrit. According to the Malay Annals, Sri Tri Buana and his men were {{exploring}} Tanjong Bemban while in Bintan when he spotted an island with white sandy beach from a high point. On learning that the island was called Temasek, they set sail for the island, but encountered a severe storm on the way. After they managed to land safely on the island, they went to hunt for wild animals. [...] He suddenly saw a strange animal with an red body, black head and a white neck breast. It was a fine-looking animal and moved with great speed as it disappeared into the jungle. He asked his chief minister, Demang Lebar Daun, what animal it was, {{and was told that}} it probably was a lion. He then decided to stay in Temasek, named the city he founded Singapura or [...] "Lion City".|$|E
2500|$|The Jazz Singer was parodied {{as early}} as 1936, in the Warner Bros. cartoon I Love to <b>Singa,</b> {{directed}} by Tex Avery. Its hero is [...] "Owl Jolson", a young owl who croons popular ditties, such as the title song, against the wishes of his father, a classical music teacher. Among the many references to The Jazz Singer in popular culture, perhaps the most notable {{is that of the}} classic MGM musical Singin' in the Rain (1952). The story, set in 1927, revolves around efforts to change a silent film production, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talking picture in response to The Jazz Singers success. The plot of the Simpsons episode [...] "Like Father, Like Clown" [...] (1991) parallels the tale of Jakie Rabinowitz/Jack Robin. Krusty the Clown's rabbi father disapproves of his son's choice to be a comedian, telling him, [...] "You have brought shame on our family! Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive." [...] The Jazz Singers story continues to be evoked in pictures such as Warner Bros.' animated Happy Feet (2006).|$|E
2500|$|Benny {{also was}} caricatured in several Warner Brothers {{cartoons}} including Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur (1939, as Casper the Caveman), I Love to <b>Singa,</b> Slap Happy Pappy, and Goofy Groceries (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny), Malibu Beach Party (1940, as himself), and The Mouse that Jack Built (1959). The last {{of these is}} probably the most memorable: Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blanc—the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister—reprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a phat-phat-bang! away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then shakes his head, smiles wryly, and mutters, [...] "Imagine, me and Mary as little mice." [...] Then, he glances toward the cat lying on a throw rug in a corner and sees his and Livingstone's cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat's mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.|$|E
