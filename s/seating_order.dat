5000|$|In medieval social order, {{the symbols}} and rituals of rank were {{associated}} with real power and income. One of these rituals was the order of precedence in the seating at ceremonial occasions. Whoever sat closer to the king or other high-ranking person, had greater rights than other people at the ceremony. As a result, when it was unclear where the delineation was in terms of responsibilities and areas of jurisdiction, so-called [...] "armchair disputes" [...] often arose over the <b>seating</b> <b>order.</b> These rarely resulted in an agreement, because [...] "conceding or giving in would have decided the dispute in favour of {{one or the other}} and ... so was out of the question," [...] according to historian Gerd Althoff. None of these disputes ended in such a confrontation, however, as that of the Goslar Precedence Dispute between Abbot Widerad of Fulda and Bishop Hezilo of Hildesheim which resulted in several deaths and a subsequent rebellion by monks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the current study is to {{determine}} the effects of physical and environmental conditions of schools, and the features of the class and teacher in the application process of Science and Technology curriculum of schools from different socioeconomic status (SES). The participants of the study composed of 2 schools with high SES, 2 with middle SES, and 2 with low SES, which were chosen via stratified sampling from Sakarya province central district elementary education schools that have low to middle, and high SES, and the directors and Science and Technology course instructors of that chosen schools. Qualitative data was acquired via the observations that were done in schools and classes, and from the interviews that were done with school directors and teachers. Acquired data was analyzed and following items were found: (1) In schools with high SES, having convenient opportunities provides advantages for the application of the science and technology curriculum. However, sometimes, courses are taught teacher centered because of crowded classes and time problems. (2) In schools with middle SES, science course is taught teacher centered because of the lack of laboratory, material insufficiency, and <b>seating</b> <b>order</b> in classes. (3) In schools with low SES, science course is taught teacher centered because of infrastructure insufficiency, high-class size, being not able to use laboratory, and material insufficiency...|$|E
40|$|Sculling {{performance}} is largely {{determined by the}} magnitude and timing of blade force application, i. e. {{the size and shape}} of the sculler’s force profile. Discovering specific force profile characteristics that relate strongly with boat velocity in elite scullers, and determining how best to measure them, would allow recommendations for improved performances. The objective of this thesis was to expand knowledge regarding biomechanical measurement of sculling force profiles and to understand how the PowerLine™ boat instrumentation system could be used effectively to measure and improve elite on-water sculling performance. A literature review showed that effective rowing force profiles are large, smooth, rectangular, and have a peak force in front of the perpendicular oar position. Laboratory validity testing showed that PowerLine™ was valid for use with elite scullers, displaying a standard error of the estimate of less than 0. 90 kgF for force and less than 0. 5 ° for angle measures. On-water reliability testing established smallest worthwhile effect sizes for PowerLine™ variables for elite scullers completing 500 -m trials, including 0. 44 % for stroke power and 0. 5 ° for angular variables. Scullers in double sculls were more variable than single scullers so consistency in stroke power was recommended as a focus for crew scullers. Sculler analyses using PowerLine™ was better when using the average of five strokes rather than single strokes. Step wise linear regression analyses presented models for two elite scullers explaining 84 % and 85 % of their variation in boat velocity. However, the relationships between sculling performance and biomechanical stroke variables, including different measures of catch technique, were not consistent between elite scullers and cannot be generalised. Analyses of changes in means for four elite scullers showed that biomechanical stroke variables did differ significantly between single, double and quad sculls and therefore training and selection should be boat class specific. In elite double sculls, correlations between change in performance and change in bow versus stroke peak force synchronization indicated that it is likely to be beneficial to performance if the stroke peaks with their force earlier and with the handles further to the stern than the bow seat. Switching the <b>seating</b> <b>order</b> in these double sculls resulted in mean boat velocity changing by up to 5. 8 % of world record time signifying the importance of seat-specific trialling. Extensive differences between elite scullers in the strength and direction of relationships between performance and PowerLine™ variables showed that full analyses of all variables must be conducted individually for each sculler. The importance of <b>seating</b> <b>order</b> in double sculls, and the benefits of the stroke seat peaking before the bow, have implications for crew selection, seat allocation, and technical recommendations. Seat trials for crew sculling boats must be seat-specific and include racing in all seating orders. Further research is necessary to verify and explain the synchronisation requirements of crew sculling boats before more scientific seat allocation can be achieved in these boats. Sculling force profiles from PowerLine™ can be used effectively to measure and improve elite on-water sculling performance...|$|E
40|$|Imparting of knowledge, its {{verification}} {{and assessment}} represent {{the most important}} teacher’s tasks. The examination results are equally important for the student and for the teacher. On {{the basis of the}} results the teacher assesses if the teaching aims were achieved, if the knowledge was imparted correctly and plans their further work. The student assesses their learning progress. Nowadays there are several various ways for teachers to assess students’ knowledge; from classic oral and written assessment to the latest forms of computer based assessment of knowledge. With the use of the appropriate software the latter can save a considerable period of teacher`s time. The diploma paper presents how Microsoft Excel, one of the major programs of Microsoft Office, can be used by teachers. It describes how to compose crosswords, quizzes and linking exercises. It also provides how student’s initial, present and final knowledge can be assessed. The exercises can be composed {{in a way that the}} student gets the feedback about the correctness of the answer as soon as it has been chosen. The main purpose of the diploma paper was to program the didactic application ADEA (Assessment Didactic Excel Application) in programing language Visual Basic for Application (VBA) which works in Excel. The application helps teachers in composing questions for oral and writing examination, correcting and assessing the exams, copying out the results and also in making a random <b>seating</b> <b>order.</b> In the end the didactic characteristics of the application were evaluated by teachers with various computer skills. Teachers with the lack of computer skills would probably need more time while adopting the application ADEA since they firstly have to master the basics of Microsoft Office Excel.
