25|$|In late October 1967, Scorpion started {{refresher}} training and weapons system acceptance tests, {{and was given}} a new commanding officer, Francis Slattery. Following type training out of Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment. She operated with the 6th Fleet into May and then headed west for home. Scorpion suffered several mechanical malfunctions, including a chronic problem with Freon leakage from refrigeration systems. An electrical fire occurred in an escape trunk when a water leak shorted out a <b>shore</b> <b>power</b> connection. (However, major steam and leakage problems are not uncommon on U.S. Navy or Royal Navy submarine deployments, even in the 21st Century.) There {{is no evidence that}} the Scorpions speed was restricted in May 1968, although it was conservatively observing a depth limitation of 500 feet, due to the incomplete implementation of planned post-Thresher safety checks and modifications.|$|E
500|$|When not driving, {{truck drivers}} need to idle their engines to {{maintain}} climate control within the truck cab (interior), {{as well as}} provide electricity for appliances. Engine idling is inefficient and only adds to the problem of air pollution. This unnecessary idling can be remedied with <b>shore</b> <b>power</b> (which is a term and idea borrowed from the shipping industry), or Truck Stop Electrification. When ships are docked in a port, they connect to a land-based power supply to provide electricity and eliminate the need to idle their engines. The idea of <b>shore</b> <b>power</b> was transferred to the trucking industry, and now there are companies such as IdleAire and Shorepower which provide electricity to diesel trucks, which eliminates the need for the driver to idle the engine. IdleAire also provides access to the Internet, cable television, and land line phone services. IdleAire promises to eliminate one-eighth of nitrogen oxide pollution through [...] "electrified parking", however, particulate pollution may increase in those areas where the electricity is provided by coal burning power plants. Some drivers are also experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, which provide clean and silent power for appliances when trucks are not running.|$|E

2500|$|This model, {{produced}} from 1988 to 1990, {{is laid out}} for racing and {{was designed to be}} competitive under the then current IMS handicapping rule. [...] The 37R hull is built with fibre-reinforced plastic using DuPont hybrid material that combines Kevlar with fiberglass. This combined with C's usual balsa core results in a very high strength or stiffness to weight ratio. Unidirectional glass is used for additional local stiffening. Its interior, rather than being based upon moulded pans and liners of the cruiser/racer 37/40+, is organized around a series of plywood longitudinals and bulkheads. These plywood members are rigidly glassed to the hull and contribute considerably to the strength and stiffness of the hull. The massive aluminum chainplates are bolted to sturdy plywood webs which form the back of the settees. The aft cabin was usually not enclosed on the standard 37R but an enclosed aft cabin was an option, as were other cruising amenities found standard on the 37+, such as hot and cold pressure water and 110 volt <b>shore</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Hinckley {{introduced}} the JetStick, Dual Guard composite material, {{and the use}} of fiberglass. The first experiments with fiberglas began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959. Despite much criticism such as the comparison of fiberglass to “frozen snot,” Hinckley used the material in boatbuilding [...] Hinckley created Dual Guard technology in 1999, a composite composed of an aramid and carbon fiber, aimed at creating a stronger and more efficient hull. [...] In 2016, the company launched a remote monitoring system called OnWatch. OnWatch uses a series of sensors to track numerous data points on a boat and relay them via a cellular system to servers that update a mobile Web site (it feels like an app when you add the OnWatch icon to your smartphone homescreen). Once you log in, it gives you a homescreen with an at-a-glance understanding of how your boat is doing, from technical details such as engine status, bilge, battery, and fuel-tank levels, to the state of your <b>shore</b> <b>power</b> connectivity.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 October 1961, Thresher, {{in company}} with the {{diesel-electric}} submarine , headed south on a 3-week test and training cruise to San Juan, Puerto Rico, arriving 2 November. Following customary procedure while in port, her reactor was shut down. Since no <b>shore</b> <b>power</b> connection was available in San Juan, the ship's backup diesel generator was used to carry the [...] "hotel" [...] electrical loads. Several hours later, the backup generator broke down and the electrical load {{was transferred to the}} ship's battery; however, most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, so lighting and air-conditioning were shut down. Without air-conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching [...] after about ten hours. (Four men received Navy Commendation Medals for their work that night, attempting to repair the diesel generator under the extreme conditions of heat and humidity.) Eventually, it became apparent that repair of the generator would not be complete before the battery was depleted, so restart of the reactor was attempted, but by that time, there was not enough charge remaining in the battery, and it ran down before restart of the reactor could be accomplished. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. Since Cavalla was moored alongside, cables, borrowed from another ship in the harbor, were connected between Thresher and Cavalla, which started her diesels, providing power that enabled Thresher to restart her reactor.|$|E

The design of the coated test samples was related to constructive aspects of the tower (weld seams, screw couplings, coating transitions, overlaying coating edges, a. s. o.). As laboratory standard tests like ISO 20340 which is a special test evaluated for off shore applications, furthermore ISO 15711 and ASTM G 8 for cathodic disbonding.

The economic viability of different transmission options are measured based on component costs and {{the costs associated with}} the transmission losses. A case study has been presented in the paper, which demonstrates the application of this techno-economic analysis framework on a range of MEC farm sizes and distances from the shore.
