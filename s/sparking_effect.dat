40|$|A Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) {{study has}} been {{conducted}} into droplets evaporating and burning {{under the influence of}} a spark. Specifically, underlying physical causes behind configurations globally extinguishing or failing to ignite have been investigated. It has been found that the global mixture fraction mean and standard deviation need to be sufficiently large (i. e. sufficient fuel must have evaporated to be available for mixing) in order for a flame to be sustained, with the standard deviation a more universal measure of success. In addition, a predictor to extinction has been identified: successful flames have a substantially large region containing hot products with low scalar dissipation rate. This stable region forms a kernel that is able to supply sufficient heat to promote flame propagation without depleting too quickly. In contrast, flows that fail to ignite never form a region containing hot products, while flows that are about to globally extinguish do not have a region with low scalar dissipation within the hot products. This predictor was also observed in the equivalent partially-premixed gaseous configuration. These indicators were found to be independent of droplet size, droplet number density and turbulent intensity and observed both while the spark was active and after the <b>spark</b> <b>effect</b> had completely dissipated. Further work will aim to quantify the scale of this effect to obtain a reliable measure of when the predictor of no low scalar dissipation amongst hot products is encountered. ...|$|R

40|$|Constant {{pressure}} outwardly propagating flame {{experiments in}} a spherical bomb are performed {{to examine the}} duration and radius over which <b>spark</b> ignition <b>effects</b> persist. This is motivated {{by the need to}} properly account for such effects in the measurement of laminar burning velocity and Markstein length using the spark ignited expanding flame technique. Ignition energy was varied and its effects on flame propagation in methane-air and isooctane-air mixtures were studied. The Markstein length of the mixture proved critical in the ignition energy dependency of flame propagation. For relatively high values, an underlying common variation of self-sustaining flame speed with radius can be identified by the rapid convergence of curves for different ignition energies. As the Markstein length decreases, low energy spark ignition is found to give rise to a distorted and wrinkled flame kernel. For such mixtures, due to the weak effect of stretch, the kernel subsequently develops into a non-spherically propagating flame. In these cases the <b>spark</b> ignition <b>effect</b> persists up to large radius. It is shown that using low ignition energy leads to a flame speed, during the development phase, which is higher than that of a self-sustaining spherical flame. It is further shown that if this effect is not accounted for, measurements of Markstein length using standard fitting techniques results in a large error. This problem is found to worsen as the Markstein length decreases, such that its apparent measured value becomes increasingly influenced by any distortions of the flame kernel produced by the spark...|$|R

40|$|Although gene-environment {{interactions}} {{are known to}} significantly influence psychopathology related disease states, only few animal models cover both the genetic background and environmental manipulations. Therefore, we {{have taken advantage of}} the bidirectionally inbred high (HAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior mouse lines to generate HAB x LAB F 1 hybrids that intrinsically carry both lines' genetic characteristics, and subsequently raised them in three different environments standard, enriched (EE) and chronic mild stress (CMS). Assessing genetic correlates of trait anxiety, we focused on two genes already known {{to play a role in}} HAB vs. LAB mice, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor type 1 (Crhr 1) and high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3 (Hmgn 3). While EE F 1 mice showed decreased anxiety related and increased explorative behaviors compared to controls, CMS <b>sparked</b> <b>effects</b> in the opposite direction. However, environmental treatments affected the expression of the two genes in distinct ways. Thus, while expression ratios of Hmgn 3 between the HAB- and LAB-specific alleles remained equal, total expression resembled the one observed in HAB vs. LAB mice, i. e., decreased after EE and increased after CMS treatment. On the other hand, while total expression of Crhr 1 remained unchanged between the groups, the relative expression of HAB- and LAB-specific alleles showed a clear effect following the environmental modifications. Thus, the environmentally driven bidirectional shift of trait anxiety in this F 1 model strongly correlated with Hmgn 3 expression, irrespective of allele-specific expression patterns that retained the proportions of basic differential HAB vs. LAB expression, making this gene a match for environment-induced modifications. An involvement of Crhr 1 in the bidirectional behavioral shift could, however, rather be due to different effects of the HAB- and LAB specific alleles described here. Both candidate genes therefore deserve attention in the complex regulation of anxiety-related phenotypes including environment-mediated effects...|$|R

Combustion variability of IMEP(COV) increase sharply with retarding of CA 50 with external EGR. The external EGR can greatly improve knock limitation and knock intensity(KI).
