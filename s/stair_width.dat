40|$|Abstract The aims of {{this study}} are to verify the effecting factors in {{evacuation}} behavior under the corridor and <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> variation in evacuation experiments at university education facilities. To achieve these purposes, the present conditions of university education facilities were analyzed, and the evacuation experiment settings were established under different width of corridor and stairs. After the experiments, we asked the effecting variables to the evacuation behaviors under the variation of corridor, <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> and density of evacuee. The results {{of this study}} are as follows; First, we found 3 main factors which affecting the evacuation behaviors; environmental factors on building conditions, psychological factors on evacuee's characteristics and personal factors on evacuee's physical conditions. Second, the environmental factors such as the location of stairs for evacuation, recognition of wayfinding in fire condition are mainly affects the evacuation behaviors, but evacue...|$|E
30|$|The {{traditional}} {{method to}} evacuate such type of buildings {{is the use}} of stairs. The design of stairs may be based on different concepts. <b>Stair</b> <b>width</b> may be designed in order to provide an adequate capacity in the whole building in relation to the largest occupant load floor (Peacock et al. 2012 a) or to accommodate the simultaneous evacuation of a given number of floors, e.g. 2 – 3 floors, given the case of a phased strategy. Different factors have been investigated, such as the design of the stairs in general, e.g., number of the stairs, <b>stair</b> <b>width,</b> staircase length, location in the building, etc. (Pauls 2005; Pauls et al. 2007) or their specific features, e.g., the slope of the stairs (Graat et al. 1999), the values for capacity on stairs (Pauls and Jones 1980; Pauls 1988), the impact of occupancy levels on stairs (Blair and Milke 2011), etc. These studies provide different methods to design stairs taking into account evacuation considerations.|$|E
40|$|Traditional lane models {{such as the}} 560 mm (22 -in.) unit of exit width are {{examined}} as historical artifacts and, when studied empirically, as flawed bases for minimum <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> determination. Criticisms of this lane model were presented separately by the authors as early as about 1970 and improved bases for minimum width determination were also presented. Currently, even the improved bases for minimum stair width—based on the authors ’ early work—need to be updated for stair user demographics and other factors that have changed in recent decades. Three types of crowd flow are considered; coherent flow, overtaking movement, and counterflow. All of these occurred in the evacuations of the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001. Partly {{as a result of}} the latter incident, counterflow has recently received particular attention in some US standards and building code-change deliberations that led to a minor increase—from 1120 mm to 1422 mm (44 in. to 56 in.) in minimum, nominal exit <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> requirements for certai...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Commuters {{leaving a}} station often choose the stair as a quicker exit than the escalator. This paper models {{the effects of}} speed leaving the station and <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> on choice of the stairs or escalator. METHODS: Aggregated data from {{previous}} studies (n= 82, 347) revealed a plateau at about 45 % stair use as the number leaving each train rose. Subsequently, the time taken by passengers on the stairs and escalator was measured in a station in Birmingham, UK in 2007 (n= 5848). The resulting transport rates (passengers s(- 1)) for stairs and escalators at the average commuting traffic were used to estimate the effects of increases in <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> on choice of the stairs. RESULTS: Average transport rates were higher for the escalator (0. 93 +/- 0. 33 passengers s(- 1)) than the stairs (0. 58 +/- 0. 24 passengers s(- 1)). Modelling {{of the effects of}} transport rate with multiple regression suggested 40. 1 % of passengers would use the stairs, a figure close to the observed rate. Using similar calculations, a doubling of width of the stairs could result maximally in a 17. 2 % increase in stair use. CONCLUSIONS: Changes to the width of stairs could produce a permanent increase in lifestyle physical activity immune to the effects of time on healthy intentions...|$|E
30|$|The {{research}} on high-rise buildings became {{a growing concern}} to safety committees working on codes {{towards the end of}} the 1960 s (Galbreath 1969; General Services Administration, 1971; Melinek and Booth 1975). The design of exit stairs was the main issue analysed at the time, providing formulas for exit <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> and for estimates of minimum total evacuation times. Significant work in this area was performed in the 1970 s and 1980 s (Pauls 1978; Pauls 1988). The focus of these studies was the application of the hydraulic movement models taking into consideration the behavioural factors. This permitted the inclusion of the pre-evacuation activities of the occupants in the analysis of the actual evacuation times of tall buildings.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{simulation}} software Simulex was adopted {{to study the}} emergency evacuation process of the island type subway elevated station and determine the “bottleneck” positions. The effects of the “bottleneck” positions on the personnel evacuation crowded degree of the subway station were studied by changing the evacuation conditions at “bottleneck” positions. Results show that staircases connecting platform and ticket hall, are identified as the “bottleneck” positions during evacuation, where crowd congestion appears easily. Moreover, {{the effects of the}} stair effective width on evacuation were evaluated by the combination of the total evacuation time and the stairway level of service, to obtain more objective evaluation. Effect of varying the <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> was studied by taking eight different values. Results show that with the decrease of the stairs effective evacuation width, the crowded degree in the stairway during the subway emergency evacuation process can be effectively relieved...|$|E

40|$|The {{time that}} it takes an {{occupant}} population to reach safety when descending a stair during building evacuations is typically estimated by measureable engineering variables such as stair geometry, speed, stair density, and pre-observation delay. In turn, engineering models of building evacuation use these variables to predict the performance of egress systems for building design, emergency planning, or event reconstruction. As part of a program to better understand occupant movement and behavior during building emergencies, the Engineering Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been collecting stair movement data during fire drill evacuations of office and residential buildings. These data collections are intended to provide {{a better understanding of}} this principal building egress feature and develop a technical foundation for future codes and standards requirements. NIST has collected fire drill evacuation data in 14 buildings (11 office buildings and 3 residential buildings) ranging from six to 62 stories in height that have included a range of <b>stair</b> <b>widths</b> and occupant densities. A total of more than 22000 individual measurements are included in the data set. This report provides details of the data collected, an analysis of the data, and examples of the use of the data. The intention is to better understand movement during stair evacuations and provide data to test the predictive capability of building egress models. While mean movement speeds in the current study of 0. 44 m/s ± 0. 19 m/s are observed to be quite similar to the range of values in previous studies, mean local movement speeds as occupants traverse down the stairs are seen to vary widely within a given stair, ranging from 0. 10 m/s ± 0. 008 m/s to 1. 7 m/s ± 0. 13 m/s. These data provide confirmation of the adequacy of existing literature values typically used for occupant movement speeds and provide updated data for use in egress modeling or other engineering calculations...|$|R

40|$|Long {{evacuation}} time during an emergency for offices in supertall commercial buildings {{is a deep}} concern and was discussed in this article. Different codes and regulations for safe egress were reviewed. A building of fixed floor area but heights varying up to 500 m was taken as an example. The required total {{evacuation time}}s for selected offices in this building were estimated by four different empirical expressions. The height, population density, and <b>stair</b> <b>width</b> of the supertall building were varied during the calculation. The estimated evacuation times were justified {{with reference to the}} local codes on means of escape. Even with a lower population density of 4. 5 persons per square meter, which is only half of the allowed value specified in the Hong Kong code, the estimated minimum total evacuation time was 26. 9 min. The evacuation time for a supertall commercial building with high occupant loading is very long. Evacuation by elevator is recommended to be an alternative. Safe evacuation strategy for supertall buildings should therefore be watched carefully. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
