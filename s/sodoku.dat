50|$|<b>Sodoku</b> (鼠毒) is a {{bacterial}} zoonotic disease. It {{is caused by}} the Gram-negative rod Spirillum minus (also known as Spirillium minor). It is a form of rat-bite fever (RBF).|$|E
50|$|He then rejoined Georges Blanc at Institut Pasteur of Casablanca, {{where he}} did {{research}} on the transmission of typhus, <b>sodoku,</b> spirochaete, recurrent fevers. In 1935, he received the Desportes Prize from the French Academy of Medicine.|$|E
50|$|The {{infections are}} {{acquired}} through rat bites or scratches. It can occur as nosocomial infections (i.e., acquired from hospitals), or due to exposure or close associations with animals preying on rats, mice, squirrels, etc. <b>Sodoku</b> is mostly seen in Asia. The incubation period is 4 to 28 days.|$|E
50|$|Rat-bite fever {{transmitted}} by the Gram-negative coiled rod Spirillum minus (also known as Spirillum minor) is more rare, and is found {{most often in}} Asia. In Japan, the disease is called <b>sodoku.</b> Symptoms do not manifest for two to four weeks after exposure to the organism, and the wound through which it entered exhibits slow healing and marked inflammation. The fever lasts longer and is recurring, for months in some cases. Rectal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms are less severe or are absent. Penicillin {{is the most common}} treatment.|$|E

For Advanced Chemistry, Electrochemistry, Thermochemistry, and Organic Chemistry are offered by the school in accordance to the Collegiate Curricula of Chemical Sciences. The competitive Mathematical Sciences of the school brings it forth in the International Mathematical Olympiad garnering awards as High Distinction, Distinction and et cetera, representing the Philippines in International <b>Sodoku</b> Competition and producing four of the most extensive studies in Combinatorics and Functional Analysis in 2008 (Antonio Eriberto Cabug), 2009 (Ralph Joyce Cabug), 2014 (Aira Alyssa Que) and 2015 (David John Delima). Calculus and Linear Algebra are the courses offered by the school in the Mathematical field in the senior year.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} analyze Sudoku puzzles by computers. Generally speaking, {{it is not so}} difficult to solve Sudoku puzzles by computers, and many programs to solve Sudoku puzzles are avaiable. However, most of the programs use recursion and backtracking, which is significantly different from methods used by a human. Hence, a human-like method to solve a Sudoku puzzle is unknown even if the solution of the puzzle is computed by compute programs. We created a computer program which solves <b>Sodoku</b> program with human-like methods. The program employs three basic techniques and solve almost all Sudoku puzzle in published books andmagazines...|$|E
