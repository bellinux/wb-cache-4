But in retirement, he continued to <b>speak</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> issues such as the war in Iraq, death penalty and gay rights. Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican who ran for governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter-faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats. Smith was featured in an ad that ran in newspapers across North Carolina and was featured in an Associated Press article. On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States.|$|E

25|$|While Zakharov did <b>speak</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> {{several key}} issues, she {{remained}} {{bound by the}} principles of party discipline. In 1988, she was critical of the proposals that became the Higher Education Contribution Scheme {{while they were in}} caucus, although she promptly dropped the matter when the majority supported the changes. This again occurred with planned price increases to various Medicare services in 1992, when Zakharov used her position as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to cut committee hearings short, to the chagrin of the opposition parties. She did, however, manage to win some small concessions through the committee's final report, and somewhat embarrassed Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe in the process.|$|E
25|$|Mikuláš Dzurinda {{has been}} a regular MP in the National Council of the Slovak Republic since his party's defeat in the 2006 {{parliamentary}} elections. In February 2008, Juraj Liška, SDKÚ-DS's deputy leader, openly asked Dzurinda to resign as the party leader due to the low party polls and the arguably undemocratic style of leadership. The members of the party praesidium denied Mr. Liška's accusations and since the praesidium assembly, Mr. Liška has been unwilling to <b>speak</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the inner affairs of the party. This affair led to the open protests against Mr. Dzurinda from party members from Bratislava. Since their exclusion from the party by a regular party judge there are no longer any thrills in the party.|$|E
25|$|As {{an attempt}} to tackle such issues, the UK {{launched}} a national campaign called Be Real, after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves. The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead. Despite the negative outcomes of technological advancements altering the perceptions of an individual’s body image and mental health, the cultivation of social media is still beneficial. Parallel to traditional media, it may be employed {{as a tool to}} share and spread body positivity. Social networking sites and applications ultimately build a platform for users to <b>speak</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> issues, with many industry insiders utilising their online leverage to protest for change. Previous techniques brands and influencers have tested include, the promotion of a positive body image through popular hashtags and marketing campaigns, and the formation of groups that support self-love and the banning of body shaming.|$|E

500|$|Gravel {{returned}} to business ventures {{and went through}} difficult times, suffering corporate and personal bankruptcies amid poor health. He has been a quixotic advocate of direct democracy and the National Initiative. In 2006, Gravel began {{a run for the}} Democratic nomination for President of the United States to promote those ideas. His campaign gained an Internet following and national attention due to forceful, humorous, and politically unorthodox debate appearances during 2007, but he found very little support in national polls or in 2008 caucuses and primaries. In March 2008, he announced that he was switching to the Libertarian Party to compete for its presidential nomination and the inclusion of the National Initiative into the Libertarian Platform. At the Libertarian National Convention of 2008 he failed on both counts, and he announced that his political electoral career had ended. [...] He subsequently became an executive for a marijuana products company and continued to <b>speak</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> various political issues including Democratic Party politics.|$|E
500|$|Amid the Panic of 1837, many {{began to}} criticize social institutions. That year, Ripley gave a sermon titled [...] "The Temptations of the Times", {{suggesting}} that the major problem in the country was [...] "the inordinate pursuit, the extravagant worship of wealth". Ripley had been asked by church proprietors to avoid controversial topics in his sermons. He said, [...] "Unless a minister is expected to <b>speak</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> all subjects which are uppermost in his mind, with no fear of incurring the charge of heresy or compromising the interests of his congregation, he can never do justice to himself, to his people, or the truth which he is bound to declare". In May 1840, he offered his resignation from the Purchase Street Church but was convinced to stay. He soon decided he should leave the ministry altogether and, on October 3, 1840, he read a 7,300-word lecture, Letter Addressed to the Congregational Church in Purchase Street, expressing his dissatisfaction with Unitarianism.|$|E
500|$|Constantine {{began his}} role as High Commissioner in [...] June 1961. In the New Year's Honours list for 1962, he was knighted and became Sir Learie Constantine; among other accolades he {{received}} at this time was {{the freedom of the}} town of Nelson. Mason notes that Constantine had now [...] "passed firmly into the consciousness as a British treasure". However, his tenure as High Commissioner ended in controversy. Constantine felt that his high-profile required him to <b>speak</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> racial issues affecting all West Indian immigrants, not just Trinidadians. In April 1963, when a Bristol bus company was refusing to employ black staff, Constantine visited the city and spoke to the press about the issue. His intervention assisted in a speedy resolution of the affair which, according to Mason, was crucial in persuading the British government of the need for a Race Relations Act. However, politicians in both Trinidad and Britain felt a senior diplomat should not be so closely involved in British domestic affairs, particularly as he acted without consulting his government. Williams effectively withdrew his support from Constantine, who decided not to continue as High Commissioner when his term expired in February 1964.|$|E
