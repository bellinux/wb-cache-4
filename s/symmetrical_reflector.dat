40|$|Report {{presents}} {{study of}} some sources of error in analysis, by geometric theory of diffraction (GTD), of performance of high-gain, dual-shaped antenna reflector. Study probes into underlying analytic causes of singularity, with view toward devising and testing practical methods to avoid {{problems caused by}} singularity. Hybrid physical optics (PO) approach used to study near-field spillover or noise-temperature characteristics of high-gain relector antenna efficiently and accurately. Report illustrates this approach and underlying principles by presenting numerical results, for both offset and <b>symmetrical</b> <b>reflector</b> systems, computed by GTD, PO, and PO/GO methods...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 123 - 125) An {{analysis of}} polarization and pattern effects is presented for parabolic and spherical reflectors which are either symmetrically or offset fed by "point source " antennas such as electric and magnetic dipoles, rectangular waveguides, and dual mode circular waveguides. A computer program is presented which yields the vector far field patterns {{of a number}} of feed and reflector combinations based on the numerical integration of induced surface currents. For symmetrical reflectors it is shown that "Huygen's source" feeds can be used to eliminate cross-polarized reflector radiation and that the small circular waveguide feed is almost ideal from this viewpoint. It is also shown that the introduction of controlled amounts of TM 11 mode into a circular waveguide feed results in cross polarization reduction {{for a wide range of}} <b>symmetrical</b> <b>reflector</b> parameters. The scanning and polarization properties of offset spheres and parabolas are compared...|$|E
40|$|The method {{involves}} using a {{collimated light}} beam with a circular cross-section, which is transferred into a convergent light beam with an annular cross-section. The light beam is directed onto the cylindrical component mantle surface at an acute angle to its longitudinal axis, for uniform illumination of a cylindrical {{section of the}} component surface. The radially dispersed light received from the illuminated area of the mantle surface of the component is detected and evaluated. the beam may {{be divided into two}} partial beams, each of which illuminates a half-cylinder surface of the cylindrical section. The light beam from a collimated source (1) may be converted into a convergent beam directed by a semi-reflective mirror (6) onto the mantle surface of the component. The dispersed light from the cylindrical component may be reflected by a rotationally <b>symmetrical</b> <b>reflector</b> (10) and fed through the semi-reflective mirror onto a detector, e. g. a camera (13). USE - For testing shaft, pist on rod, axle, etc. ADVANTAGE - Robust testing method providing rapid testing rate...|$|E
30|$|Since {{the simple}} formula which {{accurately}} predicts the squint angle in circularly polarized offset reflectors was proposed by ADATIA and RUDGE [7], the beam squint phenomenon and its compensation method have attracted many authors’ interests. A squint compensation method by properly tilting the feed {{to make the}} interpreted angle between the incident beam and the radiated beam zero is a natural choice for <b>symmetrical</b> <b>reflectors</b> with off-focus feeds [8]. A squint free approach for <b>symmetrical</b> dual <b>reflector</b> antennas is also proposed by properly choosing geometrical parameters [9]. Furthermore, XU and RAHMAT-SAMII [2] summarized the beam squint compensation methods, and proposed a compensation technology by optimally displacing circularly polarized feeds in the perpendicular plane to obtain high beam pointing accuracy. However, these methods in Refs. [2, 7 – 9] are presented from the simple electromagnetic disciplinary, and they are just practical for undistorted reflectors in the nominal state for preliminary design. In actual engineering, space reflectors including cable mesh antennas are easily susceptible to surface distortion under thermal load and other impacts, which enlarge the beam squint angle and seriously affect the beam pointing accuracy. Simply displacing and tilting the antenna feed cannot thoroughly compensate the distorted electromagnetic performance in actual engineering. Another consideration {{should be taken into}} account is that feed remains on focus with a satisfactory reflector surface is preferred due to the limited size in satellites. How to produce a cable mesh reflector with high beam pointing accuracy in electromagnetic performance is an urgent problem for space applications.|$|R
40|$|Antenna systems {{capable of}} {{operating}} with a multichannel microwave radiometer intended for mapping severe storm activity over patches {{on the surface}} of the earth 750 km square were compared. These systems included a paraboloidal reflector with an offset focal point feed, and a <b>symmetrical</b> Cassegrain <b>reflector</b> system. Both systems are acceptable from the point of view of beam efficiency, however, from the point of view of maintaining the required positional accuracies and surface tolerances, as well as from the point of view of manufacturability, cost effectiveness, and technical risk, the symmetrical Casegrain was selected as the preferred configuration. Performance characteristics were calculated and a mechanical design study was conducted to provide estimates of the technical risk, costs, and development time required for the construction of such an antenna system...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{reflector}} antennas {{are typically}} designed {{for up to}} + or - 20 beamwidths scan. An {{attempt was made to}} stretch this scan range to some + or - 300 beamwidths. Six single and dual reflector antennas were compared. It is found that a <b>symmetrical</b> parabolic <b>reflector</b> with f/D = 2 and a single circular waveguide feed has the minimum scan loss (only 0. 6 dB at Theta sub 0 = 8 deg, or a 114 beamwidths scan). The scan is achieved by tilting the parabolic reflector by an angle equal to the half-scan angle. The f/D may be shortened if a cluster 7 to 19 elements instead of one element is used for the feed. The cluster excitation is adjusted for each new beam scan direction to compensate for the imperfect field distribution over the reflector aperture. The antenna can be folded into a Cassegrain configuration except that, due to spillover and blockage considerations, the amount of folding achievable is small...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} <b>symmetrical,</b> parabolic, Cassegrain <b>reflector</b> {{system is}} very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the hyperbolic sub-reflector and its supporting struts (usually 3-4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when {{the size of the}} parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector.To avoid blockage from the sub-reflector asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe levels, beam squint, poor cross-polar response, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{first of}} a {{two-phase}} program was performed to develop the technology necessary to evaluate, design, manufacture, package, transport and deploy the hoop/column deployable antenna reflector {{by means of a}} ground based program. The hoop/column concept consists of a cable stiffened large diameter hoop and central column structure that supports and contours a radio frequency reflective mesh surface. Mission scenarios for communications, radiometer and radio astronomy, were studied. The data to establish technology drivers that resulted in a specification of a point design was provided. The point design is a multiple beam quadaperture offset antenna system wich provides four separate offset areas of illumination on a 100 meter diameter <b>symmetrical</b> parent <b>reflector.</b> The periphery of the reflector is a hoop having 48 segments that articulate into a small stowed volume around a center extendable column. The hoop and column are structurally connected by graphite and quartz cables. The prominence of cables in the design resulted in the development of advanced cable technology. Design verification models were built of the hoop, column, and surface stowage subassemblies. Model designs were generated for a half scale sector of the surface and a 1 / 6 scale of the complete deployable reflector...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{perform in}} vitro and in vivo tests using a {{clinical}} lithotripter {{in order to}} determine whether a bifocal reflector is more efficient and produces the same or less tissue damage than a conventional ellipsoidal reflector for electrohydraulic lithotripters. Materials and Methods: A standard ellipsoidal and a novel bifocal reflector were tested on a Tripter Compact lithotripter (Direx Medical Systems, Petach Tikva, Israel). The bifocal reflector was constructed by joining two sectors of two rotationally <b>symmetrical</b> ellipsoidal <b>reflectors</b> having different distances between their foci. The F 1 foci of the sectors coincided, creating a separation between the F 2 foci. The fragmentation efficiency of the reflectors was compared using kidney-stone models. Shockwave-induced trauma was evaluated in vivo by treating both kidneys of six healthy dogs. One kidney was exposed to shockwaves generated with the conventional reflector, and the other kidney was treated using the bifocal reflector. Pressure measurements were obtained for both reflectors using needle hydrophones. Results: The new design appeared to be more efficient than the conventional reflector in breaking up kidney-stone models. Tissue damage did not increase when using the bifocal reflector. Conclusion: The use of bifocal, instead of standard ellipsoidal, reflectors should be considered as an alternative to improve extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy...|$|R
40|$|Rhetorical Sensitivity {{describes}} the attitude toward encoding related to need satisfaction. Nonsensitive persons, termed Noble Selves or Rhetorical Reflectors, {{are believed to}} concentrate on satisfying their own needs, or those of others, while Rhetorically Sensitive persons search for means of mutual need satisfaction. This research attempted to determine if this attitudinal difference was behaviorally manifested. ^ Subjects were administered RHETSEN II, a scale measuring their attitude toward encoding, and assigned to five or six-person groups. Groups set and met goals over a five week period, during which their meetings were tape recorded. Because relational control is both a significant interpersonal need, and {{is reflected in the}} sensitivity concept, the system for coding behavior categorized messages into one of three control vectors: up, a message to gain relational control; across, a message to neutralize control; or down, a message to yield control. Data were matrixed by speaker and vector, and analyzed using a Minimum Information Discrimination Statistic. ^ Six groups were studied. In four, individuals who differed in rhetorical sensitivity differed in their behavior. In the others, conflict over control of relationships occurred and differences in behavior were not observed. In three of the four groups in which differences in behavior were observed, they were consistent with differences in rhetorical sensitivity among group members. ^ Noble Selves, sensitive persons, and Rhetorical Reflectors differed from each other in three major ways. First, Rhetorical Reflectors were more willing to place control of relationships in the hands of others. Second, Noble Selves engaged in more <b>symmetrical</b> behavior, while <b>Reflectors</b> established more complementary relationships. Third, sensitive persons and Rhetorical Reflectors are more adaptive to differing circumstances than Noble Selves. ^ The primary limitation on these conclusions is imposed by questions about {{the reliability and validity of}} RHETSEN II. Future research must resolve these questions. ...|$|R
