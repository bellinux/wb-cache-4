40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to detect the}} main shifts in land-use {{architecture}} and assess the factors behind the changes in typical tropical semi-arid land in Burkina Faso. Three sets of time-series LANDSAT data over a 23 -year period were used to detect land use changes and their underpinning drivers in multifunctional but vulnerable ecologies. Group discussions in selected villages were organized for mapping output interpretation and collection of essential drivers of change as perceived by local populations. Results revealed profound changes and transitions during the study period. During the last decade, shrub and wood savannahs exhibited high net changes (39 % and − 37 % respectively) with a weak net positive change for cropland (only 2 %,) while cropland and <b>shrub</b> <b>savannah</b> exhibited high swap (8 % and 16 %). This suggests that the area of cropland remained almost unchanged but was subject to relocation, wood savannah decreased drastically, and <b>shrub</b> <b>savannah</b> increased exponentially.

40|$|In the {{highlands}} of northern Ethiopia, degraded hillslopes are closed for grazing and agriculture for environmental rehabilitation. In {{order to assess}} {{the effect of these}} exclosures on water balances, a correct assessment of evapotranspiration is needed. A common method for calculating evapotranspiration employs the reference evapotranspiration in combination with a crop coefficient. However, for natural vegetation, these crop coefficients are not readily available. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} derive crop coefficients for semiarid natural vegetation using two different approaches. The crop coefficients were assessed with the dual crop coefficient approach as outlined in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper n 56 and compared with crop coefficients derived from a simple soil water balance. A good agreement between both methods was found. The mid-season crop coefficients ranged from 0. 50 to 0. 85 for open vegetation with small shrubs and from 0. 85 to 0. 95 for well developed shrubland. Vegetation with a closed tree canopy was characterized by a mid-season crop coefficient between 0. 95 and 1. 1. Additionally, a significant logarithmic relation between vegetative soil cover and crop coefficient was found.

40|$|Abstract: Biosphere Reserves {{are areas}} of in situ {{conservation}} of biodiversity. They are subdivided into a central area, buffer zones and peripheral areas. People settled into villages around {{the periphery of the}} Biosphere Reserve of Niokolo Koba. The socio-economic activities of those rural populations are largely dominated by agriculture and pastoralism. Business of forest products {{and to a lesser extent}} tourism, are also observed. Other forms of activities such as beekeeping, fishing and hunting are practiced. A stratified random sampling technique was used to collect data on diversity and actual trends in population dynamic of woody plant species under the pressure of human activities. The number of woody plant species decreased from far away vegetation’s layers to those next to human settlements. The <b>shrub</b> <b>savannah</b> is the most represented vegetation unit but patches of degraded forest galleries were also identified. The woody plant species of the biosphere reserve could be grouped into four categories with respect to their economic importance.

40|$|In {{the buffer}} {{zone of the}} Lamto Reserve, a {{protected}} area located in the forest-savannah transitional zone in central Ivory Coast, the exotic shrub Chromolaena odorata has invaded abandoned fields and degraded forests. As a result, they have turned into thickets that are used by local farmers as natural fallows to enhance soil fertility for food production. However, information about their impact on soil is scanty and investigations focusing exclusively on baseline data on C odorata fallows in humid savannahs are still lacking. This {{study was designed to}} assess changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properties after the establishment of C. odorata fallows in humid savannahs of Ivory Coast. Sampling sites were selected such that a portion of C odorata fallow was located next to the <b>shrub</b> <b>savannah,</b> the most common natural ecosystem in the area. Results revealed a rise of soil organic carbon (+ 27. 9 %), total nitrogen (+ 36. 7 %), total phosphorus (+ 56. 8 %), extractable calcium (+ 68. 3) and magnesium (+ 1403 %) in the first 10 cm of soil beneath the C odorata fallow relative to the savannah. Furthermore, the fallow was associated with high N-mineral pool as N-NO 3 - and N-NH 4 + content increased at + 72. 5 % and + 71. 5 %, respectively. The infiltration capacity of water under C odorata-based fallow was markedly high and soil macroinvertebrates, mainly earthworms, showed significant increases in density and biomass. The large quantity of good quality standing biomass produced by C odorata is likely the main factor controlling the improvement of soil quality. The results suggest that there are merits for the integration of C odorata fallow in a cropping system for sustainable food production in the buffer zone of Lamto Reserve. This can also help to reduce pressure on forest islands...|$|E

The specific epithet, ‘magnaclavata’, {{was selected by}} the authors {{to draw attention to}} the distinctive clavate processes of the pollen. A revised taxonomic description is supported by illustrations of fossil specimens from outcrop and well sections that show the range in morphology not previously recorded in the original description; the key difference is the wide variation in process morphology from clavae to clavae with interspersed echinae. Based on the new observations of the pollen morphology we conclude that the records from Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments in North and West Africa are invalid. G. magnaclavata is clearly restricted to northern South America from the Miocene to Pleistocene. The parent plant of G. magnaclavata probably grew in upper coastal plain or around swamps, commonly associated with <b>shrubs</b> and herbaceous <b>savannah</b> plants. The botanical affinity of G. magnaclavata has always been in question. Based on a review of pollen from several palm genera presently extant in northern South America we consider that the nearest living relatives, if indeed G. magnaclavata is an ancient palm, are the genera Mauritia and Mauritiella. The basis for this conclusion is the distinctive foot layer morphology of the processes in the fossil and the modern examples...|$|R

40|$|The Namibian meat {{industry}} {{relies on}} the export of weaners to the South African feedlot industry while the largest part of the cattle population in the communal areas of Namibia remain underutilised. Producing a marketable cattle carcass for slaughter, which contributes the most to the Namibian economy, remains a challenge that needs {{a high level of}} understanding of all management variables under control by the rangeland manager. The nutritional requirements of cattle are one the important areas for maximising the return from the land and ensuring long term sustainability of the farming enterprise. A commercial farming enterprise, with the same climate and sandy soils that were predominantly found in the communal farming areas of Namibia, was chosen as experimental site. Three groupings of cattle were exposed to different experimental techniques and treatments over a 15 month trial period. The first grouping of cattle was 6 oesophageal fistulated cattle used, to collect veld samples selected by the cattle, every 3 weeks to estimate the contribution of the tree and <b>shrub</b> <b>savannah</b> towards the diet of the cattle. The second grouping was 110 cattle allocated to different nutrient supplementation treatments for slaughter at 28 months of age. Five different nutrient supplementation treatments were chosen for 5 groups of 22 cattle, consisting of steers and heifers, {{for the duration of the}} period on an ad libitum basis. The 5 treatments were applied to illustrate the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns as the increasing feeding cost progressively deteriorated the amount of profit that would be expected. The optimal supplementation strategy would thus be identified according to the financial resources available to a farmer. Some of the treatments were also planned to progressively result in negative associative effects on forage intake, as energy containing raw materials in such treatments would replace the intake of natural available forage. The need for replacing forage was a common practice in droughts when the availability of forage was limiting or when the finishing of cattle during a short period before slaughter was planned. The cattle needed to be foraging less to conserve energy and thus increase protein accretion and fat deposition. The control of the experiment was the rock salt treatment group (RST) which only received a rock salt lick throughout the dry and wet seasons of the year. This was generally used for the supplementation of wildlife and cattle on rangeland in Namibia and it placed nearly no strain on the finances of a farmer. The remaining four treatments received commercially manufactured lick products with a diverse set of applications that were not strictly used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. During the wet season it was a well-established practice to only supplement with phosphorus and trace mineral containing licks due to the forage having maximum nutritional value during this time in which no additional benefit would be derived from the supplementation of protein and energy containing licks. All treatments, except for the rock salt treatment group (RST), were thus placed on a phosphorus and trace mineral lick during the wet season as part of the nutrient supplementation treatment programs. Different licks were made available to the cattle in the treatment groups, during the dry season, from which the treatment groups derived their names. One group was placed on a phosphorus and trace mineral lick for the duration of the trial, during the wet and dry season, and defined as the 6 % phosphorus treatment group (6 %PT). A maintenance treatment group (MTT) received protein in addition to phosphorus in the lick during the dry season. The production treatment group (PDT) received energy containing raw materials in addition to the minerals and protein as established in the MTT. The finisher treatment group (FST) received a larger amount of energy containing materials which diluted the mineral and protein concentration of the dry season lick even further than in the PDT. The third experimental procedure was to establish a group of 5 ruminally cannulated cattle that would individually be rotated every 3 weeks between the supplement fed treatment groups. The cattle would then be sampled for ruminal fluid, blood and faeces to observe the short term impact of the supplements during the different seasons on these variables and the diagnostic value of these parameters to indicate the nutritional status of cattle. The results clearly illustrated that the cattle had exhibited “nutritional wisdom”. The selection of higher quality plant material than what was on offer in the veld was highlighted in a review of previous oesophageal fistulated cattle research. The strong influence of rainfall on the forage quality (increased phosphorus and protein) was highlighted. During spring the phosphorus and protein reached their maximum concentrations. It was only during the wet season that animal performances were optimised when the quantity of high quality forage increased. The average daily ad libitum nutrient supplement consumption per animal on the different treatments was strongly influenced by these seasonal changes in forage quality and quantity. The lick intake increased as the dry season progressed and the quality of the forage the animals were able to select decreased. During spring the lick intake sharply decreased as the forage quality improved. The cattle adapted their intake level with the aim of maximising their energy intake, which resulted in the highest possible performance possible, from the forage and lick that was on offer to them. Monitoring the average monthly lick intake per animal would give valuable information to the farmer on the quality of the forage selected. The trends observed in average lick intake during the year could be used as an inexpensive indicator of veld qualit. An upper threshold could be set on lick intakes that would signal that a specific area was optimally grazed and that a camp rotation would aid in conserving the rangeland and optimise animal performance. The year round supplementation of rock salt lick group (RST), or alternatively no nutrient supplement, under these conditions had clearly shown a minimal contribution to the nutritional status of cattle and that this strategy would lead to certain financial underperformance or ruin of the cattle farmer. From the results presented, the year round supplementation with a phosphorus and trace mineral lick (6 %PT) was indicated as the absolute minimum nutrient supplementation strategy that would need to be followed in all communal and commercial cattle farming areas of Namibia and probably similar farming locations around the world. Free access to phosphorus licks throughout the year to growing cattle must be ensured by the farmer to allow the cattle to select the correct amount that it would require to optimise performance. This strategy required the least amount of capital to implement and had the largest return on investment for a newly established farmer. If limited amounts of energy containing materials (molasses, maize, bran) were included in the nutrient supplement on offer it allowed the animal the opportunity to only consume the minimum amount of phosphorus that it required throughout the year to balance the shortages that occurred in the forage that it was selecting from. The finisher lick given during the dry season on the FST clearly illustrated that salt and phosphorus were poor regulators of supplemental intake if the cattle were able to increase their total energy retention by over consuming and probably excreting of minerals. The optimum nutrient supplementation strategy was the MTT that alleviated the primary phosphorus and secondary protein shortages during the dry season. This strategy had a much higher capital requirement and would be most suitable for the established cattle farmer that was able to afford this strategy or had access to credit. The PDT and FST were associated with higher supplementation costs that resulted in the highest turnover for the cattle farmer, although at lower profit than the MTT. The PDT and FST supplementation strategies would be more appropriate if the improved nutritional status of the cattle was utilised in a cow herd for improved reproduction or in stud farming when genetic expression of growth potential would offset the cost of supplementation.

40|$|International audienceDomestication can {{influence}} many functional traits in plants, from overall life-history and growth form to wood density and cell wall ultrastructure. Such changes can increase fitness of the domesticate in agricultural environments but may negatively affect {{survival in the}} wild. We studied effects of domestication on stem biomechanics in manioc by comparing domesticated and ancestral wild taxa from two different regions of greater Amazonia. We compared mechanical properties, tissue organisation and wood characteristics including microfibril angles in both wild and domesticated plants, each growing in two different habitats (forest or savannah) and varying in growth form (shrub or liana). Wild taxa grew as <b>shrubs</b> in open <b>savannah</b> but as lianas in overgrown and forested habitats. Growth form plasticity was retained in domesticated manioc. However, stems of the domesticate showed brittle failure. Wild plants differed in mechanical architecture between shrub and liana phenotypes, a difference that diminished between shrubs and lianas of the domesticate. Stems of wild plants were generally stiffer, failed at higher bending stresses and were less prone to brittle fracture compared with shrub and liana phenotypes of the domesticate. Biomechanical differences between stems of wild and domesticated plants were mainly due to changes in wood density and cellulose microfibril angle rather than changes in secondary growth or tissue geometry. Domestication did not significantly modify "large-scale" trait development or growth form plasticity, since both wild and domesticated manioc can develop as shrubs or lianas. However, "finer-scale" developmental traits crucial to mechanical stability and thus ecological success of the plant were significantly modified. This profoundly influenced the likelihood of brittle failure, particularly in long climbing stems, thereby also influencing {{the survival of the}} domesticate in natural situations vulnerable to mechanical perturbation. We discuss the different selective pressures that could explain evolutionary modifications of stem biomechanical properties under domestication in manioc...|$|R
40|$|Primates {{along with}} many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic {{ecological}} conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest-savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non-tree species (liana, herb and <b>savannah</b> <b>shrub),</b> in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non-tree plants have been defined as fallback and non-preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forest-savannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. Am. J. Primatol. 77 : 948 - 962, 2015.

40|$|Domestication can {{influence}} many functional traits in plants, from overall life-history and growth form to wood density and cell wall ultrastructure. Such changes can increase fitness of the domesticate in agricultural environments but may negatively affect {{survival in the}} wild. We studied effects of domestication on stem biomechanics in manioc by comparing domesticated and ancestral wild taxa from two different regions of greater Amazonia. We compared mechanical properties, tissue organisation and wood characteristics including microfibril angles in both wild and domesticated plants, each growing in two different habitats (forest or savannah) and varying in growth form (shrub or liana). Wild taxa grew as <b>shrubs</b> in open <b>savannah</b> but as lianas in overgrown and forested habitats. Growth form plasticity was retained in domesticated manioc. However, stems of the domesticate showed brittle failure. Wild plants differed in mechanical architecture between shrub and liana phenotypes, a difference that diminished between shrubs and lianas of the domesticate. Stems of wild plants were generally stiffer, failed at higher bending stresses and were less prone to brittle fracture compared with shrub and liana phenotypes of the domesticate. Biomechanical differences between stems of wild and domesticated plants were mainly due to changes in wood density and cellulose microfibril angle rather than changes in secondary growth or tissue geometry. Domestication did not significantly modify "large-scale" trait development or growth form plasticity, since both wild and domesticated manioc can develop as shrubs or lianas. However, "finer-scale" developmental traits crucial to mechanical stability and thus ecological success of the plant were significantly modified. This profoundly influenced the likelihood of brittle failure, particularly in long climbing stems, thereby also influencing {{the survival of the}} domesticate in natural situations vulnerable to mechanical perturbation. We discuss the different selective pressures that could explain evolutionary modifications of stem biomechanical properties under domestication in manioc...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Securidaca longepedunculata is a <b>savannah</b> <b>shrub</b> found {{growing in}} {{tropical}} Africa. It is reputed {{to have more}} than a hundred medicinal uses and is a major component of anticancer decoctions in Nigeria. An attempt was made in this study to determine the in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activity and possible pro-apoptotic effect of Securidaca longepedunculata aqueous root bark extract on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells. In vitro cytotoxic activity was determined using the Trypan blue assay by incubating Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells with various concentrations of Securidaca longepedunculata aqueous extract. In vivo study was carried out by intraperitoneal administration of varied doses of Securidaca longepedunculata to tumour-bearing mice. Isolated DNA from Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells in treated and untreated animals was used for DNA fragmentation assay on agarose gel. Securidaca longepedunculata Aqueous extract, Securidaca longepedunculata was cytotoxic to Ehrlich ascites both in vivo and in vitro. The IC 50 of Securidaca longepedunculata was 67 µg/ml. Securidaca longepedunculata caused a decrease in angiogenesis as observed in the reduction in weight of treated animals and a reduction in volume of ascitic fluid in treated mice.   DNA fragmentation assay of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells from treated animals depicted a possible pro-apoptotic effect of the Securidaca longepedunculata extract due to the ladder forming pattern which was comparable to that of the standard drug (fluorouracil). Securidaca longepedunculata aqueous extract had a cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effect on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells. Industrial relevance: The use of Securidaca longepedunculata in traditional medicine in the treatment and management of cancer has been brought to the fore. Development of herbal drugs from the crude extracts could be achieved due to findings suggesting the plant could increase life span in patients with advanced stages of cancer. Herbal supplements could be produce from the plants with low concentration of the extract. Chemotherapeutic applications of the plant also include its potential inclusion in drug development based on the pro-apoptotic potential of the plant.
