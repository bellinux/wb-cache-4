40|$|Abstract: To {{further study}} {{the effects of}} public <b>service</b> <b>facilities</b> on the land use {{intensity}} at regulatory planning level and enhance the scientific determination of land use intensity, this paper expounds the influence mechanism and factors of the public <b>service</b> <b>facilities</b> on land use intensity in regulatory planning, and conducts quantitative evaluation of the influence factors through theoretical analysis, mathematical analysis and analytic hierarchy process etc. The results show that the in-fluence mechanism of public <b>service</b> <b>facilities</b> on the land use intensity goes throughout all three levels of regulatory plan-ning. Different characteristics of public <b>service</b> <b>facilities</b> on each level determine their different influence factors and take effect on the land use intensity index of the corresponding level, thus affecting the determination of the block floor area ratio. Based on this, this paper proposes a method to determine the land use intensity in regulatory planning under the re-striction of public <b>service</b> <b>facilities</b> and completes the test in practice, which may provide a reference for determining the land use intensity in regulatory planning...|$|R
