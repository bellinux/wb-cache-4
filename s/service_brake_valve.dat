50|$|A {{relay valve}} is an {{air-operated}} valve typically used in air brake systems to remotely control the brakes {{at the rear}} of a heavy truck or semi-trailer in a tractor-trailer combination. Relay valves are necessary in heavy trucks in order to speed-up rear-brake application and release, since air takes longer to travel {{to the rear of the}} vehicle than the front of the vehicle, where the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> foot-valve, parking-control <b>valve,</b> and trailer-supply valve (if applicable) are located.|$|R
50|$|With a <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> relay <b>valve</b> installed, {{the hose}} that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers, and quickly applies the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes.</b> The pressure delivered to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.|$|R
50|$|A spring <b>brake</b> relay <b>valve</b> {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> relay <b>valve,</b> although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> are applied by means of a <b>brake</b> pedal air <b>valve</b> which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control <b>valve.</b> The trailer <b>brake</b> consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park <b>brake</b> relay <b>valve</b> and the control line is regulated via the trailer <b>brake</b> relay <b>valve.</b> The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover <b>brake</b> pedal air <b>valve,</b> trailer <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the <b>brake</b> pedal <b>valve</b> {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> concurrently with the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay <b>valve</b> for remote <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> application.|$|R

40|$|Railroad cars in coal {{service in}} the northeastern United States are often shopped for wheel defects such as slid flat, built up tread and spalling. Previous work found that these defects {{can be caused by}} wheel sliding after air {{pressure}} leaks through defective <b>service</b> and emergency <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> portions into the brake cylinder. Another important factor in the creation of wheel defects from wheel sliding is the car’s empty braking ratio. If a car is excessively braked when empty, or has lost weight, there will be a greater chance for wheel sliding and damage. Wheel changeout data for different car classes were reviewed and several coal cars in the classes with the most wheel repairs were selected for detailed testing. The cars were given a complete air brake test, including a brake cylinder pressure test, and the brake system and wheels of each car was inspected. A static brake shoe force test was then conducted on each car {{in order to determine the}} current empty braking ratio, loaded braking ratio and hand braking ratio. A second set of static brake shoe force tests was also conducted using a new device that does not require removal of brake shoes and the results were compared to the first method.

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} {{hydraulic}} brake system has several advantages over traditional brake actuation systems. These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic brake systems. Implementation of full power hydraulic brake system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b> First, the dynamic characteristics of full power hydraulic brake system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (<b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power hydraulic brake system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power hydraulic brake system dynamics...|$|R

5000|$|A {{steam brake}} acts {{directly}} and immediately; the sudden {{opening of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> {{can result in a}} slight overbraking by locking the wheels. The operation of a steam brake therefore requires a great deal of experience from the engine driver.|$|R
5000|$|On a long {{train the}} brake force during a brake {{application}} was not consistent {{along the length}} of the train; the response to the driver’s operation of the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> varied according to train length and the variation caused longitudinal surging.|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|R
