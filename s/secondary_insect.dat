40|$|This study {{describes}} the {{spatial distribution of}} stored product insects captured biweekly using foodbaited cage traps in a large rice storage and processing facility, {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Monitoring started in August 2009 and will be carried out for 1 year, the first 5 months of sampling being presented in this study. From end of August 2009 until the end of December 2009, a total of 9893 insects were captured in the 99 cage traps. The most abundant species were: Carpophilus spp. (76 %), Typhaea stercorea (8. 6 %), Ahasverus advena (5. 5 %), Tribolium castaneum (2. 3 %), Sitophilus oryzae (2 %), Sitophilus zeamais (1. 5 %), Ephestia spp. (1. 2 %), Cryptolestes ferrugineus (1 %), Rhyzopertha dominica (0. 64 %), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (0. 6 %), Anthicus floralis (0. 4 %), Lasioderma serricorne (0. 25 %). The first two species, which make up for 84. 6 % of the insects collected, are not considered pests in stored grain, rather are attracted by moldy material present in residues or even in the bait material. The other insects, including primary and secondary species, comprised about 15 % of the total trapped. The spatial distribution of the most important species infesting rice grain and of the total insect number was analyzed using Surfer 6. 04 (Golden software, Golden, CO, USA) and contour maps were constructed to target areas for sanitation. Except for trap 66, located by the rice hulk storage box, the spatial distribution we observed using the contour maps showed that the greatest number of insects was mostly captured in cages placed in the receiving area, around the dryers, as well as outside of the structure where grain residues frequently accumulate. As indicated on the maps for total number of insects, a few isolated infested spots were detected. The parboiled rice area had the least amount of insects, except for trap 61, placed outside the structure. The population of primary and the most important <b>secondary</b> <b>insect</b> species, as well as the overall number of insects, decreased after sanitation and physical control measures were applied. Our observations confirm that insect monitoring is an essential tool for targeting and evaluating the control measures adopted in the quality program of rice storage and processing facilities...|$|E
25|$|But Bt cotton is {{ineffective}} against many cotton pests, however, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; {{depending on}} circumstances it {{may still be}} desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds. However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this. They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these <b>secondary</b> <b>insects</b> was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011. This was 69% of the worldwide total area planted in cotton.|$|R

Livestock grazing can affect insects by altering habitat quality; however, the effects of grazing years and intensities on insect abundance and trophic level during manipulative sheep grazing are not well understood. Therefore, we investigated these effects in a large manipulative experiment from 2014 to 2016 in the eastern Eurasian steppe, China. Insect abundance decreased as sheep grazing intensities increased, with a significant cumulative effect occurring during grazing years. The largest families, Acrididae and Cicadellidae, were susceptible to sheep grazing, but Formicidae was tolerant. Trophic primary and <b>secondary</b> consumer <b>insects</b> were negatively impacted by increased grazing intensities, while secondary consumers were limited by the decreased primary consumers. Poor vegetation conditions caused by heavy sheep grazing were detrimental to the existence of Acrididae, Cicadellidae, primary and <b>secondary</b> consumer <b>insects,</b> but were beneficial to Formicidae. This study revealed variations in insect abundance and trophic level in response to continuous sheep grazing in steppe grasslands. Overall, our results indicate that continuous years of heavy- and over- sheep grazing should be eliminated. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of more flexible sheep grazing management and will be useful for developing guidelines to optimize livestock production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.

40|$|Wheat crop {{occupies}} 			a central {{position in}} agriculture sector and our national economy. 			Pakistan contribution toward global wheat production is about 3. 2 			percent. The Punjab province is leading producer of wheat with a 			share {{of more than}} 70 {{percent of the total}} wheat production of the 			country. Despite being an agricultural country, food security of 			Pakistan has remained at stake since long because of poor yield and 			high post harvest losses caused by the storage pests. On the other 			hand country has a great exporting potential not only to achieve 			Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) relating to food security and 			safety but can earn foreign exchange and pay off country 			entire debts within 10 years just equaling our yield to that of 			Indian Punjab. 			Present investigations were, therefore, carried out to explore these 			potentials in terms of reducing post-harvest losses, food security 			and safety risks caused by the storage pests particularly the Khapra 			beetle which is a notified quarantine pest internationally. The 			studies revealed an average loss of 15. 5 percent when 10 pairs of 			Khapra larvae were released for a period of 6 months under the 			natural conditions. Similarly there were found 33 and 8 percent 			increase in number of weeviled and broken grains, respectively. 			Besides, the beetle depleted approximately 4 percent carbohydrates 			that resulted in 0. 35 and 1 percent increase in ash and crude fiber 			contents, respectively. Although total protein and fat percentages 			were slightly increased, yet these increases were predominantly due 			to the percentage loss of carbohydrates as well as production of 			protein aceous by-products of live insects, insect fragments, and 			excreta etc., which could not be sieved from the samples before 			chemical analysis. Further analysis of about 400 samples drawn from 			the entire province revealed that quality of Punjab wheat not only 			meets the international standards rather it is superior in many 			characteristics including protein content, moisture, bulk density, 			foreign matter, falling number. However, presence of quarantine 			pests such as T. granarium, Tilletia spores and Striga weeds render 			it unmarketable in the quality conscious world. A compatible grading 			system at the time of procurement and phytosanitary management of 			quarantine pests may guarantee vast acceptance of our wheat in the 			international market. Present research involved phytosanitary 			management of T. granarium with controlled and modified atmospheres 			(CA and MA) which have worldwide recognition as residuefree methods 			of insect control in warehouses, flourmills and granaries. Carbon 			dioxide and nitrogen base CAs proved effective in controlling T. 			granarium as well as the <b>secondary</b> <b>insect</b> pests, such as T. 			castaneum and S. granarius. The results revealed 100 percent control 			of T. granarium when exposed to 99 percent carbon dioxide based 			controlled atmosphere for 384 hours at 30 °C. The exposure time for 			complete mortality of T. castaneum and S. granarius was reduced to 			 96 hours under the similar conditions. The Khapra larvae were found 			to be the most resistant pests followed by S. granarius and T. 			castaneum. Carbon dioxide concentrations, exposure times and 			temperature significantly influenced mortality of the target pests. 			Higher values of these factors resulted in enhanced mortality and 			vice versa. We found a liberty to select these factors according to 			our ease and available resources to get a specific level of 			mortality. Likewise nitrogen based controlled atmosphere also proved 			effective, though time required to kill was higher as compared to 			Carbon dioxide based CAs. When atmosphere was modified by increasing 			the temperature, we achieved 100 percent mortality of the T. 			granarium larvae within 5 minutes and 12 hours at 60 and 54 °C, 			respectively. The other storage pests being admittedly the lesser 			thermo-tolerant may also be controlled under these conditions. Use 			of elevated temperatures is economically feasible, as most of the 			fumigations in Pakistan are carried out during June-Aug immediately 			after harvesting the crop when day time temperature usually touches 			 45 ± 4 °C. With a little effort and energy cost we may raise the 			ware-house temperature to a level of 60 °C to disinfest our stores 			economically. The technology is fit for cereals stored for food 			purpose. In case of seed stores germination test and adjustment of 			the seed rate is recommended before sowing because results have 			revealed significant loss of wheat seed viability. 			Finally, phosphine (PH 3) alone as well as in combination with 60 			percent carbon dioxide was also tested as Methyl bromide (MB) 			alternative at different temperatures as a short term insect control 			strategy. A phosphine concentration of 2 mg-L- 1 gave 100 			percent mortality of five out of seven strains of T. granarium, when 			exposed for a period of 120 hours. Complete control of the other two 			target pests was, however, achieved after 24 hours under the similar 			conditions. Increased temperatures, phosphine concentrations and 			prolonged exposure exerted positive effect on the mortality. It was 			concluded that aforesaid independent variables may be manipulated to 			get complete control of even the resistant pests with low residues 			permissible under Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) and Codex limits. 			Synergistic effect of carbon dioxide also helped in reducing PH 3 			concentrations to ensure phytosanitary management of T. granarium 			for Quarantine and Preshipment (QPS) and other purposes. In nutshell 			the present investigations have revealed that MB alternatives such 			as CAs, MAs as well as PH 3 are very effective in reducing storage 			losses and controlling T. granarium and others storage pests.

40|$|Mountains occupy only 3 {{percent of}} Poland. They are the {{northern}} part of the European arc of the Carpathian and Sudety Mountains, extending about 700 km along the southern Polish border. They are of medium height (about 1, 500 m., maximum 2, 600 m. a. s. l.), and diversified in terms of climate, geology, soils, vegetation, and anthropogenic impacts. The forest vegetation of the Sudety and Carpathian Mountains forms three elevational zones. Forests occur in the foothills (as high as 600 m. a. s. l.), the lower mountain forest zone (as high as 1, 250 m. a. s. l.) and the upper montane forest zone (as high as 1, 500 m. a. s. l.). The original lower mountain forests consist mainly of the fir (Abies alba Mill.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), while upper montane forests consist of spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.). Centuries of economic activity have changed the species composition of mountain forests. The share of the spruce has increased considerably, and the percentage of the fir and beech has decreased significantly. In the Sudety and western part of the Carpathian Mountains prevalence of spruce is the highest (83 percent), while in the eastern part of the Carpathians, it does not exceed 10 percent. The percentage of beech in the Sudety and western part of Carpathian forests is below 20 percent, but about 40 percent in the eastern part of the Carpathians.

25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live {{predominantly}} saprophytic lifestyles, so it's {{not uncommon}} even for plant parasitic species of this genus {{to survive in}} the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA in the plant's genome. More details about this process of plasmid DNA insertion are mentioned in the preceding sections. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes it to become crushed and/or distorted, ultimately leading to reduced water flow in the xylem due to crushed vessels. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to <b>secondary</b> invasion by <b>insects</b> and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.|$|R

Groundwater-fed streams are predictable both thermally and hydrologically year round, whereas SWF streams are unpredictable and exhibit more variable thermal and hydrologic regimes. These differences may strongly influence aquatic insect community structure and secondary production. Four streams, two GWF and two SWF, were sampled twice monthly from late April 2013 through August 2013 and once seasonally in fall (September) and early winter (November). Aquatic insect community structure differed markedly in both hydrologic types. Taxa richness was significantly higher in SWF (43) than in GWF (39) streams and non-metric multidimensional scaling of community structure revealed two distinct groups corresponding to the two hydrologic types. Total secondary production was higher in GWF than in SWF streams with Orthocladiinae (Diptera: Chironomidae) representing 56 % of <b>insect</b> <b>secondary</b> production in GWF streams. Results from this study have strong implications for aquatic insect communities in GWF and SWF streams because of differing susceptibilities of these systems to the potential effects of climate change.

Because ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Las), the putative causal agent of HLB, accumulates in its vector, the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, Kuwayama, accurate testing of the insect is vital. Due to the fact that <b>insect</b> <b>secondary</b> metabolites interfere with downstream applications (1, 3) there is concern about the number of insects pooled in DNA extractions without compromising Las detection. The current USDA CPHST approved method of testing (2) limits the pooling size to five individual insects per extraction followed by the highly sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) detection technique. The QPCR reaction targets a region of the Las 16 S ribosomal gene (4) and simultaneously the D. citri specific wingless (WGLS) gene (5) as an internal control for extraction efficiency. In contrast, the CDFA laboratory routinely pools up to 25 individual insects for DNA extraction, followed by the same QPCR detection. If pooling 25 individuals is indeed a safe practice all the labs currently limiting sample pooling to five individuals could save a substantial amount of time and money.

AAB establish symbiotic associations with the insect midgut, a niche characterized by the availability of diet-derived carbohydrates and oxygen and by an acidic pH, selective factors that support AAB growth. AAB have been shown to actively colonize different insect tissues and organs, such as the epithelia of male and female reproductive organs, the Malpighian tubules and the salivary glands. This complex topology of the symbiosis indicates that AAB possess the keys for passing through body barriers, allowing them to migrate to different organs of the host. Recently, AAB involvement in the regulation of innate immune system homeostasis of Drosophila has been shown, indicating a functional role for host survival. All these lines of evidence indicate that AAB can play different roles in insect biology, not being restricted to the feeding habit of the host. The close association of AAB and their insect hosts has been confirmed by the demonstration of multiple modes of transmission between individuals and to the progeny that include vertical and horizontal transmission routes, comprising a venereal one.

40|$|Blackbird (Icteridae) {{damage to}} {{maturing}} corn (Zea mays) {{in the milk}} and dough stages has long been considered a severe problem in localized areas of the United States (Stone et al. 1972). Most estimates of primary loss to corn yields are based on visual or measured surface area estimates of damage to individual ears (Linehan 1967; De Grazio et al. 1969; DeHaven 1974; Granett et al. 1974). These estimates of loss ignore any compensating growth in the undamaged kernels and <b>secondary</b> losses from <b>insects</b> and disease that may have occurred following damage. Numerous studies of fruit, small grain, and hay have shown that moderate injury or loss to stems, leaves, roots, or fruit can occur before yield is actually affected (reviewed by Stern 1973). Compensation in maturing corn has been suggested by Linehan (1967), Dawson (1970), Dyer (1975; 1976), and Woronecki et al. (1976). The present {{study was conducted to}} quantify possible compensatory growth responses and to estimate the effects of secondary losses associated with bird damage to maturing corn. If compensatory growth is a significant factor, visual assessments of bird damage should be adjusted to reflect more accurately the impact of bird depredations. Our previous study (Woronecki et al. 1976) suggested that net loss of shelled corn weight was a function of both the level of damage and the maturity of the ear at time of damage. The study also showed that low levels of bird damage could be partially compensated by increased kernel weight. Regardless of maturity, damage of less than six kernels per ear resulted in no net loss and in some instances resulted in increased yield. The results from that experiment were considered preliminary, because certain disparities left a doubt whether or not the data were confounded by plant responses to other primary and secondary damage. The present experiment, a modification of our previous study (Woronecki et al. 1976), was designed to provide a more sensitive test of the direct effects of bird damage on maturing field corn.

In this study we assessed aspects of the trophic ecology of this exotic fish, P. infans, using gut content and stable isotope analysis to understand its capacity to tolerate anthropogenic environmental degradation in the Lago de Pátzcuaro. We also determined its trophic guild position (TP) using the TrophLab Program and stable isotope. Niche breadth was calculated by standardized Levins’ Index (Bi). Fish was captured with a seine during wet and dry seasons at six environmentally different sites and gut contents were obtained. We analyzed a total of 239 gut contents of P. infans. The contribution of each food item in the diet was quantified using frequency of occurrence and area percentage. The importance of each prey item was determined according to the index of relative importance (IRI), and the omnivory index (OI) {{was used to assess}} the feeding behavior. Fish were categorized by size and the diet was compared between fish sizes and sites. Dorsal muscle tissue and water hyacinth tissue was obtained for nitrogen isotope signature (δ 15 N) analysis. Additionally, we measured water and habitat quality to evaluate environmental conditions at each site. We concluded that P. infans is an omnivore (OI= 0. 28) that consumes mainly detritus (44 %), epiphytic diatoms (37 %), and <b>secondary</b> on terrestrial <b>insects</b> (6 %) and zooplankton (10 %). The fish can behave as a specialist (Bi= 0. 39) or generalist (Bi= 0. 68) and as a primary consumer (TROPH= 2. 2; TP= 2. 3) with a feeding strategy that was the same at different sizes, seasons and sites. None of the evaluated sites showed good environmental quality. We argue that P. infans can tolerate changes in water quality and feeding items availability, because it can exploit resources in multiple trophic webs. However, this species could be dependent on habitat complexity, especially in the aquatic vegetation cover...|$|R
40|$|Studies in {{biological}} control and invasion biology rarely determine whether introduced plants may rapidly evolve {{in the area}} of introduction. Examining the evolution of plant chemical defenses after reassociation with a coevolved enemy is important not only to understand the dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions but also in predicting potential ultimate outcomes of classical weed control programs. A system in which chemical evolution may be examined involves the interaction between Conium maculatum, a Eurasian weed naturalized in North America that contains high concentrations of piperidine alkaloids (γ-coniceine, coniine, conhydrinone) acting as chemical defenses, and its monophagous European associate Agonopterix alstroemeriana. In the United States, C. maculatum was largely free from herbivory until approximately 30 years ago when it was reassociated via accidental introduction with A. alstroemeriana. At present C. maculatum and A. alstroemeriana are found in a continuum of re-association times and intensities. To determine the degree to which variation in alkaloid content and resistance to A. alstroemeriana were genetically based we conducted a common garden experiment involving plants from three locations in the U. S. (Illinois, Washington and New York) that had experienced 12, 20 and 32 years of reassociation with A. alstroemeriana respectively. We analyzed alkaloid concentrations and recorded the natural colonization of A. alstroemeriana on C. maculatum by counting the number of leaf rolls {{at the end of the}} season. Additionally, a bioassay with larvae from our laboratory colony raised on IL, NY and WA foliage was conducted to determine the effects of <b>secondary</b> chemistry on <b>insect</b> fitness. Total alkaloid production in C. maculatum was positively correlated with reassociation time between C. maculatum and A. alstroemeriana, with the longest historical association with A. alstroemeriana (NY) had highest alkaloid content; WA plants were intermediate, with the highest amount of variability among sites, and IL plants had lowest alkaloid concentrations. High variance among WA plants may be a result of transitioning from low alkaloid levels resulting from costs associated with investments in alkaloids in the absence of consistent herbivory, to a highly resistant state where variability has been stabilized due to selection by A. alstroemeriana. The number of leaf rolls present on C. maculatum was higher in IL plants compared to WA plants and larvae raised on foliage from IL experienced significantly lower mortality than larvae raised on foliage from WA. Prolonged reassociation between C. maculatum and its specialist moth may increase toxicity of this noxious weed in its introduced range. In a previous experiment we documented differences in alkaloid concentrations among plants from IL, WA and NY collected in situ (Castells et al. 2005 J. Chem Ecol. 31). Here we show that at least part of these differences, higher alkaloids in those regions with longer reassociation times (NY; WA; IL), have a genetic basis. Plants with higher alkaloid concentrations experienced less damage by A. alstroemeriana. At the same time, a decrease in fitness was found when larvae were raised on high alkaloid plants. All of these results are suggestive of strong directional selection exerted by A. alstroemeriana on C. maculatum chemistry...|$|R
