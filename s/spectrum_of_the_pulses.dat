40|$|GX 1 + 4 {{is one of}} the {{brightest}} celestial sources of high-energy X-rays. It is a pulsar with a period of approximately 2 min (perhaps a multiple of 2 min), decreasing at a variable rate which, since 1971, has averaged approximately 2 % per year, but which can be larger than 5 % per year. This is the largest rate of decrease observed for any pulsar. The rate of decrease appears to be correlated with the luminosity, in support of the idea that the period decrease is produced by accretion torques acting upon a neutron star. No evidence is seen for a Doppler shift due to motion of the pulsar in a binary orbit; {{this is consistent with the}} results of optical observations which suggest that any orbital period is fairly long (months to years). The spectrum of GX 1 + 4 is measured as a function of pulse phase, as well as the phase-averaged total spectrum, and the average <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulses</b> alone.

The pulse source is a sliding frequency laser which generates transform limited pulses with 10 ps full width half maximum duration at a wavelength of 1532 nm. After 50 km of standard singlemode fibre with 16 ps/nm. km dispersion the pulses have broadened to 200 ps due to dispersion. The pulses are combined with a pump signal at 1535 nm, amplified and transmitted through 13 km of dispersion shifted fibre with dispersion zero at 1535 nm. The phase conjugate signal at 1538 nm, generated by four wave mixing, is filtered, amplified and transmitted through a second span of 51. 5 km fibre which compresses the pulses back to its original pulse width. Limitations from self phase modulation in the transmission fibre have been observed. Ideally, spectral inversion should also compensate for self phase modulation if the power levels in the two spans are symmetrical. These effects has been studied with numerical simulation showing that the effect of self phase modulation is difficult to eliminate due to the asymmetrical fibre loss.

40|$|As {{real-world}} ultra-fast optical devices proliferate, {{there is}} a growing need for highly reliable and compact sources of femtosecond pulses [1]. Currently most of these applications require moderate power sources operating around 800 nm, which is ideally compatible with frequency-doubling of femtosecond Er 3 +-fiber lasers. Previously integrated high-power fiber laser systems were developed based on chirped-pulse amplification schemes relying on chirped fiber gratings for pulse stretching and compression to minimize the nonlinearities of femtosecond fiber amplifiers [2]. The component count of such systems can be considerably reduced and the optical efficiency increased by implementing aperiodically poled lithium niobate [3] (APPLN), as APPLN allows a unique integration of chirped pulse amplification with frequency-doubling. Here we demonstrate the first system application of a APPLN frequency-doubler in conjunction with a high-power cladding-pumped Er 3 +/Yb 3 + fiber laser. The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. The fiber seed system is based on an environmentally stable fiber soliton laser [1] and generates bandwidth-limited 250 fsec pulses with pulse energies of 300 pJ at a repetition rate of 40 MHz at a wavelength of 1. 56 µm. To operate the cladding pumped power amplifier in saturation the pre- amplifier is used, which boosts the average signal power to 35 mW. Prior to amplification in the cladding-pumped power amplifier the pulses are stretched to ~ 1. 7 psec in a 2. 9 m length of positive dispersion fiber. Using a coupled pump power of ~ 6 W at 980 nm into the power amplifier, we obtain a signal power of 600 mW. After frequency-doubling in a length of 2 cm of APPLN an average power of 180 mW is obtained at 780 nm. The frequency-doubled pulse energy is 4. 5 nJ. Note that the crystal was not AR-coated and the internal SH power was ~ 210 mW. The internal SH conversion efficiency was 40 %. An autocorrelation trace and the corresponding pulse spectra at the frequency-doubled wavelength are shown in Fig, 2. The pulse width is 290 fsec and assuming a gaussian pulse shape the time bandwidth product is 0. 51, i. e. the pulses were within 20 % of the bandwidth limit. Since currently APPLN allows the recompression of pulses up to 15 psec in width [3], we can expect that this technology may be upscaled to producing femtosecond pulses at Watt-level powers at 780 nm.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work on {{a variety}} of novel fibre-based, all-optical approaches to the implementation of several key telecommunications operations. It can be divided into two distinct parts. The first part relates to the generation and coherent manipulation of short pulses in all-fibre systems. The development of an actively and harmonically mode-locked polarisation-maintaining erbium fibre ring laser operating at a repetition rate of 10 GHz is first presented. Long-term stable operation is ensured by the use of an optical phase lock loop to maintain resonant operating conditions. The ring laser incorporated a long length of dispersion-shifted fibre that enhanced soliton compression of the generated pulses, and a filter to allow for tuneable operation within the erbium gain bandwidth. The output was in the form of 2 - 4 ps nearly transform-limited solitons, the width of which depended on pump power. A series of characterisation measurements on this laser is presented. These include autocorrelation and optical spectrum measurements of the pulses, frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) characterisation, an interpulse noise measurement, jitter measurements using the RF <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulses,</b> and bit error-rate measurements. A technique that uses superstructured fibre Bragg gratings for passively manipulating short pulses in a coherent manner is presented. The technique relies on filtering in both amplitude and phase the (broad) spectrum of the input pulses, thereby producing pulses of a desired spectral, and hence temporal response. The pulses generated from the erbium fibre ring laser were used in a series of experiments that demonstrated this technique. A basic pulse encoding and decoding scheme, pulse shaping of soliton pulses into square pulses, and repetition rate multiplication from 10 to 40 GHz are presented. The second part of the thesis concerns a detailed characterisation of the recently discovered optical nonlinearities associated with the reflectivity of a gallium:glass interface. It is demonstrated that such mirrors can be formed at the tip of a cleaved fibre. The reflectivity of these mirrors is shown to change at the erbium wavelengths by 30 % under suitable temperature and optical excitation. An assessment of the dependence of the magnitude, dynamics and optical phase response of the nonlinearity on temperature and pump power is carried out. The reproducibility of the nonlinear effect was also examined. Gallium mirrors were then used to passively Q-switch a variety of fibre lasers. Due to their broadband nature, Q-switching of lasers of significantly different lasing wavelengths was achieved (1064 and 1550 nm). Pulse energies up to 10 µJ were obtained. This performance is directly comparable to that achieved using state-of-the-art (wavelength-selective) saturable absorbers. <br/...|$|E

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} propagation {{over long}} distances of moderate intensity laser pulses in tenuous gases is studied. <b>The</b> dynamics <b>of</b> these <b>pulses</b> {{will be affected}} by nonlinear focusing and dispersion due to the background gas, and by plasma induced refraction and dispersion. Laser propagation is studied numerically using the simulation code WAKE. Different phenomena are found for different regimes of peak input power. For powers near the critical power, temporal pulse narrowing and splitting due to phase modulation and group velocity dispersion is seen. For slightly higher powers, plasma generation and <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a trailing pulse, which is guided off axis by plasma refraction and nonlinear gas focusing, is observed. For even higher powers, <b>the</b> laser <b>pulse</b> is partially trapped by the plasma and then exhibits a form <b>of</b> self-interference. <b>The</b> processes affecting <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> is also studied. Among these are self-phase modulation, nonlinear self-focusing, plasma generation, and group velocity dispersion. <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> these factors leads to an asymmetric spectrum. If group velocity dispersion cannot arrest nonlinear self-focusing, self...|$|R
