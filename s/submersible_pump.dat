50|$|A <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> {{cable is}} a {{specialized}} product {{to be used}} for a <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> in a deep well, or in similarly harsh conditions. The cable needed for this type of application must be durable and reliable as the installation location and environment can be extremely restrictive as well as hostile. As such, <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> cable can be used in both fresh and salt water. It is also suitable for direct burial and within well castings. A <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> cable's area of installation is physically restrictive. Cable manufacturers must keep these factors in mind to achieve the highest possible degree of reliability. The size and shape of <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> cable can vary depending on the usage and preference and pumping instrument of the installer. Pump cables are made in single and multiple conductor types and may be flat or round in cross section; some types include control wires as well as power conductors for the pump motor. Conductors are often color-coded for identification and an overall cable jacket may also be color-coded.|$|E

30|$|The <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> unit is a {{new type}} of pumping system for lifting {{formation}} fluids from onshore oil wells, and the identification of its working condition has an important influence on oil production. In this paper we proposed a diagnostic method for identifying the working condition of the <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> system. Based on analyzing the working principle of the pumping unit and the pump structure, different characteristics in loading and unloading processes of the submersible linear motor were obtained at different working conditions. The characteristic quantities were extracted from operation data of the submersible linear motor. A diagnostic model based on the support vector machine (SVM) method was proposed for identifying the working condition of the <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> unit, where the inputs of the SVM classifier were the characteristic quantities. The performance and the misjudgment rate of this method were analyzed and validated by the data acquired from an experimental simulation platform. The model proposed had an excellent performance in failure diagnosis of the <b>submersible</b> <b>pumping</b> system. The SVM classifier had higher diagnostic accuracy than the learning vector quantization (LVQ) classifier.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Submersible</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} in oil {{production}} to provide a relatively efficient form of [...] "artificial lift", able to operate across {{a broad range of}} flow rates and depths. By decreasing the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} well (by lowering bottomhole flowing pressure, or increasing drawdown), significantly more oil can be produced from the well when compared with natural production. The pumps are typically electrically powered and referred to as Electrical <b>Submersible</b> <b>Pumps</b> (ESP).|$|R

50|$|A <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> (or sub pump, {{electric}} <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> (ESP)) is {{a device}} {{which has a}} hermetically sealed motor close-coupled to the pump body. The whole assembly is submerged in the fluid to be pumped. The main advantage {{of this type of}} pump is that it prevents pump cavitation, a problem associated with a high elevation difference between pump and the fluid surface. Submersible pumps push fluid to the surface as opposed to jet pumps having to pull fluids. Submersibles are more efficient than jet pumps.|$|E
