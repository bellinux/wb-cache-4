The study included 8 renal transplant recipients. In these patients immediately after the operation was performed the coupled plasma fi ltration adsorption with hemofiltration using a cartridge Mediasorb to reduce the severity of reperfusion injury. We have found that during this extracorporeal blood correction procedure there was <b>statistically</b> not <b>signifi</b> cant decrease of tacrolimus blood concentration. However, concentration of tacrolimus remained in the therapeutic range even after the procedure {{and it was not}} signifi cantly different from the control point С 0. Conclusion. Coupled plasma fi ltration adsorption is safe in renal transplant recipients and has no signifi cant impact on tacrolimus blood concentration. However, the downward trend in the concentration of tacrolimus in the course of these procedures, especially in continuous or semicontinuous mode, as well as in patients with low hematocrit and hypoalbuminemia, requires individual monitoring. </p...|$|R

40|$|Wildlife {{collisions}} with {{vehicles and}} trains are examined in Jasper National Park, Alberta. The database {{used in this}} research {{is one of the}} largest and most complete wildlife/collision databases in North America. Over 4, 000 wildlife collisions from 1951 to 2002 have been documented. The main species examined are elk, bighorn sheep, mule deer, moose, white-tailed deer, coyotes, wolves, black bear and grizzly bear. This level and detail of information is critical in designing mitigation solutions to reduce wildlife collisions. There are a variety of variables that infl uence collision rates ranging from age class, sex, type of wildlife, vehicle volumes, vehicle type, season, time of day and transportation category. From 1980 to 1999, collisions with wildlife averaged 149 large animals per year. For some species these collision rates are both <b>statistically</b> and biologically <b>signifi</b> cant. In addition, collisions on highways and the railway affect both local and regional wildlife populations. Using collision data as indicators of wildlife composition adjacent to transportation corridors shows changes have occurred in the wildlife composition adjacent to transportation corridors. Additional research includes an updated assessment of the effect of reduced speed zones in reducing wildlife collisions and an assessment of Strieter Lite Refl ectors. Reduced speed zones reduced the rate of collisions with elk and other wildlife but had a negligible affect on reducing bighorn sheep collisions. An analysis of Strieter Lite Refl ectors is in preparation.

40|$|Background Phantom limb pain is a {{debilitating}} condition {{for which no}} eff ective treatment has been found. We hypothesised that re-engagement of central and peripheral circuitry involved in motor execution could reduce phantom limb pain via competitive plasticity and reversal of cortical reorganisation. Methods Patients with upper limb amputation and known chronic intractable phantom limb pain were recruited at three clinics in Sweden and one in Slovenia. Patients received 12 sessions of phantom motor execution using machine learning, augmented and virtual reality, and serious gaming. Changes in intensity, frequency, duration, quality, and intrusion of phantom limb pain were assessed {{by the use of}} the numeric rating scale, the pain rating index, the weighted pain distribution scale, and a study-specifi c frequency scale before each session and at follow-up interviews 1, 3, and 6 months after the last session. Changes in medication and prostheses were also monitored. Results are reported using descriptive statistics and analysed by non-parametric tests. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 02281539. Findings Between Sept 15, 2014, and April 10, 2015, 14 patients with intractable chronic phantom limb pain, for whom conventional treatments failed, were enrolled. After 12 sessions, patients showed <b>statistically</b> and clinically <b>signifi</b> cant improvements in all metrics of phantom limb pain. Phantom limb pain decreased from pre-treatment to the last treatment session by 47 % (SD 39; absolute mean change 1. 0 [0. 8]; p= 0. 001) for weighted pain distribution, 32 % (38; absolute mean change 1. 6 [1. 8]; p= 0. 007) for the numeric rating scale, and 51 % (33; absolute mean change 9. 6 [8. 1]; p= 0. 0001) for the pain rating index. The numeric rating scale score for intrusion of phantom limb pain in activities of daily living and sleep was reduced by 43 % (SD 37; absolute mean change 2. 4 [2. 3]; p= 0. 004) and 61 % (39; absolute mean change 2. 3 [1. 8]; p= 0. 001), respectively. Two of four patients who were on medication reduced their intake by 81 % (absolute reduction 1300 mg, gabapentin) and 33 % (absolute reduction 75 mg, pregabalin). Improvements remained 6 months after the last treatment. Interpretation Our fi ndings suggest potential value in motor execution of the phantom limb as a treatment for phantom limb pain.

The duration of egg storage prior to their incubation had a weak negative effect on the weight loss from incubation day 0 to day 15. Eggs stored for 1 - 3 days exhibited a <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cantly higher weight loss than eggs stored for 8 - 11 days prior to incubation (P< 0. 001). Eggs stored for up to 8 days showed a tendency towards <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant (P< 0. 05) longer period of incubation. The relationship between incubation period length and egg storage term was moderate, curvilinear and the effect of egg storage term was estimated at 14. 3 % оf the total dispersion of the trait.

The Class II division 1 subjects included 20 males and 33 females (mean age: 17. 08 ± 1. 03 years). All received comprehensive orthodontic treatment using an edgewise appliance and appropriate headgear. Lateral cephalograms were taken {{at the beginning and end}} of treatment. Twenty-fi ve (14 linear and 11 angular) measurements were analysed on each radiograph. Each cephalogram was traced and digitized. For statistical evaluation, paired and independent-samples t-tests were performed. When the pre- and post-treatment measurements were compared, <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant differences were found for nine of 25 measurements. During treatment the facial axis, U 1 –SN (°), U 1 –NA (mm), U 1 –NA (°), H angle and upper lip to E plane measurements decreased, while N-ANS, interincisal angle and upper lip to Steiner S line increased.

Th e results showed that annual income, household size and gender of household head are <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant determinants {{of the value of}} fl ock size in small-holder livestock production. Average annual household income from livestock keeping was N 12, 447. 47 and this constituted 42. 6 % of the mean annual income of N 31, 262. 95. Th e study also found that income from small-holder livestock operation have a positive and <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant (p< 0. 001) eff ect on improved nutrition, household food security, and consequently, rural poverty reduction.

40|$|The use {{of graphic}} symbols forms an {{integral}} part of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies, particularly for pre-literate children. Although some studies have indicated that typically developing children and those with autism are able to learn symbol meanings with multiple exposures to graphic symbols, little is known about how children with autism rate {{the degree to which the}} symbol represents its referent (translucency) with repeated exposures. The purpose of this study was to describe the translucency ratings of children with autism over three consecutive exposures. Twenty-two children with autism participated in a Blissymbol translucency task that included 40 symbols. The Blissymbol task was modifi ed from Bornman, Alant, and du Preez (2009), who explored the translucency of Blissymbols with typically developing children. Findings of this study indicated <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant differences in total translucency ratings of the Blissymbols by the children with autism between Day 1 and Day 3 (medium effect size) with Day 3 yielding more positive ratings than Day 1. No single Blissymbol showed <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant differences over the days. Findings are interpreted and further implications for research are discussed.

40|$|We {{investigated}} serum {{concentration of}} C-reactive protein (CRP) {{and measures of}} adi-posity in patients with type diabetes mellitus (male, female) and age and sex-matched apparently healthy subjects. CRP concentration was determined by laser nephelometry (BN II Analyzer) and Car-dioPhase high-sensitivity CRP (DADE BEHRING) was used as reagent which consists of polystyrene particles coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to CRP. Results have shown that serum CRP concentration in patients with type diabetes mel-litus was <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cantly higher compared to control group of healthy subjects (p<,). Body mass index (BMI) correlated signifi cantly with serum concentration of CRP in patients with type diabetes mellitus (r=,; p<,). <b>Statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant positive correlation was also found between waist to hip ratio and serum CRP concentra-tion in patients with type diabetes mellitus (r=,; p<,). Elevated serum CRP concentration in patients with type diabetes mellitus is probably caused {{by the presence of}} chronic low-grade infl ammation in these patients. It is pos-sible that determined increase of CRP concentration refl ects activation of innate immune system components in patients with type diabetes mellitus. Implications of established association between measures of adiposity and serum CRP level in type diabetes mel-litus remain unclear.

40|$|Introduction: Partial molar {{trophoblast}} degeneration is {{a benign}} disease characterised by numerous complications {{such as an}} invasive mole and malignant alteration. Methods: This was a retrospective study which recruited 70 pregnant women diagnosed with hydatidiform mole or with physiological pregnancy spontaneously aborted. The pregnant women had similar demographic features and were included in two groups. 35 pregnant women with a molar pregnancy diagnosed during the first trimester {{were included in the}} study group; while 35 pregnant women with miscarriages during the fi rst trimester were included in the control group. Results: Examined trophoblast changes were: type of atypia, amount and mass of trophoblast proliferation. Specifi c β HCG serum levels were observed in all pregnant women before the treatment. Pregnant women in the study group had <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant higher levels of β HCG serum in comparison with the control group (both average levels 60191. 37 ± 49662. 75 and levels according to gestational age). <b>Statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant changes of villous trophoblast were observed by the pathomorphological analysis: mild trophoblast atypia (57. 14 %); pronounced trophoblast mass (45. 71 %) and mild trophoblast proliferation amount (51. 43 %). Conclusion: Serum β-HCG level measurements and pathomorphological analysis of chorionic villi are reliable and effective methods in a partial mole diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks of {{psoriasis}} usually can {{be linked}} with traumatic life stress events. Stressful life events in response to psychosocial trigger {{have been reported to}} negatively affect the course of psoriasis and are regarded as preventable causes of morbidity. Aims of this study were to determine which coping strategies are mostly used in psoriatic patients and to determine if there is a difference in coping according genders, clinical stages and stress level. The result shows that denial, active coping, seeking emotional support, positive reframing and acceptance are most frequently used among psoriatic patients. In adaptive coping psoriatic patients Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was 16. 24, in maladaptive coping psoriatic patients PASI score was 19. 6. Difference between adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies in psoriatic patients according clinical stage measured by PASI score was not <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant. Psoriatic patients who had higher score of life stress events (461. 57) measured by Life change units (LCU) used maladaptive coping <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant more then patients with lower life stress events score (284. 71). The results point to the need of psoriatic patients to learn how to cope with stress, enabling them to change ways of coping. There is need for integrating psychological intervention into standard care protocol of chronic dermatologic disease as psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|Cerebrovascular {{accident}} is a focal neurological defi ciency occurring {{suddenly and}} lasting {{for more than}} hours. Th e purpose of our work {{is to determine the}} role of the functional elec-trical simulation (FES) in the rehabilitation of patients with hemiparesis, which occurred as a consequence of a cerebrovascular accident. Th is study includes the analysis of two groups of patients with hemiparesis (patients with deep hemiparesis and patients with light hemi-paresis), a control group which was only treated with kinesiotherapy and a tested group which was treated with kinesiotherapy and functional electrical stimulation. Both groups of patients were analyzed in respect to their sex and age. Additional analysis of the walking function was completed in accordance with the BI and RAP index. Th e analysis of the basic demographical data demonstrated that there is no signifi cant diff erence between the control and tested group. Th e patients of both groups are equal in respect of age and sex. After weeks of rehabilitation of patients with deep and light hemiparesis there were no <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant diff erences between the groups after evaluation by the BI index. However, a <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant diff er-ence was noted between the groups by the RAP index among patients with deep hemiparesis...|$|E
40|$|Shape {{and color}} are key factors in quality {{evaluation}} of fresh asparagus (Asparagus maritimus L.). Typical green color of asparagus {{comes from the}} chlorophyll, pigment which has been degradated during drying process. Th e aim {{of this paper was}} to compare color changes of asparagus dried in laboratory tray drier equipment at diff erent temperatures (40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C) at airfl ow velocity of 2. 75 ms- 1. Color changes were obtained by digital image analysis in RGB color model and by chromameter in L*a*b * color model. Basic elements of image analysis system were low voltage halogen lamps with refl ector, digital camera and programs for image pre-processing and analysis. Mean values of color parameters, color changes and correlation coeffi cients for asparagus were calculated for both color models. An analysis showed <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant infl uence of drying temperature on hue angle and total color change for both chosen color models of dehydrated asparagus. Represented results show that there was no <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant diff erence according to color changes between drying at 50 °C and 60 °C. Calculated correlation coeffi cient between color changes for used models was found to be 0. 9167. Key words image analysis, color, asparagus, dehydratio...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} {{study is}} focused on 50 years of phenological observations (1961 – 2011) of the herbs, shrubs, trees and bird populations and the phenological phases that create a continuous phenological sequence covering the whole spring aspect of the fl oodplain forest ecosystem. Th e phenological phases were observed for 5 herbs, 5 shrubs, 3 trees and 2 bird species. Th e phenological phases were observed as precisely as possible by only one observer during the whole time of observation. All observed plants and bird species showed <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant shift s to the earlier time but the rate of shift ing among {{the parts of the}} fl ood-plain forest ecosystem was diff erent. Th e most progressive shift s were detected for herbs (the rate of shift ing was on average 13. 9 days), followed by shrubs (phenophases advanced by 11. 3 days on average), trees (phenophases advanced by 10. 2 days) and fi nally by bird species (phenophases advanced by 9. 6 days on average). Consequently the length of overlap of the chosen phenological phases was elaborated. Th e rate of shortening or lengthening of the overlap diff ers among all parts of the ecosystem and indicates not only the separation of phenophases but also no <b>statistically</b> <b>signifi</b> cant change in the length of overlap in each part of the ecosystem...|$|E
