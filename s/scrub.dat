40|$|One of {{characteristics}} of the rising cloud storage technology is low-cost and high reliability. A distinct benefit of disk scanning or <b>scrubbing</b> operation is identifying the potential failure sectors as early as possible, thus providing high reliability. Obviously, the higher the <b>scrubbing</b> frequency is, the higher the system reliability is. However, {{it may take a}} few hours for a scanning process to check the whole disk. In other words, the <b>scrubbing</b> process may result in a downtime or a lower system performance. Furthermore, the <b>scrubbing</b> process consumes energy. In order to reduce the impact of disk <b>scrubbing</b> on disk performance and energy consumption, system designers choose to scan the disk in a low frequency, which results in a lower reliability. Thus it is essential to design a good <b>scrubbing</b> scheme in a large scale storage system over long time horizons. In this paper, we present a novel <b>scrubbing</b> scheme to solve the challenge. In this scheme, an optimum <b>scrubbing</b> cycle is decided by keeping a balance between data loss cost, <b>scrubbing</b> cost, and disk failure rate. Our research shows how the data price and the <b>scrubbing</b> cost affect <b>scrubbing</b> frequency, and the <b>scrubbing</b> scheme is applicable for storage with inexpensive data. Our experiment shows that our scheme outperforms routine method 73. 3 % in cost and 40 % in reliability...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} {{to reduce the risk}} of data loss in hard-drives, from redundant disks (e. g., RAID systems) to error coding within individual drives. Disk <b>scrubbing</b> is a background process that reads disks during idle periods to detect irremediable read errors in infrequently accessed sectors. Timely detection of such latent sector errors (LSEs) is important to reduce data loss. In this paper, we take a clean-slate look at disk <b>scrubbing.</b> We present the first formal definition in the literature of a <b>scrubbing</b> algorithm, and translate recent empirical results on LSE distributions into new <b>scrubbing</b> principles. We introduce a new simulation model for LSE incidence in disks that allows us to optimize our proposed <b>scrubbing</b> techniques and demonstrate the significant benefits of intelligent <b>scrubbing</b> to drive reliability. We show how optimal <b>scrubbing</b> strategies depend on disk characteristics (e. g., the BER rate), as well as disk workloads. ...|$|R

The accompanying infrastructure for calcium looping capture technologies are circulating fluidized beds, which have already been implemented on an industrial scale.

40|$|Abstract—Disk <b>scrubbing</b> {{periodically}} {{scans the}} contents of a disk array to detect the presence of irrecoverable read errors and reconstitute {{the contents of}} the lost blocks using the builtin redundancy of the disk array. We address the issue of scheduling <b>scrubbing</b> runs in disk arrays that can tolerate two disk failures without incurring a data loss, and propose to start an urgent <b>scrubbing</b> run of the whole array whenever a disk failure is detected. Used alone or in combination with periodic <b>scrubbing</b> runs, these expedited runs can improve the mean time to data loss of disk arrays over a wide range of disk repair times. As a result, our technique eliminates the need for frequent <b>scrubbing</b> runs and the need to maintain spare disks and personnel on site to replace failed disks within a twentyfour hour interval.
