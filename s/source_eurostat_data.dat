40|$|This report {{offers a}} {{quantitative}} statistical {{approach to the}} Media and Content Industries (MCI). It is based on official data sources and complemented with data from non-official data sources. The current OECD definition of the MCI sector is discussed, as regards {{the limitations of the}} definition itself and of its operationalization. The approach taken in the collection of data, and also problems with data availability, are dealt with. The official <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> consulted include <b>Eurostat</b> <b>data</b> for EU Member States, the OECD and national statistical offices. In addition, the report draws on a number of non-official sources which complement official statistics and contribute to a better analysis and understanding of the economic profile of the MCI sector, particularly when describing new developments not (yet) covered by official statistics. Data from non-official sources to describe some emerging trends regarding the effect of ICT on the MCI are also provided. The study contains an economic profile of the Media and Content Industries for the individual EU Member States and for the US, Japan, India and China. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} origin and {{destination}} of doctoral candidates and post-doctorates in life sciences in Europe, and gives some elements of comparison for the United States, {{with a combination of}} three <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> (<b>Eurostat</b> and NetReAct <b>data</b> for Europe, NSF data for the U. S.). We find that the number of doctoral graduates in life sciences in the EU is higher than in the U. S. (9, 000 against 6, 000) but the proportion of foreigners is lower in the EU (17 % against 29 %). The number of postdoctorates in life sciences is {{more or less the same}} in the EU and the U. S. (19, 000 against 18, 000) but the EU attracts less foreign postdoctorates than the U. S. (25 % against 57 %). 76 % of doctoral graduates in life sciences from EU universities continue to work in the EU after graduation whereas 12 % go to the U. S. or Canada, and another 12 % go to another country. For postdoctorates from EU universities, percentages are more or less the same (76 % stay in the EU, 8 % go to the U. S. or Canada and 16 % to another country). JRC. J. 3 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{competitive}} performance of the EU countries for the prepared swine meat sector during the period 1990 - 2003. This sector has been chosen for the role that traditional products play in most EU countries. To assess competitiveness, the analysis evaluates several trade indices to compare the trends over the last fifteen years: Revealed Comparative Advantage, the Vollrath indices, Net Export Index, and Grübel - Lloyd index. The <b>data</b> <b>source</b> was the <b>Eurostat</b> <b>data</b> base, considering intra - EU export and import data referred to 17 sub- sectors with 8 digit codes. Moreover, cluster analysis has been applied to highlight groups of countries with similar features. Good competitive performance in the prepared swine meat sector is observed in Italy, Spain, Ireland and Austria, all of which were found to be specialised in the sector and export oriented. Germany and France show positive competitive performance, but a high level of intra - industry trade and low specialisation is also revealed. Denmark is characterized by negative dynamics of competitiveness even though there are high exports in the sector; a similar trend is observed in Belgium and the Netherlands. The rest of the countries show weak competitiveness for the analysed sector. Moreover, the type of exported product varies greatly: Italy and Spain export dried or smoked swine meat, whereas Germany and Denmark export mainly sausages and preserved swine meat.
