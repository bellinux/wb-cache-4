A total of 170 HIV-seropositive adults presenting with herpes zoster (confirmed by direct fluorescent-antigen testing and/or viral culture) were enrolled and randomized to receive a 10 -day course of orally administered <b>sorivudine</b> (40 mg once daily plus acyclovir placebos) or acyclovir (800 mg five times daily plus <b>sorivudine</b> placebo). Patients were monitored daily to document the events of cutaneous healing, pain, zoster-related complications, and drug-related adverse events. Patients were reassessed on days 21 and 28 and then once monthly for 1 year. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to the cessation of new vesicle formation. Secondary efficacy endpoints included times to other events of cutaneous healing, resolution of pain, and frequency of dissemination and zoster recurrence. In a multivariate analysis, <b>sorivudine</b> was superior to acyclovir for reducing the times to the cessation of new vesicle formation (relative risk [RR] = 1. 54, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 00 to 2. 36; P = 0. 049) and total lesion crusting (RR = 1. 48, 95 % CI = 1. 07 to 2. 04; P = 0. 017).

This drug has demonstrated antiviral activity against varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex type 1 virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Clinical studies in Japan and subsequently worldwide showed this drug to be a potent agent for treating varicella zoster infections. Although in general well tolerated, a fatal drug interaction with fluoropyrimidine drugs was subsequently observed.

Eight nucleoside analogs (acyclovir, ganciclovir, penciclovir, lobucavir, brivudin, <b>sorivudine,</b> IVDU and ara-T), for which the cytostatic action against mammalian cells expressing the HSV- 1 TK gene has been well documented, were studied for their inhibitory effect on the growth of yeast expressing the viral TK. These nucleoside analogs had little or no inhibitory effect on the growth of yeasts transformed with the empty vector, but inhibited to a significant extent the growth of yeast expressing the viral TK. Use of HSV- 1 TK-expressing yeast allows quick screening in multi-well plate format for compounds with potential use in HSV- 1 TK suicide gene therapy. The method may also be used as a tool to selectively suppress or arrest the growth of one population of yeast out of mixed yeast cell cultures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{thymidine}} kinase (TK) was expressed in mammalian 143 B TK− cells to investigate its substrate specificity. The {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1) TK was similarly expressed for comparison. Both viral TKs conferred a TK+ phenotype on 143 B TK− cells. The nucleoside analog ganciclovir (GCV) {{did not affect the}} growth of 143 B EBV TK or 143 B TK− cells but effectively killed 143 B HSV- 1 TK cells. Furthermore, lysates of 143 B EBV TK cells could not phosphorylate GCV, which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. EBV TK, HSV- 1 TK, and EBV TK N−, a truncated EBV TK missing 243 N-terminal amino acids, were purified as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria, and all had TK activity. In addition, EBV TK was observed to have a thymidylate kinase activity but could not phosphorylate GCV, acyclovir, or 2 ′-deoxycytidine.

30|$|Drug–drug {{interaction}} {{is a condition}} where one drug affects {{the activity of the}} other by increasing or decreasing its activity. These interactions are seen in patients suffering from chronic ailments such as congestive heart failure, rheumatic diseases, hypertension, cancer, and human immunodeficiency which require multiple drug therapy and may result in adverse drug interactions manifested as a loss in drug efficacy (Doucet et al. 2002). Co-administration of ketoconazole and terfenadine was reported to cause potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (Manahan et al. 1990) and an interaction between <b>sorivudine</b> and fluorouracil also resulted in fatal toxicity (Watabe 1996; Sokuda et al. 1997). Cytochrome enzymes {{play a major role in}} metabolizing drugs and the activity of this group of enzymes or a single CYP can determine patient’s response to drug therapy. Therefore, modulation of the activity of CYPs by a given drug is a critical issue for the assessing the safety and efficacy of a drug. Inhibition of CYP can increase systemic exposure leading to severe toxic side effects of the drug or another concomitantly given medication that is metabolized by the respective CYP(s) (Romet et al. 1994; Wandel et al. 1998). Cardiac toxicity caused by co-administering the antihistamine terfenadine with the antifungal ketoconazole or the antibiotic erythromycin is an example whereby inhibition of CYP 3 A 4 results in elevated terfenadine levels, resulting in prolongation of the QTc interval (Venkatakrishna et al. 2000). Similarly, the increased bleeding in patients on warfarin therapy has been attributed to inhibition of its metabolism (Chan 1998).|$|E
40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV) {{is usually}} {{associated}} with mild to moderate illness in immunocompetent patients. However, older age and immune deficiency {{are the most important}} risk factors linked with virus reactivation and severe complications. Treatment of VZV infections is based on nucleoside analogues, such as acyclovir (ACV) and its valyl prodrug valacyclovir, penciclovir (PCV) as its prodrug famciclovir, and bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVDU; brivudin) in some areas. The use of the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet (PFA) is restricted to ACV-resistant (ACV(r)) VZV infections. Since antiviral drug resistance is an emerging problem, we attempt to describe the contributions of specific mutations in the viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene identified following selection with ACV, BVDU and its derivative BVaraU (<b>sorivudine),</b> and the bicyclic pyrimidine nucleoside analogues (BCNAs), a new class of potent and specific anti-VZV agents. The string of 6 Cs at nucleotides 493 to 498 of the VZV TK gene appeared to function as a hot spot for nucleotide insertions or deletions. Novel amino acid substitutions (G 24 R and T 86 A) in VZV TK were also linked to drug resistance. Six mutations were identified in the "palm domain" of VZV DNA polymerase in viruses selected for resistance to PFA, PCV, and the 2 -phophonylmethoxyethyl (PME) purine derivatives. The investigation of the contributions of specific mutations in VZV TK or DNA polymerase to antiviral drug resistance and their impacts on the structures of the viral proteins indicated specific patterns of cross-resistance and highlighted important differences, not only between distinct classes of antivirals, but also between ACV and PCV. status: publishe...|$|E

Drug-resistant virus strains were obtained by serial passage of the OKA strain in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts and the different drug-resistant mutants were subsequently evaluated for their in vitro susceptibility to a broad range of antiviral drugs. Virus strains emerging {{under the pressure of}} ACV, BVDU and BVaraU were cross-resistant to all drugs that depend on the viral TK for activation, but remained susceptible to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i. e. PMEA, PMEDAP and the 3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl derivatives of adenine (HPMPA) and cytosine (HPMPC, cidofovir)) and PFA. In contrast, the virus strains selected under pressure of PCV were resistant to PCV, ACV, PMEA and PFA; but not BVDU, BVaraU, GCV, HPMPC or HPMPA. Similar patterns of drug susceptibility were noted for the virus strains selected under the pressure of PMEA or PFA, pointing to an alteration in the viral DNA polymerase as basis for the resistant phenotype selected by PCV, as well as PMEA and PFA. In contrast, the resistant phenotype selected by ACV as well as BVDU and BVaraU may be attributed primarily to mutations in the viral TK gene.

Different classes of compounds, such as heparin, pentosan polysulfate (PS), dextran sulfate (DS), aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), phosphonoformic acid (PFA), 9 -(2 -phosphonylmethoxyethyl) adenine (PMEA), 2 -amino- 7 -[(1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxy) methyl] purine (S 2242), polyvinylalcohol sulfate (PVAS) and the co-polymer of vinylalcohol sulfate with acrylic acid (PAVAS), acyclovir (ACV), ganciclovir (GCV), penciclovir (PCV), brivudin (BVDU), cidofovir (HPMPC), lobucavir, (R) - 9 -[4 -hydroxy- 2 -(hydroxymethyl) butyl]guanine] (H 2 G), (R) - 9 -(2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine (PMPA) and <b>sorivudine</b> (BVaraU), were evaluated for their anti-HHV- 7 activity in the SupT 1 T cell line and in purified CD 4 + T lymphocytes. Antiviral activity was monitored by inhibition of: (i) CD 4 expression down-regulation; (ii) giant cell formation and (iii) apoptosis induction. In general, PS, DS, PVAS, PAVAS, ATA, PFA, PMEA, S 2242, lobucavir and HPMPC had comparable anti-HHV- 7 activity in the two cell lines, irrespective of the parameters followed to monitor antiviral activity. One of the exceptions was heparin which had an IC 50 of 9. 6 microg/ml in SupT 1 cells and > 250 microg/ml in CD 4 + T lymphocytes. The compounds PCV, GCV, H 2 G and PMPA showed some activity in CD 4 + T lymphocytes, but not in SupT 1 cells. ACV, BVDU and BVaraU did not show activity in either cell system. None of the chemokines tested, such as platelet factor- 4 (PF- 4), eotaxin, stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha(SDF- 1 alpha) and RANTES, had detectable activity against HHV- 7.

The following compounds were included: acyclovir (ACV), brivudine (BVDU), <b>sorivudine</b> (BVaraU), other BVDU congeners such as BTDU, CTDU, CVDC and CVDU, ganciclovir (GCV), FIAC, araT, araA, araC, foscarnet (PFA), phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates HPMPC, cHPMPC, HPMPA, cHPMPA, HPMPc 3 A, PMEA and PMEDAP, the N 7 -isomeric acyclic nucleoside analogue N 7 AP, penciclovir (PCV), compounds 882 C 87 and H 2 G and two oxetanocin derivatives OXT-A and OXT-G. Fourteen of the 16 clinical isolates displayed the following order of decreasing selectivity against VZV: BVaraU > BVDU > CVDU ∼ CVDC > H 2 G > N 7 AP } CTDU ∼ BTDU ∼ OXT-G ∼ 882 C 87 > ACV > FIAC ∼ araT > HPMPC ∼ cHPMPC ∼ HPMPA ∼ HPMPc 3 A ∼ cHPMPA > PCV ∼ GCV ∼ OXT-A > PMEDAP ∼ PMEA > PFA ∼ PAA ∼ araA > araC. Two VZV strains (isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an AIDS patient) that were shown to have a truncated TK were clearly resistant to all the compounds that need the viral TK for their phosphorylation, while sensitivity to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, PFA, PAA, OXT-A and araA, remained unchanged. A slight (5 - and 10 -fold) increase was noted in the 50 % inhibitory concentration of N 7 AP and OXT-G, respectively, for the TK- VZV strains as compared to the TK+ VZV strains. Ganciclovir and FIAC also showed a marked decrease in their activity against these two strains, but this was not as pronounced as for the other viral TK-dependent drugs. From our results, it appears that although acyclic nucleoside phosphonates may not have as favourable a therapeutic index as drugs requiring the viral TK, they should be considered for the treatment of TK- VZV life-threatening infections that are resistant to the viral TK-dependent drugs © 1995 Friedr.

PBMCs isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were stimulated by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (10 microg/ml) for 72 h. Stimulated PBMCs (3 x 10 (6) cells/plate) were then incubated with [3 H]d 4 T (0. 65 microCi; 3 microM) and either acyclovir, dapsone, ddC, ddI, fluconazole, foscarnet, ganciclovir, itraconazole, lobucavir, ranitidine, ribavirin, rifampin, <b>sorivudine,</b> sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, lamivudine (3 TC), zidovudine, or thymidine (30 and 300 microM) for 24 h. Doxorubicin and drugs showing some evidence of inhibition were also studied at 0. 3 and 3 microM. Cells were extracted overnight with 60 % methanol prior to analysis by radiometric high-performance liquid chromatography. Additional data for nine of the drugs were obtained by incubation with [3 H]d 4 T in U 937 cells for 24 h. The effect of d 4 T (0. 2 to 20 microM) on zidovudine (0. 65 microCi; 0. 018 microCi) phosphorylation was also studied. Zidovudine significantly reduced d 4 T total phosphates in PBMCs and U 937 cells (in PBMCs to 33 % [P < 0. 001] and 17 % [P < 0. 001] of that in control cells at 3 and 30 microM, respectively). A small reduction in zidovudine phosphorylation was seen with d 4 T but only at d 4 T:zidovudine ratios of 100 and 1, 000. Of the other compounds screened, only thymidine, ribavirin, and doxorubicin produced inhibition of d 4 T phosphorylation in both PBMCs and U 937 cells. However, doxorubicin was cytotoxic at 3 microM. The decrease in d 4 T phosphorylation in the presence of ribavirin is consistent with previous findings with zidovudine. Although ddC significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of d 4 T in PBMCs, this was not seen in U 937 cells, and it is probable that the findings in PBMCs are related to mitochondrial toxicity [based on 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay].

40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV), {{a member}} of the {{herpesvirus}} family, is responsible for both primary (varicella, chickenpox) as well as reactivation (zoster, shingles) infections. In immunocompetent patients, the course of varicella is generally benign. For varicella zoster, post-herpetic neuralgia is the most common complication. In immunocompromised patients (particularly those with AIDS), transplant recipients and cancer patients, VZV infections can be life-threatening. For these patients and also for immunocompetent patients at risk such as pregnant women or premature infants, the current treatment of choice is based on either intravenous or oral aciclovir (acyclovir). The low oral bioavailability of aciclovir, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, have stimulated efforts towards the development of new compounds for the treatment of individuals with VZV infections. Among these new compounds, penciclovir, its oral prodrug form famciclovir and the oral pro-drug form of aciclovir (valaciclovir), rank among the most promising. As with aciclovir itself, all of these drugs are dependent on the virus-encoded thymidine kinase (TK) for their intracellular activation (phosphorylation), and, upon conversion to their triphosphate form, they act as inhibitors/alternative substrate of the viral DNA polymerase. Therefore, cross-resistance to these drugs may be expected for those virus mutants that are TK-deficient and thus resistant to aciclovir. Other classes of nucleoside analogues dependent for their phosphorylation on the viral TK that have been pursued for the treatment of VZV infections include <b>sorivudine,</b> brivudine, fialuridine, fiacitabine and netivudine. Among oxetanocins, which are partially dependent on viral TK, lobucavir is now under clinical evaluation. Foscarnet, which does not require any previous metabolism to interact with the viral DNA polymerase, is used in the clinic when TK-deficient VZV mutants emerge during aciclovir treatment. TK-deficient mutants are also sensitive to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i. e. [s]- 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl]cytosine; HPMPC); these agents do not depend on the virus-encoded TK for their phosphorylation but depend on cellular enzymes for conversion to their diphosphoryl derivatives which then inhibit viral DNA synthesis. Vaccination for VZV has now come of age. It is recommended for healthy children, patients with leukaemia, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or those with chronic diseases. The protection induced by the vaccine seems, to some extent, to include zoster and associated neuralgia. Passive immuniatin based on specific immunoglobulins does not effectively prevent VZV infection and is therefore restricted to high risk individuals (i. e. immunocompromised children and pregnant women). status: publishe...|$|E
