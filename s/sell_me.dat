Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to <b>sell</b> <b>me,</b> but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team."

[...] On 19 January, Silvio Berlusconi announced that Manchester City had officially ended their bid after a discussion between the clubs, and that Kaká would remain with Milan. Milan supporters had protested outside the club headquarters earlier that evening, and later chanted outside Kaká's home, where he saluted them by flashing his jersey outside a window. Kaká finished his final season with Milan by scoring 16 goals, helping Milan finish third in Serie A, and once again being elected as a finalist for the FIFA World Player of the Year Award, finishing fourth in voting for the second-straight year. He was also nominated for the Ballon D'Or award, finishing in sixth place, and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career.|$|E

He joined Barcelona just weeks later, two years before the Spanish {{dictator}} Francisco Franco died, maintaining to the European press corps en route that he chose Barcelona over rivals Real Madrid because he could never join a club [...] "associated with Franco". As he recalled in a documentary on TV3 channel, [...] "I remember my move to Spain was quite controversial. (...) The president of Ajax wanted to <b>sell</b> <b>me</b> to Real Madrid, (...) Barcelona weren't at the same level as Madrid football wise, but it was a challenge to play for a Catalan club. Barcelona was more than a club." [...] At the end of the 1982–83 season, Ajax decided not to offer Cruyff a new contract. This angered Cruyff and he responded by signing for Ajax's archrivals Feyenoord. Cruyff's season at Feyenoord was a successful one in which the club won the Eredivisie {{for the first time in}} a decade, part of a league and KNVB Cup double.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} the Israelites' encounter with Sihon in [...] and [...] Noting {{the report of}} [...] that [...] "Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying: ‘Let me pass through your land,'" [...] the Midrash taught that the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon {{just as they had}} to Edom to inform the Edomites that the Israelites would not cause Edom any damage. Noting the report of [...] that the Israelites offered Sihon, [...] "You shall <b>sell</b> <b>me</b> food for money [...] [...] [...] and give me water for money," [...] the Midrash noted that water is generally given away for free, but the Israelites offered to pay for it. The Midrash noted that in [...] the Israelites offered, [...] "We will go by the king's highway," [...] but in [...] the Israelites admitted that they would go [...] "until [...] shall pass over the Jordan," [...] thus admitting {{that they were going to}} conquer Canaan. The Midrash compared the matter to a watchman who received wages to watch a vineyard, and to whom a visitor came and asked the watchman to go away so that the visitor could cut off the grapes from the vineyard. The watchman replied that the sole reason that the watchman stood guard was because of the visitor. The Midrash explained that the same was true of Sihon, as all the kings of Canaan paid Sihon money from their taxes, since Sihon appointed them as kings. The Midrash interpreted [...] which says, [...] "Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan," [...] to teach that Sihon and Og were the equal of all the other kings of Canaan. So the Israelites asked Sihon to let them pass through Sihon's land to conquer the kings of Canaan, and Sihon replied that the sole reason that he was there was to protect the kings of Canaan from the Israelites. Interpreting the words of [...] "and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together," [...] the Midrash taught that God brought this about designedly so as to deliver Sihon into the Israelites' hands without trouble. The Midrash {{interpreted the}} words of [...] "Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon," [...] to say that if Heshbon had been full of mosquitoes, no person could have conquered it, and if Sihon had been living in a plain, no person could have prevailed over him. The Midrash taught that Sihon thus would have been invincible, as he was powerful and dwelt in a fortified city. Interpreting the words, [...] "Who dwelt at Heshbon," [...] the Midrash taught that had Sihon and his armies remained in different towns, the Israelites would have worn themselves out conquering them all. But God assembled them in one place to deliver them into the Israelites' hands without trouble. In the same vein, in [...] God said, [...] "Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon [...] [...] [...] before you," [...] and [...] says, [...] "Sihon gathered all his people together," [...] and [...] reports, [...] "And Israel took all these cities." ...|$|E
