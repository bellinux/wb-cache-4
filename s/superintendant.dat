The study involved 62 <b>superintendants</b> who were formerly principals of secondary schools, high schools, and vocational schools in Bandung, West Java.

40|$|Decommissioned {{urban schools}} in the United States have become a problem despite well-intentioned efforts of federal, state and local {{authorities}} to reconstruct them. The challenge to school districts, <b>superintendants,</b> local and state authorities is threefold – one arising from the education policy and declining student enrollment. The second challenge is due to inadequate funds for maintenance and renovation of existing facilities. The third from the architectural point of view stemming from an architectural and technological modernity to avoid {{not so much the}} possibility of urban sprawl but possible clash of community interests. Urban Sprawl is defined as “The unplanned, uncontrolled spreading of urban development into areas adjoining the edge of a city” (The American, 2009). Thus the feasibility of reconstructing decommissioned urban schools and the subsequent challenge to the architect are associated with avoiding urban sprawl, spatial mismatch, technological modernity, and to enhance community interest and concerns. The literature will review three case studies, (Boston, Georgia 2 ̆ 6 Nevada, and Buffalo, NY). In 1997,Bostonfaced challenges in decreasing student enrollment, decommissioned urban schools, building abandonment, lack of public housing and related land use and sought creative alternatives. The second in Georgia and Nevada were compelled toward privatization due to unavailability of funds to abandon schools that are increasingly being supplanted by a system of accepting schools. The third, Buffalo Public School, (NY) No. 60 was identified by private investors as a prime candidate to create new urban senior housing. The directed project will provide the results of a literature review, case study development, conclusions and recommendations. The project identified areas of interest in articulating a strategic framework of analysis for the reconstruction of decommissioned urban {{schools in the}} United States utilizing the Buffalo NY School model...|$|R

50|$|Smith {{was born}} in Jericho, now Bainbridge, Chenango County, New York, on January 6, 1799, to Jedediah, 1st and Sally Strong, both of whom descended from {{families}} that came to New England during the Puritan emigration. Smith's father was a New Hampshire native. Smith received an adequate English instruction, learned some Latin, and was taught how to write decently. Around 1810, Smith's father, who owned a general store, {{was caught up in}} a legal issue involving counterfeit currency, after which the elder Smith moved his family west to Erie County, Pennsylvania. At the age of 13, Smith worked as a clerk on a Lake Erie freighter, where he learned business practices and probably met traders returning from the far west to Montreal. This work gave Smith an ambition for adventurous wilderness trade. According to Dale L. Morgan, Smith's love of nature and adventure came from his mentor, Dr. Titus G. V. Simons, a pioneer physician who was on close terms with the Smith family. Morgan speculated that Simons gave the young Smith a copy of Meriwether Lewis's and William Clark's 1814 book of their 1804-1806 expedition to the Pacific, and, according to legend, Smith carried this journal on all of his travels, throughout the American West. Smith would provide Clark, who had become <b>Superintendant</b> of Indian Affairs, much information from his own expeditions into the West. In 1817, the Smith family moved westward again, to Ohio, and settled in Green Township, or what is present-day Ashland County.|$|E

While large families were not uncommon it was unusual for an aristocratic family to have so many legitimate children. In June 1760 Horace Walpole noted Sir Cecil’s [...] "endless hoard of beautiful daughters". As a result, on several occasions over the years he lobbied the Duke of Newcastle for various sinecures and government positions. In 1748 he asked for [...] "the reversion of the controllership of army accounts, or failing that, a place in the revenue commission". He explained [...] "the reason, my Lord, for my thus importuning you is a very cogent one, a numerous family, scarce in the power of frugality to support."On 2 Oct. 1750 he wrote again: The last time I had the honour to be with your Grace ... you gave me leave to trouble you with a letter, in case an employment should become vacant ... I then mentioned ... superintendent of the royal brass foundries at Woolwich ... Tis a sinecure, and the salary £500 a year, and no more." [...] In 1751 Bishopp received his appointment, and later was appointed <b>Superintendant</b> of H.M.'s Founderies in August 1751.

The federal government's Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment Department constructed the first buildings in 1918. Established in 1919 for returning World War I veterans who suffered from tuberculosis (TB), the Central Alberta Sanatorium as it was then called, was typical of its era, [...] "isolated, treed and divided into many separate buildings." [...] It was [...] "downstream from the old Alberta Ice Company warehouse" [...] (now the Shriner's storage area for antiques). In 1916 Dr. A. H. Baker served on a medical advisory committee investigating the prevalence of TB among Canadian indigenous populations and in 1917, {{as a member of the}} Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps, he served in China. In 1918, following a diagnosis of TB he was discharged—though he never required hospitalization.

When Baker retired in 1950 after thirty years of service, the sanitorium was renamed the Baker Memorial Sanatorium in his honour. The site was nearest what would become the village of Bowness and eventually many Bowness villagers worked at the Sanitorium.
