25|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{underground}} mines re-worked lodes {{that had already been}} mined from the surface. Because of the great quantity of underground water, it was necessary to dig horizontal adits into the hillsides to de-water the mines. Dartmoor's topography, cut with deep valleys, helped there and in many cases it was possible to dig to a reasonable depth without the need to pump out water. These adits connected with shafts that were either sunk vertically downwards or followed the line of the steeply dipping lode. Working the lode then took place by <b>stoping</b> from the horizontal levels in the usual manner.|$|E

2500|$|The stope, {{which is}} the {{workshop}} of the mine, is the excavation from which the ore is extracted. Two methods of stope mining are commonly used. In the [...] "cut and fill" [...] or open <b>stoping</b> method, the space remaining following removal of ore after blasting is filled with waste rock and cement. In the [...] "shrinkage" [...] method, only sufficient broken ore is removed via the chutes below to allow miners working {{from the top of}} the pile to drill and blast the next layer to be broken off, eventually leaving a large hole. Another method, known as room and pillar, is used for thinner, flatter ore bodies. In this method the ore body is first divided into blocks by intersecting drives, removing ore while so doing, and then systematically removing the blocks, leaving enough ore for roof support.|$|E

40|$|Selective <b>stopping</b> {{paradigms}} address selectivity in controlled behavior, {{as subjects}} <b>stop</b> certain responses or responses to certain stimuli. The literature has discussed 2 strategies for selective <b>stopping.</b> First, selective <b>stopping</b> may prolong the <b>stop</b> process {{by adding a}} discrimination stage (Independent Discrim-inate then <b>Stop).</b> Second, selective <b>stopping</b> may involve <b>stopping</b> nonselectively and then restarting the response if the signal is an ignore signal (<b>Stop</b> then Discriminate). We discovered {{a variant of the}} first strategy that occurred often in our experiments and previously published experiments: The requirement to discriminate <b>stop</b> and ignore signals may interact with the go process, invalidating the independent race model (Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop).</b> Our experiments focused on stimulus selective <b>stopping,</b> in which subjects <b>stop</b> to one signal and ignore another. When <b>stop</b> and ignore signals were equally likely, some subjects used the <b>Stop</b> then Discriminate strategy and others used the Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy. When <b>stop</b> signals were more frequent than ignore signals, most subjects used the <b>Stop</b> then Discriminate strategy; when ignore signals were more frequent than <b>stop</b> signals, most subjects used the Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy. The commonly accepted Independent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy was seldom implemented. Selective <b>stopping</b> was either not selective (<b>Stop</b> then Discrim-inate), or interacted with going (Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop).</b> Implications for the cognitive science, lifespan development, clinical science, and neuroscience of selective <b>stopping</b> are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The 18th-century mine {{workings}} began from adits {{driven into the}} sloping hillside {{along the line of}} the vein. These were known as the Top Level, Middle Level and Gilgower's Level. As each level was extended further into the hill, ore was obtained by cutting rises above the levels, or sumps below them. The ore was usually removed by overhead <b>stoping</b> (called [...] "roofing" [...] locally), that is, by cutting away the roof of a level. Wooden working platforms were built above the level, supported on heavy beams wedged between {{the two sides of the}} vein. The ore was dropped down from the stopes to the level below, filled into wooden wheelbarrows and wheeled out. In places the workings could be as much as [...] wide where the vein had split into two distinct branches, or fissures to the east had been mineralised. These workings were left open with no support and the large holes on the hillside today show where they eventually collapsed.|$|E

60|$|The Bergwerke {{consist of}} four tunnels {{driven into the}} lower part of the western hill-side, further down than the bottom of the {{abandoned}} native workings. They are eccentrically disposed in curves and other queer figures. All abut upon galleries running in sections along the lode-line, and intended ultimately to connect. The total length may be a thousand feet. Being cut in the gneiss, they require no timbering; but the floors are little raised above the level of the rivulet, and water percolates through roofs and walls. The latest tunnel has been driven past the new gallery, and has struck a second lode; this has never been worked by the natives, and <b>stoping</b> to above the springs may be found advisable. Ventilation is managed by means of the old abandoned native shafts. A very large quantity of ore is brought to bank. I found it hard to form an estimate, because it was in scattered heaps overgrown with vegetation; but I should not be surprised if it amounted to 5,000 tons. This means that want of proper machinery has resulted in a dead capital of from 20,000l. to 30,000l.|$|E

40|$|Trajectory <b>stops</b> imply {{important}} semantic information, and {{the extraction}} of trajectory <b>stops</b> is the premise to carry out advanced Stop/Move analysis. This paper, {{based on the idea}} of kernel density, firstly introduces the concept of <b>stop</b> index, which is derived by cumulating spatio-temporal contribution of neighboring points, and further designs <b>stop</b> index graph to intuitively visualize the evolution of spatio-clustering degree during a trajectory. Importantly, <b>stops</b> index and its graph are related to spatial scale through neighboring radius, which then can be exploited to analyze trajectory <b>stops</b> under multiple scales. In addition, this paper introduces <b>stop</b> sequence rooted from <b>stop</b> index, and proposes an algorithm for the automatic extraction of trajectory <b>stops</b> by progressively merging <b>stop</b> sequences. According to the algorithm, a <b>stop</b> under strong GPS signal exactly corresponds to a <b>stop</b> sequence, while a <b>stop</b> under weak GPS signal could be derived by merging multiple <b>stop</b> sequences. Experiments based on own-acquired and GeoLife trajectories show that the algorithm has achieves the balance between the completeness and accuracy of <b>stop</b> extraction, and could effectively discover and extract complex and diverse trajectory <b>stops.</b> Even facing trajectories with serious drift noises, the algorithm still achieves a high rate of accuracy on <b>stop</b> extraction...|$|R
