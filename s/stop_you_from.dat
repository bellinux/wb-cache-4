He was also a guest on the British video gaming radio show One Life Left. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called the game a [...] "perversely addictive thing", and Complexs Jacob Moore said it is [...] "as basic as it can get, but that won't <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> wasting hours of your day."

500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> being dazzled by the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E

In addition, the song was later described as a [...] "New Zealanders version of" [...] Kelis's [...] "Milkshake." [...] Bret briefly appears as The Prince of Parties, {{a reference to a}} song from the season one episode [...] "New Fans." [...] Dave sings his portion of the rap in a style very similar to the opening theme of the TV series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The second song {{featured in the}} episode is [...] "You Don't Have to Be a Prostitute." [...] In an interview with The A.V. Club, Jemaine explained that the song was inspired by The Police's hit single [...] "Roxanne". However, the duo wished to make a [...] "judgmental" [...] version that [...] "makes a lot of assumptions about the profession. Singing a song about prostitution, like 'I'll <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> being a prostitute with this song'".|$|E

Dr. Claire Rusbridge expressed her incredulity: [...] "If you took a stick and you beat a dog to create this pain that you could get from Syringomyelia, you'd be prosecuted, but there's nothing to <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> breeding a dog that can be painful." ...|$|E

5000|$|SFBT {{is famous}} for {{inviting}} clients to get very specific about such subjective measuring and scaling; for example, by asking questions that invite clients to establish their own polarity; and then, measure their progress—forwards and backwards—towards the more desirable pole.

What is [...] "the best things could ever possibly be?" [...] (ten). The client is asked to rate their current position on their own scale. Questions are used to elicit useful details of behavior to measure by, resources and support (e.g. [...] "what's <b>stopping</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> slipping one point lower down the scale?"). Clients are then invited to calibrate their own progress precisely (e.g. [...] "on a day when you are one point higher on the scale, what tells you this is a 'one point higher' day?"). Similarly preferred futures can be discussed {{in light of the}} client's own scale (e.g. [...] "where on the scale would be good enough?
