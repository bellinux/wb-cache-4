40|$|A low- speed wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of canopy construction methods, design details, and canopy slots on the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of all-flexible parawings. Construction details such as type of nonporous canopy fabric, glued or sewed <b>seams,</b> <b>tape</b> reinforcement, or cloth-weave orientation had little effect on maximum lift-drag ratios and resultant-force coefficients. The maximum lift-drag ratios varied from 2. 2 to 2. 5 for the various single-keel unslotted parawings, and from 2. 2 to 2. 4 for the slotted canopy parawings. Incremental reductions in the lengths of all the suspension lines caused corresponding reductions in the resultantforce coefficients and maximum lift-drag ratios. The available range for modulation of resultant-force coefficient and lift-drag ratio by shortening the control lines was very limited. Includes bibliographical references (p. 18).

40|$|In {{this paper}} was exposed some {{research}} institute from important specialists in textile domain, concerning an unconventional assembly method – ultrasonic weld. An alternative to the classic sewing assembly, with thread and needles is ultrasonic seaming. In ultrasonic welding, there are no connective bolts, nails, soldering materials, or adhesives necessary to bind the materials together. Ultrasonic is defined as acoustic frequencies above the range audible to the human ear. Ultrasonic frequencies are administered to the fabric from the sonotrode of bonding machine. The high frequency and powerful energy produced, when is release in one special environment, the ultrasound heating this environment. The ability to ultrasonic weld textiles and films depend on their thermoplastic contents and the desired end results. The paper defines the weld ability of more common textiles and films. The welding refers to all types of bonding and sealing, as in point bonding of fabric, or continuous sealing of film. With the whole environment gone highly technical and specialized, industrial fabrics are used widely today for making many products such as inflatable boats, sewn technical clothing, tents, awnings, truck tarpaulins, filter bags, airships, bag & luggage, inflatable toys, advertising banners etc. Sewing, <b>seam</b> <b>taping,</b> gluing etc. have gone obsolete for sealing such fabrics {{that have to be}} ultra safe and efficient. This welding technology may be an alternative method of manufacturing cloth and is gently with the environment because there are produced less wastes...|$|R
50|$|After {{three years}} {{experience}} — including packing at least 200 reserves, 100 each {{of two different}} types — Senior Riggers can test for the Master Rigger rating which allows them to do most major repairs. There is no written test for Master Riggers, but the oral exam is far more extensive, including identifying dozens of material samples. The Master practical exam starts with assembling and adjusting a sewing machine, then doing a major canopy repair that includes a <b>seam,</b> reinforcing <b>tape</b> and line attachment. Master candidates are usually asked to demonstrate a harness repair also.FAA riggers are tested by Parachute Rigger Examiners (government employees) or Designated Parachute Rigger Examiners (independent civilians, usually highly-experienced Master Riggers).U.S. military riggers only need a letter from their commanding officer and the written test to earn FAA rigger ratings.|$|R

50|$|Unlike a {{conventional}} waterproof fabric, Analogy would fail a hydrostatic head test (if used {{to seal the}} bottom of a tube containing water, only a very short column could be supported). However, like fur, Analogy causes water to flow away from the body of the wearer and with water typically moving out faster than it arrives the garment is effectively waterproof from the wearer's point of view. Without a formal seal required, Analogy does not need the <b>taped</b> <b>seams</b> required by e.g. Gore-Tex rain-wear, and punctures in the outer layer do not compromise the action of the twin-component design.|$|R
5000|$|Some garments, and tents, are {{designed}} to give greater or lesser protection against rain. For urban use raincoats and jackets are used; for outdoor activities in rough weather there is a range of hiking apparel. Typical descriptions are [...] "showerproof", [...] "water resistant", and [...] "waterproof". These terms are not precisely defined. A showerproof garment will usually be treated with a water-resisting coating, but is not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. This is suitable for protection against light rain, but after a short time water will penetrate. A water-resistant garment is similar, perhaps slightly more resistant to water but also not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. A garment described as waterproof will have a water-repellent coating, with the <b>seams</b> also <b>taped</b> to prevent water ingress there. Better waterproof garments have a membrane lining designed to keep water out but allow trapped moisture to escape ("breathability")—a totally waterproof garment would retain body sweat and become clammy. Waterproof garments specify their hydrostatic rating, ranging from 1,500 for light rain, to 20,000 for heavy rain.|$|R
30|$|Some {{of their}} more notable {{findings}} was that floor patterns caused by ignitable liquids may be minimal because they can easily be destroyed, that the commonly reported clean burn damage {{may be caused by}} water spray from fire suppression hoselines and that areas of clean burn were associated with the inflow of air due to local ventilation flows. Mass loss of the furniture items was measured {{at the end of each}} test and was showed to relate well to the area of origin. Areas along the wall surfaces that were white in color directly adjacent to areas of significant soot deposition were found within this series of tests to be attributed to the oxidation of the soot from the surface (i.e. clean burn) and with wash from the hoseline for suppression. Also, the study illustrated that drywall <b>seams,</b> if no <b>tape</b> and mud was applied, would present areas of clean burn damage during ventilation-controlled conditions (Mealy et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|In high {{performance}} waterproof clothing, <b>seam</b> <b>tape</b> and welds fail before {{other parts of}} the garment. This paper examines a method of sealing seams in which the needle waterproofs the holes it creates by sealing them with a film of a thickness governed by the Landau-Levich law. The equation governing Landau-Levich behavior is combined with equations describing hole geometry to develop a phase space describing the fluidic and geometric properties necessary to seal a hole. A manual proof of concept test is performed which demonstrates that the basic method works. The needle speed of a standard sewing machine is then measured as is the size of the hole made by a standard sewing machine needle. These values are then used to calculate the viscosity of a fluid that will satisfy the conditions described by the phase space. An adhesive with the calculated viscosity is made and is used on a test bed to seal holes made by a needle. Each individual hole is sealed and further tests show that the seals are waterproof. Both the proof of concept and test bed experiments confirm the theory and it is concluded that needle speed, film length, and viscosity are the variables that can be controlled to tune hole sealing. by Cole Houston.

50|$|The Diana is a {{very simply}} {{constructed}} box camera with a mechanical film advance, spring-loaded shutter, and a primitive plastic viewfinder. It is constructed primarily of low-quality phenolic plastics of the type commonly found in toys imported from Asia during the 1960s. Because of wide variances in production quality, combined with a poorly designed camera body latching mechanism, Diana cameras are predisposed to light leaks onto the exposed film. If not desired, such leaks can be temporarily remedied by sealing the <b>seams</b> with light-proof <b>tape</b> after loading the film. The design of the Diana incorporates a crude lens that produces an image circle which only marginally covers the diagonal of a film frame. This marginal coverage field produces images with often pronounced vignetting. The poor quality of the plastic meniscus lens results in generally low contrast and resolution, odd color rendition, chromatic aberration, and blurred images. Additionally, the film spool may become loose or out of place when winding the film {{on to the next}} frame. Finally, the crude advance and shutter mechanism can result in images that are not properly centered or exposed.|$|R
