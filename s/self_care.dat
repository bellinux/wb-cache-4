5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing <b>self</b> <b>care,</b> and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to <b>self</b> <b>care</b> such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E
40|$|Received 7 Dec, 2008; Accepted 22 Apr, 2009) AbstractBackground and purpose: Diabetes type 1 is {{a chronic}} disease in {{children}} during their childhood, {{which may have}} unfavorable effects on children, family and society. By enhancing self- care in children having diabetes type 1, we can reduce these effects. Self- care in children also can be affected by factors such as family reaction. The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine the relationship between self-care in diabetic children and their family’s reaction. Materials and methods: This research is a non- experimental and correlative study which determines and specifies the relationship between diabetic self- care in children, who are affected by diabetes and their family’s reaction. 133 {{children between the ages of}} seven to fourteen suffering from diabetes type 1 were chosen with above continuous method for two months from selected centers. Collecting information, observation and questionnaire forms were used. Results: The results obtained from this study, showed there is a meaningful relationship between child's self- care and reaction of their family (p= 0. 000). Variants such as age, sex, rank of birth and length of disease period are not considered as an interfering element in relation between <b>self</b> <b>caring</b> and family reaction. Conclusion: The results from this research reveal that the <b>self</b> <b>caring</b> of children in an average level has a direct influence and relationship with family reaction and at the same time, the direct and strong correlation with the diabetic child’s knowledge regarding their functions and performances. We suggest that educational programs should be provided for these children and their families, in order to promote <b>self</b> <b>caring</b> of children and their family’s reaction. We also propose conducting similar research, by using case- control method, to identify other factors in this regard. J Mazand Univ Med Sci 2009; 19 (69) : 38 - 44 (Persian...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Author Johanna Rahl and Marie Johansson. Title Helsingborg-Ängelholm, a {{comparison}} of the work of the municipalities regarding <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> activities for employed teachers. Content Today you pay more and more attention to <b>self</b> generated health <b>care.</b> Political decisions affect the social development and thereby also conditions for people to feel healthy. As the municipalities are working with its inhabitants they {{are an important part of}} the <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> activities. The most part of our life we spend in school or at work and this is the reason why these places are the most suitable to create healthy people. From these thoughts we created the following aim of the study: “The aim of this study is to investigate what kind of work regarding <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> that is performed by the municipalities of Helsingborg and Ängelholm towards the employed teachers and how the teachers apprehend this work. Beside we will compare the municipalities and the selected schools and look for differences and similarities. Using actual knowledge about <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> we will support with thoughts how to develop the work for better <b>self</b> generated health <b>care.</b> ” To answer the aim we have done 20 interviews of teachers, headmasters, responsible for human resources in the municipality, project leader for “Hälsovägen” as well as responsible for Child and Youth committee, all working within Helsingborg and Ängelholm municipalities. Our result shows that there is an ongoing work regarding <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> in both municipalities, even though it is different. In Ängelhom there is a policy regarding <b>self</b> generated health <b>care,</b> including 1000 SEK as a subsidy for these kinds of activities, among a lot of other things for the employees. The municipality also arrange special health congresses and other projects regarding <b>self</b> generated health <b>care.</b> In Helsingborg the subsidy is 2000 SEK a year, together with a health care card with discounts. The municipality in Helsingborg also has a well developed team work with “Hälsoborgen”, the towns` answer to the company’s health care. This is missing in the municipality of Ängelholm, who instead has progressed a lot more regarding the <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> activities for the employed teachers. The most used part is the subsidy of the <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> activities; however this part must be paid by the schools themselves. This will lead to the schools reducing both the number of employees as well as materials to the pupils. Theories regarding <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> and health focus on the importance to affect people physical, psychological and social. The municipalities we have compared are still working more on the physical part. It is not enough to have a good physique if you don’t feel good both psychologically and socially. This is something to think about for both of the municipalities, when they evaluate their <b>self</b> generated health <b>care</b> work. Helsingborg and Ängelholm need to enlarge their views concerning <b>self</b> generated health <b>care,</b> through learning from each other. Key words Helsingborg municipality, Ängelholm municipality, employed teachers, ill-health, health and <b>self</b> generated health <b>care...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Considering chronic {{nature of}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS), {{it is necessary}} to utilize appropriate methods in order to improve coping in MS patients. So, this study was conducted on patients with MS supported by the Iranian MS Society in 2001 for determining the effect of <b>self</b> - <b>care</b> program on their Applying coping mechanism. Materials & Methods : In this semi - experimental study 34 patients with MS who were not in the acute phase of disease were selected. The data was collected via personal questionnaires, problem list, jalowice standard coping scale and self- report check lists. The validity of jalowice coping scale was approved in Iran and the Reability of questionaires was then approved using a pilot study on the first 10 samples revealing a high correlation coefficient (r= 0. 87). <b>self</b> - <b>care</b> program (<b>self</b> – <b>care</b> for muscular spasm, fatigue, constipation and amnesia and…) was educated, then <b>self</b> - <b>care</b> program was performed for one month period and the data was analyzed using paired t- test, wilcoxon, croscal - wallis and manwithney tests. Results : Application of <b>self</b> - <b>care</b> program reduced applying affective - focused coping and reduced some symptoms such as muscular spasm, fatigue, constipation and amnesia in MS patients. The,mean valve of affective - focused coping reduced from 81 / 61 before performing the program to 64 after the program (p< 0. 05) Conclusion : Self-care program can be an effective method for reducing applying affective - focused coping of MS patients...|$|R

25|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{wellness}} industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of fitness influencers and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these bloggers and companies have received numerous criticism because the “drive for “wellness” and “clean eating” has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation”. Likewise, reports have also shown that the messages delivered by “fitspiration” websites are sometimes identical to the “thinspiration” or pro-anorexia types. This is evident through “language inducing guilt about weight or the body, and promoted dieting”. Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of <b>self</b> <b>care</b> could potentially cause “increasingly disordered eating” , whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as Orthorexia; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.|$|E
500|$|Although many attend regular {{education}} classes, some children with AS may utilize {{special education services}} because of their social and behavioral difficulties. Adolescents with AS may exhibit ongoing difficulty with <b>self</b> <b>care</b> or organization, and disturbances in social and romantic relationships. Despite high cognitive potential, most young adults with AS remain at home, yet some do marry and work independently. The [...] "different-ness" [...] adolescents experience can be traumatic. Anxiety may stem from preoccupation over possible violations of routines and rituals, from being placed in a situation without a clear schedule or expectations, or from concern with failing in social encounters; the resulting stress may manifest as inattention, withdrawal, reliance on obsessions, hyperactivity, or aggressive or oppositional behavior. Depression is often the result of chronic frustration from repeated failure to engage others socially, and mood disorders requiring treatment may develop. Clinical experience suggests the rate of suicide may be higher among those with AS, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by systematic empirical studies.|$|E
2500|$|One {{criticism}} of Noddings' ethic of care, {{in regards to}} education, is that it advocates little importance to caring for oneself, except {{as a means to}} provide further care for others.

40|$|Background and ObjectivesDiabetic {{patients}} {{play the}} main {{role in the}} management of their disease. Adequate knowledge of this disease state and <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> will improve the health of these patients. Some studies have indicated a high prevalence of diabetes complication are {{due to the lack of}} knowledge of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> and practice in diabetic patient group. The objective of this study is to measure the knowledge level of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> and practice in order to evaluate their effects on improvement of diabetic patients' health in the city of Qom, Iran. MethodsIn this cross sectional study 1004 patients with diabetes participated (During year 2006). Data were collected from patients of General Hospital metabolism and endocrine research center. An interviewing method was used to asses the demographics data, history of disease, and knowledge of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> in these patients. Data were analyzed using a descriptive statistic, chi-square, and Pearson correlation coefficient, and SPSS software. ResultsOut of 1004 observed case, 154 patients were with Diabetes type I and 850 patients with Diabetes type II. The knowledge of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> and practice level of with both types of diabetes were determined to be mostly at an intermediate level. In type I diabetic patients there was a significant relation between knowledge level of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> and gender of the patients (P= 0. 01). Also, there was a significant correlation between practice and age (P= 0. 03 (, and economical status (P= 0. 06) of the patients. In type II diabetic patients there was a significant relation between knowledge level of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> and educational level (P= 0. 00 (, and economical status (P= 0. 01) of the patients. The practice level of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> was significantly related to economical status (p= 0. 03) in this group of patients. ConclusionThese results indicate that an increase in knowledge level of <b>self</b> directed patient <b>care</b> and practice in diabetic patients can significantly improve their health. So it is necessary to consider training programs for diabetic patients especially for illiterate and patients with a lower economic status.
