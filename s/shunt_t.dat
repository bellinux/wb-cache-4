40|$|Background: Portal-systemic shunts (PSSs) {{are rarely}} seen in healthy {{individuals}} or patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease. They may {{play an important}} role in hepatic metabolism as well as in the spread of gastrointestinal metastatic tumours to specific organs. Small spontaneous PSSs may be more common than generally thought. However, epidemiological data are scarce and inconclusive. This systematic review examined the prevalence of reported PSSs and the associated detection methods. Methods: Literature up to 2011 was reviewed for adult patients with proven congenital or acquired PSSs. Only PSSs in normal livers were analysed for the methods of diagnosis. Eligible studies were identified by searching relevant databases, including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. The selection of eligible articles was carried out using predefined inclusion criteria (adult, non-surgical PSS) and a set of search terms that were established before the articles were identified. Results: Eighty studies were included describing 112 patients with congenital or acquired PSSs. The majority were diagnosed incidentally using Doppler ultrasound imaging and CT. Conclusion: Congenital and acquired PSSs are rare. They are usually clinically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally by radiological techniques. They may be clinically relevant owing to drug, tumour cell, metabolic and pathogen <b>shunting.</b> <b>T.</b> J. Matthews, M. I. Trochsler, F. H. Bridgewater and G. J. Madder...|$|R

40|$|Josephson {{junctions}} with non-hysteretic current-voltage characteristics {{form the}} basis of most superconducting electronic circuits including RSFQ logic and programmable Josephson voltage standards. In contrast to conventional SIS devices, Nb/Al AlOx - Nb (SNIS) junctions with an additional comparatively thick Al interlayer and a comparatively thin barrier AlOx are intrinsically <b>shunted</b> at <b>T</b> >= 4. 2 K. In this contribution, we provide experimental and theoretical arguments proving that this finding is mainly explained by a broad distribution of highly-conductive barrier transparencies with a significant effect from nearly ballistic modes. An additional advantage of the proposed SNIS junctions is possibility to tune the critical voltage value by modifying Nb and/or Al film thicknesses. With observations of wide Shapiro steps up to 1. 25 V at 6. 3 K we show that this type of Josephson junctions can be successfully used at temperatures above 4. 2 K. The presence of well-developed quantized voltage features even at 7. 2 K means that Nb/Al - AlOx- Nb devices can successfully operate far above the liquid helium temperature and, in principle, are compatible with two-stage cryocoolers...|$|R

However, therapy can be complicated by systemic toxicity and unpredictable bioavailability, making a targeted drug delivery vehicle for local therapy desirable. A promising approach {{is the use of}} nanoparticles, which have been demonstrated to increase potency and decrease toxicity of therapies in a variety of disease models including Th 17 mediated diseases. Nanoparticles can also be targeted to specific cell types via surface modification, further increasing the potential specificity of this approach. We therefore constructed a nanoparticulate drug delivery platform from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) capable of encapsulating and releasing RA. Here we report the fabrication, characterization, and in vitro bioactivity of this platform. We demonstrate that RA containing PLGA nanoparticles suppress IL- 17 production and ROR-γ(t) expression in T cells polarized towards the Th 17 phenotype in vitro with similar potency to that of free drug. Furthermore, we show that these particles enhance TGF-β dependent Foxp 3 expression and IL- 10 production of T cells in vitro with similar potency to free RA. Finally, we demonstrate that T cells polarized towards the Th 17 phenotype in the presence of free and nanoparticulate RA have similarly suppressed ability to induce IL- 6 production by fibroblasts.

Quarenta e cinco crianças com hidrocefalia derivada e mielomeningocele foram analisadas quanto ao QI, que foi estatisticamente correlacionado com o nível motor, idade da primeira derivação, número de revisões, infecção e perímetro cefálico. A idade média foi 7, 5 anos (3 a 15 anos), 16 eram do sexo masculino e 29 eram do sexo feminino. Três (6, 6 %) obtiveram escore de QI > 110, 11 (24, 5 %) entre 100 - 110, 8 (17, 7 %) entre 85 - 100, 16 (35, 5 %) entre 70 - 85 e 7 (15, 5 %) entre 50 - 70. O QI correlacionou-se diretamente com o nível motor, sendo o resultado cognitivo melhor, em ordem decrescente, nos níveis sacral (t 0, 0055), lombar baixo (t 0, 0119) e lombar alto (t 0, 0226). Houve melhor desempenho cognitivo nas crianças operadas até 7 dias de vida (t 0, 0099), decrescendo progressivamente o resultado a partir do primeiro mês, não existindo diferença significativa entre 7 a 31 dias (t 0, 1013). Houve pior resultado no grupo que apresentou infecção do sistema de derivação (t 0, 0146). O prognóstico foi progressivamente pior de acordo com o número de revisões. O melhor resultado foi encontrado nas crianças com perímetro cefálico na média (t 0, 0115); resultado intermediário entre [...] 1 DP (desvio padrão) e a média (t 0, 0130) e entre a média e + 1 DP (t 0, 0256). Os piores resultados cognitivos foram encontrados nos extremos > 1 DP (t 0, 0269) e Myelomeningocele {{occurs in}} 0. 4 for 1000 {{neonates}} and {{is associated with}} hydrocephalus in 85 - 90 %, and reports on cognition are sparsely found in literature. Forty five children with treated hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele were studied in regard of IQ, and statistically correlated to functional motor level, age of the first shunt, number of revisions of shunt, infection of the shunt and circumference of the head. The medium age was of 7. 5 years (3 - 15 years), 16 males and 29 females. Three (6. 6 %) had a IQ score > 110, 11 (24. 4 %) had a score between 100 - 110, 8 between 85 - 100 (17. 7 %), 16 (35. 5 %) between 85 - 100 (17. 7 %) and 7 (15. 5 %) between 50 - 70. IQ directly correlated with motor level, having better cognitive results the children with minor functional motor disabilities. Cognition was best in children operated until the seven day of life (t 0. 0099), with progressive worse results in children operated after {{the first month of}} life, no significance was observed in children operated in the period 7 to 31 days (t 0. 1013).

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in the metallisation of poly-silicon thin-film solar cells on glass, created by solid phase crystallisation (SPC) of evaporated amorphous silicon (EVA), revealed that shunting through sub-micron holes (density 100 – 200 mmS 2) in the films causes severe shunting problems when the air-side metal contact is deposited onto these diodes, by creating effective shunting paths between the two highly doped layers of EVA cells. We present evidence of these pinholes by optical transmission and focussed ion beam (FIB) microscopic images and confirm the point-like pinhole shunts using lock-in thermographic images. The latter revealed that the Al rear electrode induces strong ohmic shunts below the grid lines and a high density of weak non-linear shunts away from the grid lines. Two distinctly different approaches are shown to reduce the shunting problem to a negligible level: (i) to contact {{only a small fraction}} of the rear Si surface via a point contacting scheme, whereby the metal layer needs to be thin (< 1 mm) and the fractional area coverage small (< 5 %), and (ii) to deposit line contacts in a bifacial interdigitated scheme, whereby a thick layer of metal is deposited followed by a wet-chemical etching step that effectively reduces shunting by preferentially etching away the <b>shunting</b> paths. <b>Test</b> devices with an area of 1 cm 2 achieve pseudo fill factors (pFF) of above 75 % and diode ideality factors of below 13, demonstrating that the proposed methods are well suited for the metallisation of the rear surface of EVA solar cells.

Applying microwaves from room temperature sources is the conventional approach to excite quantum state transitions. Finding {{a method to}} apply short microwave bursts with a narrow linewidth is a challenge for on-chip Josephson based oscillators. We present a scheme containing an RSFQ pulse generator, ultra narrowband filter, SQUID based resonator and coupler. The operating frequency of the designed controller is 3 - 6 GHz. The unique feature of this design is a SQUID based resonator. By varying magnetic field in the SQUID, the resonance length can be varied between λ/ 4 and λ/ 2. The resonator is added as a shunt between the filter and coupler. Transmission of microwave signals from the filter to the output {{is determined by the}} <b>shunt</b> resonance.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} limiting dark current mechanisms in InAs/GaSb type-II superlattice (T 2 SL) infrared detectors {{is key to}} improve the electrooptical performance of these devices. We present a six-component dark current analysis which, for the first time, takes account of sidewall-related dark current contributions in mesa-etched T 2 SL photodiodes. In a wide temperature range from 30 K to 130 K, the paper compares limiting mechanisms in two homojunction T 2 SL photodiode wafers for the long-wavelength infrared regime. While the two epi wafers were fabricated with nominally the same frontside process they were grown on different molecular beam epitaxy systems. In the available literature a limitation by Shockley-Read-Hall processes in the space charge region giving rise to generation-recombination (GR) dark current is the prevailing verdict on the bulk dark current mechanism in T 2 SL homojunction photodiodes around 77 K. In contrast, we find that investigated photodiode wafers are instead limited by the diffusion mechanism and the ohmic shunt component, respectively. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis of the various dark current components {{has led to an}} interesting observation on the temperature dependence of the <b>shunt</b> resistance in <b>T</b> 2 SL homojunction photodiodes. Our results indicate that the GR and the shunt mechanism share the same dependence on bandgap and temperature, i. e., a proportionality to exp(-E-g/ 2 kT) ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{recommendations}} for mechanical ventilation in the {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS) {{include the use of}} small tidal volumes (VT), even at the cost of respiratory acidosis. We evaluated the effects of this permissive hypercapnia on pulmonary gas exchange with the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET) in eight patients with ARDS. After making baseline measurements, we induced permissive hypercapnia by reducing VT from 10 +/- 2 ml/kg to 6 +/- 1 ml/kg (mean +/- SEM) at constant positive end-expiratory pressure. After restoration of initial VT, we infused dobutamine to increase cardiac output (Q) by the same amount as with hypercapnia. Permissive hypercapnia increased Q by an average of 1. 4 L. min(-) (1). m(2), decreased arterial oxygen tension from 109 +/- 10 mm Hg to 92 +/- 11 mm Hg (p < 0. 05), markedly increased true <b>shunt</b> (Q S/Q <b>T),</b> from 32 +/- 6 % to 48 +/- 5 % (p < 0. 0001), and had no effect on the dispersion of VA/Q.

These results agreed with effects of changes in VT and Q predicted by the mathematical lung model of the MIGET. We conclude that permissive hypercapnia increases pulmonary shunt, and that deterioration in gas exchange is explained by the combined effects of increased Q and decreased alveolar ventilation...|$|R

In the current study we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of this variant as well as variants containing the individual mutations T 103 N and KHRR 296 - 299 AAAA. Plasma clearance and in vivo lysis of whole blood and platelet-rich clots were determined in a rabbit arterio-venous <b>shunt</b> model. The <b>T</b> 103 N containing variants were administered as an intravenous (i. v.) bolus. KHRR 296 - 299 AAAA and t-PA were infused i. v. over 90 min.

Potency of the variants relative to t-PA on whole blood clots ranged from 0. 9 (T 103 N, KHRR 296 - 299 AAAA) to 1. 7 (T 103 N). Relative potency on platelet-rich clots ranged from 2. 4 (T 103 N) to 4. 2 (T 103 N, KHRR 296 - 299 AAAA).

30|$|MRI is {{the most}} {{valuable}} imaging modality {{in the evaluation of}} LV thickening and enables comprehensive evaluation of LV thickening, including establishing diagnosis of LV thickening, determining LV geometry, establishing aetiology, quantification, identifying prognostic factors, serial follow-up and assessment of treatment response. In certain instances, particularly with suboptimal echocardiography, MRI is used in establishing the diagnosis of LV thickening. MRI can exquisitely demonstrate the specific LV geometric pattern, which has therapeutic and prognostic implications (see below). The tissue characterization capabilities of MRI help in establishing a specific aetiology of LV thickening, which is essential for determining the appropriate treatment strategy. MRI is considered the gold standard in quantification of LV mass as well as volumes and function due to its high accuracy and reproducibility [1]. This makes MRI ideal for serial measurements of LV mass in clinical scenarios as well as research trials to assess treatment response. MRI provides prognostic information based on mass, volumes, function, and fibrosis. MRI can evaluate other structures, including vasculature and valves [14]. Several MRI sequences are used in the evaluation of LV thickening. ECG-gated steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine sequence is used in morphological evaluation of the LV thickening as well as qualitative evaluation of ventricular function. LV mass, volumes and function can also be quantified from a stack of short axis slices by drawing endocardial and epicardial contours, both in the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. Regional myocardial function can be accurately evaluated using several deformation techniques such as feature tracking, myocardial tagging, strain-encoded MRI (SENC) and displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) [15]. Some of these techniques such as myocardial tagging require dedicated post processing software and additional time, which has precluded widespread clinical adoption of such techniques. Velocity-encoded phase-contrast (PC) sequence is used in the quantification of valvular lesions (stenosis, regurgitation), other obstructive lesions (coarctation) and <b>shunts</b> [16]. <b>T</b> 2 -weighted sequences (STIR, SSFP) are used in the evaluation of myocardial oedema. Post-contrast dynamic first pass perfusion imaging can identify perfusion defects (e.g., aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) [17]. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences are used to detect scar/fibrosis, which helps in establishing aetiology of LV thickening as well as determining prognosis. T 1 mapping sequences, both pre and post contrast, quantify the T 1 values as well as extracellular volume (ECV), which is more sensitive in the detection of diffuse fibrosis than LGE. Additionally, T 1 mapping can identify deposits of amyloid, lipid and iron [18 – 20]. MR angiography (MRA) is useful in the evaluation of vascular abnormalities such as coarctation and renal arterial stenosis. The 4 D flow sequences are useful in the assessment of flow characteristics such as direction and vortices, which may have a potential future clinical role.|$|R
