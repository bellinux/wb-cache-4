50|$|Two basic {{types of}} wood {{shingles}} are called <b>shingles</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakes.</b> The difference is {{in how they}} are made, the shingles are sawn and shakes are split. Wood <b>shingles</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> have long been known as a fire hazard and have been banned in various places, particularly in urban areas where exterior, combustible building materials contribute to devastating fires known as conflagrations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shingles</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> may be tapered, straight, split or sawn and any {{combination}} of these except straight-tapered. Different species and quality of wood are used as are different lengths and installation methods. Shakes and shingles may also be treated with wood preservatives and fire retardants before or after installation.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th Century, the {{production}} of wooden roofing shingles was an extremely dangerous {{process in which the}} shingle weaver hand-fed pieces of raw wood onto an automated saw. Despite the danger of the profession, the industry was a large one throughout Washington and Oregon and by 1893 Washington state alone had 150 mills which converted Western Red Cedar into <b>shingles</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> for the roofing and siding of American homes.|$|E
50|$|Wood {{clapboard}} {{is often}} imitated using vinyl siding or uPVC weatherboarding. It is usually produced in units {{twice as high}} as clapboard. Plastic imitations of wood <b>shingle</b> <b>and</b> wood <b>shakes</b> also exist.|$|R
25|$|After the 1923 Berkeley Fire, Lilian Bridgman {{was among}} the architects {{involved}} in the rebuilding of Berkeley. She used the Hotel Whitecotton as a meeting place with clients. The Fire led {{to a change in}} building materials from <b>shingled</b> walls <b>and</b> cedar <b>shake</b> roofs to the use of stucco and tile roofs which can also be observed in the architecture of Bridgman.|$|R
50|$|The {{carriage}} house is 35 ft wide and 100 ft long, and originally housed the estate's wheeled vehicles {{as well as}} the horses and mules that pulled them. The building is sheathed in clapboard on the first floor, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> on the second. The roof is covered with slate <b>shingles</b> <b>and</b> is capped by a square cupola that served to ventilate the interior.|$|R
40|$|Preservative {{treatments}} can {{be applied}} to wood roofing before or after installation. In this paper, we briefly review treatment objectives, types of treatments, treating stan-dards, quality control, technical factors that affect <b>shake</b> <b>and</b> <b>shingle</b> performance, environmental concerns, and disposal of spent or excess-treated wood products. A synop-sis of research on alternative treatments for wood <b>shakes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shingles</b> being conducted at the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), is also presented.

5000|$|In November 1999 a {{landfill}} fire {{started at the}} Delta <b>Shake</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shingle</b> site. A state of emergency was declared in Delta to help the firefighters battle the underground blaze at the landfill. The site is a dump for demolition materials, such as wood <b>and</b> asphalt <b>shakes,</b> resulting in an environmentally hazardous smoke. High pollution levels were also detected in water running off from the fire. Water poured on the Delta <b>Shake</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shingle</b> Site by firefighters has mixed with naturally decaying wood to produce potentially toxic run-off. [...] At {{the peak of the}} fire it covered an area more than a hectare and burned 20 meters deep. The entire operation took over six months at a cost of four million dollars.|$|R
