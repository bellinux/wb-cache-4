5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5|$|PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in a skull bone {{attributed}} by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits {{occurred on}} the splenial. The areas around these pits are <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, {{it is likely that}} they were obtained in a fight with another Herrerasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Since the New York State Militia {{had been}} sent to assist Union troops at Gettysburg, the local New York Metropolitan Police Department was the only force on hand to try to {{suppress}} the riots. Police Superintendent John Kennedy arrived at the site on Monday to check on the situation. Although not in uniform, people in the mob recognized him and attacked him. Kennedy was left nearly unconscious, his face bruised and cut, his eye injured, his lips <b>swollen,</b> <b>and</b> his hand cut with a knife. He had been beaten to a mass of bruises and blood all over his body.|$|E
5|$|The fifth-brightest star is Zeta Apodis at {{magnitude}} 4.8, a star that has <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> cooled {{to become an}} orange giant of spectral type K1III, with a surface temperature of 4649 K and a luminosity 133 {{times that of the}} Sun. It is 297 ± 8 light-years distant. Near Zeta is Iota Apodis, a binary star system around 1300 light-years distant, that is composed of two blue-white main sequence stars that orbit each other every 59.32 years. Of spectral types B9V and B9.5 V, they are both over three times as massive as the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The fungus grows {{predominantly}} in coniferous forests, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal {{associations with}} living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground {{in summer and}} autumn. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as mushrooms appear under pine trees, generally in summer and autumn. It has a matte brown to maroon-coloured cap and its stem is often large and <b>swollen,</b> <b>and</b> the overall colour may have an orange-red tinge. As with other boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body is variable.|$|E
5|$|The talonid, {{another group}} of cusps, makes {{up the back of}} the tooth. It is wider than long and {{contains}} a well-developed cusp, the hypoconid, on the outer side and a depression, the talonid basin, in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller hypoconulid cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by a cutting edge which is suggestive of the presence of a metacone cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the entocristid, rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct entoconid cusp is absent. This entocristid is continuous with the lingual cingulum.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, with an apparent (visual) magnitude of 3.14. It is an orange giant of spectral type K7III located 203 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth. Around twice as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted the hydrogen {{at its core}} and has evolved away from the main sequence. The star has swollen to about 55 times the Sun's radius and is emitting roughly 673 times the luminosity of the Sun. The stellar atmosphere has cooled, giving it a surface temperature of 3,880K., see Table 1. The only star with a proper name is Alsciaukat (from the Arabic for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, located 380 ± 10 light-years from Earth. This star is also an evolved giant with around twice the Sun's mass that has <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> cooled since exhausting its core hydrogen. It is anywhere from 59 to 75 times {{as wide as the}} Sun, and 740 times as luminous. Alsciaukat is also a variable star, ranging in brightness by 0.05 magnitude over 25 to 30 days from its baseline magnitude of 4.25.|$|E

5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as Boletus edulis, Boletus reticulatus and Boletus aereus. The young, immature cap may have a pale pink colour and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 in) tall by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> imposing, bearing a network. The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
5|$|Depicting the {{eyepiece}} of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of4.68—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380±30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} to stage uprisings {{within a short time}} in {{southern}} and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea. Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in Kent started 10days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections. Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the River Severn. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October. Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to Wem, where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men. On 2 November 1483 he was executed. Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either Plymouth or Poole) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion. Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.|$|E
