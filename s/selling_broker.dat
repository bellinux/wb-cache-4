50|$|A yacht broker is a {{specialist}} who serves yacht or boat sellers and/or buyers {{as a representative}} for the sale or purchase of a yacht or boat. The yacht broker is paid an agreed commission by the seller to market the yacht for sale, field interest and inquiries from buyers, handle negotiations, attend inspection and water trial and ultimately, if successful, to attend delivery. A buyer's broker may assist their client in locating and qualifying a vessel and assisting with purchase negotiations but is typically not paid a commission by buyer and instead shares in the commission paid by the seller to their broker.

In 1958 the <b>selling</b> <b>brokers,</b> Winchcombe Carson Ltd, purchased the building and in 1980 the building was transferred to Dalgety Australia Ltd. The property was resold in November 1980 and subsequently leased as the office for the Minister of Works and Housing of the State of Queensland from 1983 to 1991. The building was sold again in 1993. At the time of purchase the building was intended for the dual use as a residence and beauty salon/finishing school.

50|$|Two such {{stations}} were WRNO in New Orleans and KUSW in Salt Lake City, {{both of them}} with a rock and roll music format. Both {{stations were}} well received by shortwave listeners, but could not make the format successful in the long run.

40|$|Access to China and its {{wealth of}} {{manufactured}} goods was long {{sought by the}} European ‘monopoly Companies’, yet a direct and regular trade between Europe and the South China coast was only established {{around the turn of}} the eighteenth century. By focusing on the private trade and interloping activities of British-born China traders, this thesis shows how this branch of commerce took root and expanded within a transnational European trading arena between c. 1720 to 1750. Interlopers, or free agents, I argue, played a highly integrative role for the development of European markets for Chinese goods and the networks of supply and capital that underpinned the trade. British-born Canton traders, who were operating in the smaller interloping East India Companies established close connections between Britain and the continent and between the different ‘national’ East India Companies. Private trade records, merchant letters, and East India Company materials form the large source base of this study and are used to analyse the ways in which cross-border mobility encouraged the transfer of expertise, capital, and information between different East India ventures. Methodologically, this work draws on, and builds upon the extensive scholarship on networks and the transnational. It is not biographical, yet follows a number of key individuals and their largely overlapping networks in order to shed light on the question how Canton traders (and British-born interlopers in particular) operated in the European market place – not merely as collective importers of foreign consumer goods, but as independent merchants, whose trade in Chinese goods ranged from wholesale buying and <b>selling,</b> <b>brokering,</b> smuggling, and the fulfilment of special commissions for clients across Europe...|$|R

50|$|Even large {{companies}} with lending licenses <b>sell,</b> or <b>broker,</b> the mortgage loan transactions they originate and close. A smaller percentage of bankers service {{and keep their}} loans than those in past decades. Banks act as a broker due to the increasing size of the loans because few can use depositor's money on mortgage loans. A depositor may request their money back and the lender would need large reserves to refund that money on request. Mortgage bankers do not take deposits and do not find it practical to make loans without a wholesaler in place to purchase them. The required cash of a mortgage banker is only $500,000 in New York. The remainder {{may be in the}} form of property assets (an additional $2.00), an additional credit line from another source (an additional $10,000,000). That amount is sufficient to make only two median price home loans. Therefore, mortgage lending is dependent on the secondary market, which includes securitization on Wall Street and other large funds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{the growth}} of various {{networked}} systems as potential market places, we study market models wherein, owing {{to the size of}} the markets, transactions take place between largely unknown agents. In such scenarios, intermediaries or brokers play a significant role in a transaction. We analyze market behavior in large networks wherein all sellers are not known to the buyers and vice-versa and depend on intermediaries to conduct any transactions. In such markets, we study a specific case where buyers wish to purchase goods from trusted sources at minimal prices. Sellers wish to maximize <b>selling</b> price. <b>Brokers</b> attempt to maximize profit by aiding in trade by acting as intermediaries; brokers have an advertising budget. We show the existence of competitive equilibria in such layered broker markets. We also describe efficient algorithms to compute these equilibria. We give polynomial-time distributed mechanisms to reach the equilibrium for two extreme cases of the brokers’ advertising budget constraints. ...|$|R
