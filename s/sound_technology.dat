It also became the first Indian film to use Dolby Atmos surround <b>sound</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jedi Knight uses both 3D {{graphics}} and surround sound. It {{is one of}} the early games to adopt the use of 3D graphics hardware acceleration using Microsoft Direct3D. The 3D <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> was tweaked extensively to give an immersive feel to the game. This was achieved by experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles. Between levels Jedi Knight features full motion video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre-rendered graphics. The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983.|$|E

5|$|The Loudest Engine {{features}} a sound {{adapted to the}} genres of folk and rock, {{more so than the}} previous two Howling Bells records. Juanita explained that the band relied less on the <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> that was prominent in Radio Wars, instead returning to the more organic state of Howling Bells. For the new album, Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon Düül and Aphrodite's Child. Howling Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You're Strange, which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of <b>sound</b> <b>technology,</b> Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} post-converted from 2D to 3D, {{in part because}} the {{production}} team wanted to shoot 35 mm film. Dan Mindel used Kodak Vision3 500T 5219 and 200T 5213, while the second unit shot day exteriors on Kodak Vision3 50D 5203. During the production, 20 layers of lightning CGI effects were applied to depict Electro. Jamie Foxx was photographed as Electro by KNB EFX team and the skin colors used to show the moods of the character. A total number of 1600 visual effects shots of the film was originally filmed in 2K resolution and then converted into 4K resolution with the help of color grading. To give the visual effects a realistic look, sound designers Addison Teague and Eric Norris and re-recording mixers Paul Massey and David Giammarco mixed the background music using Auro 11.1 cinema <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> and the film's soundtrack was remixed using Dolby Atmos, Auro and Dolby 5.1.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, {{the company}} {{publicly}} introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders (named after {{the use of}} a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disc). That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later. In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT for exclusive use of its film <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months. During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company's sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs—the new name for the AT research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of Don Juan.|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} {{the role of}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives like the UN Global Compact in the diffusion of Environmentally <b>Sound</b> <b>Technologies</b> (EST). The study has been performed as a questionnaire-based survey among {{a subset of the}} companies that participate in the UN Global Compact The UN Global Compact is a voluntary organisation that in the words of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan seeks to “give a human face to the global market”. In other words, the UN Global Compact is a corporate citizenship initiative that explores voluntary mobilisation of business sector for reducing human rights violations, labour rights violations, environmental degradation and corruption. This thesis {{has investigated}} one aspect of this organisation that is related to the environmental principles: what is the potential role of CSR initiatives in the diffusion of Environmentally <b>Sound</b> <b>Technologies.</b> The results show that companies that have a high degree of CSR involvement also have higher utilisation of environmentally <b>sound</b> <b>technologies.</b> It is believed that one manner of involving business in these issues is to present a compelling business case. The survey indicated that companies that have employed environmentally <b>sound</b> <b>technologies</b> have experienced three main impacts related to: (1) internal cost, (2) market performance and (3) CSR performance. Similarly, the survey indicated that companies experience three main impacts of participating in the UN Global Compact, related to: (1) internal cost, (2) competitiveness and (3) market performance...|$|R

25|$|The {{next step}} was to develop {{electric}} <b>sound</b> <b>technology.</b> The first electric musical instrument was the Denis d'or, which was built by Vaclav Prokop Dovis in 1753. It was incorporated with 700 strings temporarily electrified to enhance their sonic qualities. In 1760, Jean Baptiste Thillaie de Laborde developed the clavecin électrique. This was a keyboard instrument incorporated with plectra and activated by electricity. But both instruments were not using electricity to produce sound. Elisha Gray invented an electric musical instrument called the musical telegraph. It made sound from an electromagnetic circuit's vibration. He incorporated a basic single note oscillator. Next he added a loudspeaker consisting of diaphragm to make data audible.|$|E
25|$|Stateless met in Leeds in 2002. Chris James, James Sturdy and Jon Taylor {{had played}} in rock bands {{together}} for several years. When realising this more traditional style did not offer them the musical challenge they were looking for, they began to expand their musical tastes and influences to more sample based electronica and hip hop. For a while they ruled out the use of guitars when writing, trying to take their sound into a new direction. The interest in hip hop brought in DJ kidkanevil who they heard at a hip hop club night in Leeds. James met Rod Buchanan-Dunlop, a Scot, at Leeds Metropolitan University {{on the first day}} of their Creative Music and <b>Sound</b> <b>Technology</b> course in the Leeds Met School of Technology.

25|$|Sound waves travel {{differently}} through fish {{than through}} water because a fish's air-filled swim bladder {{has a different}} density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected <b>sound.</b> Acoustic <b>technology</b> is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use active sonar and echo <b>sounder</b> <b>technology</b> to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition.|$|R

50|$|A {{range of}} {{approaches}} and tools {{can be used}} to promote sustainable practices. Demand management, which includes accurate valuations of natural resources and increasing public awareness, is a valuable strategy to support sustainable consumption. This approach can also provide significant savings in infrastructure investment. Sustainable production can be supported by the adoption and use of environmentally <b>sound</b> <b>technologies</b> which can improve environmental performance significantly. These technologies protect the environment, are less polluting, use resources in a sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products and handle all residual wastes in a more environmentally acceptable way than the technologies for which they are substitutes. Environmentally <b>sound</b> <b>technologies</b> {{can also be used to}} drive reduced impacts and enhance value along a supply chain and support businesses embracing product stewardship.|$|R
25|$|It {{was during}} this period {{that some of the}} more {{important}} production companies first came into being, notably Mingxing ("Star") and the Shaw brothers' Tianyi ("Unique"). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, Laborer's Love (1922). This soon shifted, however, to feature-length films and family dramas including Orphan Rescues Grandfather (1923). Meanwhile, Tianyi shifted their model towards folklore dramas, and also pushed into foreign markets; their film White Snake (1926) proved a typical example of their success in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. In 1931, the first Chinese sound film Sing-Song Girl Red Peony was made, the product of a cooperation between the Mingxing Film Company's image production and Pathé Frères's <b>sound</b> <b>technology.</b> However, the sound was disc-recorded, and the first sound-on-film talkie made in China was either Spring on Stage (歌場春色) by Tianyi, or Clear Sky After Storm by Great China Studio and Jinan Studio.|$|E

It was a challenging production that lasted 21 months, with Chaplin later confessing that he [...] "had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection".

In addition to the soundtrack album, the music of IV was arranged and released in the style of Celtic music, performed by Máire Breatnach. It also sparked the release of an album of piano arrangements, something which would be repeated for every subsequent main-series game to date.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{development}} in <b>sound</b> <b>technologies</b> has enabled the realistic replay of real-life sounds.
