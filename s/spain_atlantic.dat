It is currently believed that there are two stocks for each of the two species, north and south, which determine their assessment and management. A genetic analysis using eight polymorphic microsatellite markers was carried out on samples collected from western European waters and the south-western Mediterranean Sea. The results strongly suggest that the boundary between northern and southern stocks is not genetically supported. However, populations were not genetically homogeneous. Besides a pattern of genetic differentiation between Mediterranean {{and the rest of the}} samples, the L. budegassa samples taken from the <b>Spain</b> <b>Atlantic</b> zone and from the Portugal Atlantic zone were genetically distinct, whereas the samples taken in the French Atlantic zone for the L. piscatorius species seem to be different from the rest of the samples under study. This can be indicative of a more subtle genetic structure that deserves more study for guaranteeing adequate fishery management of these species...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the demographic structure of Juniperus communis L. {{populations in the}} Mediterranean high mountains of southern Spain in order to analyse its population viability. For this, we compared the age structure of these Mediterranean populations with those of northern <b>Spain</b> (<b>Atlantic),</b> and, on a local scale, the populations of di€erent habitats within the Sierra Nevada. The populations from northern Spain showed age structures with high proportions at young stages. In contrast, the Mediterranean populations proved {{to be dominated by}} adult and senescent individuals, except for the few habitats with higher water availability during the summer, which have larger proportions of seedlings and juveniles. Dry habitats showed a lower seedling survival rate than did wet ones, mainly due to summer drought. Both the di€erence between Atlantic and Mediterranean categories, and the di€erence between habitats in Sierra Nevada re¯ect a serious limitation on recruitment of J. communis in Mediterranean mountains due to climatic stress imposed by summer drought. The Mediterranean populations provide a clear example of remnant dynamics, surviving for long periods due to great individual longevity which partially o€sets losses to unfavourable environmental conditions. The low ability to recover after anthropic disturbances emphasizes the need for conservation of J. communis populations in southeaster...|$|E
40|$|The thick organic matter-rich colluvial soils of NW <b>Spain</b> (<b>Atlantic</b> rankers), which {{formed as}} a result of Holocene slope {{transport}} processes, might well contain large amounts of Black C from palaeofires, not only as large charcoal fragments (as was frequently reported) but also as finely divided and amorphous, largely NaOH-extractable material, as appeared to be the case for the soils of the study area. Therefore, Black C may be a major agent in the pedogenesis of these soils. Furthermore, the abundance of Black C may be responsible for the deep dark colour and explain the high resistance of the soil organic matter against biological degradation, in combination with occlusion and the traditional sorptive preservation mechanisms. The indirect evidence of human influence in the fire regime that created these soils implies that the Atlantic rankers have an anthropogenic character. Upon long-term burial, Black C becomes increasingly oxidised, depolymerised, depolyaromatised, fractionated (on a macrostructural scale) and incorporated in the fine fabric of the soils studied here. The results presented suggest significant alteration of Black C on the millennial scale. The difficulties in recognising amorphous and degraded Black C without application of advanced molecular characterisation techniques explains why fire (thermal modification) was hitherto ignored as a major cause of soil organic matter stability in Atlantic rankers. In the study area, local deforestation and shrubland expansion started already ca. 7000 cal BP and accelerated since ca. 6000 – 5500 cal BP. In all likelihood, past societies used fire to clear the land and facilitate animal grazing, but climate deterioration after the Holocene Thermal Maximum and Roman Warm Period may have catalysed human inpact on the vegetation patterns. Fabaceae and Ericaceae shrubland communities first colonised the upper slopes of the hill and then probably expanded into the lower areas. The deciduous forest never completely recovered after the phases of forest retreat (ca. 7000 – 6500 cal BP, 5700 – 5300 cal BP, 4000 – 3500 cal BP, 3000 – 2000 cal BP and 2000 – 1500 cal BP) because of the intense burning and grazing disturbance regime imposed. This process might reflect the formation of the traditional dual landscape that can still be observed nowadays: shrubland and pasture grounds at o monte and cultivated land and some fragmented remains of deciduous forest in the valleys. If this proves correct, the roots of the o monte land use, including slash-and-burn practices and extensive pastoralism, may date back to the Neolithic and perhaps even Late Epipalaeolithic/Mesolithic period...|$|E

50|$|During the 16th century, Valencia {{lost its}} status as a preeminent {{commercial}} center of Europe to the rapidly developing cities of Northern and Central Europe. Within <b>Spain,</b> the <b>Atlantic</b> trade favored the cities of Andalusia such as Cádiz. This was largely due to diminishing profits from the Mediterranean trade. The Spanish Empire was in frequent conflict with the Ottoman Empire which controlled most of the eastern Mediterranean. They prevented each other from reaching certain ports while Ottoman privateers such as Barbarossa preyed on trade ships. The Barbary pirates such as Dragut, operating out of Tunis, Tripoli, Algiers, Salé and ports in Morocco, attacked shipping in the western Mediterranean, which included destructive raids in Christian ports along the coast. This decline in trade greatly inhibited the economy in Valencia, which had already been economically affected by the Alhambra decree which had expelled the Jews in 1492.|$|R

40|$|Even when {{spatially}} explicit {{models are}} published in accessible international journals, {{they are rarely}} reused by the scientific community. This is unfortunate, as these models contain useful information to develop further research and to support decision-making policies. In {{the absence of a}} major study on Eurasian badger (Meles meles) abundance in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spain,</b> and given the potential role of this species in Mycobacterium bovis epidemiology, we aimed to predict broad-scale badger abundance by generalizing published models for sett suitability within the UK (one calibrated for Northern Ireland and another one for England and Wales). The UK models used fine-resolution environmental predictors that were not available for Spain. Thus, we generalized the models using the outputs of the published models as response variables and calibrated new models using broad-scale environmental predictors. The new model derived from that for Northern Ireland accurately predicted the badger abundance (field data for 48 1 km× 1 km squares in 12 localities) in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spain,</b> and indicated a high potential for the species in lowland pastoral areas. The mean density of badgers in the study area was 3. 81 adults/km 2 (3. 0 ± 1. 3 adults/group), which is higher than in Mediterranean areas in Spain, but lower than in some areas in England where badgers contribute to M. bovis maintenance. We provide the first example of generalization of published spatial models, and confirm that this procedure allows for more efficient use of research funding, by generating new information of relevance, in this case study, for badger management and for understanding M. bovis epidemiology in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spain.</b> P.
