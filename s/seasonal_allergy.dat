5000|$|Among <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergies,</b> {{there are}} some allergens that fuse {{together}} and produce {{a new type of}} allergy. For instance, grass pollen allergens cross-react with food allergy proteins in vegetables such as onion, lettuce, carrots, celery and corn. Besides, the cousins of birch pollen allergens, like apples, grapes, peaches, celery and apricots, produce severe itching in the ears and throat. The cypress pollen allergy brings a cross reactivity between diverse species like olive, privet, ash and Russian olive tree pollen allergens. In some rural areas there is another form of <b>seasonal</b> grass <b>allergy,</b> combining airborne particles of pollen mixed with mold. Recent research has suggested that humans might develop allergies as a defense to fight off parasites. According to Yale University Immunologist Dr Ruslan Medzhitov, protease allergens cleave the same sensor proteins that evolved to detect proteases produced by the parasitic worms. Additionally, a new report on <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergies</b> called “Extreme allergies and Global Warming”, have found that many allergy triggers are worsening due to climate change. 16 states in the United States were named as “Allergen Hotspots” for large increases in allergenic tree pollen if global warming pollution keeps increasing. Therefore, researchers on this report claimed that global warming is bad news for millions of asthmatics in the United States whose asthma attacks are triggered by <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergies.</b> [...] Indeed, <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergies</b> are one of the main triggers for asthma, along with colds or flu, cigarette smoke and exercise. In Canada, for example, up to 75% of asthmatics also have <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Allergic {{diseases}} are increasing world-wide, {{and according to}} the hygiene hypothesis may be related to a decreased exposure to environmental bacteria. Probiotic bacteria are recognized for their immunomodulating properties, and may benefit allergy patients. In vitro studies reveal immunomodulatory effects that are strain dependent. Differential immunomodulatory in vitro capacities cannot be extrapolated directly to in vivo efficacy. Thus, in vitro screening should preferably be followed by a comparative analysis of the selected immunomodulatory strains in an in vivo setting. Objective We selected five Lactobacillus strains on their IL- 10 -inducing capacity, and evaluated the immunomodulatory properties in birch-pollen-allergic subjects outside the hayfever season, with a reduction of IL- 13 as the primary outcome. Methods A double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study was performed in which 62 subjects with a proven birch-pollen allergy consumed one of five different probiotic yoghurts containing four Lactobacillus plantarum strains and one Lactobacillus casei strain or a placebo yoghurt. Blood samples were collected at the start and after 4 weeks. Several immune parameters were determined in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures (PBMC) derived from these subjects. Results A decrease in birch-pollen-specific IgE was found for four probiotic strains. L. casei Shirota reduced the number of CD 16 +/CD 56 + cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For strain L. plantarum CBS 125632, the decrease in IgE coincided with significant decreases in IL- 5 and IL- 13 production by aCD 3 /aCD 28 -stimulated PBMC cultures. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance Subjects with <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> can be used to determine immunomodulatory responses outside the pollen season within a 4 -week study period. L. plantarum CBS 125632 decreased several immune markers related to allergy, and may have the potential to alleviate the severity of <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> symptom...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Direct-to-consumer {{advertising}} (DDTCA) of medications, {{a marketing}} tool {{used by the}} pharmaceutical industry to increase patient awareness of products, affects both consumer behavior and, ultimately, physician prescribing practices. Billions of dollars are budgeted each year for DTCA, and its influence is far-reaching. However, little information is available about patient-initiated physician interactions in which television-bbased DTCA has {{played a role in}} consumer behavior. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the influence of television-based DTCA on treatment changes in patient-initiated medication use. Methods: A 68 -item survey instrument consisting of dichotomous, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions was constructed and sent to a convenience sample of US residents during 3 consecutive months ending in February 2005. The survey, which was accessed through an Internet link provided in the e-mail, was designed to capture data about patient perceptions and behaviors regarding television-based DTCA of prescription medications used for <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> and asthma as well as demographic information. Inferential and descriptive analyses were performed. Key tests included Crosstabs analysis and normal approximation to the binomial test with the z score. Results: Surveys were sent to 2500 individuals. A total of 427 valid surveys were returned for a 17. 1 % response rate. Of the 402 respondents (94. 1 %) who stated that they had seen DTCA for <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> medication, 50 (12. 4 %) said they had discussed the advertised medication with their physician and 22 of those discussions (44. 0 %) resulted in a change in treatment. Three hundred forty-two respondents (80. 1 %) stated that they had viewed DTCA for prescription asthma medications, and 23 of those respondents (6. 7 %) said that they had discussed the brand of asthma medication viewed on television with their physician. Those discussions resulted in a change in treatment for 9 respondents (39. 1 %).

40|$|SummaryPatients {{with grass}} pollen allergy, {{commonly}} called pollinosis, often present reactivity to pollen allergens {{from a number}} of grass species due to cross-reactivity of IgE antibodies to pollen proteins present in pollen grasses. In this context, Italian rye grass (Lolium multiflorum) pollen of the Poaceae family cultivated in Southern Brazil has been considered a major sensitizing agent in patients with pollinosis. In this region, Italian rye grass is capable of producing a great amount of pollen. In addition to L. multiflorum, other Poaceae grasses are naturally grown as weed in Southern Brazil, but with no clinical relevance. Pollen extracts derived from homologous or heterologous grasses are often used for both diagnosis and treatment of <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy.</b> However, no standardized L. multiflorum pollen extract is commercially available in Brazil and mixed grass extracts are commonly used for diagnosis and immunotherapy of grass pollen allergy. Further studies are required to better characterize the cross-reactivity between L. multiflorum and other grass pollen allergens for improving the diagnosis and immunotherapy to L. multiflorum pollen allergy...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the potential immunomodulatory effect of six Lactobacillus strains on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) isolated from allergic patients. hPBMC from patients allergic to birch pollen or grass pollen were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of selective bacterial strains. Cultures were left unstimulated or stimulated with aCD 3 /aCD 28 or Bet v 1. After 1, 4 and 8 days, cells and culture supernatants were harvested and the effect on cellular proliferation and the supernatant levels of several cytokines was assessed. All strains had the ability to repress IL- 13 production but did show a differential effect on IFN-¿ induction. Both strains B 223 and B 1697 showed a lower IFN-¿, IL- 12 and TNF-a induction as compared with the other tested strains. Strain B 633 showed the best proliferation-suppressive properties in aCD 3 /aCD 28 -stimulated cells. Suppression of the T-helper type 2 (Th 2) cytokine induction and induction of the Th 1 cytokine production by specific strains might be beneficial for allergic patients having a disturbed Th 1 /Th 2 immune balance.

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} The association between airborne pollen counts or duration of pollen season and allergy symptoms {{is not always}} distinguished. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the correlation between pollen exposure (annual total pollen quantity and main pollen season length) of selected allergenic plants in the atmosphere of Bratislava, and concentration of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) in serum of patients with <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> during 2002 – 2003. Material and Methods The concentration of pollen was monitored by a Burkard volumetric pollen trap. At the same time, 198 pollen allergic patients were testing to determine the values of sIgE antibodies against selected pollen allergens; a panel of 8 purified allergens was used. Results The highest percentages of sensitization were detected for Poaceae and Ambrosia pollen allergens. The most abundant airborne pollen types were Urticaceae, Betula, Populus, Fraxinus, Pinus and Poaceae. The length of the pollen season varied. The longest pollen season was that of the Plantago – 105 days, and the shortest, Corylus – 20 days. A significant correlation was found between annual total pollen quantity and median sIgE values, especially in 2002. Conclusions A strong and significant positive correlation was observed between pollen counts, excluding Betula, and sIgE levels in both analysed years. The correlation was weaker and negative in the case of length of pollen season and sIgE values...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cedar pollinosis is a {{widespread}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> that is unique to Japan. Environmental exposure units (EEU) assist {{in the development of}} effective therapeutic and preventive measures because outdoor studies are limited by seasonal variation in pollen exposure. Objectives: We constructed an EEU to conduct a randomized cross-over double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effi cacy of cetirizine (Zyrtec), a second-generation antihistamine. Methods: The spatial and temporal homogeneity of pollen distribution in the EEU was evaluated by counting the number of pollen grains on petroleum-jelly–smeared glass slides and by real-time pollen monitors. In the clinical study, 20 volunteers with known cedar pollinosis were exposed to pollen for 5 hours, randomly allocated to receive either cetirizine hydrochloride or placebo 30 minutes after exposure. Symptoms and the degree of somnolence were recorded every 30 minutes for 5. 5 hours. As a measure of psychomotor performance, the Uchida–Kraepelin test was used to determine work quantity and error rate. Results: The cedar pollen grains were scattered evenly in the exposure room.

40|$|Background: Confidential {{enquiries}} into asthma deaths {{can identify}} inadequacies in medical management and factors which contribute to patients ’ death. Aims: To identify {{risk factors for}} paediatric asthma deaths over a 6 -year period. Methods: Observational case-series study of paediatric asthma deaths between 2001 - 2006 in the UK Eastern Region. Hospital, primary care and post-mortem data were obtained for every child (≤ 17 yrs) with asthma recorded on the death certificate, and a detailed questionnaire was completed. Information was obtained on asthma severity, medications, hospital admissions, GP and hospital follow-up, adherence, psychosocial / behavioural factors, allergies, details of the terminal attack and precipitating factors. Results: 20 children (10 male; 8 - 17 yrs; median: 11. 5 yrs) died of asthma between 2001 - 2006. 9 / 20 had mild to moderate asthma (BTS/ SIGN criteria), 10 / 20 had severe asthma and 1 child was not known to have asthma. 13 / 20 were clinically atopic. Only 3 had undergone allergy assessment. 10 / 20 died between June and August. 12 / 20 children had adverse psychosocial and behavioural factors. 7 / 20 children were on non-combination long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) treatment without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

40|$|The aim was {{to obtain}} a better {{understanding}} of the relationship between exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) and adverse events (AEs) reported in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. We used data from the BLISS- 76 trial on belimumab. The data were accessed through an agreement under the SHARE mechanism. AEs were grouped according to medical relevance, i. e. based on similarity of symptoms and pathophysiology. We studied the relationship between AEs and exposure to GCs at baseline and at any time-point, and compared the frequencies of each AE and groups of AEs between tertiles of cumulative GC dose. In total, 991 AEs were reported in the 819 patients of the trial. The frequencies of anaemia, pyrexia, oral herpes, and malaise were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in patients who were on GCs at baseline than in those who were not. The frequencies of several other AEs, including nausea, <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy,</b> bacterial sinusitis, and viral upper respiratory infection, were significantly higher in patients without GCs. For cumulative GCs, tachycardia and proteinuria were significantly more frequent in the highest tertile than in the lowest tertile, but other AEs and groups of AEs were significantly more frequent in the lowest tertile. This study highlights the feasibility of post-hoc analyses of RCTs using the SHARE mechanism and demonstrates the association of GCs with various AEs.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that seasonal allergies affect up to approximately 44 % of the population. Many people compromise the quality of their lives in order to function on a day to day basis. There are several treatments that are available in alleviating symptoms related to seasonal allergies, but many people have difficulty adhering to certain recommended regimens. Intranasal corticosteroids have been thought of as the first line of therapy in the treatment of seasonal allergies, but these require daily treatments. Systemic antihistamines, on the other hand, provide allergic relief on an as-needed basis, but are subject to a higher possibility of side effects as they are systemically metabolized. Topical antihistamines are a class of medications that could possibly provide similar, if not better, effectiveness in symptomatic control of seasonal allergies. Methods: The focus {{of this study was to}} review clinical trials providing comparison between topical antihistamines and systemic antihistamines. Clinical trials within the last fifteen years comparing topical antihistamines with systemic antihistamines and with placebos, were carefully selected and analyzed. Double-blinded and randomized clinical trials of specific topical antihistamines and systemic antihistamines were identified by a systematic literature search using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PUBMED search engines. Results: Based on the seven randomized, double-blinded, and placebo controlled clinical trials, the efficacy of topical antihistamines was significantly greater than systemic antihistamines. Both topical and systemic antihistamines significantly improved symptoms compared to placebo.

40|$|Nasal {{irritant}} sensitivity ” is {{an important}} construct in environmental health science; functional measures, however, lack standardization. We performed duplicate measures of nasal irritant perceptual acuity on 16 subjects (evenly divided by sex and <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> status) using two different test compounds: carbon dioxide (CO 2) (detection) and n-propanol (localization). The a priori hypotheses included a) allergic rhinitics will display lower perceptual thresholds than nonrhinitics; b) females will display lower perceptual thresholds than males; and c) estimates of perceptual acuity using the two test systems will be positively correlated. We obtained CO 2 detection thresholds using an ascending concentration series, presenting 3 -sec pulses of CO 2, paired with air in random order, by nasal cannula. We obtained localization thresholds by simultaneously presenting stimuli (ascending concentrations of n-propanol vapor in air) and blanks (saturated water vapor in air) to opposite nostrils, with laterality randomized. In terms of test–retest reliability, individual replicate measures for CO 2 detection thresholds correlated more closely than did the localization thresholds of volatile organic compounds (VOC) (r = 0. 65 and r = 0. 60, respectively). As an intertest comparison, log-transformed individual mean CO 2 and VOC measures were positively correlated with an r of 0. 63 (p < 0. 01). In univariate analyses, sex predicted both log-transformed CO 2 and VOC thresholds (females being more “sensitive”; p < 0. 05 and 0. 001, respectively). Nasal allergies predicted sensory testing results only in the multivariate analysis, and then only for VOC localization (p < 0. 05). The question of population variation in nasal irritant sensitivity (as well as the generalizability of results across test compounds) deserves further attention. Key words: allergic rhinitis...|$|E
40|$|Background Ragweed is a {{major cause}} of <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy,</b> {{affecting}} millions of people worldwide. Several allergens have been defined based on IgE reactivity, but their relative immunogenicity in terms of T cell responses has not been studied. Objective We comprehensively characterized T cell responses from atopic, ragweed-allergic subjects to Amb a 1, Amb a 3, Amb a 4, Amb a 5, Amb a 6, Amb a 8, Amb a 9, Amb a 10, Amb a 11, and Amb p 5 and examined their correlation with serological reactivity and sequence conservation in other allergens. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors positive for IgE towards ragweed extracts after in vitro expansion for secretion of IL- 5 (a representative Th 2 cytokine) and IFN-γ (Th 1) in response to a panel of overlapping peptides spanning the above-listed allergens were assessed. Results Three previously identified dominant T cell epitopes (Amb a 1 176 – 191, 200 – 215, and 344 – 359) were confirmed, and three novel dominant epitopes (Amb a 1 280 – 295, 304 – 319, and 320 – 335) were identified. Amb a 1, the dominant IgE allergen, was also the dominant T cell allergen, but dominance patterns for T cell and IgE responses for the other ragweed allergens did not correlate. Dominance for T cell responses correlated with conservation of ragweed epitopes with sequences of other well-known allergens. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance These results provide the first assessment of the hierarchy of T cell reactivity in ragweed allergens, which is distinct from that observed for IgE reactivity and influenced by T cell epitope sequence conservation. The results suggest that ragweed allergens associated with lesser IgE reactivity and significant T cell reactivity may be targeted for T cell immunotherapy, and further support the development of immunotherapies against epitopes conserved across species to generate broad reactivity against many common allergens...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} the acute effects on circulating lymphocyte subsets, antioxidant status, and cytokine profile after consumption of EpiCor® (EP) (Embria Health Sciences, Ankeny, IA, USA), a dried fermentate produced from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using a placebo-controlled randomized crossover study design with 12 healthy adult human subjects. EP contains high levels of bioavailable antioxidants and strongly activates natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. EP consumption has been shown to increase erythrocyte hematocrit levels, boost mucosal immune protection, reduce cold/flu symptoms, reduce <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> symptoms and the need for rescue medication, and increase salivary secretory immunoglobulin A levels. This warranted further study on immune effects in humans. A within-subject analysis of data collected before and at 1 and 2 hours after consumption of a single dose of 500 [*]mg of EP versus placebo was performed. A transient reduction in circulating T and NK cell numbers was observed 2 hours post-consumption, suggesting that homing and recirculation of these cells, as part of healthy immune surveillance, were supported by EP. The increased expression of activation markers on the CD 3 − CD 56 + NK cell population was significant for CD 69 at 1 hour post-consumption (CD 25, P<. 07; CD 69, P<. 05), whereas for CD 25 it was significant at 2 hours after consumption (CD 25, P<. 03; CD 69, P<. 15). A rapid increase in serum interferon-γ was observed at 1 hour post-consumption (P<. 07; after removal of two outlying data sets, P<. 05) and {{may have contributed to the}} effects seen on NK and T cell subsets.

The utility of these tests in subjects with signs and symptoms of asthma but without a clear diagnosis has not been investigated. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of mannitol to identify exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as a manifestation of BHR; compared this with methacholine; and compared the sensitivity and specificity of mannitol and methacholine for a clinician diagnosis of asthma. Methods 509 people (6 – 50 yr) were enrolled, 78 % were atopic, median FEV 1 92. 5 % predicted, and a low NAEPPII asthma score of 1. 2. Subjects with symptoms of <b>seasonal</b> <b>allergy</b> were excluded. BHR to exercise was defined as a ≥ 10 % fall in FEV 1 on at least one of two tests, to methacholine a PC 20 ≤ 16 mg/ml and to mannitol a 15 % fall in FEV 1 at ≤ 635 mg or a 10 % fall between doses. The clinician diagnosis of asthma was made on examination, history, skin tests, questionnaire and response to exercise but they were blind to the mannitol and methacholine results. Results Mannitol and methacholine were therapeutically equivalent to identify EIB, a clinician diagnosis of asthma, and prevalence of BHR. The sensitivity/specificity of mannitol to identify EIB was 59 %/ 65 % and for methacholine it was 56 %/ 69 %. The BHR was mild. Mean EIB % fall in FEV 1 in subjects positive to exercise was 19 %, (SD 9. 2), mannitol PD 15 158 (CI: 129, 193) mg, and methacholine PC 20 2. 1 (CI: 1. 7, 2. 6) mg/ml. The prevalence of BHR was the same: for exercise (43. 5 %), mannitol (44. 8 %), and methacholine (41. 6 %) with a test agreement between 62 & 69 %. The sensitivity and specificity for a clinician diagnosis of asthma was 56 %/ 73 % for mannitol and 51 %/ 75 % for methacholine. The sensitivity increased to 73 % and 72 % for mannitol and methacholine when two exercise tests were positive. Conclusion In this group with normal FEV 1, mild symptoms, and mild BHR, the sensitivity and specificity for both mannitol and methacholine to identify EIB and a clinician diagnosis of asthma were equivalent, but lower than previously documented in well-defined populations. Trial registration This was a multi-center trial comprising 25 sites across the United States of America. (NCT 0025229). </p...|$|E
