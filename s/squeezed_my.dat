60|$|In the vestry {{she turned}} away as we signed, and I verily believe she was crying, though to this day I can't say why she should have cried, and she was near crying too when she <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand at parting--and she {{never said a word}} or looked at me, but just <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand....|$|E
60|$|He <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> arm till he extorted from me {{some sort}} of mumble.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Harrison nodded {{a little}} gloomily and we glided off. Eve <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> {{hand under the}} rug.|$|E
5000|$|Fast Friends: Pal Mickey {{will speak}} {{the names of}} Disney characters, and the player must respond to each in a {{specific}} way. For example, [...] "when I say Goofy, <b>squeeze</b> <b>my</b> left hand" [...] or [...] "when I say the name of someone who can fly, <b>squeeze</b> <b>my</b> right hand." ...|$|R
60|$|She's coming later.... I don't {{know why}} you should <b>squeeze</b> <b>my</b> hands in this pointed manner.|$|R
60|$|He {{said this}} with an {{appearance}} of the deepest anxiety--and more, he emphasized it by affectionately <b>squeezing</b> <b>my</b> hand.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand in hers. [...] "Oh, {{my darling}} boy, you have brought such joy to my heart! What {{suspense}} I shall live in now! I think {{a week of}} it would kill me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marble looked sorrowfully at the wheel, <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand, as if {{to express}} sorrow for having {{reminded}} me of so painful an event, and then I heard him murmuring to himself--"Well, I never had a father to lose. No bloody mill could do me that injury." ...|$|E
6000|$|Guert {{stopped short}} in the street, looked me {{full in the}} face with an {{expression}} of truth that could not well be feigned, <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand fervently, and rejoined with a strange frankness, that I could not have imitated, to be master of all I saw-- ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{a section}} of the wall fell inward with a crash. I began to <b>squeeze</b> <b>my</b> body through the narrow passage toward the patio.|$|R
5000|$|The country song [...] "Don' <b>Squeeze</b> <b>My</b> Sharmon," [...] {{which was}} a minor hit for Charlie Walker in 1967, was {{inspired}} by the ad campaign for Charmin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Halo! Geo'ge, don't <b>squeeze</b> <b>my</b> arm so! You's hurtin' me. I {{hear you}} say somet'ing 'bout plotummik lub, but what sort o' lub that may be is more'n I kin tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But no {{such luck}} for honest Peter Brock, or Captain Wood, {{as he was in}} those days. One blessed Monday I went to wait on Mr. Secretary, and he <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand and whispered to me that I was to be Major of a {{regiment}} in Virginia--the very thing: for you see, my dear, I didn't care about joining my Lord Duke in Flanders; being pretty well known to the army there. The Secretary <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand (it had a fifty-pound bill in it) and wished me joy, and called me Major, and bowed me out of his closet into the ante-room; and, as gay as may be, I went off to the 'Tilt-yard Coffee-house' in Whitehall, which is much frequented by gentlemen of our profession, where I bragged not a little of my good luck.|$|E
6000|$|The {{evening was}} cloudy, {{and it got}} on from dusk to dark {{by the time we}} {{approached}} the town again. The housemaid was rather nervous at finding herself alone with me on the beach, and once or twice looked behind her distrustfully as we went on. Suddenly she <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand hard, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|The Brandenburger {{showed his}} white teeth in a grin {{as he held}} out his broad brown hand to me. The instant that mine was {{enclosed}} in it he suddenly bent his whole strength upon it, and <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> fingers together until the blood tingled in the nails, and the whole hand was limp and powerless.|$|E
5000|$|Fisher {{has also}} said [...] "We wanted a book where I could <b>squeeze</b> <b>my</b> {{imagination}} for everything {{it was worth}} and 'Green Lantern' just {{seemed to have the}} most potential that way." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Something Is <b>Squeezing</b> <b>My</b> Skull", [...] "Mama Lay Softly on the Riverbed", [...] "When Last I Spoke to Carol", [...] "Its Not Your Birthday Anymore" [...] and [...] "You Were Good in Your Time".|$|R
6000|$|... "You return {{good for}} evil," [...] she replied, <b>squeezing</b> <b>my</b> arm. [...] "Russ, {{let me tell}} you--whenever {{anything}} frightens me since we got here I think of you. If you're only near I feel safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, very much. I fell when {{he fired}} {{and tried to}} get away, but he chased and caught me and the blood ran out on to his hand. He wiped it off on his coat, then <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> sides with his finger and thumb until I was dead, then put me in his pocket. There was some dead warm soft thing in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She sniffed and {{was raising}} an untender hand, when I checked her. [...] "Forbear, ma'am," [...] I cried with authority, [...] "I prefer {{to believe in}} that bag. How much to be pitied, ma'am, {{are those who have}} lost faith in everything." [...] I think all the pretty things that the little nursery governess had made out of nothing <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand for letting the {{chandelier}} off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was glad}} to see, too, that every man had a hammock.' The {{sergeant}} gravely shook his head. 'There must be some mistake, sir. The men of my own mess had no hammocks. There were not hammocks enough on board, and {{the men of the}} two next messes laid hold of hammocks for themselves as soon as they got on board, and <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> men out, as I may say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|THE DANE. (<b>Squeezing</b> <b>my</b> {{hand with}} great vehemence.) My dear friend! vat an affection and {{fidelity}} ve have for each odher! But tell me, do tell me,--Is I not, now and den, speak some fault? Is I not in some wrong? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you; you're a good fellow. <b>Squeeze</b> <b>my</b> hand--there now, go away; I'll {{sleep for}} a little. Stay, perhaps, I may never waken; if so, farewell. You'll find {{a fire in the}} library if you choose to wait till it's over. God bless you." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the last}} of the {{gathering}} had departed, about one o'clock in the morning, I had added considerably to my experience, gained a pretty accurate idea of who was who in the legislature and politics of the state, and established relationships--as the Colonel reminded me--likely to prove valuable in the future. It seemed only gracious to congratulate him on his management of the affair,--so far. He appeared pleased, and <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "He must propose to-morrow," [...] thought Rebecca. [...] "He {{called me}} his soul's darling, four times; he <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand in Amelia's presence. He must propose to-morrow." [...] And so thought Amelia, too. And I dare say {{she thought of}} the dress she was to wear as bridesmaid, and of the {{presents}} which she should make to her nice little sister-in-law, and of a subsequent ceremony in which she herself might play a principal part, &c., and &c., and &c., and &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest,--My {{father is}} dead, my poor old father, and now I have nobody but you {{left in the}} world. Thank God, at the last he was without pain and, they thought, insensible; but I know he wasn't, because he <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand. Some of his last words that could be {{understood}} were, 'Give my love to Morris.' Oh! I feel as though my heart would break. After my mother's death till you came into my life, he was everything to me--everything, everything. I can't write any more.|$|E
60|$|All {{this time}} he was <b>squeezing</b> <b>my</b> hand with his damp fishy fingers, while I made every effort I decently could to get it away. But I was quite unsuccessful. He drew it under the sleeve of his mulberry-coloured great-coat, and I walked on, almost upon compulsion, arm-in-arm with him.|$|R

6000|$|... "I ken I am pater patriae well enough," [...] said James; [...] "but {{one would}} think they had a mind to <b>squeeze</b> <b>my</b> puddings out, that they may divide the inheritance, Ud's death, Geordie, {{there is not a}} loon among them can deliver a Supplication, as it suld be done in the face of majesty." ...|$|R
60|$|Up {{started the}} music, the fiddlers bending over their bows with flushed faces, having dipped {{into the cool}} punch in the interval. Away flung my lady to meet Singleton, while I swung Patty, who <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand in return. And soon {{we were in the}} heat of it,--sober minuet no longer, but romp and riot, the screams of the lasses a-mingle with our own laughter, as we spun them until they were dizzy. My brain was a-whirl as well, and {{presently}} I awoke to find Dolly pinching my arm.|$|E
60|$|Lucy's face did not corroborate that notion; but she withdrew {{to let my}} {{decision}} be known. In a few minutes a large, hard-featured, but not ill-looking man approaching fifty, entered my room, walked up to me with tears in his eyes, <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> hand warmly, and then seated himself without ceremony. He was attired like a thriving countryman, though his language, accent, and manner denoted one superior to the ordinary run of those with whom he was otherwise associated in externals. I {{had to look at}} him a second time ere I could recognise Jack Wallingford, my father's bachelor cousin, the western land-holder.|$|E
60|$|The sight {{seemed to}} have a curious effect on Master Simon, as he <b>squeezed</b> <b>my</b> arm, and, {{altering}} his course, sheered wide of the porch, as though he had not had any idea of entering. This evident evasion induced me to notice the orator more particularly. He was meagre, but active in his make, with a long, pale, bilious face; a black beard, so ill-shaven as to bloody his shirt-collar, a feverish eye, and a hat sharpened up at the sides, into a most pragmatical shape. He had a newspaper in his hand, and seemed to be commenting on its contents, to the thorough conviction of mine host.|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you, Corny," [...] he said, <b>squeezing</b> <b>my</b> hand, as I left him; [...] "improve the {{opportunity}} {{in your own}} way, for I assure you I shall do it in mine. It is present valour against past valour. If it were not my own case that is concerned, {{there is not a}} man living to whom I should more freely wish success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you, Corny, my dear boy," [...] Herman Mordaunt answered, <b>squeezing</b> <b>my</b> {{hand with}} fervour. [...] "God bless you, and {{enable you to}} protect her. I {{was about to ask}} you to change seats with me; but, on the whole, I think my child will be safer with you than she could be with me. We will await God's {{pleasure}} as accident has placed us." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Something Is <b>Squeezing</b> <b>My</b> Skull" [...] is a {{song with}} lyrics by Morrissey and music by Alain Whyte. The song is the second single to be {{released}} from Morrissey's 2009 album Years of Refusal. [...] It was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Jerry Finn, the man behind 2004’s You Are the Quarry. The single was released on 27 April 2009 and reached #46 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|R
