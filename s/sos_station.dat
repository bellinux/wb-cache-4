50|$|In the example, a 100% intake {{pressure}} recovery is assumed, <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> 1 and 2 are coincident.|$|R
5000|$|In High Bridge {{there is}} a 1 mile parcourse trail with 10 or <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> in Voorhees State Park ...|$|R
50|$|In the example, the {{aircraft}} is stationary, <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> 0 and 1 are coincident. Station 1 is not depicted on the diagram.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 - <b>Soest</b> Zuid <b>Station</b> to <b>Soest</b> Central, Soestdijk <b>Station</b> and Soestdijk Noord. Operated by Connexxion. Operates 2x per hour, Evening/Sundays 1x per hour.|$|R
50|$|The Lone Ranger {{was a huge}} {{financial}} success for both Republic and Trendle. The serial also created new interest in the radio version and an additional hundred or <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> picked up the show. King Features even {{came out with a}} comic strip.|$|R
50|$|The station's tracks {{merge into}} a single track {{at both ends of}} the <b>station,</b> <b>so</b> the <b>station</b> would have been served in only one {{direction}} (southbound) had it been opened.|$|R
50|$|Ted Jones {{turned the}} license back {{a couple years}} ago, so as to focus on WKKY. FCC rules now {{prohibit}} the re-licensing of daytime <b>stations,</b> <b>so</b> the <b>station</b> is gone forever.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Soest</b> <b>station</b> is a {{passenger}} {{station in the}} city of Soest in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is on the Hamm-Warburg and the Dortmund-Soest lines. It was also served by passenger trains on the Möhne Valley Railway (Möhnetalbahn) from 1899 to 1960.|$|R
5000|$|At any one time, {{the program}} {{is likely to be}} airing on 40 or <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> in the United States, and on such {{specialized}} outlets as Armed Forces Radio and the International Space Station, and occasional overseas radio. The program is made available free of charge and reporting of its use is not enforceable.|$|R
50|$|The Den Dolder-Baarn railway is {{a railway}} {{line in the}} Netherlands running from Den Dolder to Baarn, passing through Soest. It is also called the Stichtse lijn ("Sticht line") in Dutch. It is {{operated}} by the Nederlandse Spoorwegen. The railway line is 11 km long. The line is single track, with a passing place at <b>Soest</b> <b>Station.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} at the Plaza de Europa and is 300 m from the border with the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. Gibraltar does not have its own long {{distance}} bus <b>station</b> <b>so</b> this <b>station</b> also serves Gibraltarians who wish to travel through Spain by bus.|$|R

60|$|The {{next morning}} as Mr. Morris, the butcher, was driving past the Port house at rather a rapid rate {{for a man}} with a heavy wagon, Miss Maria {{appeared}} at her door with her bonnet on. She ran out {{into the middle of the}} street, and <b>so</b> <b>stationed</b> herself that Mr. Morris was obliged to stop. Then, without speaking, she clambered up to the seat beside him.|$|R
5000|$|... 74 - <b>Soest</b> Zuid <b>Station</b> tot Amersfoort. Operated by Connexxion. 2x {{per hour}}, 4x per hour at peak times.|$|R
5000|$|Gala-Yuzawa Station {{serves the}} nearby ski resort Gala Yuzawa (ski lifts operate {{directly}} from the <b>station),</b> <b>so</b> the <b>station</b> is only used during the winter period. During the skiing season, Tanigawa services from Tokyo are extended to run to Gala-Yuzawa. All trains on the line are classified as [...] "limited express", so a limited express surcharge is required.|$|R
5000|$|... 70 - Hilversum to <b>Soest</b> Zuid <b>Station</b> and Amersfoort. Operated by Connexxion. 2x {{per hour}}, 4x per hour at peak times.|$|R
5000|$|... 21 - <b>Soest</b> Zuid <b>Station</b> to <b>Soest</b> West and Soestdijk Noord. Operated by Connexxion. Operates 2x per hour, No Evening/Weekend service.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} relay <b>stations</b> <b>so</b> its signal also reaches the {{farthest}} departments. The station has relay <b>stations</b> <b>so</b> its signal also reaches the farthest departments. There repeaters in several locations thus covering the whole province of San Juan: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{situated}} underneath the mainline station {{of the same}} name, <b>so</b> this <b>station</b> is an interchange with the regional railway FR3.|$|R
5000|$|The product {{moves along}} a line, <b>so</b> {{bottlenecks}} (<b>stations</b> that {{need more time}} than planned) are easily identified when the product does not move on in time.|$|R
5000|$|... "Calvary hill" [...] today {{refers to}} a roughly life-size {{depiction}} of the scene of crucifixion with crucifixes, usually the cross of Jesus and the two criminals, but many are more elaborate, including sculptures of additional figures. These scenes of the crucifixion are set up on small hillocks, which may be natural or artificial. Often 14 or <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> of the cross are {{laid out on the}} way up to the pilgrimage hill and there is often a small, remote church or chapel located between a few dozen to several hundred metres away.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, {{this station}} was opened as a {{temporary}} terminal station in the middle stage of the Tazawako Line construction and the line was called Hashiba Line. In 1944 (in the World War II) its operation was stopped as Fuyōfukyū Line. After World War II the construction of Tazawako Line was restarted and completed in 1966. But new route plan did not pass this <b>station,</b> <b>so</b> this <b>station</b> was remained operation stopped.|$|R
50|$|His {{requests}} for correspondence were not motivated by money alone. He used the correspondence {{to demonstrate that}} he had a listening audience <b>so</b> radio <b>stations</b> would continue to broadcast his show.|$|R
50|$|Metro Deportivo 18 de Marzo was {{originally}} {{to be named}} Metro Montevideo (from nearby Avenida Montevideo), according to early plans for Line 3, <b>so</b> this <b>station</b> has changed its name twice.|$|R
30|$|The network {{topology}} used to service wind farms with high speed data connectivity {{is that of}} fixed base stations serving numerous fixed subscriber units. Before radio planning can commence, {{it is necessary to}} calculate the distance subscriber units can be from their base <b>station</b> <b>so</b> that base <b>stations</b> can be appropriately placed.|$|R
50|$|However, {{this move}} yielded few {{dividends}} in passenger numbers, <b>so</b> the <b>station</b> was shifted back near its original position on Newton Road in 1902, where it stayed until final closure in 1945.|$|R
50|$|One {{month before}} the N&BR opened a Bill authorising the {{amalgamation}} of the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway with the N&BR came into effect and <b>so</b> Thetford <b>station</b> became a Norfolk Railway asset.|$|R
50|$|FM stereo {{will tend}} to get static more quickly than the {{monophonic}} sound due to its use of subcarriers, <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> may choose to extend the usable part of their range by disabling the stereo generator. Listeners can also choose to disable stereo decoding on the receiver, though loss of the stereo pilot tone causes this to happen automatically. Because this tends to turn on and off when {{at the threshold of}} reception, and the threshold is often set too low by the manufacturer's product design, manually disabling this when {{at the edge of the}} broadcast range prevents the annoying noisy-stereo/quiet-mono switching.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, power {{generation}} was stopped at Bjarnarflag {{in order for}} reconstruction and improvements to generators, turbines and other equipment. More than 60 million Icelandic krona was invested in the reconstruction. There are plans to increase capacity by adding extra turbines and enlarging {{the size of the}} power station, but these plans have met with some resistance in the Reykjavik area. The people who live in north of Iceland and especially around Myvatn Area have always been positive about plans to make Bjarnarflag geothermal power <b>station</b> bigger <b>so</b> the geothermal power could be used more efficiently <b>so</b> <b>station</b> can make more energy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Soest</b> <b>station</b> was {{extensively}} renovated and refurbished up to 2010 to {{meet its}} role as both a regional station {{as well as a}} (touristic) gateway to the city. In addition to the renovation of the building and its environment, about five hectares of industrial land has been created. The building of a new underpass gives direct access to {{the north side of the}} town. In addition, the level of platform 1 was raised. In addition, the station has new retail, sanitary facilities and automatic teller machines on the ground floor with office space on the upper floors.|$|R
50|$|The Tappan Zee Bridge is not {{far from}} the <b>station,</b> <b>so</b> the <b>station</b> sees some use by {{commuter}}s from Rockland County. As of August 2006, daily commuter ridership was 2677 and there are 909 parking spots, fewer than 100 of which are owned by the railroad.Historically, the New York Central Railroad offered intercity service to Chicago along the Water Level Route, from the station. Amtrak does not offer this service. The closest station long distance passenger service is Yonkers.|$|R
50|$|The station {{buildings}} {{have been sold}} into private ownership and <b>so</b> this <b>station</b> is unstaffed. There are no ticket issuing facilities available at the station although these can generally be purchased from the train conductor.|$|R
50|$|The working {{title of}} the book was The Company War, but Cherryh's editor at DAW, Donald A. Wollheim, {{believed}} that the moniker lacked commercial appeal, <b>so</b> Downbelow <b>Station</b> was selected as the title for publication.|$|R
25|$|During early {{experiments}} with LORAN's skywaves, Jack Pierce noticed that {{at night the}} reflective layer in the ionosphere was quite stable. This led {{to the possibility that}} two LORAN stations could be synchronized using skywave signals, at least at night, allowing them to be separated over much greater distances. Accuracy of a hyperbolic system {{is a function of the}} baseline distance, <b>so</b> if the <b>stations</b> could be spread out, the system would become more accurate, <b>so</b> fewer <b>stations</b> would be needed.|$|R
50|$|The town {{boasts a}} railway station {{that was once}} part of the Main North Line. These days the line is closed at this point <b>so</b> the <b>station</b> is not in use. The {{buildings}} have been reused.|$|R
50|$|On November 11, 1990, Amtrak rerouted the Capitol Limited and Broadway Limited off {{the former}} Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway so that Conrail could {{abandoned}} the lightly-used line. The Broadway Limited was rerouted onto a former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line through Garrett, while the Capitol Limited {{was moved to}} the Lake Shore Limited route. The changes meant that Fort Wayne lost rail service, <b>so</b> <b>stations</b> were established in nearby small towns on the new routes; Waterloo station was opened with a single platform and a small plexiglass shelter. An Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach bus connection to Fort Wayne ran until April 2, 1994.|$|R
