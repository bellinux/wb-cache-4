Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate {{millions of dollars in}} sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: [...] "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive.

Therefore, this research applied the theories of feminism and children’s empowerment in relation to children’s literature. To analyze the data, this research used qualitative descriptive content analysis. The data of the research were the words, phrases, clauses and sentences related to (1) the harms that gender inequality put on female children in Taliban society, (2) the struggles of the main character of female child, Parvana, against gender inequality in Taliban society, and (3) the <b>significant</b> <b>meanings</b> of Parvana’s struggles in Taliban society which are embedded in Deborah Ellis’ The Breadwinner. The primary instrument in this research was the researcher herself while the secondary instruments were any media and devices which contributed to the data collection and the data analysis. To ensure the data trustworthiness, triangulation was applied in this research. The results of this research show that there are three harms that gender inequality does to female children in Taliban society: fear and lack of confidence, desperation and unwillingness to struggle, and dependency. Parvana as the main female child character in the story does some struggles against gender inequality in Taliban society, namely disguising as a boy to become a breadwinner and fulfill other needs of the family, optimizing her attempts to save her family, encouraging her family, and helping other women to survive. The study also reveals that there are three <b>significant</b> <b>meanings</b> of Parvana’s struggles in Taliban society: boosting her self-esteem, improving a sense of pride on herself, and arousing a feeling of satisfaction of her efforts...|$|R

Its first appearance was in 1992 when Erica stumbled upon it during a storm and was stranded there with Dimitri. From that point until Dimitri left Pine Valley in 2001 it appeared repeatedly. In this place Dimitri forced Erica to admit her feelings for him and they made love for the first time. He also gave her the lodge as a wedding present.

Even when they moved on with other people Dimitri took Erica there when she was in a moment of distress and in need of comfort. It is sometimes referred to as their [...] "port in the storm" [...] because the lodge literally provided them shelter during a thunderstorm during the beginning of their storyline.
