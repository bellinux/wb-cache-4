5|$|Barkley {{played the}} power forward position, but {{occasionally}} played <b>small</b> <b>forward</b> and center. He {{was known for}} his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Small</b> <b>forwards</b> have {{a variety}} of assets, such as quickness and {{strength}} inside. One common thread among all kinds of <b>small</b> <b>forwards</b> is an ability to [...] "get to the line" [...] and draw fouls by aggressively attempting (post up) plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. As such, accurate foul shooting is a common skill for <b>small</b> <b>forwards,</b> many of whom record a large portion of their points from the foul line. Besides being able to drive to the basket, they are also good shooters from long-range. Some <b>small</b> <b>forwards</b> have good passing skills, allowing them to assume point guard responsibilities known as point <b>forwards.</b> <b>Small</b> <b>forwards</b> {{should be able to do}} a little bit of everything on the court, typically playing roles such as swingmen and defensive specialists.

5000|$|One {{common thread}} among {{all kinds of}} <b>small</b> <b>forwards</b> is an ability to [...] "get to the line", that is, having {{opposing}} players called for committing shooting fouls against them, as fouls are frequently called on the defense when offensive players [...] "take the ball hard" [...] to the basket; that is, the offensive players aggressively attempt post-up plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. Therefore, accurate foul shooting is an imperative skill for <b>small</b> <b>forwards,</b> many of whom record {{a large portion of}} their points at the foul line. <b>Small</b> <b>forwards</b> who are defensive specialists are very versatile as they can often guard multiple positions using their size, speed, and strength such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.|$|R

Bosh was given a three-year contract extension, while Maurizio Gherardini of Benetton Treviso was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.|$|E
5|$|Barkley also possessed {{considerable}} defensive talents led by {{an aggressive}} demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position {{and leader of the}} highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the <b>small</b> <b>forward</b> and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability {{made him one of the}} few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block.|$|E

In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of Internet routing is scalability; routers require a fast-path forwarding table entry for every IP prefix announced in the Internet. A second major challenge is providing multiple paths: using only a single route to each destination leads to unreliability and suboptimal path quality. We address those two problems in a new protocol, pathlet routing, in which networks advertise fragments of paths (pathlets) which sources concatenate into endto-end source routes. Intuitively, the pathlet is a highly flexible building block, capturing policy constraints as well as enabling an exponentially large number of path choices. In particular, we show that pathlet routing can emulate the policies of BGP, source routing, and several recent multipath proposals. This flexibility allows pathlet routing to address the two key challenges of scalability and multiple paths. When a router’s routing policy has only ”local ” constraints, it can be represented using {{a small number of}} pathlets, leading to very <b>small</b> <b>forwarding</b> tables and many choices of routes for senders. Crucially, pathlet routing does not impose a global requirement on what style of policy is used, but rather allows multiple styles to coexist. A somewhat surprising consequence of our architecture is that routers that use local policies obtain the immediate benefit of <b>small</b> <b>forwarding</b> tables, regardless of what the other routers choose. Pathlet routing thus supports complex routing policies while enabling and incentivizing the adoption of policies that yield <b>small</b> <b>forwarding</b> plane state and a high degree of path choice. 1...|$|R

5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best <b>small</b> <b>forward</b> and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but was defeated by superior competition.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} by analysts, the team easily secured a {{berth in the}} 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals {{for the first time}} in franchise history. Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend <b>small</b> <b>forward</b> Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim. Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 6. Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a <b>small</b> <b>forward,</b> and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself {{as one of the best}} rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.|$|E
