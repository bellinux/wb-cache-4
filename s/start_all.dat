25|$|Depending on {{the type}} {{and size of the}} race, there may be any of the {{following}} methods implemented to start the race.

25|$|Several {{cars were}} {{conceived}} by Henry Ford from {{the founding of}} the company in 1903 before the Model T was introduced.

25|$|Alexander Maconochie, a Scottish {{geographer}} and {{captain in}} the Royal Navy, introduced the modern idea of parole when, in 1840, he was appointed superintendent of the British penal colonies in Norfolk Island, Australia. He developed a plan {{to prepare them for}} eventual return to society that involved three grades. The first two consisted of promotions earned through good behaviour, labour, and study. The third grade in the system involved conditional liberty outside of prison while obeying rules. A violation would return them to prison and they would <b>start</b> <b>all</b> over again through the ranks of the three-grade process. He reformed its ticket of leave system, instituting what many consider the world's first parole system. Prisoners served indeterminate sentences from which they could be released early if they showed evidence of rehabilitation through participation in a graded classification system based on a unit of exchange called a mark. Prisoners earned marks through good behavior, lost them through bad behavior, and could spend them on passage to higher classification statuses ultimately conveying freedom.|$|E
