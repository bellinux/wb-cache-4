5000|$|The same {{geographic}} {{names have}} historically been used by emigrant settlers to denote their new homes, leading to referential ambiguity of place names. Sometimes, the original name gets modified (as in [...] "York" [...] vs. [...] "New York"). In many cases, a name is reused without modification ("Boston" [...] in England, UK vs. [...] "Boston" [...] in Massachusetts, USA). To map a set of place names or toponyms that occur in a document to their corresponding latitude/longitude coordinates, a polygon, or any other <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint,</b> a disambiguation step is necessary. A toponym resolution algorithm is an automatic method that performs a mapping from a toponym to a <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint.</b>|$|E

These applications require arrays of many small elements to selectively record the sound waves coming from a certain direction. Here we present proof of concept of an optical micro-machined ultrasound sensor (OMUS) fabricated with a semi-industrial CMOS fabrication line. The sensor is based on integrated photonics, which allows for elements with small <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint.</b> We demonstrate that the first prototype is already capable of detecting pressures of 0. 4 ?Pa, which matches the performance {{of the state of the}} art piezo-electric transducers while having a 65 times smaller <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint.</b> The sensor is compatible with MRI due to the lack of electronical wiring.

A good agreement is found between MOPITT and MOZAIC/IAGOS measurements, consistent with results from earlier studies using different validation data and despite large variability in MOPITT CO total columns along the <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint</b> of the MOZAIC/IAGOS measurements. Validation results improve when taking the large <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint</b> of the MOZAIC/IAGOS data into account. No statistically significant drift was detected in the validation results over the period 2002 – 2010 at global, continental and local (airport) scales. Furthermore, for those situations where MOZAIC/IAGOS measurements differed from the MOPITT a priori, the MOPITT measurements clearly outperformed the MOPITT a priori data, indicating that MOPITT NIR retrievals add value to the MOPITT a priori. Results from a high spatial resolution simulation of the chemistry-transport model MOCAGE (MOdèle de Chimie Atmosphérique à Grande Echelle) showed that the most likely explanation for the large MOPITT variability along the MOZAIC-IAGOS profile flight path is related to spatio-temporal CO variability, which {{should be kept in}} mind when using MOZAIC/IAGOS profile measurements for validating satellite nadir observations...|$|E

30|$|Based on our {{historical}} simulation using the climate-to-fishery model, {{we suggest that}} {{the influence of the}} regime shift had both temporal (seasonal) and <b>spatial</b> <b>footprints.</b> The causes emerge due to the different responses to the regime shift by anchovy and sardine in relation to their particular ecology. The possibility that anchovy is more sensitive to changes in coastal upwelling than sardine has been suggested by Rykaczewski and Checkley (2008). This finding is also supported by an earlier analysis using the same model as used here (Fiechter et al. 2015), which found that the primary factor controlling anchovy population abundance in the CCS was changes in egg production associated with varying adult growth conditions (i.e., prey availability) in the coastal upwelling region. Our results support this hypothesis by explaining the underlying process of how the changes in coastal upwelling affected anchovy and sardine. Furthermore, we find that considering temporal variability within the year is crucial for understanding the niche differences between sardine and anchovy (e.g., Fig.  20).|$|R
40|$|Background: The Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery (ECOTF) for {{penaeid shrimp}} fishes within Australia’s Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). The {{past decade has}} seen the {{implementation}} of conservation and fisheries management strategies to reduce {{the impact of the}} ECOTF on the seabed and improve biodiversity conservation. New information from electronic vessel location monitoring systems (VMS) provides an opportunity to review the interactions between the ECOTF and spatial closures for biodiversity conservation. Methodology and Results: We used fishing metrics and spatial information on the distribution of closures and modelled VMS data in a geographical information system (GIS) to assess change in effort of the trawl fishery from 2001 – 2009 and to quantify the exposure of 70 reef, non-reef and deep water bioregions to trawl fishing. The number of trawlers and the number of days fished almost halved between 2001 and 2009 and new spatial closures introduced in 2004 reduced the area zoned available for trawl fishing by 33 %. However, we found that there was only a relatively minor change in the <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint</b> of the fishery as a result of new spatial closures. Non-reef bioregions benefited the most from new spatial closures followed by deep and reef bioregions.

Most efforts concentrate on predicting the value of response variable {{in terms of}} controlling variables either through a physical model or a regression model. However, many geospatial systems comprises complex, nonlinear, and spatially non-uniform relationships, making it difficult to even formulate a viable model. This paper focuses on spatial partitioning of controlling variables that are attributed to a particular range of a response variable. Thus, the presented method surveys spatially distributed relationships between predictors and response. The method is based on association analysis technique of identifying emerging patterns, which is extended in order to be applied more effectively to geospatial data sets. The outcome of the method is a list of <b>spatial</b> <b>footprints,</b> each characterized by a unique “controlling pattern”—a list of specific values of predictors that locally correlate with a specified value of response variable.

This study documented long-term changes in core fishing areas of a major recreational fishery in Alaska and identified biological, regulatory, social, and economic drivers of spatial fishing patterns by charter operators. Using participatory mapping and in-person interviews, we characterized the <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint</b> of 46 charter operators in the communities of Sitka and Homer since the 1990 s. The <b>spatial</b> <b>footprint</b> differed between Homer and Sitka respondents, with Homer operators consistently using larger areas for Pacific halibut than Sitka operators. Homer and Sitka showed opposite trends in core fishing location area over time, with an overall decrease in Homer and an overall increase in Sitka. For both Sitka and Homer respondents, the range of areas fished was greater for Pacific halibut than for rockfish/lingcod or Pacific salmon. Spatial patterns were qualitatively different between businesses specializing in single species trips and those that operated multispecies trips and between businesses with one vessel and those with multiple vessels. In Homer, the most frequently cited reasons for changes in the location and/or extent of fishing were changes in trip type and the price of fuel, while in Sitka, the most frequently cited reasons for spatial shifts were changes to Pacific halibut regulations and gaining experience or exploring new locations. The diversity of charter fishing strategies in Alaska may allow individual charter operators to respond differently to perturbations and thus maintain resilience of the industry as a whole to social, environmental, and regulatory change.

Some system effects can be estimated from these documents directly (for example, the use of electricity by the airport). However, others need further assessment. The most significant {{of these is the}} modal shift of air passengers between surface access modes. The Thames Hub Vision proposal documents suggest that 60 per cent of passenger arrivals and departures could be serviced by rail. This is a major increase from current levels at Heathrow (less than 30 per cent by rail or London Underground (Heathrow Airport Limited 2014)). A strict traffic management approach is proposed, limiting onsite parking and providing extensive park and ride facilities at the rail orbital stations, such that the orbital becomes an extended rail shuttle service. A model of potential surface access changes has been created based on origin–destination data for Heathrow (Civil Aviation Authority 2003), with passengers whose journey length has increased and who pass an orbital station on route to the airport, assumed to be open to a modal shift from car to rail. A full list of assumptions used within the modal shift analysis is included in the Additional file 1.

First, we had identified gazetteers as {{a key component of}} our architecture for distributed geospatial digital libraries, but having only one instance of a gazetteer to go by (ours), it was unclear which features digital libraries could generally expect from gazetteers, and which were artifacts of our implementation. Second, our initial work on gazetteers was largely content-based, having focused on developing the ADL Gazetteer Content Standard (GCS) [1], and a protocol would provide a complementary, functional definition of a gazetteer as a type of knowledge organization system. Thus in 2001 we collaborated with ESRI to create the ADL Gazetteer Protocol [2]. In the interest of interoperability, the protocol defines a simplified gazetteer model that is compatible with the GCS, but omits much of the latter’s elaborate details such as temporal qualification and lineage.

The δ 18 O record is {{interpreted}} as a proxy for South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) intensity and allows the reconstruction of its variability during the last 1600 years. Two periods of anomalous changes in the climate mean state corresponding to the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) periods identified in the Northern Hemisphere are recognized in the record, in which decreased and increased SASM activity, respectively, have been documented. Variations in SASM activity between the MCA and the LIA seem to be larger over the northern part of the continent, suggesting a latitudinal dependence of the MCA footprint. Our results, based on time series, composite and wavelet analyses, suggest that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) plays an relevant role for SASM modulation on multidecadal scales (∼ 65 years), especially during dry periods such as the MCA.
