5|$|The BBRC {{conducted}} a detailed review into the controversial {{identification of a}} curlew seen at Druridge Bay in Northumberland in 1998, coming {{to the conclusion that}} it was, as had been believed by many observers, a first-summer <b>slender-billed</b> curlew. This identification was accepted by the British Ornithologists Union's Records Committee, leading to the addition of this species to the British List. The record is currently being reviewed again by BBRC to establish whether this earlier decision should be upheld.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} very similar in {{appearance}} to the Fea's petrel, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be obvious in the most <b>slender-billed</b> examples, which are probably mostly females, but {{can be difficult to}} determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the underwing. The wing panel is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but P. feae deserti sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.|$|E
25|$|Norfolk Island, with {{neighbouring}} Nepean Island, {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the entire populations of white-chested and <b>slender-billed</b> white-eyes, Norfolk parakeets and Norfolk gerygones, as well as over 1% of the world populations of wedge-tailed shearwaters and red-tailed tropicbirds. Nearby Phillip Island is treated as a separate IBA.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the winter}} {{migrants}} seen here are greater flamingo, Kentish plover, lesser sand plover, Pacific golden plover, grey plover, common sandpiper, curlew sandpiper, Eurasian curlew, osprey, little stint, Temminck's stint, black-tailed godwit, common redshank, greenshank, common tern, little tern, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern, Caspian tern, brown-headed gull, Pallas's gull, <b>slender-billed</b> gull, painted stork, openbill stork and grey heron. Thousands of Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, northern shoveller also use the backwaters.|$|E
25|$|Extinctions include {{that of the}} endemic Norfolk kākā and Norfolk ground dove {{along with}} endemic {{subspecies}} of pigeon, starling, triller, thrush and boobook owl, though the latter's genes persist in a hybrid population descended from the last female. Other endemic birds are the white-chested white-eye, which may be extinct, the Norfolk parakeet, the Norfolk gerygone, the <b>slender-billed</b> white-eye and endemic subspecies of the Pacific robin and golden whistler.|$|E
25|$|Far {{more recent}} {{possible}} or presumed extinctions of species which {{may turn out}} still to exist include the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the Japanese wolf (Canis lupus hodophilax), last sighted over 100 years ago; the ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the <b>slender-billed</b> curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), not seen since 2007.|$|E
25|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in Egypt, {{especially in the}} Nile Valley and the Delta region. Birds of prey include vultures, eagles, hawks, falcons and owls. Other large birds include storks, flamingoes, herons, egrets, pelicans, quail, sunbirds and golden orioles. About four hundred and eighty species of bird have been recorded, the globally endangered ones being the red-breasted goose, white-headed duck, Balearic shearwater, Egyptian vulture, Rüppell's vulture, sociable lapwing, <b>slender-billed</b> curlew, saker falcon and yellow-breasted bunting. Egypt is on a major bird migratory route between Eurasia and East Africa and around two hundred species of migrants pass through twice a year.|$|E
25|$|The diets of the {{starlings}} {{are usually}} dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example white sandalwood, Indian Banyan. In addition to trees {{they are also}} important dispersers of parasitic mistletoes. In South Africa, the red-winged starling is an important disperser of the introduced Acacia cyclops. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, {{which led to the}} speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol. Laboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly. In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume nectar. The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown, but at least some are, such as the <b>slender-billed</b> starling of alpine East Africa, which pollinates giant lobelias.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, southern giant petrel, snow petrel, <b>slender-billed</b> prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the king penguin, wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern giant petrel, Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, great shearwater, common diving petrel, south polar skua and parasitic jaeger.|$|E
500|$|Pamela Rasmussen’s {{interest}} in Asian birds {{led to her}} involvement in more specifically conservation-directed projects. Two Gyps vultures, the Indian white-rumped vulture, Gyps bengalensis, and the [...] "long-billed vulture" [...] suffered a 99 percent population decrease in South Asia due to poisoning by diclofenac, a veterinary drug that causes kidney failure in birds that have eaten the carcasses of treated cattle. Rasmussen showed {{that there are two}} distinct species of long-billed vulture: the Indian vulture G. indicus and <b>slender-billed</b> vulture G. tenuirostris. This is important to conservation, since a captive-breeding program has been established to assist the recovery of at-risk vulture species.|$|E
500|$|Many of the shearwaters in {{the genus}} Puffinus are {{proficient}} divers. While {{it has long}} been known that they regularly dive from the surface to pursue prey, using both their wings and feet for propulsion, the depth that they are able to dive to was not appreciated (or anticipated) until scientists began to deploy maximum-depth recorders on foraging birds. Studies of both long-distance migrants such as the sooty shearwater and more sedentary species such as the black-vented shearwater have shown maximum diving depths of [...] and [...] Tropical shearwaters, such as the wedge-tailed shearwater and the Audubon's shearwater, also dive in order to hunt, making the shearwaters the only tropical seabirds capable of exploiting that ecological niche (all other tropical seabirds feed close to the surface). Many other species of procellariid, from white-chinned petrels to <b>slender-billed</b> prions, dive to a couple of metres below the surface, though not as proficiently or as frequently as the shearwaters.|$|E

2500|$|Kaziranga hosts a {{large number}} of raptors, {{considered}} a sign of a healthy ecosystem. This includes the rare eastern imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle, white-tailed fishing eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle and the lesser kestrel. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. About 99% of the stable vulture population was killed by kidney failure caused by consuming the veterinary drug diclofenac in domestic animal carcasses. Of these, the red-headed vulture, and Eurasian black vulture are still near threatened due to their large range, but the Indian vulture, <b>slender-billed</b> vulture and the Indian white-rumped vulture have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have similar losses [...] the griffon vulture and the Himalayan griffon, but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of this many vultures creates a critical void in the scavengers ecological niche in Kaziranga.|$|E

50|$|The diet of the <b>Slender-billed</b> Grackle {{consisted}} of animals, plants and fruits. It mainly ate worms, flies and maize. The <b>Slender-billed</b> Grackle {{also tended to}} group and form flocks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slender-billed</b> greenbul was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Andropadus and was re-classified to the genus Stelgidillas in 2010. Alternatively, some authorities classify the <b>slender-billed</b> greenbul in the genus Pycnonotus. Alternate names for the <b>slender-billed</b> greenbul include the Cameroon sombre greenbul and Cameroon greenbul. The latter name {{should not be confused}} with the species of the same name, Arizelocichla montana.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Slender-billed</b> grackle is {{believed}} to have gone extinct around 100 years ago, after disappearing from the Valley of Mexico. The only known habitats for the <b>slender-billed</b> grackle were the marshes and wetlands of Mexico. Reportings of grackles nesting in urban areas also exist, but this {{is believed}} to have been a response to loss of habitat due to the conversion of marshes to farmland. <b>Slender-billed</b> grackles had also been observed nesting in cultivated farm land near towns, but much of this land was cultivated marshland.|$|E
