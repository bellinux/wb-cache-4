2500|$|That same day, Wurzelbacher also {{appeared}} on Good Morning America. Diane Sawyer {{asked him if}} he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> [...] "No, not even close." [...] Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, [...] "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you and tell you {{that you were going to}} be a major part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" [...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help it," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> light in her eyes. [...] "No, indeed, I could not. I was riding along the lane by Lade Wood, on my white palfrey, when in the great dark glade there stood one, two, three great men with guns, and when one {{took hold of the}} damsel's bridle and told her to come with him, what could she do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You didn't dodge that bullet sharp enough, Sam," [...] Peter <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> as the negro's shako {{was carried}} {{off with a}} ball.|$|E
6000|$|... “Come on, Wilcox,” Stephen <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> “Don’t stand staring there. Dinner is ready, and I am only {{waiting for}} you to begin.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{would think}} you doubted my honesty," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> though his colour rose {{in a quick}} resentfulness {{frequent}} with him.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are unusually enthusiastic, cousin," [...] <b>said</b> Emma, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "I {{thought you}} said last night that weather never {{affected}} you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Oh, surely not,’ <b>said</b> I, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> ‘Earlyish, if you like!’ {{which brought}} me finally beyond him, highly pleased with my success.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{you know}} me, mother?' he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> And on hearing his voice the good woman nearly {{fell to the}} ground with astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] I <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> and {{bounding}} down to {{the front}} gate, where I had left my bicycle, I mounted and rode away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "I am the Dimbula, of course. I've {{never been}} {{anything}} else except that--and a fool!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{depends upon}} {{what else you}} say. Look here, now, Eunice!" [...] Dan <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> mixture of fun and earnest, [...] "what {{are you going to}} say to mother? It's no use, being disagreeable, is it? Of course, I don't contend for ideal {{perfection}} anywhere, and I don't expect it. But there isn't anything experimental about this thing, and don't you think we had better all make the best of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't be <b>an</b> ass,' <b>said</b> Pringle, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> {{which should}} have been careless, but was in reality merely feeble. 'She's quite a kid.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to time," [...] <b>said</b> John <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "I {{believe that}} may be {{dispensed}} with, though money is certainly a different thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{have you}} not {{presented}} him to us already?" [...] Madame de Chevreuse <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "Your memory must be singularly short, colonel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} we need fret very much if the Britishers have grown frightened," [...] I <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> and Uncle 'Rasmus replied: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Misfortunes {{never come}} alone," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "We must get on. If I find the descent difficult, you must help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Without the {{slightest}} trouble," [...] <b>said</b> Vallance, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "I lunched there yesterday. To-night I couldn't buy a five-cent cup of coffee." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "From the Old Country," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "and a bit high-handed, but there's sand in him. Do {{you know}} {{anything}} about Allenwood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe you}} care a button for the Dutch painters," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "But I shall {{certainly}} write you a letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfortunately, you and Alice have monopolized the attentions of {{the only}} two {{eligible}} young men at the fort," [...] <b>said</b> Betty, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{she knows}} there's been some misunderstanding," [...] <b>said</b> Dan, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> that was anxious, {{in view of}} the clouds {{possibly}} gathering again.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{about the}} five philosophers?" [...] <b>said</b> Helen, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> {{stitching}} firmly and swiftly at her canvas. [...] "I wish you'd describe them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I shall {{work hard}} to become a fair swordsman," [...] Desmond <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "I suppose {{there is plenty of}} time to spare." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And my prospectus," [...] <b>said</b> Shandon, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> and <b>a</b> sner; [...] "do you {{consider}} that was a work of mathematical accuracy of statement?" ...|$|R
