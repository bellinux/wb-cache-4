5|$|Scully {{performs}} Jimmy's autopsy {{when she}} is attacked by an agent who injects something into her, causing her to collapse. After being confronted by Byers, Susanne reveals that she is pretending to have switched sides so she, along with her fiancee Grant Ellis, can <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> on the government's harmful initiatives. She works alongside the Gunmen to set up Grant, whom she discovers has been lying to her.|$|E
5|$|<b>Slow</b> <b>progress</b> in {{preventing}} the disease may in part {{be due to}} stigma associated with TB. Stigma {{may be due to}} the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS. Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore County Planning Commission first {{conceived}} the Baltimore Beltway as a county-level roadway project in 1949; by 1953 {{the project was}} taken over by the state due to <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> at the county level. The project was included as part of the Interstate Highway System by 1956, increasing the speed of construction due to federal funds available.|$|E
50|$|The {{humanitarian}} crisis {{due to the}} 2015 earthquakes created new problems {{for the people and}} <b>slowed</b> <b>progress</b> towards achieving justice.|$|R
2500|$|The Mississippi Choctaws' {{improvements}} {{may have}} continued if it wasn't dramatically interrupted by world events. World War I <b>slowed</b> down <b>progress</b> for the Indians as Washington's [...] bureaucracy {{focused on the}} war. Some Mississippi Choctaws also served during the war. The Spanish Influenza also <b>slowed</b> <b>progress</b> as many Choctaws {{were killed by the}} world-wide epidemic.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} short cuts this, in time, he found had its drawbacks, and {{possibly}} the <b>slower</b> <b>progress</b> of the railway might in the end have been better.|$|R
5|$|VOC–Mataram forces made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> {{against the}} rebels. By the {{beginning}} of 1678 their control was limited to several towns in the central northern coast. In 1678 Speelman became the Director-General of the VOC, replacing Rijcklof van Goens, who became Governor-General (Speelman would become Governor-General in 1681). His command in Jepara was handed over to Anthonio Hurdt, who arrived in June 1678.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg {{demonstrated}} {{with ten}} civic leaders {{in front of}} the NYSDOT building in East Meadow about the <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> of construction on the NY102 (Front Street) overpass. Construction was causing rush hour traffic to back up for miles near the Hempstead Turnpike (NY24) exit, and evidence showed no work had been done for several months. After residents and commuters started demanding answers, NYSDOT stated that a project that began as just basic bridge repair had become a larger-scale project that required a redesign {{due to the fact that}} the bridge had more damage than initially realized.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September, XXXVI Corps {{launched}} a frontal assault against the Soviet fortifications but made only <b>slow</b> <b>progress.</b> XXXVI Corps attempted another flanking attack similar to Kayrela, with one German regiment trying {{to circumvent the}} Soviet defenses in the south. This time it did not work as well, and the German effort bogged down against heavy resistance. After days of fighting, the Germans were finally able to push behind the Voyta River only to be confronted by another even stronger Soviet defense line. The so-called VL or Verman Line stretched from Lake Verkhneye Verman to Lake Tolvand and included heavy Soviet pre-war fortifications.|$|E
50|$|McNeill and {{his troops}} quickly found {{themselves}} struggling through a dense jungle of mimosa bushes whose low-level branches covered in sharp thorns <b>slowed</b> <b>progress</b> and caused havoc among both troops and transport animals.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sites have}} {{extended}} this gaming style {{by allowing the}} players to see each other's actions as they are made. This allows for real time playing while everyone is online and active, or <b>slower</b> <b>progress</b> if not.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} of what players are calling [...] "pay to win" [...] {{with regards to}} game difficulty scaling steeply and <b>slowing</b> <b>progress</b> to a crawl unless the player pays real money for in game perks and items.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} three days, the JNA made <b>slow</b> <b>progress.</b> Its {{artillery}} attacked Srđ Hill, the Fort Imperial and Žarkovica on 2 October. The next day, the JNA shelled Dubrovnik's Belvedere Hotel, where a ZNG defence post was located, and the Yugoslav Air Force bombarded the city's Argentina Hotel. On 4 October, the JNA 2nd Corps captured Slano in Dubrovačko Primorje, interdicting the Adriatic Highway there and isolating Dubrovnik {{from the rest of}} Croatia. On 5 October, the Ploče district of Dubrovnik was shelled, followed by a Yugoslav Air Force strike on the Fort Imperial the next day.|$|E
5|$|Scheduled {{to land at}} 11:00 on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was re-routed King, {{because the}} gun battery at Le Hamel was still operational. They {{proceeded}} towards their objective of Bayeux. 151st Brigade arrived {{at the same time}} and after meeting fierce resistance, they achieved their objective of controlling the road and railway between Bayeux and Caen. 56th Brigade made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> and had to dig in for the night some distance from Bayeux. 69th Brigade secured the eastern flank and by nightfall made contact with the Canadian forces on Juno.|$|E
5|$|Aayirathil Oruvan languished in {{development}} hell due to <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> of the shoot and the extensive pre- and post-production works, evading release dates ranging one year. Shooting began in July 2007, and {{took place in}} various locations with 2,000 extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and Jaisalmer, Rajasthan amongst other regions throughout India. Uncut, the film runs for over 220 minutes, but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 183 minutes. The film released coinciding with the festival of Thai Pongal on 14 January 2010, with a Telugu dubbing version, titled Yuganikki Okkadu, following six weeks later. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially.|$|E
5000|$|... 2004 Nik {{entered the}} Mitsubishi Championship, {{one of the}} most {{competitive}} one make championships to date. Breaking his arm in the first event of the season <b>slowed</b> <b>progress</b> for the first few rounds, but still finishing the Championship in 3rd position.|$|R
5|$|Navigating {{through the}} smoke <b>slowed</b> <b>progress,</b> and the mistaken use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to {{identify}} their positions—the same colour strategic bombers used to mark targets—led to some bombing of the Canadians and <b>slower</b> <b>progress</b> than planned. On 15 August, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade continued the offensive, but <b>progress</b> remained <b>slow.</b> The 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to Trun. The next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise against minor opposition from Waffen SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.|$|R
50|$|During {{construction}} of the track prior to the 2006 games, there was concern that the track would be completed in time for homologation. A minor archaeological find (Roman ruins) during construction <b>slowed</b> <b>progress</b> until the remains were excavated (near the current Turn 11).|$|R
5|$|American air, artillery, mortar, and {{tank fire}} now {{concentrated}} on Battle Mountain, and I and L Companies prepared another counterattack to retake it. This attack launched soon after, but made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> and at midnight it halted {{to wait for}} daylight. Shortly after dawn on August 22, I and L Companies resumed the attack. L Company moved up the mountain, with I Company supplying a base of fire. Three North Korean grenades wounded six of the troops, causing the rest to retreat without orders from their frustrated commander. They were eventually returned to the hill with some coercion. A few hours later, when a small North Korean force worked around its right flank, the company again withdrew back {{down the hill to}} I Company's position without orders.|$|E
5|$|Due to the band's <b>slow</b> <b>progress,</b> Shields {{contemplated}} relocating to New York City, {{where members}} of his family were living at the time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On the strength of the release, the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances, supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{remained}} in the Admiralty Islands until October, when it boarded ships there for the invasion of Leyte, which it assaulted on 20 October 1944. Chase's 1st Brigade's initial mission was to reconnoiter the hills {{on the west side}} of the Tacloban Valley and establish observation posts from which it could command the entrances to the valley. In November, he was ordered to cover the flank of X Corps' advance up the Leyte Valley, and later into the Ormoc Valley. Chase had to move his brigade across mountainous, roadless, uncharted jungle in frequently appalling wet weather. The advance made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> against Japanese troops that fought tenaciously all the way.|$|E

25|$|Work was <b>slow,</b> <b>progressing</b> at only 8–12feet a week (3–4m). To earn some {{income from}} the tunnel, the company {{directors}} allowed sightseers to view the shield in operation. They charged a shilling for the adventure and an estimated 600–800 visitors {{took advantage of the}} opportunity every day.|$|R
50|$|Children {{are doing}} worse in Sub-Saharan Africa {{than any other}} region. Africa scores 35 in the Index, {{reflecting}} {{the high level of}} deprivation in primary schooling, child health and child nutrition. It is also making the <b>slowest</b> <b>progress,</b> improving child well-being by only 20% over 1990-2006.|$|R
5|$|The Americans recrossed the Matanikau and {{attacked}} westward again beginning on 18 November, but made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> against determined resistance from Japanese forces. The U.S. attack was halted on 23 November at a line {{just west of}} Point Cruz. The Americans and Japanese would remain facing each other in these positions {{for the next six}} weeks, until the ending stages of the campaign when U.S. forces began their final, successful push to drive Japanese forces from the island. Although the Americans had come close to overrunning the Japanese rear areas in the early November offensive, it would not be until the final stages of the campaign that the U.S. finally captured Kokumbona.|$|E
5|$|The Mud Bay force {{travelled}} in Arunta {{and came}} ashore at 23:00 in the Maclaren King, {{two of the}} ship's launches, the three Japanese landing craft and the two powered whaleboats. A base was established at Mud Bay, where a dressing station was prepared and heavy equipment, including all but one 2-inch mortar per company, was cached. The Australians then {{set out on a}} gruelling march to Kilia, guided by Papuan policemen. As they moved off, a violent thunderstorm broke, and it started to rain heavily. The force pushed on toward Kilia, but made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> that night due to the steep terrain and heavy rain. They were still half a mile from Kilia at 08:30 on 23 October, when they encountered the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The deposed Sultan made an {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Kenya and Tanganyika for military assistance, although Tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary {{police officers to}} Zanzibar to contain rioting. Other than the Tanganyika Rifles (formerly the colonial King's African Rifles), the police were the only armed force in Tanganyika, and on 20 January the police absence led the entire Rifles regiment to mutiny. Dissatisfied with their low pay rates and with the <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> of the replacement of their British officers with Africans, the soldiers' mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both Uganda and Kenya. However, order on the African mainland was rapidly restored without serious incident by the British Army and Royal Marines.|$|E
30|$|After 1896, the {{radiation}} risk decreased very fast {{at first and}} more slowly thereafter to nearly zero in 1935. Many victims became quite old, {{partly because of the}} <b>slower</b> <b>progress</b> of tissue reactions at lower radiation doses, partly because of the success of often multiple surgical interventions.|$|R

5|$|While G Company {{held its}} {{positions}} on Hill 179 on September 2 against North Korean attack, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry started an attack northwest toward it at 17:00 from the Chung-ni area. The battalion made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> against formidable North Korean forces. The night was extremely {{dark and the}} terrain along the Kuhe-ri ferry road was mountainous. After fighting throughout the night, the battalion reached a position south of the original defensive positions of G Company, 35th Infantry {{the next day at}} 15:00. A coordinated attack by US armor, artillery, air, and infantry got under way and by 18:00 the battalion had re-established the battle line. In this attack the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry, killed 275 North Koreans and recovered {{a large part of the}} equipment G Company had lost earlier.|$|E
5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} easy {{to get to the}} crest, but it was difficult to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made <b>slow</b> <b>progress</b> and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E
5|$|Although Hudson {{anticipated}} that the trip would take less than a month, it took 56 days. Most of the journey was by water, and ice on the Niagara River, inclement weather and ice on Lake Erie, and unnavigable portions of the Cuyahoga River contributed to the travelers' <b>slow</b> <b>progress.</b> Although ice on Lake Erie and the Buffalo River near Niagara Falls destroyed one boat, the group reached Cleaveland (present-day Cleveland, Ohio) on June 9, 1799. After purchasing more supplies, they set off down the Cuyahoga River. Although Hudson believed that the river could carry their boats {{as far south as}} required, they only reached present-day Northfield on June 20. When the settlers arrived in the vicinity of their parcel they had difficulty locating its four boundary markers, finding the southwest marker in late June. Only one of the two groups herding cattle overland reached the settlement.|$|E
5000|$|Arimaa {{is a new}} game. Therefore, {{the number}} of programmers and amount of time devoted to {{computer}} Arimaa is much less than for computer chess. Computer chess had thousands more programmers and 40 more years than computer Arimaa. The later and smaller effort resulted in less and <b>slower</b> <b>progress</b> in computer Arimaa.|$|R

50|$|While {{the method}} converges under general conditions, it {{typically}} makes <b>slower</b> <b>progress</b> than competing methods. Nonetheless, {{the study of}} relaxation methods remains a core part of linear algebra, because the transformations of relaxation theory provide excellent preconditioners for new methods. Indeed, the choice of preconditioner is often {{more important than the}} choice of iterative method.|$|R
