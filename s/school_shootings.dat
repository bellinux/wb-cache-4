5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG!, {{abbreviated}} SCMRPG!, is a role-playing {{video game}} created by Danny Ledonne and released in April 2005. The game recreates the 1999 Columbine High <b>School</b> <b>shootings</b> near Littleton, Colorado. Players assume {{the roles of}} gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and act out the massacre, with flashbacks relating parts of Harris and Klebold's past experiences. The game begins {{on the day of}} the shootings and follows Harris and Klebold after their suicides to fictional adventures in perdition.|$|E
5|$|Police {{were also}} {{investigating}} whether a copycat element was involved after it emerged that both Saari and Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the gunman in the Jokela school shooting, had bought their guns {{from the same}} store. Both gunmen had taken photographs of themselves in similar poses, and both exchanged videos related to <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> on YouTube and Finnish social networking site IRC-Galleria. In March 2009, Police ruled out contact with Pekka-Eric Auvinen, {{and said that he}} had committed his crimes alone: 200 people were interviewed during the investigation, none of whom said they knew of Saari's plans.|$|E
5|$|When Garth Ennis {{took over}} writing, he {{included}} his trademark representation {{of racism and}} religious fanaticism, as well his depictions of the Falklands War. The most controversial writer, Brian Azzarello, tackled issues such as Neo-Nazism, prison rape and homosexuality. During Warren Ellis' run, he included American <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> in a one-shot issue {{which led to a}} major controversy. In his run, Peter Milligan managed to put punk ideology in the series, with the protagonist trying to reacquire his former punk self, while also characterizing the Conservative government as a demon infestation with the punk subculture fighting against this supposed subversion and abuse. As such, much of Hellblazer's horror often comes in the crisis and controversies of its time. Being set in the UK, many famous British personalities have appeared or made cameos such as Sid Vicious, Margaret Thatcher, Aleister Crowley and Alan Moore.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 Panama City <b>school</b> board <b>shootings</b> {{occurred}} on December 14, 2010, in Panama City, Florida. In the attack, a disgruntled individual, Clay Allen Duke, fired four shots at six Bay District School board members, but missed them all, including the superintendent. Duke was then shot several times by Head of Safety and Security Mike Jones, a retired police officer.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the 1987 Hungerford {{massacre}} and 1996 Dunblane <b>school</b> massacre mass <b>shootings,</b> the United Kingdom enacted tough gun laws and a buyback program to remove guns from private ownership.|$|R
50|$|Many Jewish {{children}} in France {{were afraid to}} go to <b>school</b> after the <b>shootings,</b> and Jewish teenagers reported fears of dressing in a recognisably Jewish manner. Some Israeli politicians called on French Jews to emigrate to Israel to escape the anti-Semitism in France.|$|R
25|$|The Columbine shootings {{influenced}} subsequent <b>school</b> <b>shootings.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the aftermath, {{speculation}} occurred {{about the}} killers' motivation {{and whether the}} murders could have been prevented. Unlike many previous <b>school</b> <b>shootings,</b> both shooters committed suicide, which made the massacre particularly difficult to assess.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to expressed {{concerns over the}} causes of the Columbine High School massacre and other <b>school</b> <b>shootings,</b> some schools have renewed existing anti-bullying policies, in addition to adopting a zero tolerance approach to possession of weapons and threatening behavior by students.|$|E
50|$|After {{the murder}} and <b>shootings,</b> <b>school</b> {{officials}} started a plan to reduce violence in the school. The school was closed for two days as officials held special assemblies concerning school violence. The school officials said that {{of the students who}} appeared at the assemblies at Murray-Wright, half appeared with their parents. This occurred despite fears that few parents would appear.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the {{population}} in South Philadelphia changed from predominantly poor Jewish and Italian immigrant and first-generation children to include low-middle income Afro-American and immigrant Asian-American children. The number of student enrollment from 1960 to 2009 declined from over 1,000 to less than 500 students. There {{had always been a}} significant Black presence at South Philadelphia High School. In the 1960s, each Fall and Spring, fights broke out between majority Italo-American and minority African-American students which either led to or were initiated by neighborhood violence which included white students from Bishop Neumann Catholic High <b>School.</b> Stabbings, <b>shootings,</b> and even homicides were connected to this violence. The school was effectively surrounded by an Italian American community(ties).|$|R
50|$|Incidents of <b>school</b> and {{workplace}} <b>shootings</b> have put {{strong emphasis on}} being more aware of bullying, and consequently {{the need for a}} means to respond to such events have led to a growth in the field of verbal self-defense. Today, more and more individuals are presenting themselves as verbal self-defense experts and offering individual and corporate training, both on and off line, as a way to battle bullying at school, in the workplace and on the Internet.|$|R
25|$|The {{article also}} portrayed <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> in Canada as a Quebec phenomenon, citing Jan Bryan, {{columnist}} for the Montreal Gazette, saying, “Three doesn’t mean anything. But three out of three in Quebec means something.” It also presented the Montreal anglophone community as a small-town, close-knit community.|$|E
25|$|In July 1999, the FBI {{convened a}} major summit on school {{shooters}} in Leesburg, Virginia. Attending were psychologists, psychiatrists, and representatives from recent <b>school</b> <b>shootings,</b> including a large Columbine contingent. Attorney General Janet Reno attended. The FBI eventually published a major report on school shooters, {{though it did}} not pinpoint the causes of any individual case.|$|E
25|$|Societal or mass trauma {{can occur}} {{in a number of}} {{settings}} and typically affects a large group or society. These are instances such as <b>school</b> <b>shootings,</b> terrorist attacks, and natural disaster. A counselor's primary concern when called to these types of crises is to assess people's awareness of resources. Individuals experiencing trauma in large scales {{need to be aware of}} shelters that offer food and water; places that meet their basic necessities for survival.|$|E
40|$|Psychiatry- on {{the high}} school samurai sword slaying in Krugersdorp last year, Szabo 1 and Potterton 2 made some clear-headed {{comments}} about the events that do (or don’t) drive a teenager to commit a school rampage shooting, spree slashing, or other sort of violent, dramatic crime in a public venue. Both highlight the fact that South African society is not new to violence; we are after all, {{considered one of the most}} violent societies in the world. Violent crimes, including homicides and family murders, are part of our daily lives. However this incident, possibly because of its bizarre execution, has captured the country’s attention. Both Szabo 1 and Potterton 2 highlight the fact that violent school-related crimes occur throughout the world. <b>School</b> rampage <b>shootings,</b> such as Columbine, have in fact become commonplace in the United States and have been duplicate...|$|R
50|$|Lanza {{removed the}} hard drive from his {{computer}} and damaged it prior to the shooting, creating a challenge for investigators to recover data. At the time of publication of the final report, {{it had not been}} possible to recover data from it. Police believe that Lanza extensively researched earlier mass shootings, including the 2011 Norway attacks and the 2006 West Nickel Mines School shooting at a one-room school in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania. Police found that Lanza had downloaded videos relating to the Columbine High <b>School</b> massacre, other <b>shootings</b> and two videos of suicide by gunshot.|$|R
50|$|On 20 January 1976, the Meadowlands School Board was {{instructed}} by the circuit inspector that subjects like history, geography and mathematics would be taught {{through the medium}} of Afrikaans. The board unanimously resolved that the medium of instruction in schools under jurisdiction of the Meadowlands School Board from standard 3 to 8 (grade 5 to 10) should be in English. Early in February of the same year, two members of the school board, Mr. Letlape and Mr. Peele were dismissed by the Apartheid education authorities. On 16 June news reached the <b>school</b> of the <b>shootings</b> that were taking place in Soweto. Students here destroyed some landmarks and the next day they organised a march to Orlando Stadium.|$|R
25|$|During the 2000s, Enfield High School has {{restructured}} {{and updated}} its security and discipline policies. After {{events such as}} the September 11th attacks, the Columbine High School Massacre, the Virginia Tech Shootings, and Sandy Hook Elementary <b>School</b> <b>shootings,</b> the school has vowed to make the school a safe and welcoming learning environment for students and staff, through increased security measures, practices of the school lock-down procedure, through the use of security checkpoints, and protective school windows and technological improvements to limit and secure entry into the building.|$|E
25|$|An {{immediate}} controversy arose {{about an}} article regarding the Dawson shootings by journalist Jan Wong, of the Toronto-based Globe and Mail. Three {{days after the}} event, Wong, who {{was born and raised}} in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled Get under the desk, in which she drew a link between all three <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of the Quebec society and its protective language laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{connecting the}} band and <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> continued on October 10, 2007, when 14-year-old SuccessTech Academy student Asa Coon shot four people before committing suicide. After being punched in the face by another student while exiting a bathroom, he shot his attacker – Michael Peek – in the abdomen. Armed with two revolvers, he then proceeded down a hallway, where he wounded another student and two teachers by firing into two occupied classrooms, before entering a nearby bathroom and committing suicide. Coon was wearing a black Marilyn Manson T-shirt during the incident.|$|E
50|$|Torgoff {{was born}} in New York City {{and grew up in}} Glen Cove, on Long Island. He is the son of Bess Kagan and Irving Torgoff, a two time All American {{basketball}} player at LIU who later became a notable player in the NBA as the first “sixth man” in pro basketball history when he played for Red Auerbach’s Washington Capitols. Torgoff grew up playing sports before being swept up in the turbulence of the late 1960s as a teenager, becoming {{one of the leaders of}} the student strike at his high <b>school</b> after the <b>shootings</b> at Kent State in May 1970. He attended SUNY Cortland and the University of Neuchatel, Switzerland, receiving BAs in both History and French.|$|R
50|$|Vecchio was an Italian-immigrant and {{a runaway}} from Opa-locka, Florida where she {{attended}} Westview Junior High <b>School.</b> After the <b>shootings,</b> she bartered her story {{to a local}} reporter {{in exchange for a}} bus ticket to California. She was found by police before she boarded the bus, and sent back to her family, who reportedly later sued T-shirt companies for 40% of the profits of sales featuring Filo's photograph. Following Filo's publication of the photograph through the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review satellite paper Valley Daily News and its subsequent pickup internationally, Florida governor Claude Kirk labelled Vecchio a dissident communist.After Vecchio married Joe Gillum in 1979, the couple moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where Vecchio became a clerk at a coffee shop. She later studied massage therapy and is employed as a respiratory therapist.|$|R
40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} supports {{the position that}} human beings are inherently emotional beings and that emotion and affective development impacts human development and behavior {{in a wide variety of}} important ways. This paper provides an overview of emotion and the affective domain, including developmental considerations and methods that can be used to facilitate development in this domain. Also discussed are instruments and methods to assessment emotional and affective development. Life in America at the dawning of the 21 st century exhibits a complex tapestry of distressful social and cultural problems, including public <b>school</b> and church <b>shootings,</b> racial and ethnic tensions, apathy and cynicism in the political sphere, grave challenges to the family unit, and disturbing levels of youth violence, drug abuse, alcoholism, and teen pregnancy. All of these problems have an important feature in common – they are heavily influenced and, in some cases, dominated by the power of human emotions (Goleman, 1995; Greenspan, 1997; LeDoux, 1996). Most psychologists agree that the study of emotion and the affective domain is one of the most perplexing topics in the field of psychology (Plutchik, 2001). However, even the somewhat confusing picture produced to date has led researchers to conclude that one’s emotiona...|$|R
25|$|The {{anxiety of}} {{heterosexual}} individuals (particularly adolescents whose construction of heterosexual masculinity {{is based in}} part on not being seen as gay) that others may identify them as gay has also been identified by Michael Kimmel as an example of homophobia. The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and suburban American schools, and has been associated with risk-taking behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of <b>school</b> <b>shootings)</b> by boys seeking revenge or trying to assert their masculinity. Homophobic bullying is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{fourth season}} of Degrassi: The Next Generation {{commenced}} airing in Canada on 7 September 2004, concluded on 14 February 2005 and contains twenty-two episodes.

This season depicts {{the lives of}} a group of high school sophomores and juniors as they deal with some of the challenges and issues teenagers face such as bullying, dysfunctional families, <b>school</b> <b>shootings,</b> mental disorders, STDs, disabilities, gambling, homosexuality, and inappropriate student-teacher relationships.|$|E
500|$|Warren Ellis {{took over}} the title in 1999, after his work on Transmetropolitan which {{had moved to the}} Vertigo imprint, {{following}} the closure of Helix Comics. He was meant to become a full-time writer for several years, as Delano, Ennis and Jenkins before him, but left the title early after DC refused to publish the story [...] "Shoot", about high <b>school</b> <b>shootings,</b> following the Columbine High School massacre, despite the fact it had been written and submitted prior to the event.

40|$|In 2013, Everytown began {{tracking}} gunfire {{in schools}} and at college and universities — public reports that a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds — {{and over the next}} three years identified 160 qualifying incidents, including fatal and nonfatal assaults, suicides, and unintentional shootings. In all, these incidents resulted in 59 deaths and 124 non-fatal gunshot injuries. Regardless of the individuals involved in a shooting, or the circumstances that gave rise to it, gunfire {{in schools and}} at colleges and universities undermines the sense of security that all students should have in their learning environments. By tracking this data, Everytown hopes to begin a reasoned discussion about effective means to promote <b>school</b> safety. Of <b>shootings</b> perpetrated by minors at primary and secondary schools and for which the source of the firearm was known, more than half of the kids obtained the gun at home — likely because an adult did not store it locked and unloaded. Twenty-four shootings — nearly one in six — occurred after a confrontation or verbal argument intensified, because of the presence of a gun rather than in spite of it...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{hypothesized}} that {{middle school students}} in schools where students endorse aggressive attitudes {{are less likely to}} report threats of violence. Our statewide sample consisted of 39, 364 7 th and 8 th graders who completed school climate surveys in 423 schools. Students were asked how much they agreed or disagreed with two statements: (1) “If another student brought a gun to school, I would tell one of the teachers or staff at school ” (2) “If another student talked about killing someone, I would tell one of the teachers or staff at school. ” Two multi-level logistic regression analyses found that student reports of aggressive attitudes are associated with a lower likelihood of reporting such incidents. These analyses controlled for student and school demographics. Rationale Authorities agree that student reports are key to the prevention of <b>school</b> shootings; many <b>shootings</b> have been prevented because students were willing to break the code of silence and seek help for a threat of violence. The present study hypothesized that the prevalence of student attitudes that support and justify aggressive behavior will be associated with less willingness to report threats of violence. Study Questions Does the prevalence of aggressive attitudes in middle school make students less likely to report the presence of a gun at a school or a threat to kill someone? Methods and Results The sample included 19, 004 boys (48 %) and 20, 360 girls (52 %) from 423 Virginia public schools.

500|$|Kazmierczak {{described}} himself as a sensitive person in his personal statement for the University of Illinois graduate school. He also felt victimized during his adolescent years. He expressed interest in helping people with mental problems, and wanted to work with people [...] "in need of direction." [...] Although initial reports said there were no signs, he was considered troubled. A story published by Esquire stated that he allegedly had a history of mental illness and attempted suicides, was bullied in high school, and had shown an interest in previous <b>school</b> <b>shootings,</b> particularly those that occurred at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.|$|E
500|$|Following the Finnish <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> of 2007 and 2008, {{media reports}} again {{attempted}} {{to draw a}} connection between the shooters and KMFDM, and noted that both listed the band among their favorites. In an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK shortly after the 2008 incident, Konietzko responded to these claims by saying the recent shootings were a by-product of the copycat mentality and the Finnish shooters' desire to emulate the lifestyles and actions of the Columbine shooters. [...] "One of my biggest concerns immediately following this incident [...] was that there would be copycats repeating such things in the future, as there often are when people commit heinous crimes and acts of violence. I was, unfortunately, right." ...|$|E
500|$|The 13th season {{introduced}} the characters Katie and Katherine, stars {{of a television}} show, The Queef Sisters, that consists largely of vaginal flatulence jokes. They are female equivalents of long-time characters Terrance and Phillip, who are initially angered at the competition from Katie and Katherine, but end up romantically involved with them. Season 13 also marked the final appearance of long-time supporting character Gordon Stoltski, the third grade student who read the morning announcements for South Park Elementary. In the episode [...] "Dances with Smurfs", Gordon is murdered while reading the announcements by a gunman who mistakes him for a truck driver who slept with his wife. Some critics found the scene disturbing and inappropriate {{in the light of}} recent <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Most of the lyrical {{themes in}} Simply Deep (2002) speak {{of love and}} life experiences, {{particularly}} in the songs [...] "Dilemma", in which Rowland expresses her endless love to her love interest, and [...] "Stole", in which she sings about an emotional [...] "tale of <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> and suicides". In Ms. Kelly (2007), Rowland covers topics such as her [...] "deeply personal relationship issues" [...] in her songs, [...] "Still in Love with My Ex", [...] "Flashback", [...] "Love", [...] "Better Without You" [...] and [...] "Gotsta Go (Part I)". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian noted that the songs could be about Rowland's former relationship with American football player Roy Williams.

500|$|Saari {{left behind}} two {{handwritten}} {{notes in his}} school dormitory indicating {{that he had been}} planning the massacre for six years. A police spokesperson commented: [...] "Saari left notes saying he had a hatred for mankind, for the whole of the human race, and that he had been thinking about {{what he was going to}} do for years. The notes show he was very troubled and he hated everything." [...] Police said that although most of the victims were female, the motive did not seem to be a hatred of women. One of Saari's friends noticed a change in his behaviour two years before the shootings, when Saari began expressing a fondness for guns and an admiration of the <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> in the United States. He said that around 18 months previously Saari had sent him a message saying that he would carry out a school shooting the next day. Saari reportedly denied being serious about carrying out his threat.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN said Cartman {{worked well}} for a Beck satire, and said, [...] "The real accomplishment of this episode is how it totally roasted a semi-political figure, without being political at all." [...] However, Isler said the script loses focus {{with the appearance of}} the Smurfs, and that Gordon's death was disturbing and inappropriate in the light of recent <b>school</b> <b>shootings</b> in the United States. The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal, a vocal critic of Beck, said mocking Beck is an easy task, but the episode [...] "handled it with just enough of the show's usual surrealist bent that it was never wholly predictable". He praised some of the episode's unexpected elements, like Cartman's Smurf film and Wendy's surprise resignation. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] became [...] "a little strange" [...] starting with Cartman's Smurf story, but he called the episode [...] "smart, sharp, and poignant". Delgado said the episode had less [...] "laugh out loud" [...] humor than traditional South Park episodes, in favor of intelligent satire. AOL Television writer Donald Deane called it one of the funniest episodes of the season.|$|E
