Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{variable}} flow rate <b>sprinkler</b> applicable to center pivot and lateral–move irrigation systems was constructed and {{tested in the}} laboratory. <b>Sprinkler</b> nozzle size was reduced a fixed amount using a retractable concentric pin in the nozzle bore. Cycling insertion of the concentric pin in the <b>sprinkler</b> nozzle bore provided a time – averaged {{variable flow}} rate over a range of 36 % to 100 % for the nozzle sizes tested. The application pattern radius of the <b>sprinkler</b> tested was reduced approximately 15 % under variable flow conditions. <b>Sprinkler</b> drop size distribution was also reduced by engagement of the pin in the <b>sprinkler</b> nozzle bore. Measured flow rates compared well with theoretical flow rates below 28 L/min (7. 4 gpm). Results from laboratory testing indicate the variable flow rate <b>sprinkler</b> could potentially be used for site–specific irrigation management with center pivot and lateral–move irrigation systems...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{experimental}} setups fail {{to detect}} any turning of the reverse <b>sprinkler</b> because the transient torque is not {{large enough to}} overcome the friction of the <b>sprinkler's</b> bearing. The increased friction prevents the <b>sprinkler</b> from actually turning [...] "backwards", although it is being (weakly) pushed in that direction. On the other hand, experiments with very low-friction bearings do find a small torque on the reverse <b>sprinkler</b> even in its steady state. [...] This is now understood to be {{a consequence of the}} viscosity of the fluid being sucked into the <b>sprinkler,</b> which leads to the dissipation of some of the energy of the incoming fluid and diffuses some of its angular momentum to the surrounding tank. This torque, induced by the viscosity, causes the reverse <b>sprinkler</b> to turn weakly towards the incoming fluid (i.e., in the direction contrary to the motion of a regular <b>sprinkler</b> expelling water).|$|R
5|$|The robin uses auditory, visual, {{olfactory}} {{and possibly}} vibrotactile cues to ﬁnd prey, but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection. It is frequently seen running across lawns picking up earthworms, and its running and stopping behavior is a distinguishing characteristic. In addition to hunting visually, {{it also has}} the ability to hunt by hearing. Experiments have discovered that it can find worms underground by simply using its listening skills. It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left, right or forward to detect movement of its prey. In urban areas, robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where <b>sprinklers</b> are in use. They also are attracted to freshly turned earth in gardens, where worms and grubs are abundant targets. Occasionally, they may visit bird feeders if mealworms or animal-fat suet is offered.|$|E
5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by <b>sprinklers</b> or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.|$|E
25|$|Other {{criticisms of}} UK fire {{regulations}} voiced {{in the aftermath}} of the fire include the lack of external <b>sprinklers,</b> mandated in Dubai and Australia for example for buildings featuring combustible cladding, the lack of internal <b>sprinklers,</b> which could have contained the original fire, and a 1986 change in the law under the then Conservative government that abolished a requirement that external walls should have at least one hour's fire resistance to prevent blazes from re-entering a building and spreading to other apartments. Wales has required <b>sprinklers</b> to be installed in new houses and flats built since 2016. A BBC Breakfast investigation, focusing on half of the UK's council owned and housing association owned tower blocks, found that 2% of them have full sprinkler systems. Deaths were 87% lower when buildings with <b>sprinklers</b> caught fire. England, Wales and Scotland all require <b>sprinklers</b> in newly built tall buildings but this does not apply retrospectively to older buildings.
