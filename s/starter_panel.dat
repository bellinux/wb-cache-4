50|$|The Nanoleaf Aurora uses {{slightly}} different technology from the company's light bulbs. The Aurora is also made with LED chips on {{a printed circuit}} board, but features a diffuser on a flat triangular surface. It consists of triangular light panels you can control on your Android or iOS device, or by using spoken commands.You can connect any panel to any other panel using an SD card-like connector chip to join their sides. Power flows through all {{of them from the}} base attachment, which can handle up to 30 panels. If you want more than the <b>starter</b> kit's nine <b>panels,</b> extras are available in three-packs for $60 each (about Â£50/AU$80). The Nanoleaf Aurora, a modular flat panel wall fixture LED lighting system, was introduced at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show.|$|R

Saymar have replaced the old petrol engine with a more fuel-efficient Toyota 2L-T diesel engine developing 102 hp. Other sub-systems upgraded include the manual transmission, new engine cooling system, new and improved electrical system, new disc braking system all round, hydraulic powered steering, new turret electrical system, communications and intercom system. All new electrical components include more reliable electrical wire bundles, electric voltage regulator, 24 V 65 A generator, 24 V <b>starter,</b> new drivers <b>panel</b> and new instrumental panel. This upgrade {{can be carried out}} in the user's own facilities with the aid of kits provided by Saymar or the company could carry out the work in its own facilities. This upgrade package could also be combined with a general overhaul of the vehicle to bring it up to an almost new build standard.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} few years after World War II, {{manufacturers}} began developing and widely distributing aluminium siding. Among them Indiana businessman Frank Hoess was credited with the invention of the configuration seen on modern aluminium siding. His experiments began in 1937 with steel siding in imitation of wooden clapboards. Other types of sheet metal and steel siding on the market at the time presented problems with warping, creating openings through which water could enter, introducing rust. Hoess remedied this problem {{through the use of a}} locking joint, which was formed by small flap at the top of each panel that joined with a U-shaped flange on the lower edge of the previous panel thus forming a watertight horizontal seam. After he had received a patent for his siding in 1939, Hoess produced a small housing development of about forty-four houses covered in his clapboard-style steel siding for blue-collar workers in Chicago. His operations were curtailed when war plants commandeered the industry. In 1946 Hoess allied with Metal Building Products of Detroit, a corporation that promoted and sold Hoess siding of ALCOA aluminium. Their product was used on large housing projects in the northeast and was purportedly the siding of choice for a 1947 Pennsylvania development, the first subdivision to solely use aluminium siding. Products such as 4", 6", 8" [...] and 10" [...] X 12' unpainted aluminium <b>panels,</b> <b>starter</b> strips, corner pieces and specialized application clips were assembled in the Indiana shop of the Hoess brothers. Siding could be applied over conventional wooden clapboards, or it could be nailed to studs via special clips affixed to the top of each panel. Insulation was placed between each stud. While the Hoess Brothers company continued to function for about twelve more years after the dissolution of the Metal Building Products Corporation in 1948, they were not as successful as rising siding companies like Reynolds Metals.|$|R
