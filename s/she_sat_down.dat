5|$|We tried {{a similar}} {{approach}} for The Little Shop of Horrors, dropping {{in and out of}} various downtown dives. We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at the table with us, and the three of us worked {{out the rest of the}} story together.|$|E
500|$|Ono went on {{a musical}} hiatus until signing with Rykodisc in 1992 to release the {{comprehensive}} six-disc box set Onobox. It included remastered highlights from all of Ono's solo albums, as well as unreleased material from the 1974 [...] "lost weekend" [...] sessions. She also released a one-disc sampler of highlights from Onobox, simply titled Walking on Thin Ice. That year, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> for an extensive interview with music journalist Mark Kemp for a cover story in the alternative music magazine Option. The story took a revisionist look at Ono's music {{for a new generation}} of fans more accepting of her role as a pioneer in the merger of pop and the avant-garde.|$|E
500|$|After obtaining {{commercial}} success with first two singles, [...] "Smile" [...] and [...] "LDN", Allen decided {{to promote the}} album by releasing [...] "Littlest Things". The song was composed in New York, where Allen travelled after she had met producer Mark Ronson when at lunch with her then boyfriend, Seb. There, {{she told him she}} was a singer and gave him a copy of her demo CD. He was impressed by her song [...] "Smile" [...] and asked her to work together. Regarding the process of composing the song, Ronson stated: We spent a day together and worked on a couple of things, and went to record shops where I played samples to her. Then I wrote the piano and guitar bit to [...] "Littlest Things", and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and scribbled for about an hour and finished the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|Also {{instrumental}} in exposing Eichmann's identity was Lothar Hermann, a half-Jewish German who had emigrated to Argentina in 1938. When in 1956 Hermann's daughter Sylvia began dating {{a man named}} Klaus Eichmann who boasted about his father's Nazi exploits, Hermann alerted Fritz Bauer, prosecutor-general {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany. Sylvia, sent on a fact-finding mission, was met at the door by Eichmann himself, who said he was Klaus's uncle. Informed that Klaus was not home, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to wait. When Klaus returned, he addressed Eichmann as [...] "Father". In 1957 Bauer passed along the information in person to Mossad director Isser Harel, who assigned operatives to undertake surveillance, but no concrete evidence was initially found. On 1 March 1960 Harel dispatched to Buenos Aires the Shin Bet chief interrogator Zvi Aharoni, who over the course of weeks of investigation was able to confirm the identity of the fugitive. As Argentina had a history of turning down extradition requests for Nazi criminals, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made the decision that Eichmann should be captured rather than extradited, and brought to Israel for trial. Harel himself arrived in person in May 1960 to oversee the capture. Mossad operative Rafi Eitan was named leader of the eight-man team, most of whom were Shin Bet agents.|$|E
500|$|Disillusioned {{at being}} typecast as the [...] "sarcastic {{interest}} of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel {{of the same name}} and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: [...] "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." [...] She was cast as Eugenia [...] "Skeeter" [...] Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was [...] "well-meaning and hugely likable" [...] despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.|$|E
500|$|She {{returned}} to the stage wearing a tank top with glittery tomboy looking suspenders and pants for a dance-oriented performance of [...] "Boys". The show continued with [...] "Stronger", in which she wore a paint-covered robe and in some shows a bowler hat. At {{the end of the}} performance, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> next to a piano player and talked to the audience before moving into a performance of [...] "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman". A video interlude spoofing Making the Band-type shows followed, showing Spears and her dancers as a struggling band. She took the stage again in a barge (wearing a black, silver, and gray rock star style jacket and green pants) along with four female dancers to perform [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll". The barge was lifted by wires, but pyrotechnics below it made it seem as if it was lifted by fire. When it was above the B-stage, Spears jumped to it with bungee cords. There was a skit in which her dancers chased her, before Spears loses the rock star jacket revealing a glittery red and purple halter top for a performance of [...] "What It's Like To Be Me" [...] in the small stage. She {{returned to}} the main stage for a performance of [...] "Lonely", in which she danced to a video projection of herself. The dancers and the band performed the [...] "Breakdown" [...] interlude. In [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", she sang on an elevated platform wearing a white evening gown, while two of her dancers performed a routine. Artificial snow fell from the ceiling during the performance.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{returned}} for the Glam-Punk {{segment of the}} show and strapped on a guitar for rocked-out versions of [...] "I Love New York" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The backdrop during the performances displayed the New York skyline sliding off and stars respectively. [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was accompanied by her dancers in new wave style dance, while wearing black clothes and white ties. An energetic rendition of [...] "Let It Will Be" [...] followed before <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> for some minutes {{to talk with her}} audience. She later started singing [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] without any choreography or backdrop video, only sitting on the floor, and then recalled co-singer Yitzhak Sinwani out for an acoustic version of [...] "Paradise (Not for Me)". The final segment Disco started after a brief radio-style mini-mix of old hits. Madonna emerged in a butterfly-collared suit influenced by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever for a mash-up of [...] "Music" [...] and The Trammps' 1976 single [...] "Disco Inferno" [...] This also included a sample of her 1986 song [...] "Where's The Party" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} song while dancers rollerskated circles around her. Stuart Price's remixed dance version of [...] "Erotica", which sampled the song's original demo [...] "You Thrill Me", is performed. The next song was a Tropical-Dance version of [...] "La Isla Bonita", where the screens displayed clips of different beautiful islands, the sea and its fauna. This is followed by [...] "Lucky Star"; this dance re-invention of the song shared the same musical arrangement than the following and final song of the evening [...] "Hung Up", which is accompanied by a sing-along with the audience and confetti and golden balloons falling from above. The show ended as the phrase [...] "Have you confessed?" [...] appeared onscreen.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Gočeva started {{promoting}} the album in Serbia. On 29 May, she {{appeared on the}} sixth season of the TV show Veče sa Ivanom Ivanovićem [...] where <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> for an interview and later performed [...] "Koj da mi zapee" [...] and [...] "Smej mi se smej" [...] from the album as well as [...] "Begaj, begaj" [...] which was a new song published after the album's release. According to Nielsen, the episode on which the singer appeared was viewed by approximately million people in Serbia.

2500|$|She {{helped the}} girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to {{concentrate}} on his work but {{he knew what was}} going to happen. Magda then went back up to the Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the Führerbunker and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something [...] "sweetened" [...] to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the Führerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red and her face was [...] "frozen". <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 2011, Wallenda {{completed}} a [...] high-wire crossing {{between the two}} towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The [...] performance was a recreation of the act that had killed Karl Wallenda in 1978. For the performance, Wallenda's mother, Delilah (Karl's granddaughter), joined him. The mother and son team started {{at opposite ends of}} the wire. [...] When Delilah reached the middle of the wire, roughly the spot Karl had fallen, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on the wire and Nik stepped over her before the two continued to opposite ends of the wire. At one point during the performance, Nik knelt down on the wire and blew a kiss in honor of his great-grandfather's memory.|$|E

2500|$|The few {{young women}} {{compared}} to {{number of young}} men led to the women's being paid unwanted attention. Maud's classmate, Jessie Mary, wrote that the [...] "oys (or young men as I guess they call themselves) abound". She noted that girls were frequently ogled by the boys, who enjoyed teasing them. When a girl was late, the boys would loudly clap as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> Each October, the freshman class would elect about twelve positions, including a president and vice president, a treasurer, a class essayist, and a marshal. The marshal was tasked with organizing parties and other social occurrences. Girls were generally barred {{from most of the}} positions. However, an annual tradition of the boys was to [...] "nominate the most precocious girl" [...] and then [...] "gossip about her viciously". Maud was nominated.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{returned}} to the diplomatic scene and responded to the ongoing 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis, in which plans for the Honduran fourth ballot box referendum had led to the 2009 Honduran coup d'état, and which was becoming Latin America's worst political crisis in some years. In early July, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with ousted President of Honduras Manuel Zelaya, who agreed on a U.S.-backed proposal to begin talks with the de facto Roberto Micheletti government. Later, in September, Zelaya {{returned to}} the country, and President of Costa Rica Óscar Arias, who had become a mediator in the matter, as well as Clinton expressed hope that Zelaya's return could break the impasse with the Micheletti government. In particular, Clinton said, [...] "Now that President Zelaya is back it would be opportune to restore him to his position under appropriate circumstances – {{get on with the}} election that is currently scheduled for November, have a peaceful transition of presidential authority and get Honduras back to constitutional and democratic order." [...] At the end of October, Clinton took a leading role in convincing Micheletti to accept a deal – which she termed an [...] "historic agreement" [...] – in which Zelaya would return to power in advance of general elections in which neither figure was running. Micheletti said that Clinton had been insistent on this point: [...] "I kept trying to explain our position to her, but all she kept saying was, 'Restitution, restitution, restitution.'" [...] That agreement broke down, despite efforts of the State Department to revive it, and Clinton and the U.S. ended up supporting the winner of the 2009 Honduran general election, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, with Clinton characterizing the elections as [...] "free and fair" [...] and Lobo as holding a strong commitment to democracy and the rule of constitutional law.|$|E
