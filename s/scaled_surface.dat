40|$|Nickel-based {{superalloys}} are a {{class of}} materials that have been specifically developed for high temperature applications for use in aero-engines and power generation. The evolution of superalloy chemistry and solidification structure has made the control and prevention of defect formation in single-crystal components increasingly challenging. This study examines the formation and avoidance of Surface Scale and Surface Melting, {{both of which are}} detrimental to the production cost and the performance of single-crystal turbine components. Surface Scale is a defect found on the surface of as-cast single-crystal components identified as a region of discolouration. A systematic analysis reveals that Surface Scale forms in the solid-state during casting due to the combined effects of (1) differential thermal contractions between mould and metal and (2) transient oxidation of the exposed metal casting surface at temperature below 1300 °C. The resultant transient oxide film is 0. 5 - 1 μm thick whilst the remaining surface undergoes a mould-metal reaction during the initial stages of casting, at temperatures above the liquidus, producing a 1 - 2 μm thick protective layer of Al[subscript 2]O[subscript 3]. Surface Melting is identified on the heat-treated blade surface as an area of localised melting within the <b>Scaled</b> <b>surface</b> area. Through an in-depth analysis of the microstructural evolution it was found that Surface Melting is a consequence of elemental evaporation of γ-phase stabilisers. The subsequent change in chemistry results in the transformation of the γ phase to γ’ and TCPs and a concomitant occurrence of incipient melting at the surface during solution heat treatment. This thesis concludes that the prevention of Surface Scale is made possible by the use of an inert atmospheric gas, such as Argon, within the casting furnace. However, the subsequent formation of Surface Melting during heat-treatment can only be prevented by pre-oxidising the as-cast components, thus forming Al[subscript 2]O[subscript 3] in order to form a protective barrier to evaporation...|$|E

The flow in the rotating cylinder comprises of a thin-flowing surface layer with the remaining particles rotating as a fixed bed. Experimental results indicate that the scaled layer thickness increases with increasing Froude number (Fr= omega (2) R/g, where omega is the angular speed, R is the cylinder radius, and g the acceleration due to gravity) and with increase in size ratio (s=d/R, where d is the particle diameter). The free surface profile. is nearly flat at low Fr and becomes increasingly S shaped with increasing Fr. The layer thickness profiles, which are symmetric at low Fr become skewed at high values of Fr and small s. The dynamic angles of repose for all the materials studied show a near-linear increase with rotational speed (omega). Scaling analysis of the experimental data shows that the shape of the <b>scaled</b> <b>surface</b> profiles and the scaled layer thickness profiles are nearly identical when Froude number and size ratio are held constant, for each material. The surface profiles and layer thickness profiles are also found to be nearly independent of the material used. The dynamic angle of repose (beta). however, does not scale with Fr and s and depends on the particle properties. The experimental results are compared to continuum models for flow in the layer, The models of Elperin and Vikhansky [Europhys. Lett. 42, 619 (1998) ] and Makse [Phys. Rev.

Tremendous {{studies have shown}} that micro- and nano- <b>scaled</b> <b>surface</b> morphology has great influences on cellular behavior and has great potential application in medical device design and organs regeneration. Although a variety of cell types have been used in cell-substrate studies for different purposes, information about how the cellular response of hepatic cells to the nanoporous and microgrooved structures is still insufficient The effects of groove/ridge width of the microgrooved structures on the mammalian cell culturing is usually overlooked. In this thesis, the cellular response of hepatic cells to the nanoporous and microgrooved is studied, including the cell spreading, cell elongation, cell alignment, and cell motility. Also, the effects of groove/ridge width are addressed on three mammalian cell lines (BEL- 7402, MIHA, and HeLa). Three experiments were performed. Firstly, the effect of nanoporous surface on hepatic cell line, BEL- 7402, was studied. The nanoporous surface (140 nm) was fabricated by anodize alumina membrane and microcontact printing techniques on PDMS surface. Cellular behaviors were analyzed with scanning electron microscope and time-lapse imaging. The results showed that cell projected area was reduced with cell migration speed was promoted on porous surface when compared with flat control surface. Secondly, the effect of microgrooves surface (10 μm, 30 μm and 50 μm, with equal ridge and groove width) on hepatic cell line, BEL- 7402, was studied. The microgrooved surface was fabricated by microcontact printing on PDMS. Cellular behaviors were analyzed with scanning electron microscope and time-lapse imaging. The results showed that cell elongation, alignment and directional migration was promoted by the groove structure when comparing with flat surface. Thirdly, the effect of microgrooved PDMS surfaces with varied ridge width and groove width on three mammalian cell lines (BEL- 7402, MIHA, and HeLa) was studied. Microgrooved PDMS surfaces with nine combination of ridge width (5 μm, 10 μm and 30 μm) and groove width (5 μm, 10 μm and 30 μm) were fabricated using photolithography and soft lithography. The results showed that all grooved structures have almost same affection on the cellular response, independent of the cell type. Also, our result showed that the cell elongation displayed same pattern on all micrgrooved surfaces, independent of the groove/ridge width changes. In addition, our result showed that microgrooved surface that contained 10 μm ridge or groove were less effective in aligning cells. On the other hand, microgrooved surface 5 × 5, 5 × 30, 30 × 5 and 30 × 30 showed most effective in aligning cell when compare with other grooved surface and flat control surface.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Vegetation {{change is}} an {{important}} factor affecting the global carbon cycle, land-atmosphere interaction, and terrestrial ecology. The study of vegetation change on a global scale can be used to evaluate the impact of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing can monitor vegetation change at the global scale, providing continuous samples of radiation reflected by vegetated surfaces with a temporal resolution of days. The MISR instrument offers the potential to sample the specular anisotropy of the Earth from up to 9 angles. Characterization of the specular anisotropy of vegetated surfaces on a global scale will provide information on the physical characteristics of vegetation affecting anisotropy not available from nadir-view only remote sensing. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) transformation of multi-angular measurements of the Earth’s surface acquired by the MISR instrument, to examine the feasibility of quantifying the structural characteristics of different vegetation communities at a global scale. This transformation will be applied to a time-series analysis of the Kalmioposis Wilderness in the Siskiyou National Forest in Southwestern Oregon to better understand the changes in spectral and angular reflectance of a forest stand during re-growth after a stand-replacing disturbance. A sample encompassing a full phenologic cycle, of the red bands only from MISR cameras Ca – Cf, at <b>scaled</b> <b>surface</b> reflectance, provided the template on which PCA was performed. The sample of MISR data was created using imagery collected from 2001 – 2005 to provide a wide variety of vegetation and soils reflectance over a phenologic cycle. Sample data was rotated to the principal components as the new axes using the coefficients of rotation from an un-standardized PCA. Samples were evaluated at various latitudes, differing topography, and varying vegetation density and land cover to determine the properties of the scene controlling the range and magnitude of the principal components. Principal component 1 was found to have high negative correlation to NDVI. Principal component 2 was found to have high positive correlation to both the solar zenith angle and the relative azimuth angle between the MISR sensor and the path of incident radiation. Principal component 3 could not be correlated to any available metric, although evidence suggests that component 3 may carry useful information. The PCA transformation proved useful at relating the changes in vegetation after a fire at the Biscuit Complex. The changes in the BRDF as sampled by MISR were expressed through the principal components, but these changes could not be directly related to changing structural characteristics of the vegetation. The goal of assessing structural characteristics of vegetation through the PCA transformation to a single metric of vegetation structure was unsuccessful. The PCA transformation of the MISR sample successfully yielded a transformation where different classes of vegetation occupied distinct and unique regions of PCA space. The first two principal components were successfully correlated to measurable and definable metrics of vegetation and solar illumination. The third principal component, for which a correlation could not be found, was suggestive of carrying unique information and merits further investigation. The transformation of multi-angular red band reflectance as presented in this study may prove to be a valuable method of estimating biomass at a global scale. With principal components correlated to measures of biomass in NDVI and to the shadowing of the ground through the angle of solar illumination, the PCA relates characteristics of vegetated scenes in a minimum of bands...|$|E
