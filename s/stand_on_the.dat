5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Castle ({{formerly}} the Lordship House) is a Grade I listed 16th-century {{manor house}} in Lordship Lane, Tottenham, London.

It was remodelled in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> money question.|$|E

5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground.

5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E

5|$|The British {{continued}} their policy of stalling Smith. At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E
5|$|The Railway <b>Stand,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{west side}} of the stadium nearest to Birmingham city centre, is also free-standing. It was opened in 1999 and holds some 8,000 spectators in two tiers; the upper tier, a small area known as the Olympic Gallery, {{overhangs}} the lower, at the back of which is a row of executive boxes. From the 2009–10 season, the Railway Stand was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager. Visiting supporters are housed in the lower Railway Stand, segregated from home fans by plastic netting over the seats.|$|E

Cheadle was again absent through injury, as two goals from Tommy McGuigan ended Vale's record run of 21 games unbeaten. Title rivals Gateshead then left Vale Park with a point after a goalless draw, ending the club's record run of 12 consecutive home victories.|$|E
