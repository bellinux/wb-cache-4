40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the challenges {{posed by the}} illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUD fishing) in the Southern Ocean. The paper charts the growth in IUU fishing in sub-Antarctic waters from the mid- 1990 s, and {{the efforts of the}} international community to address it. It examines the challenges faced in detection and enforcement, and the limitations in the internationallegal mechanisms available to combat the problem. These mechanisms are both region-specific, with the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), and global, with the United Nations Highly Migratory and Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement, and the various instruments, binding and non-binding, overseen by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) directed at fisheries management. In the former case, CCAMLR 2 ̆ 7 s operation within the Antarctic Treaty System has created substantial challenges in responding effectively to the growth of IUU fishing. In the latter, the Fish Stocks Agreement and FAO Compliance Agreement have presented challenges in terms of international take-up, and structures that allow for effective response. The paper then examines the international responses to IUD fishing, both generally and from a regional perspective. These include greater international cooperation in enforcement, and the institution of a catch documentation scheme for the principally targeted <b>species,</b> <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b> These regional measures have proven effective in reducing, although not eliminating the problem. It concludes by considering what new issues affecting IUU fishing are potentially emerging...|$|E
40|$|The {{two giant}} notothenioid <b>species,</b> the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>{{toothfish}}</b> Dissostichus eleginoides and the Antarctic toothfish D. mawsoni, are important {{components of the}} Antarctic ichthyofauna and heavily exploited commercially. They have similar appearance and size, both are piscivorous and benthopelagic, but differ in their geographic distribution and absence/presence of the antifreeze trait. We karyotyped these two sister species by analyzing specimens collected from multiple Antarctic and sub-Antarctic sites. Both species have a diploid number of 48, but differ in karyotypic formula, (2 m + 2 sm + 44 a) for D. eleginoides and (2 m + 4 sm + 42 a) for D. mawsoni, due to an extra pair of submetacentric chromosomes in the latter. Chromosomal fuorescence in situ hybridization with rDNA probes revealed unexpected species-specific organization of rRNA genes; D. mawsoni possesses two rDNA loci (versus one locus in D. eleginoides), with the second locus mapping to its additional submetacentric chromosome. The additional rRNA genes in D. mawsoni may be a cold-adaptive compensatory mechanism for growth and development of this large species in freezing seawater...|$|R

25|$|Between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, {{fisheries}} landed 119,898 tonnes, {{of which}} 85% consisted of krill and 14% of <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b> International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, {{which in the}} 1998–99 season landed five to six times more <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> than the regulated fishery.|$|R

40|$|The Southern Ocean is {{a hostile}} and remote marine environment. It {{is also a}} place of great beauty that {{contains}} unique fish, bird, mammal and coral species, and thousands of invertebrates, plants and micro-organisms – many of which we know little about or which are endemic and occur nowhere else in the world. The Southern Ocean also contains a wealth of natural marine resources that include the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery. This fishery has come under increasing pressure {{over the last decade}} as fishers have harvested stocks {{to meet the demands of}} an increasing world population and an insatiable desire by consumers to eat white-fleshed fish (Fallon and Kriwoken submitted). Given the demand for <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish,</b> illegal fishing of these stocks has flourished and the incidental mortality of seabirds in this longline fishery threatens many endangered albatross species. In addition, discarded longline equipment threatens marine mammals when they become entangled in the lines. This report focuses on issues of sustainability in the Southern Oceans fisheries, with specific reference to the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b> The paper also informs a series of companion Internet sites that summarise the findings reported in detail here and they can be accessed at. A description of the Southern Ocean, and its physical and biological characteristics, sets the scene for a related discussion about its marine resources. We then outline the historical and contemporary context of the Southern Ocean’s management, and elaborate on the range of fishing techniques used to harvest a number of fisheries. With this important background information in place, we examine the case of the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> describing its ecology, stock estimates and commercial exploitation. An analysis of the incidence of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing then leads to a discussion of trade in <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b> What becomes clear from this work is that there are various international actors of influence whose involvement in the Southern Ocean fisheries is crucial for sustainability outcomes and for the conservation of the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> and other <b>species</b> in the Southern Ocean...|$|R

40|$|Illegal, {{unregulated}} and unreported (IUU) {{fishing is}} a major problem in many of the world's fisheries. The stocks most severely impacted centre on those characterised by high economic value, such as abalone, as well as long lived and slow growing <b>species</b> such as <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides). Effective management of these stocks as well as assessment of the impacts of IUU fishing on the resources is impeded by the technical difficulties associated with determining the magnitude of the IUU catches. The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery rates as an extreme example of extraordinarily high levels of illegal and unreported (IU) catch. To assess the level and trends in IU catches, we used a combination of approaches that included collation of confiscation records from law enforcement, development of a novel index (the confiscations per unit policing effort—CPUPE), estimation of illegal catches using a spatial and age-structured assessment model, and cross-checking of model outputs through comparison with trade data on abalone imports in destination countries. The model-predicted 2008 IU estimate was 860 tonnes, more than 10 times the total allowable catch (TAC) for that year, and implied that, on average, 14 % of all IU catches are confiscated. Associated management responses included the listing of H. midae on Appendix III of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), and a temporary closure of the commercial fishery. We summarise both technical and management lessons to be learnt from this integrated approach to assess and verify the magnitude of IU fishing...|$|R
40|$|Diet {{seems to}} be a key factor driving {{diversity}} and isolation among killer whale populations. Killer whales at Marion Island, Southern Ocean, have been observed preying on seals and penguins but are also know to depredate <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> from longline fishing vessels. However, their diet is poorly known especially when they occur offshore. We analysed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in 32 skin samples collected from 24 killer whales belonging to 8 social units. Adult males showed higher δ 15 N values than adult females or subadults, indicating that they occupy a higher relative trophic level. There {{were no significant differences in}} δ 13 C among social units, but δ 15 N differed significantly and 2 individuals from social units which have been observed depredating <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> had higher δ 15 N values. The inshore presence of killer whales at Marion Island was a significant predictor of δ 13 C values, but not of δ 15 N values. This suggests some foraging north of Marion Island, potentially on lower trophic level prey. We also analysed tissue samples from seal, penguin and <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> prey and used available values for Antarctic fur seals. Results show that killer whales around Marion Island are apex predators, but that they do not feed exclusively on other high trophic level predators such as elephant seals, fur seals, and <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b> Killer whales had δ 15 N values similar to those of <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> and adult male elephant seals, implying that the diet of killer whales at Marion Island includes some lower trophic level prey such as cephalopods or fishes.

40|$|The fishery for <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides) {{around the}} island of South Georgia in the Southern Ocean is a {{profitable}} operation targeting a high-value, slow-growing species. We substituted the complex Bayesian age-structured model currently used for assessments with a Schaefer production model, which performs equally well as an operating model for management strategy evaluation. A number of potential effort reduction strategies are investigated, several of which would achieve better conservation objectives and higher future profits from the fishery than those predicted using the current management strategy.

40|$|International audienceFeeding {{ecology and}} isotopic niche of the {{wandering}} albatross Diomedea exulanswere investigated in the poorly studied population on the Kerguelen Islands and compared to thaton the Crozet Islands. Fish (48 % by mass) and cephalopods (46 %) were similarly important inchick food at Kerguelen, while cephalopods (87 %) dominated the diet at Crozet. Fish preyincluded mainly deep-sea <b>species,</b> with the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> Dissostichus eleginoides beingthe main item. Cephalopod beaks were identified, {{most of which}} were from adult oceanic squids. Albatrosses preyed upon the same taxa at both localities, but in different proportions. Histioteuthisatlantica (30 % by number), Galiteuthis glacialis (13 %), and Kondakovia longimana (10 %) were the main squid prey at Kerguelen, while K. longimana (35 %) and H. eltaninae (23 %) dominatedat Crozet. Chick feather δ 15 N values were higher in wandering albatrosses than in otheroceanic seabirds of the 2 communities, indicating that the wandering albatross is an apex consumertogether with the sperm whale and sleeper shark that have similar δ 15 N values. Satellitetrackedwandering albatrosses foraged in local subantarctic waters and farther north, with someCrozet birds overlapping with those from the Kerguelen population in western Kerguelen waters. Anthropogenic items (e. g. plastic fragments, hooks) were found in half the food samples. All fishery-related items were from the local toothfish fishery. The high number of hooks from Crozetindicated the presence of a fairly large number of illegal longliners in the area during the Australwinter 1998.
