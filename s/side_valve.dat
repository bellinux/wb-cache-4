25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve spring) to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
25|$|The {{compensating}} euphonium {{is common}} among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one <b>side</b> <b>valve.</b> The compensating valve system uses extra tubing, usually coming {{off of the}} back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the lower range of the instrument. This range being from E2 down to B1. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are compensating. Only those designed with extra tubing are compensating. There were, at one time, three-valve compensating euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one compensating models did, in order to bring the notes C2 and B1 in tune. This three-valve compensating configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Side</b> <b>valve</b> six – fitted {{into the}} PV651/2, TR671/4, PV653/4, TR676/9, PV658/9, PV36, PV51/2, PV53/6, PV801/2, PV821/2, PV831/2 and PV60 from 1929 to 1958 ...|$|E
50|$|The first S.P.A.s {{designed}} by Alberto Ballacco and Ceirano were the 28/40HP and 60/70 HP which had four cylinder engines, <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> and live rear axles. They were {{exhibited at the}} Esposizione di Torino.|$|R
50|$|The new {{detachable}} {{aluminium alloy}} cylinder head was fitted over inclined <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> and anodised aluminium alloy pistons. Pressure lubrication was supplied to the tappets, coolant temperature {{was controlled by}} thermostat and coil ignition was provided with automatic advance.|$|R
5000|$|... a 16/20 hp four {{cylinder}} model which {{resembled the}} standard Mercedes designs of the period. To wit - the cylinders were cast in two blocks of two cylinders, with <b>side</b> <b>valves,</b> a T-head design and chain {{drive to the}} rear wheels.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II BSA were Britain's largest motorcycle manufacturer {{with a long history}} of armaments supply to the armed forces. [...] Designed by Val Page the BSA M20 started development in 1937 as a heavy-framed sidecar model with a simple 500cc single cylinder <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> engine. It had low compression and plenty of low-end torque through a standard BSA gearbox.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1919 BSA {{launched}} their first 50 degree vee-twin, Model E, 770cc <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> (6-7hp) motorcycle for the 1920 season. The machine had interchangeable valves, total loss oil system with mechanical pump and an emergency hand one. Retail price was £130. Other features were Amac carburettor, chain drive, choice of magneto or Magdyno, 7-plate clutch, 3 {{speed gear box}} with kickstarter and new type of cantilever fork ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1932 Datsun Type 11 was a {{small car}} with a 495 cc, 10 HP <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> engine and a three speed transmission[...] It was offered in several body styles, and DAT/Nissan sold 150 of the Type 11 in 1932. [...] The Type 11 was only {{produced}} during the year 1932, as changes in the law allowed Nissan to sell a new model with a larger engine in 1933.|$|E
50|$|The second {{production}} motorcycle to use {{a straight}} twin design, this time a 'parallel twin' with vertical cylinders akin to the later British type, was the Werner of 1903. It used cast-iron cylinders with integral heads, and <b>side</b> <b>valves,</b> with a capacity of 500cc.|$|R
50|$|The Rolls-Royce V-8 was {{the first}} British V8. It is a 3.5 L square engine with <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> and a 90° angle. To compete with {{electric}} cars, the engineering priorities of this engine were quietness and refinement over outright power and the design was deliberately shallow to emulate {{the look of the}} town brougham.|$|R
50|$|The racer was {{marketed as}} a 1909 road car, the 10/12, and new {{monobloc}} construction was standard across the line. Yet the engineers {{could not make}} up their minds; in 1910, they reverted to <b>side</b> <b>valves,</b> and in 1913, switched to sleeve valves for the 25/35, while there was a prototype sixteen-valve four, the marque's last racing attempt.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E
50|$|The Fiat 508 {{was fitted}} with a 995 cc <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> engine.|$|E
50|$|The M33-10 was {{developed}} as a 5.95 hp <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> based on the earlier BSA Sloper with capacity extended to 595cc {{to make it more}} suitable for use with a sidecar. In 1934 M33-10 was replaced by the M34-12 'de Luxe' <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> and the M34-13 overhead valve 'de Luxe' models, bith of which had 5.95 hp engines.|$|E
50|$|If the {{camshaft}} {{is located in}} the crankcase, a valve train of pushrods and rocker arms will be required to operate overhead valves. Mechanically simpler are <b>side</b> <b>valves,</b> where the valve stems rested directly on {{the camshaft}}. However, this gives poor gas flows within the cylinder head as well as heat problems and fell out of favor for automobile use, see flathead engine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911 Austro-Daimler began {{producing}} the Prinz Heinrich (in English: Prince Henry) model; this car, which featured an overhead cam 5,714-cc four-cylinder engine, quickly became famous. It could develop 95 bhp at 2,100 rpm; {{there was also}} a less potent version with <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> and a 6,900-cc engine capable of developing [...] at only 1,200 rpm. Both designs were by Porsche.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} the {{combustion}} chamber as an [...] "inverted hemi-head", along with the angled cylinder head joint and pitched-roof piston crowns, had earlier {{been used in the}} 1930 Van Ranst-designed Packard V12 engine, although in this case the valves were both in the block as <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> and the spark plug was poorly placed at the extremity of the combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|Between 1919 and 1921 the Type 10 was {{equipped}} with a 4-cylinder 1,592cc <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> engine.|$|E
5000|$|Its Tipo 98 {{petrol engine}} was a <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> [...] inline-four, {{developing}} [...] at 1,700 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} models, an 8 and a 10 hp, both using <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> Coventry-Climax engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of four stroke engines have poppet valves, although some aircraft engines have sleeve valves. Valves may {{be located in}} the cylinder block (<b>side</b> <b>valves),</b> or in the cylinder head (overhead valves). Modern engines are invariably of the latter design. There may be two, three, four or five valves per cylinder, with the intake valves outnumbering the exhaust valves in case of an odd number.|$|R
50|$|Both engines had a 106 mm stroke, {{meaning the}} 65 model {{measured}} 2,110 cc and the 75 model measured 2,810 cc The 75 model was predominately targeted towards export markets, given the additional £5 horse-power tax that was payable owing to its larger capacity. The straight-six engine featured <b>side</b> <b>valves,</b> a detachable head and coil ignition. There was a dry single-plate clutch and the gearbox had four speeds with silent third.|$|R
5000|$|Hudson stopped {{supplying}} the eight-cylinder engine in 1936, and subsequent cars had a , 3,455 cc straight-six, still with <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> {{and called the}} 3.5 litre. A Centric supercharged version was also listed with a claimed output of [...] The chassis was 4 in shorter than the 4 litre at 116 inches. Saloon bodies were available but most were open cars. Approximately 80 were made between 1936 and 1939.|$|R
5000|$|Willment in the UK, {{designed}} and manufactured overhead inlet valve cylinder {{heads for the}} <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> engines.|$|E

5000|$|In late 1915, Indian {{introduced}} Gustafson's {{replacement for}} Hedstrom's [...] V-twin engine. The new engine used <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> {{instead of the}} inlet-over-exhaust (IOE) valve layout used in Hedstrom's designs. The flathead engine was quieter and less expensive to manufacture than the earlier IOE engine and needed less maintenance. It was named [...] "Powerplus" [...] because its output of approximately [...] was noticeably {{greater than that of}} the earlier engine.|$|R
5000|$|... 1905 {{brought a}} new car that was again bigger and which {{provided}} the only offering from the small Cleveland manufacturer. It was a huge automobile with a four-cylinder L-head engine with a block cast in pairs and mechanical operated <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> delivering 40 HP. Wheelbase of 118 inches (300 cm). It was called the model 32/40 and was available as a very expensive 7-passenger Touring that set a buyer back a hefty $4,150.|$|R
50|$|The Adler 2.5-litre was {{powered by}} a {{longitudinally}} installed water-cooled straight-six side-valve engine of 2,494 cc displacement, with a four-bearing crankshaft and pressured lubrication. The <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> were controlled via a chain-driven camshaft. The radiator, engine and gear box were all set well forward in the car, and power was delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission which included synchromesh on the top three ratios. The gear lever emerged directly from {{the centre of the}} dashboard.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 the Blackburne <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> engines disappeared, {{replaced}} by the 348 cc and 499 cc Rudge-Python, and a Sturmey-Archer motor entered the range.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Side</b> <b>valve</b> six - fitted {{into the}} PV651/2, TR671/4, PV653/4, TR676/9, PV658/9, PV36, PV51/2, PV53/6, PV801/2, PV821/2, PV831/2 and PV60 from 1929 to 1958 ...|$|E
50|$|In 1935 the Python and <b>side</b> <b>valve</b> JAP engines disappeared, {{but with}} a new choice of coil or magneto ignition, Cotton could still claim 16 models.|$|E
50|$|The engines {{were used}} to power water pumps, generators, cement mixers and much more. They had a chain drive {{ignition}} magneto, either the Lucas SR1, the Lucas RS1 or a M-l MK1(shaft driven and early chain driven), and an Amal float bowl. The engines were made in 1 hp, 1.5 hp, 2 hp and 2.5 hp versions. The engine was a 4 stroke poppet valve engine, and, surprisingly, has overhead <b>valves,</b> instead of <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> and a simple centrifugal governing system.|$|R
50|$|The Phantom was Rolls-Royce's {{replacement}} for the original Silver Ghost. Introduced as the New Phantom in 1925, the Phantom had a larger engine than the Silver Ghost and used pushrod-operated overhead valves instead of the Silver Ghost's <b>side</b> <b>valves.</b> The Phantom was built in Derby in England and in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States. There were several differences in specification between the English and American Phantoms. The Phantom {{was replaced by the}} Phantom II in 1929, at which point it was called the Phantom I.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 the K4 and L4 {{models were}} {{introduced}} featuring a new {{engine of the}} same capacity, but lightened and simplified by conversion to <b>side</b> <b>valves</b> instead of overhead valves, use of aluminium pistons and lighter connecting rods. The side-valve engine may have been for streamlined production, cost, reliability or weight-saving reasons. The cantilever rear springs were replaced with semi-elliptic springs and the rear axle was fitted with an underslung worm drive. The K4 used a 3 metre wheelbase and the L4 was approximately a foot longer.|$|R
