5|$|On 6 June 1918, Mackay {{was heading}} on leave to London {{to visit his}} wife, who had managed to reach England after a long battle with wartime travel restrictions, when he was <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> back at Boulogne by British {{military}} police. He had been appointed to command the 1st Infantry Brigade and had to return at once. He was immediately promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general. Mackay commanded the 1st Infantry Brigade in the later stages of the fighting around Hazebrouck. In the operations east of there in June and July, his brigade was exceptionally active {{in the form of}} minor operations and patrolling that became known as the peaceful penetration.|$|E
5|$|In the Ogulin {{area of the}} HV Karlovac Corps AOR, the 99th Brigade, {{reinforced}} by the 143rd Home Guard Regiment's Saborsko Company, moved towards Plaški at 5a.m., but the force was <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> back in disarray by 6p.m. The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced from Josipdol towards Plaški, encountering minefields and strong ARSK resistance. Its elements connected with the 14th Home Guard Regiment, advancing through Barilović towards Slunj. Near the city of Karlovac, the 137th Home Guard Regiment deployed four reconnaissance groups around midnight of 34 August, followed by artillery preparation and crossing of the Korana River at 5a.m. The advance was fiercely resisted by the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade, but the bridgehead was stable {{by the end of}} the day. The 110th Home Guard Regiment, {{reinforced by}} a company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment, advanced east to the road leading south from Karlovac to Vojnić and Slunj, where it met heavy resistance and suffered more casualties to landmines, demoralizing the unit and preventing its further advance. In addition, the attached company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade failed to secure the regiment's flanks. The 104th Brigade tried to cross the Kupa River at 5a.m., but failed and fell back to its starting position by 8a.m., at which time it was shifted to the bridgehead established by the 110th Home Guard Regiment. A company of the 99th Brigade was attached to the 143rd Home Guard Regiment for operations the next day, and a 250-strong battlegroup was removed from the brigade and subordinated to the Karlovac Corps directly.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans {{took the}} opening kickoff, and quarterback Drew Brees drove the Saints to the Tampa Bay 30-yard line. On a 4th down and 1, however, they were <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> {{the ball over}} on downs. At their own 41-yard line, Buccaneers quarterback Jeff Garcia threw an {{apparent}} completion, but was intercepted by Jonathan Vilma. The turnover led to a Saints field goal. Midway through the first quarter, heavy rain began to fall.|$|E

500|$|The game {{itself was}} highly competitive. New York {{got off to}} a quick 3–0 lead; however Baltimore scored two touchdowns to take a 14–3 halftime advantage. [...] Late in the third quarter, the Colts {{appeared}} ready to put the game out of reach by driving deep into Giants' territory. However, they were <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> the ball over on downs.|$|E
500|$|The cast began rehearsing, {{but after}} 20 minutes <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> to Cherones, {{who agreed to}} talk to Charles. While {{on his way to}} Charles' office, Cherones met Castle Rock {{executive}} Glenn Padnick and informed him about the cast's reaction to the episode. Cherones said that Padnick was relieved to hear this, and they both discussed the problem with Charles, and decided not to use the script. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated [...] "You know, it would have been an interesting show, but [...] we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been. So, it was disappointing but also understandable." [...] The replacement episode called [...] "The Phone Message" [...] was written by David and Seinfeld in two days.|$|E
500|$|On 24 March 1945, the 17th Airborne {{took off}} from airfields in Central France, North and South of Paris, for Operation Varsity. The glider {{carrying}} Levert Lindell Smith Jr.’s squad landed in a field near Wesel, Germany, probably sometime during the late morning hours. Lindell {{had been sent to}} the 17th Airborne as a replacement while they were refitting near Chalons sur Marnes, France, after coming off of the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes. He became a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) man in a squad of 12 men in Company C,194th Glider Infantry Regiment. The men in his squad, along with other troops, took up defensive positions near a bridge over the Issel Canal. They were attacked by German artillery and infantry in a brief, but fierce battle. During that time, Lindell apparently attempted to throw a hand grenade at the attacking German infantry, but the grenade went off in his foxhole. He was very badly injured in that explosion. After the German attack was <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> back, he was given first aid, but he died a few minutes later. Lindell was posthumously awarded the following: (1) a Purple Heart Medal, (2) a Bronze Star Medal,(3) Combat Infantryman Badge, (4) Good Conduct Medal, (5) European Campaign Medal with one star, (6) World War II Victory Medal, and (7) Honorable Service Pin. Lindell had his 19th birthday on 21 March 1945, and died on 24 March 1945, just 3 days later. He had been in the U.S. Army for only five months and {{had been a member of}} the 17th Airborne Division for less than a month.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> to look back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1840, Colonel Harney {{finally got}} revenge for his humiliation on the Caloosahatchee River. He led ninety men into the Everglades from Fort Dallas on the Miami River, {{traveling}} in canoes {{borrowed from the}} Marines. They were guided by a black man named John {{who had been in}} Seminole captivity for a while. The column encountered some Indians in canoes and gave chase, catching some of them and promptly hanging the men. When John was having trouble finding the way, Harney tried to force the captured Seminole women to lead the way to the camp, reportedly by threatening to hang their children. However, John got his bearings again and the Harney party found the camp of Chakaika and the 'Spanish Indians'. Dressed as Indians, the soldiers approached the camp early in the morning, achieving surprise. Chakaika was outside the camp when the attack started. He started to run and then <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> to face the soldiers, offering his hand, but one of the soldiers shot and killed him. There was a brief fight during which some of the Indians escaped. [...] Harney had two of the captured warriors hanged, and had Chakaika's body hung beside them. Harney and his men returned to Fort Dallas after twelve days in the Everglades. Harney had lost one soldier killed. His command had killed four Indians in action and hanged five more. The Legislative Council of Florida presented Harney with a commendation and a sword, and Harney was soon given command of the Second Dragoons.|$|E
