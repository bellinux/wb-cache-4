50|$|The {{election}} {{used the}} supplementary vote system: voters {{were instructed to}} mark the <b>ballot</b> <b>paper</b> with their first and second choices of candidate (although there were an unusually large number of <b>spoilt</b> <b>ballots).</b> If no candidate got a majority of first preference votes, the top two candidates {{went on to a}} second round in which second preference votes of the eliminated candidates were allocated to them to produce a winner.
