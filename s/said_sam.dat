500|$|Damon Knight {{described}} Campbell as a [...] "portly, bristled-haired blond {{man with}} a challenging stare." [...] "Six-foot-one, with hawklike features, he presented a formidable appearance," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Sam</b> Moskowitz. [...] "He was a tall, large man with light hair, a beaky nose, a wide face with thin lips, and with a cigarette in a holder forever clamped between his teeth," [...] wrote Asimov.|$|E
500|$|The team {{spent time}} [...] "solving [...] riddle" [...] of a {{speaking}} protagonist, a notable departure from Grand Theft Auto IIIs silent protagonist Claude. Ray Liotta portrayed protagonist Tommy Vercetti. Liotta described the role as challenging: [...] "You're creating a character that's not there before... It's so intensive". When recording the role, the team used blue screen {{in order to}} allow Liotta to visualise [...] "how it's gonna move". The team ensured that the player felt [...] "real affinity" [...] for Tommy, making the narrative a key development interest. Dan Houser described Tommy as [...] "strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive". Director Navid Khonsari recalled Liotta frequently complaining on set and found him difficult to work with as a result. [...] "In some sessions he was ... into it, but then sometimes ... he was very dark and couldn't work", <b>said</b> <b>Sam</b> Houser. Following the game's success, Liotta reportedly claimed that he was underpaid for the role.|$|E
500|$|Bill's {{appearance}} {{was designed to}} reflect practicality, as opposed to self-expression; most of his clothing and gear {{can also be used}} as a survival tool. Bill is revealed to be homosexual {{at one point in the}} game. Druckmann initially left this vague in the script, but was inspired at the script read-through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill's sexuality. To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel doesn't voice them. [...] "he reason to have Bill there is that Bill can actually say that to Joel, and warn Joel about that stuff," [...] Druckmann <b>said.</b> <b>Sam</b> Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality [...] "added to his character ... without really tokenizing him". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the [...] "most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013", calling him [...] "deeply flawed but wholly unique".|$|E

Weerasuriya said, [...] "The Order was never written as a one-off story". <b>Sams</b> <b>said</b> that although developers wanted to retain ownership to its intellectual property, it needed the approval of Sony to bring the game to market. [...] "It was absolutely the company's desire to own it," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Sams.</b> [...] "We love that game and we are proud of it.
