She {{wanted to get the}} voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. During the flashback to Apu's childhood, the animators made <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> show Manjula, as they wished to reveal her {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E

25|$|In Central Africa simple {{crossbows}} {{were used}} for hunting and as a scout weapon, previously {{thought to have been}} first introduced by the Portuguese. Until recently they were especially in use by different tribes of the pygmy-people, usually with poisoned and relatively small arrows. This silent technique of hunting in the tropical forest is quite {{similar to that of the}} South American indigenous hunting method with blow pipe and poisoned arrows. It makes <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> startle up the prey, for example if a first shot goes astray. Since the small arrow is rarely deadly itself, the animal will drop from the trees after some time because of the poisoning.|$|E
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the {{disorder}} has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.|$|E
500|$|During its development, Lords of Shadow {{was placed}} on several lists for most {{anticipated}} video games. GameTrailers ranked it at number 7 for [...] "Top 10 Most Anticipated Games of 2010." [...] Explicit Gamer wrote [...] "With so many great games in store for us in 2010, you should be <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> overlook Castlevania: Lords of Shadow when it hits the shelves." [...] Games Radar placed Lords of Shadow at number 26 for 100 Most Anticipated Games of 2010, stating that [...] "This could be a megaton release." [...] 1UP.com's top 50 most anticipated games of E3 2010 ranked Lords of Shadow at number 17. Despite the heavy anticipation, Cox noted {{there was still a}} small number of fans who did not like the game's transition to the 3D format. He stated, [...] "Fair enough, some people aren't going to like what we're doing and we accept that but generally what we're trying to do is bring the fans with us ... there's no point in going back and making the same game again – the point is to make a clean break and move forward with the series." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2007, {{the band}} {{recorded}} three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!, released November 20, 2007. The live album is {{described on the}} press release as [...] "their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever … and they even made <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> play any songs off their 1995 live album I Heard They Suck Live." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, the Cinema Society {{arranged}} {{a place for}} Méliès, his granddaughter Madeleine and Jeanne d'Alcy at La Maison du Retraite du Cinéma, the film industry's retirement home in Orly. Méliès was greatly relieved {{to be admitted to}} the home and wrote to an American journalist: [...] "My best satisfaction in all is to be <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be one day without bread and home!" [...] In Orly, Méliès worked with several younger directors on scripts for films that never came to be made. These included a new version of Baron Munchausen with Hans Richter and a film that was to be titled Le Fantôme du métro (Phantom of the Metro) with Henri Langlois, Georges Franju, Marcel Carné and Jacques Prévert. He also acted in a few advertisements with Prévert in his later years.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1937, Prince Konoe became Prime Minister. One month later, Japanese troops {{clashed with}} Chinese troops near Peking in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Konoe {{dispatched}} three divisions of troops, admonishing {{the military to}} be <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> escalate the conflict. Within three weeks the army launched a general assault. Konoe and his cabinet feared that Japanese troops would not respect any peace agreement. He was also unsure that Chiang Kai-shek could control his own forces. In August, Chinese sentries killed two Japanese marines who crashed a gate at a Chinese airfield in Shanghai. Konoe agreed with Army Minister General Hajime Sugiyama to send two divisions to defend Japanese honor. His cabinet then issued a declaration, accusing both nationalist and communist Chinese of [...] "increasingly provocative and insulting" [...] behavior toward Japan.|$|E

"I {{had just}} said to Dick McMullen, 'Be <b>sure</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fire until they reach that mullein stalk,' when a commotion {{in the rear of}} our line caused me to look behind us, and to my dismay, my eyes rested upon the largest line of cavalry I had ever seen. There seemed to be no end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in our {{immediate}} rear I know not, and from what direction they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance. Major [...] Boyd, commanding our regiment, quickly said: 'We are prisoners,' {{and that was the end}} of the Nineteenth Virginia Infantry as a body of armed soldiers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who seek}} immorality must not {{associate}} with women.

Your spirit will weaken and your qi will leave. All of these [...] will accumulate, and bring about death. As for why you avoid [...] on these days, it is not only to block off lasciviousness. It is [...] to pacify the female palaces. The female palaces are in the shen and the male palaces are in the yin. Yin and shen punish each other. Both execute each other. On these days the Three Corpses of men and women come out from the pupils of the eyes. Female Corpses beckon the male, and male Corpses beckon the female. Misfortune and harm pass back and forth, making the spirit perish and thus blemishing your rectitude. Even if a person does not notice it, his body is exposed and has already been harmed because the Three Corpses fight within the eyes, while blood is shed within the Niwan (a compartment in the brain). On these days, even if it is a girl who you are extremely fond of, or a wife of a close friend, you absolutely must not look them face to face. My predecessor and teacher became an Immortal by simply practicing this method. The [...] does not apply to [...] closest of relatives to whom you have no thoughts [...] (tr.
