5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his <b>sub-tenant,</b> Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew or Hildebert. Perhaps because of {{the distance to the}} parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a <b>sub-tenant,</b> four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of Bulkington can be traced in Domesday Book where it is {{mentioned}} as among the estates of the Count of Meulan, overseen by his <b>sub-tenant</b> Salo. Originally the parish of Bulkington consisted of two five-hide vills - in the south Bulkington and Barnacle, and in the north Marston, Weston and Bramcote. The first four of these were all held by the Count of Meulan.|$|E
50|$|Unable to {{sell the}} land, the {{government}} opted for temporarily leases. 319,200 acres had been leased by 1938, mainly to affluent individuals. The short terms of the leases encouraged malpractice, and exploitation by the tenants towards the <b>sub-tenants</b> who cultivated the land. This led to widespread unrest amongst the <b>sub-tenants</b> who were unable to pay their rent, and were falling into debt.|$|R

25|$|The 1960s saw a rapid {{expansion}} of the Objectivist movement. Rand was a frequent lecturer at universities across the country. Rand hosted a radio program on Objectivism on the Columbia University station, WKCR-FM. The Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI) hosted lectures on Objectivism, the history of philosophy, art, and psychology in cities across the country. Campus clubs devoted to studying Rand's philosophy formed throughout the country, though operated independently of NBI. Rand was a frequent guest on radio and television, {{as well as an}} annual lecturer at the Ford Hall Forum. At the peak of its popularity, NBI was delivering taped lectures in over 80 cities. By 1967 NBI had leased an entire floor in the Empire State Building (with The Objectivist as a <b>sub-tenant).</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1086, the Domesday Survey {{documents}} {{that while the}} majority of Urse's lands were in Worcestershire, he also held land in Warwickshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire. His lands in Warwickshire were held directly from the king, as a tenant-in-chief, while others were held as an under-tenant of others who had their lands directly from the king. Urse's lands in Herefordshire likewise were held as a mixture of tenant-in-chief and <b>sub-tenant,</b> as was also the case in Gloucester. Of the lands that Urse held in Worcestershire, he held them both directly from the king and from the Bishop of Worcester. Domesday also records that the revenue that Urse was responsible for as sheriff was £128 and 4 shillings from Worcestershire. This was just the amount due for the royal estates in Worcester, as Urse was also responsible for payments of £23 and 5 shillings for the royal lands in the Borough of Worcester, £17 as profits on the shire and hundred courts with an additional £16 or a hunting hawk, specifically a [...] "Norway hawk"; also due from the courts. Urse also had to pay the queen £5 plus £1 additional for a [...] "sumpter horse". All of these payments were guaranteed by Urse, who had to make up any shortfall.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, the Queensland Soccer Council (QSC) {{had taken}} over the lease of Lang Park as its home ground, with a view to using it as the home ground for BDFA {{fixtures}} (and thus leaving the Brisbane Cricket Ground). Latrobe became a <b>sub-tenant,</b> using the ground for its home games. In 1936, the Brisbane competition had remained steady in size, with the First Division still comprising eight teams: Latrobe and Milton (Lang Park), Merton Rovers, Shafston Rovers, Toombul United (Nundah), United Rangers (playing at Raymond Park No 2 field, Kangaroo Point) Wynnum and YMCA (ultimate Premiers); the Second Division six teams: Corinthians (Raymond Park No 1), Merton Rovers (Yeronga Park), Pineapple Rovers, Redfern United (Lanham [...] Park, Grange), Toombul United and YMCA.|$|E

5000|$|Land tenure is {{a common}} law {{property}} system largely inherited from property law principles developed under English and British monarchical rule.

40|$|AbstractMulti-tenancy {{architecture}} (MTA) {{is often}} used in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the central idea is that multiple tenant applications can be developed using components stored in the SaaS infrastructure. Recently, MTA has been extended to allow a tenant application {{to have its own}} <b>sub-tenants,</b> where the tenant application acts like a SaaS infrastructure. In other words, MTA is extended to STA (Sub-Tenancy Architecture). In STA, each tenant application needs not only to develop its own functionalities, but also to prepare an infrastructure to allow its <b>sub-tenants</b> to develop customized applications. This paper applies Crowdsourcing as the core to STA component in the development life cycle. In addition, to discovering adequate fit tenant developers or components to help build and compose new components, dynamic and static ranking models are proposed. Furthermore, rank computation architecture is presented to deal with the case when the number of tenants and components becomes huge. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate that the ranking models and the rank computation architecture work as design...|$|R

50|$|Entomologist Pauli Bergström {{and kidney}} surgeon Lauri Mustonen share a 280 m² rented {{apartment}} in the centre of Helsinki. Their peaceful, uneventful life is interrupted when their landlady, aging aristocrat Lydia Molotova, decides to give the apartment {{as a gift to}} her nephew, Sergeant John Molotov. Immediately, Sergeant Molotov raises the rent by a factor of more than ten, which is more than Bergström and Mustonen can pay. Not wanting to move elsewhere, they place an ad in the newspaper, looking for a <b>sub-tenant</b> to help them pay the rent. The <b>sub-tenant</b> is Carl Robert Palmberg, a Finland-Swedish interior decorator in his 30s, who is openly gay. Things get further complicated when Sergeant Molotov has to undergo surgery because of an infected kidney, and Mustonen decides to operate him privately.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} manors in Burghfield; Burghfield Regis, and Burghfield Abbas, {{although}} the current Parish of Burghfield now includes {{for the former}} manor of Sheffield (or Soefeld). King Edward IV, gave the Burghfield manor its Royal title of 'Regis'. Its manor house, alias Nether Court, stood on the site now occupied by the Rectory in Burghfield village. This manner was <b>sub-tenanted</b> {{to the family of}} Thomas de Burghfield, who proudly took his name from the village, sometime before 1175. The De Burghfields were also <b>sub-tenants</b> of Burghfield Abbas, which had been owned by Reading Abbey from about the same time. The original Burghfield Bridge was commissioned by Matthew De Burghfield, being the lord of the latter manor in the early 13th century, but later on the family had arguments with King Edward I over who should repair it. There was a minor skirmish there after the First Battle of Newbury in 1643.|$|R

5000|$|Military {{service was}} based upon units of ten knights (see Knight-service).

A mesne lord was the level of lord in the middle holding several manors, between the lords of a manor and the superior lord. The <b>sub-tenant</b> might have to provide knight-service, or finance just a portion of it, or pay something purely nominal.
