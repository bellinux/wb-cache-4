5|$|Following the 2006 season, {{several players}} graduated, {{including}} starting senior All-Americans <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith</b> (wide receiver) and Ryan Kalil (center), {{as well as}} all-conference linebackers Dallas Sartz and Oscar Lua. Junior All-American Dwayne Jarrett, who was their leading receiver in 2005 and 2006, renounced his eligibility and joined the NFL.|$|E
5|$|Early in the season, Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith</b> while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|In early 2007, Peart and Cathy Rich again began {{discussing}} {{yet another}} Buddy tribute concert. At {{the recommendation of}} bassist Jeff Berlin, Peart decided to once again augment his swing style with formal drum lessons, this time {{under the tutelage of}} another pupil of Freddie Gruber, Peter Erskine, himself an instructor of <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith.</b> On October 18, 2008, Peart once again performed at the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. The concert has since been released on DVD.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendance}} of 113,090 {{was the highest}} in college football history. Robinson had 29 carries and completed 19-of-22 passes for 186 yards, contributing 383 of Michigan's 473 total yards. Robinson ran for 197 yards, setting a school record for a quarterback, surpassing <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith,</b> who rushed for 147 yards on four carries at Minnesota on November 12, 1983. Michigan committed no turnovers, {{the first time since}} the game against Miami (Ohio) on September 6, 2008. With the win, the Wolverines improved to 108–18–2 all-time in home openers.|$|E
5|$|Kicker John Kasay is the team's career points leader. Kasay scored 1,482 {{points during}} his 16 seasons (1995–2010) with the Panthers. Quarterback Cam Newton, {{who has played}} for the Panthers since 2011, is the career passing leader, having thrown for 20,257 yards over his six seasons with the team. Running back Jonathan Stewart is the career rushing leader for the Carolina Panthers. Stewart, during his tenure with the team (2008–present), rushed for 6,868 yards with the Panthers.

5|$|The Argentine {{joined the}} Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, {{where he played}} backup for veteran guard <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith.</b> He {{spent much of the}} early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team {{at the end of the}} season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the {{defending}} champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence.|$|E
5|$|By 1986 the Flames landed {{forwards}} Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing {{second in}} the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games—the only time that the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series during the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith</b> ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{acquired}} quarterback Fran Tarkenton {{from the}} Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season {{in exchange for}} their 1st- and 2nd-round draft picks, and showed improvement. They finished 7–7 in 1967 and were 7–3 through ten games in 1968. Leaving them one game behind Capitol Division leader Dallas. However, New York dropped its final four games to again finish 7–7. Notably, in 1968, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl; it wasn't until 2010 that another Giants receiver, (<b>Steve</b> <b>Smith),</b> would make the Pro Bowl. Since Smith, Victor Cruz (2012) and Odell Beckham Jr. (2014–16) have made it to the Pro Bowl. Jones' average of 22.3 yards per reception for his career is still an NFL record.|$|E
50|$|This {{would be}} <b>Steve</b> <b>Smiths</b> Sr.s final {{game in the}} NFL. He {{finished}} the game with three catches for 34 yards. After the game, he immediately retired, ending his 16-year career.|$|R
50|$|Brown's guitar {{work can}} be heard on over 100 albums, {{including}} four Grammy Award winners. Records such as the Brecker Brothers' Return of the Brecker Brothers and Out of the Loop, Marcus Miller's The Sun Don't Lie, Billy Cobham's Warning, and Joe Zawinul's Faces and Places {{are just a few}} out of the long list. His live performances include DVDs with Marcus Miller, Billy Cobham, Gil Evans, David Sanborn, Louie Bellson, Bob James, and <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith's</b> Vital Information. Brown's compositions and arrangements are featured on albums by Les McCann, Dennis Chambers, Ricky Peterson, <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith's</b> Vital Information, and Billy Cobham.|$|R
500|$|While {{producing}} the first Buddy Rich tribute album, Peart {{was struck by}} the tremendous improvement in ex-Journey drummer <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith's</b> playing, and asked him his [...] "secret." [...] Smith responded he had been studying with drum teacher Freddie Gruber.|$|R
5|$|The National Hockey League (NHL) {{is a major}} {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} league which operates in Canada and the United States. Since its inception in 1917–18, 52 players born within the current borders of the United Kingdom have taken part. None of them, however, were trained within the country. Of these players, 23 are from England, 21 from Scotland, 5 from Northern Ireland and 3 from Wales. Steve Thomas and Owen Nolan played over 1,000 regular season games, while Thomas and <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith</b> {{are the only ones}} to have appeared in over 100 playoff games. All three players finished their careers in the 21st century. The only British born player currently playing in the NHL is Brendan Perlini of the Arizona Coyotes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1984–85 season, Anderson signed an eight-year contract with the Oilers. Anderson recorded 42 goals and 81 points and once more his team were the division champions. Anderson was also selected to play in the All-Star Game. For the third straight season, the Oilers reached the Finals. The Oilers defeated their opponent, the Philadelphia Flyers, in five games. Anderson set a career high in assists with 16 during the playoff run. The 1985–86 season saw Anderson score 54 goals, 48 assists, adding up to 102 points. This was the second time Anderson had reached the 50 goal plateau in his career and the third time he had reached the 100 point plateau. He was also selected to play in his third consecutive All-Star Game. For the fifth consecutive season, the Oilers sat atop the Smythe Division. However, the Oilers were eliminated in the division finals by the Calgary Flames on an own goal by defenceman <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith.</b> The loss did not seem to faze Anderson and his team, as they won their third Cup the next season by beating the Flyers once again, but this time in seven games. Anderson set career highs in goals (14), points (27) and PIM (59) during the playoff run.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith.</b> Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome {{to come back to the}} Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent at the end of the 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
50|$|Coming {{off their}} home {{win over the}} Bears, the Panthers flew to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 3 duel with the Minnesota Vikings. This game would also be WR <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith's</b> {{first game of the}} year, coming off his 2-game suspension.|$|R

5|$|During the 2011 preseason, the Giants lost {{tight end}} Kevin Boss, wide {{receiver}} <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith,</b> guard Rich Seubert, linebacker Keith Bulluck, wide receiver Derek Hagan, and Pro Bowl center Shaun O'Hara to free agency. However, the 2011 season {{also saw the}} emerging of second-year wide receiver Victor Cruz and second-year tight end Jake Ballard. The Giants opened the season against the Washington Redskins on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, with both New York City and Washington being a target of the attacks. The Redskins beat the Giants 28–14, but the Giants won their next three games, against the Rams, Eagles, and Cardinals. After a loss against the Seattle Seahawks, they went on another three-game winning streak. A key victory was an upset of the New England Patriots 24–20 at Gillette Stadium. The victory ended the Patriots' NFL record home-game winning streak, after a touchdown pass from Manning to Ballard with 15 seconds left. However, the Giants lost their next three games, before regaining their position atop the NFC East with a tightly contested 37–34 win over the Dallas Cowboys on December 11. After splitting their next two games against the Redskins and New York Jets, a victory over the Cowboys in the last game {{of the regular season}} clinched a postseason appearance for the Giants.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to rebuild, the team {{acquired}} several players who were highly talented, but had reputations for off-court troubles. Isaiah Rider, who was traded by the Minnesota Timberwolves for a draft pick and career backups due to his frequent arrests and lack of punctuality, was arrested for cannabis possession two days before his debut with the Blazers. Rasheed Wallace, who was acknowledged as a hot-tempered player since college, was also acquired, in a trade with the Washington Bullets. Point guard Kenny Anderson was {{signed as a free}} agent, and subsequently traded to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire in February 1998 (the Raptors traded Anderson to the Boston Celtics five days later, because {{he did not want to}} play in Canada). Initially, this approach worked, as the team returned to the Western Conference finals in 1999 under head coach Mike Dunleavy. After being swept by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs, Whitsitt sent Rider and guard Jim Jackson to the Atlanta Hawks for guard <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith</b> and acquired former All-Star forward Scottie Pippen from the Houston Rockets. The team again advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced a Los Angeles Lakers team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. In that series, the Trail Blazers dropped three out of the first four games before winning the next two, forcing a pivotal Game 7. The Blazers had a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, but lost the game and the series to the Lakers, who went on to win the first of three consecutive titles.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{visited the}} Washington Huskies, led by first–year head coach Tyrone Willingham and quarterback Isaiah Stanback. The Huskies took an early lead {{on a field}} goal, but the Trojans {{answered}} with a Leinart touchdown pass to <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith.</b> Stanback threw his only touchdown of the game late in the quarter to give the Huskies a 10–7 lead, but the Trojans took the lead for good {{less than a minute}} later with Leinart's second touchdown pass of the day. A minute into the second quarter Reggie Bush ran for a touchdown, and, after a failed extra point attempt and the Huskies offense unable to move the ball, two minutes later returned a punt 84yards for a touchdown. After another failed drive for the Huskies and another twominutes, Leinart threw his third touchdown of the game to give the Trojans a 34–10 lead. Stanback rushed for a touchdown with twominutes remaining before half-time to cut their deficit in half, but Mario Danelo kicked a field goal as time expired to give the Trojans a 37–17 lead at half-time. In the third quarter, Leinart threw his fourth touchdown of the game before he was replaced by backup Booty. A Booty interception, that was returned 76yards by Dashon Goldson, gave the Huskies their last score of the game, and Booty's touchdown pass to Patrick Turner proved to be the final score in the game, giving the Trojans a 51–24 win. With the win the Trojans extended their winning streak to 29games.|$|E
50|$|On September 25, 1982, UCLA and Michigan had {{a rematch}} of the Bluebonnet Bowl at Michigan Stadium. Quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>Smith's</b> six-yard run gave Michigan a 14-0 lead {{and after the}} Wolverines blocked a Bruin punt and took {{possession}} on the UCLA seven, Smith's five-yard pass to Anthony Carter made the score 21-0 with 12:57 remaining in the second quarter.|$|R
