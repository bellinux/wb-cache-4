5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} to cut Nebraska's lead before halftime. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback, and Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 20-yard throw to Bryan Jennings after Oxendine was stopped for no gain on a carry to the left. From the Tech 40-yard line, Oxendine carried the ball 39 yards for another first down deep inside Nebraska's {{half of the}} field. Nebraska committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but Virginia Tech was stopped for short gains on the two plays following the penalty. Virginia Tech was forced to use a timeout {{in order to stop}} the clock from moving and to allow time to plan the third-down play. With 57 <b>seconds</b> <b>remaining</b> in the first half, Parker ran the remaining two yards for a first down at the Nebraska 11-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a five-yard pass to Cornelius White, but because White was unable to get out of bounds or cross the goal line, Tech was again forced to call a timeout to stop the clock with 25 <b>seconds</b> <b>remaining.</b> On the next play, Druckenmiller completed a six-yard pass to Shawn Scales for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The score came with 19 <b>seconds</b> <b>remaining</b> in the first half, and the extra point was good, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714.|$|E

The score and extra point gave Tech a 2113 lead with 23 <b>seconds</b> <b>remaining</b> before halftime. Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech 42-yard line, potentially setting up an Indiana field goal try before halftime. Paci completed a pass to the 36-yard line, and the few <b>seconds</b> <b>remaining</b> in the first half apparently ran off the clock before Indiana could use its final timeout to stop the clock.|$|E

Janzen Jackson’s interception set up Crompton’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Moore with 18 <b>seconds</b> <b>remaining</b> in the first half. Instead of running out the clock, Taylor threw from his 33 to Jarrett Boykin, who was stopped inside the Volunteers’ 5 as the clock apparently expired.
