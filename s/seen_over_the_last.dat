5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 10 years. Their travel routes {{have been identified as}} along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

5000|$|... On 11 July, {{in a press}} release, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz {{called for}} an {{immediate}} stop to the violence. [...] "The spiral of escalation that we have <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few days is extremely threatening. Putting an immediate end to the violence is now absolutely paramount." [...] In this context, Kurz also referred {{to the meaning of}} the holy month of Ramadan, also regarded as the month of peace by Muslims."My sympathy lies with the victims of this conflict; in particular the civilians. Everything possible has to be done to prevent more civilian victims. Even though Israel has a legitimate security interest, this must be exercised with a sense of proportion and in compliance with international humanitarian law. This also means that the Israeli missile offensive must be stopped." [...] "Peace is possible", Kurz concluded. On 16 July, in another press release, Kurz said, [...] "The death toll is frighteningly high and the spiral of escalation is gaining momentum all the time",. Kurz emphasised his support of Egypt's efforts at mediation and advocated an immediate ceasefire. [...] "Neither side can refuse a ceasefire for the sake of political or tactical deliberations". He expressed sympathy for the victims, in particular the civilian casualties.|$|E

It'd be nice to go and relax and go and support him. It'd be nice to go to Monaghan games as well and support them because I've given them 20 years as a manager and player and I think that is as much as I can give. It is with a heavy heart that I do it because they are a great bunch of lads. I can't thank them enough for all they have given me. I can't thank the Monaghan supporters enough for the support they have given us and unfortunately we have not been able to deliver on the field.|$|E
5000|$|The FFF {{offered a}} {{substantial}} retrospective - {{devoted to the}} work of Alain Corneau in his presence which also helped to [...] "grow" [...] the festival's influence as some screenings started in October {{in the run-up to the}} festival itself which ran from 7 to 30 November. In Glasgow the Corneau retrospective found a home at the CCA, adding yet another venue to the line-up while the Ciné Lumière devoted a weekend to the retro. In Edinburgh and Glasgow, the festival's founding cities, the response to the overall programme which embraced work by Claude Miller, Claude Chabrol, Jean Becker, Raoul Ruiz, Philippe Muyle, Jeanne Labrune, Michel Deville, Robert Guédiguian and Danièle Thompson among many, proved pleasingly buoyant and maintained the growing momentum <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> couple of years. Stirling Macrobert were cautiously upbeat about the participation on four titles. Sidebar activity included the stunning exhibition of photographs by Nicolas Guerin, a photographer who works for Positif, shown at the French Institute in Edinburgh and on the walls of GFT's Café Cosmo; a round table on literary adaptations in the cinema featuring Franco-Scottish input from Bernard MacLaverty, Alain Corneau and Leslie Hills at the French Institute where additional attractions included a programme of documentaries on writers as well as four portraits of directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Claire Denis, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Robert Guédiguian. Again the level of activity built on initiatives started in previous years. One of the resounding causes for optimism was the positive reaction to the educational programme (Moi César, Le Papillon and Vivre me tue) which proved popular with pupils, students and teachers. The strong opening weekend (and closing at London Ciné Lumière) with many guests in attendance including Alain Corneau, Nadine Trintingnant, Jean Veber, Nicolas Vannier, and Nicolas Guerin, ensured that the festival had a vibrant send-off and produced vibes that resonated over the days ahead. Distribution of guests ensured that Dundee (Jean and Louis Becker) and Aberdeen (Thomas Chabrol) shared in the bounty.|$|E
