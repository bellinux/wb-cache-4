500|$|The [...] John Vinci {{designed}} {{building is}} a two-story structure that cost $9 million for the land, building, landscaping, and interior design. The exterior facade is buff brick with black granite windowsills and thresholds and white-painted <b>steel</b> <b>windows.</b> The building features furniture {{dating back to the}} club's founding as well as Mies van der Rohe designs. [...] Several elements of the new building's design are considered homages to Mies. The fact that the building was so Miesian thirty years after his death while the club focused on avant-gard art {{was a bit of a}} controversy. The building's atrium that allows filtered light into the central galleries and dining areas is its primary feature. [...] Another focal point of the building is the restored Mies van der Rohe steel staircase that provides access to the second floor. The design includes white-painted steel, travertine marble, floor-to-ceiling curtains, dark-stained wood floors, and large areas of glass. The color palette of saffron, black, gray, scarlet, and white is consistent with the former building. Also notable are the veil of north side metal screens. The building also has a [...] outdoor landscaped garden. The building accommodates a 200-person audience seating.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{flats and}} mansion blocks {{were built in}} Brighton, Hove and Portslade in the interwar and {{immediate}} postwar periods. [...] St Richard's Flats (mid-1930s, by Denman and Son), [...] "cottagey and jazzy at the same time", are stuccoed with wooden balconies and a clay-tiled roof. [...] King George VI Mansions at West Blatchington consist of three long groups of three-storey brick and tile terraces forming a quadrangle around an area of open space; designed by T. Garratt and Sons in the [...] "Vernacular Revival" [...] style, they are little changed since their construction. [...] Wick Hall (1936) and Furze Croft (1937, by Toms and Partners) occupy the old gardens of the original Wick Hall mansion. [...] Their [...] "elegant" [...] form and high quality makes them [...] "well-respected local landmark". [...] Furze Croft retains its Crittall <b>steel</b> <b>windows</b> and is characteristic of the 1930s Moderne style. [...] Courtenay Gate occupies a prime site on Hove seafront; designed in 1934, it rises to seven storeys and has good architectural detail. [...] In The Drive in Hove, numbers 20 and 22 are brick- and stone-built flats which enhance the streetscape of this important residential road; number 22 was [...] "designed to resemble a castle". [...] John Leopold Denman's Harewood Court (1950s), built for the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution, is a seven-storey brick-built block in the Art Deco style. Nearby, at the junction of The Drive and Cromwell Road, Eaton Manor dates from 1968–72, rises to eight storeys and contains over 100 flats. [...] It is described on the local list as [...] "handsome ... well articulated ... {{an excellent example of}} the type".|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{progress}} of the economy, heating in winter is widespread in the eastern area of China. According to the exterior-protected structure of buildings in Nanjing, the hourly and dynamic load of energy consumption {{during the time of}} heating in winter is simulated and calculated in the paper. Through calculations, the energy consumption of the different windows, walls and roofs is gained. By analyzing the results of these calculations, the conclusion that using a single frame-double plastic <b>steel</b> <b>window</b> can save energy by 37. 68 % is reached. As part of the economical efficiency analysis, an investment payback period is analyzed using the methods of static state and dynamic state. The analysis shows that by using single frame-double plastic <b>steel</b> <b>window,</b> the investment payback period is about 7 years...|$|R
50|$|Many East Riding {{schools have}} the same {{trademark}} brick work, floor surfaces and galvanised <b>steel</b> <b>windows.</b> Their structure and internal design features are very similar. South Hunsley, Beverley Longcroft, Withernsea, Headlands and Hornsea Schools all bear a great similarity, hardly surprising {{when one considers that}} they were being built at roughly the same time.|$|E
50|$|The differing {{masses of}} MacRobertson impart {{proportion}} and scale to the building, while the De Stijl colour of the articulated red steel hopper windows {{contrast to the}} blue glazed brick piers and cream brickwork, helping {{to break up the}} facade. <b>Steel</b> <b>windows</b> were not common in schools at this time and are seen as a modernist and functional approach.|$|E
50|$|The Fulton Residence {{is intimately}} {{associated}} with the esteemed architect Charles Fulton as the house he designed for his family.

50|$|During the First World War, Crittall's {{factories}} {{were used}} in munitions production, but postwar the company returned to <b>steel</b> <b>window</b> manufacture.

Multiple Coulomb scattering inside these media leads to an increase of the beam size.

50|$|Behind {{the street}} frontages {{the first floor}} of the {{building}} is set back from the northern boundary to gain natural light. The two-storeyed rear elevation to Ogden Street is plain and utilitarian without the decorative expression and composition of the front elevation. The rear and visible side walls are of painted render. <b>Steel</b> <b>windows</b> sizes vary according to use and plumbing is externally mounted. A single door, with roller shutter, allows access to the street.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building was renovated in 1983-1984, when the original <b>steel</b> <b>windows</b> were replaced.

5000|$|Thiry came to {{national}} attention in 1937 with a cement-based stuccoed residence for {{a manager at}} Portland Cement, Frank J. Barrett. The innovative house was published in The Modern House in America in 1940: the garage and house formed two rectangles, with a [...] "smooth, undecorated exterior", its doors and windows flush with the surface. <b>Steel</b> <b>window</b> frames were painted blue-green, and glass-brick was used around the entry and along {{the walls of the}} partly sunken living room.|$|R
50|$|This {{contrast}} {{can be seen}} in the Viking Apartments. The Viking shows {{contrast between}} the light-colored brick that was aligned through vertical stripes using black stone and <b>steel</b> <b>window</b> sash. Another example is the Hathaway Towers (ca. 1931). The skeletal structure is cream city brick, blonde brick. The corners of the brick are rounded with no projecting cornice, this continues with the circular lobby with terrazzo floor. However within the lobby, the trim done in silver and black, contrasting against the blonde brick.|$|R
50|$|The village {{includes}} some noteworthy early examples of Modernist architectural design; the distinctive white, flat-roofed houses on Francis Way and Silver Street are {{the work of}} influential Scottish architect Thomas S. Tait, a leading designer of Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in the 20th Century who is also credited with designing the concrete pylons on Sydney Harbour Bridge. Of note are the <b>steel</b> <b>window</b> frames manufactured by Crittall's firm as a test for their use in the damp English climate.|$|R
