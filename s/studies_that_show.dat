5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E
5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks.

5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the Deinonychus egg's {{microstructure}} {{confirms that}} {{it belonged to}} a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, the egg of Deinonychus is more {{similar to those of}} oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7cm (2.7in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2cm diameter of the largest Citipati (an oviraptorid) eggs; Citipati and Deinonychus also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of Citipati and Deinonychus eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.|$|E

25|$|Withdrawal from heavy, chronic {{cannabis}} use {{does not}} usually exceed 3–4 days, {{but it has}} the potential to be psychologically addictive. Withdrawal symptoms are generally mild - loss of appetite, insomnia, feelings of uneasiness/anxiety, tension, stomach ache, headache and irritability all being common symptoms. There are <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> no actual increased risk of cancer from smoking marijuana, even when duration of use is expanded over several years. In fact, some studies indicate THC to have anticancer properties, with studies showing tumor reduction in mice.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid may be {{involved}} in schizophrenia; however, there has been no research done to examine the specific effects of quinolinic acid in schizophrenia. There are many <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> that kynurenic acid (KYNA) plays a role in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and there has been some research to suggest that 3-hydroxykynurenine (OHK) plays a role in the disease as well. Because quinolinic acid is strongly associated with KYNA and OHK, it may too play a role in schizophrenia.|$|E

50|$|This {{variability}} of PTC tasting {{came to the}} attention of Albert Blakeslee at the Carnegie Institute of Genetics on Long Island, New York.

25|$|It is unclear, however, how {{nicotine}} {{interacts with}} positive symptoms, {{as it would}} follow from this theory that nicotine would exacerbate excess dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway and thus positive symptoms as well. One theory argues that the beneficial effects of nicotine on negative symptoms outweigh possible exacerbation of positive symptoms. Another theory is based on animal models showing that chronic nicotine use eventually results in a reduction in dopamine, thus alleviating positive symptoms. However, human studies show conflicting results, including some <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> that smokers with schizophrenia have the most positive symptoms {{and a reduction in}} negative symptoms.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> {{the health and}} medical {{benefits}} of weight loss, a study in 2005 of around 3000 Finns over an 18-year period showed that weight loss from dieting can result in increased mortality, while those who maintained their weight fared the best. Similar conclusion is drawn by other studies, and although other studies suggest that intentional weight loss has a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy, it is associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals and the slightly overweight but not obese. This may reflect the loss of subcutaneous fat and beneficial mass from organs and muscle in addition to visceral fat {{when there is a}} sudden and dramatic weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol and {{the stress}} {{response}} have known deleterious {{effects on the}} immune system. High levels of perceived stress and increases in cortisol {{have been found to}} lengthen wound-healing time in healthy, male adults. Those who had the lowest levels of cortisol the day following a 4mm punch biopsy had the fastest healing time. In dental students, wounds from punch biopsies took an average of 40% longer to heal when performed three days before an examination as opposed to biopsies performed on the same students during summer vacation. This is in line with previous animal <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> similar detrimental effects on wound healing, notably the primary reports showing that turtles recoil from cortisol.|$|E

25|$|Although silicon {{is readily}} {{available}} {{in the form of}} silicates, very few organisms use it directly. Diatoms, radiolaria and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica phytoliths (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example rice, need silicon for their growth. There is some evidence that silicon is important to nail, hair, bone and skin health in humans, for example in <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density, and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis. Silicon is needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen, of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{regressive}} tax formula, Social Security benefits are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces {{a much higher}} percentage of low-income workers' pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay {{a higher percentage of}} their pre-retirement income). Supporters of the current system also point to numerous <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and survivor benefits paid on behalf of low-income workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would only apply at a population level). Other research asserts that survivor benefits, allegedly an offset, actually exacerbate the problem because survivor benefits are denied to single individuals, including widow(er)s married fewer than nine months (except in certain situations), divorced widow(er)s married fewer than 10 years, and co-habiting or same-sex couples, unless they are legally married in their state of residence. Unmarried individuals and minorities tend to be less wealthy.|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, a {{meta-analysis}} of 87 studies investigating alcohol use and mortality risk was conducted.

2500|$|Test strips {{that changed}} color {{and could be}} read visually, without a meter, {{have been widely used}} since the 1980s.

2500|$|Some {{have criticized}} {{elements}} of Reaganomics {{on the basis}} of equity. For example, economist John Kenneth Galbraith believed that the Reagan administration actively used the Laffer curve [...] "to lower taxes on the affluent". Some critics point out that tax revenues almost always rise every year, and during Reagan's two terms increases in tax revenue were more shallow than increases during presidencies where top marginal tax rates were higher. Critics also point out that since the Reagan tax cuts, income has not significantly increased {{for the rest of the}} population. [...] This assertion is supported by <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> the income of the top 1% nearly doubling during the Reagan years, while income for other income levels increased only marginally; income actually decreased for the bottom quintile.|$|E
