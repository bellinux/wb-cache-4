5|$|At {{the height}} of the revolt, Hananu {{effectively}} created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea. Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in Armanaz, where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and weapons from local sources, and a <b>supreme</b> <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> to oversee judicial matters.|$|E

The hotel was poorly {{maintained}} during this time period. Haerlin’s three sons were assigned to fight at the front. Two of his sons, Otto and Wilhelm, died in Flanders while his third son, Fritz, survived the war. During the German Revolution of 1918 - 1919 mutinous sailors shelled the Alster Pavilion. The <b>revolutionary</b> <b>Supreme</b> Marine <b>Council</b> took over the hotel until March 1919. The poorly maintained and damaged hotel had to be completely re-renovated.

In their 6 February 2015 [...] "constitutional declaration" [...] after seizing control of the Yemeni capital and much of former North Yemen, and the failure of Thursday talks between the Houthis and Yemen’s many political parties that were aimed at forming a government to replace Hadi and his cabinet, the group declared the committee would act as Yemen's interim authority.

25|$|The Somali {{language}} {{also contains}} a few Italian loanwords that were retained from the colonial period. The most widely used is ciao, meaning goodbye.

25|$|The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> {{established}} large-scale {{public works}} programs and successfully implemented an {{urban and rural}} literacy campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the Arab world, eventually joining the Arab League (AL) in 1974. That same year, Barre also {{served as chairman of}} the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union (AU).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{national}} elections after independence, held on 30 March 1964, the SYL won an absolute majority of 69 of the 123 parliamentary seats.

However, in the same year, then President of Somalia Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke was assassinated. A military coup quickly ensued, with Siad Barre now assuming leadership.

Taraki eventually revealed that there were in total 35 members in the council, which five of them were military officers and all of them were members of the PDPA.

50|$|The Sino-Burmese {{relations}} has {{not changed}} even after the military coup took place by then commander-in-chief General Ne Win on 2 March 1962. The Union <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> led by Ne Win stated that it would still adopt the “positive neutrality” and non-alignment for its foreign policy. After two months of the coup, the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> implemented ‘Burmese way to socialism (BWS)” a socio-economic foundation {{which most of the}} <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> build their policies on. Subsequently, the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> founded ‘Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP)’ on 4 July 1962 and this was emerged as a political organisation to lead the socialist revolution in Burma. General Ne Win’s <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> was acknowledged by Chinese government two days after the coup. In order to implement the Burma way to socialism, General Ne Win’s government started to carry out its economic nationalisation and these include nationalisation of 6,700 Chinese stores, two of Beijing’s banks and all Chinese schools and newspapers between 1964 and 1965. Besides the nationalisation of the schools, the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> has also suspended the publication of foreign language newspapers and this had severely effect on Chinese influence in Burma.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} writing {{systems have been}} used over the years for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the Somali {{alphabet}} is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> formally introduced it in October 1972. The script {{was developed by the}} Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except p, v and z. Besides Ahmed's Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established Arabic script and Wadaad writing. Indigenous writing systems developed in the 20th century include the Osmanya, Borama and Kaddare scripts, which were invented by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur and Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare, respectively.|$|E

On 16 July 1991, the CFV declared {{the creation of an}} alternative government, with Zafy as its Prime Minister. Zafy was detained for a week in late July 1991 and was met with a crowd of about 100,000 supporters upon his release. He was subsequently wounded during a protest. The opposition was ultimately successful in forcing Ratsiraka to agree to the Panorama Convention, which established a transitional government and stripped Ratsiraka of most of his powers, on 31 October 1991. Zafy became head of the High Authority of the State, which, along with the Social and Economic Recovery Council, replaced the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> and the National Assembly during the 1991–1993 transitional period.|$|E
25|$|Samatar was {{a member}} of President Siad Barre's ruling <b>Supreme</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (SRC). In May 1986, Barre {{suffered}} serious injuries in a life-threatening automobile accident near Mogadishu, when the car that was transporting him smashed {{into the back of a}} bus during a heavy rainstorm. He was treated in a hospital in Saudi Arabia for head injuries, broken ribs and shock over a period of a month. Samatar, who was then serving as Vice President of Somalia, subsequently served as de facto head of state for the next several months. Although Barre managed to recover enough to present himself as the sole presidential candidate for re-election over a term of seven years on December 23, 1986, his poor health and advanced age led to speculation about who would succeed him in power. Possible contenders included his son-in-law General Ahmed Suleiman Abdille, who was at the time the Minister of the Interior, in addition to Barre's Vice President Lt. Gen. Samatar.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} decade {{following}} {{the formation of the}} BSPP the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> enjoyed the supremacy over the party. This was in accordance with the party’s constitution, which stated that he <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> was “the <b>supreme</b> authority of the party during the transitional period of its construction”. This hierarchy should later be reversed so the BSPP would lead the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council,</b> and in 1974 with the formation of a new constitution the party took the political leadership in the general elections.|$|R

The decree formally abolished the military’s <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council.</b> A second decree, issued on 1 May, named the members of the first cabinet that included Qadir as Minister of Defence.|$|R
25|$|Successive Somali governments had {{continually}} {{supported the}} cause of Somali irredentism {{and the concept of}} 'Greater Somalia', a powerful sentiment many Somalis carried, as a core goal of the state. This particularly had strong support from the Isaaq clan who notably sent many volunteers, especially in 1976 as they joined WSLF guerrilla insurgencies and sent many volunteers a year before the war took place. Another factor behind the strong support from the Isaaq {{was the fact that the}} border that was drawn between Ethiopia and Somalia cut off important grazing grounds for Isaaq tribesmen. Barre along with the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council,</b> to entrench their rule and in an attempt to regain the Somali Region of Ethiopia, launched a war against Ethiopia in 1977, this war was referred to in Somalia as 'The War for Western Somalia'. The Soviet Union, which at the time was allied to both Somalia and Ethiopia turned against Barre, and (with their allies) provided enough support to the Ethiopian army to defeat the Somali forces and force a withdrawal from the Somali region of Ethiopia.|$|E
