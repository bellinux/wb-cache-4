Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.|$|E

In Gaiman's 1998 collection of short stories, <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mirrors,</b> the poem Bay Wolf is a retelling of Beowulf in a modern-day setting. In this story, Beowulf as the narrator is ambiguous about what happened between Grendel's mother and himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Amerykahn Promise" [...] samples the 1977 song [...] "The American Promise" [...] by American band RAMP as its backing track. The {{original}} song was co-written and produced by Roy Ayers, who gave Badu the original master tape {{for her to}} rework on her album. Ayers and Edwin Birdsong were inspired to write the song by President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 speech [...] "The American Promise", which called for justice and equal rights in the United States. [...] "Amerykahn Promise" [...] features explicit political satire, with themes of disfranchisement and the hindrance of the American Dream. Its tongue-in-cheek subject matter portrays America as a land of broken promises. The song opens with a blaxploitation trailer blurb, saying [...] "more action, more excitement, more everything", and features an improvisatory funk vamp, RAMP vocalists Sibel Thrasher and Sharon Matthews, and an authoritative male voice, performed by Keith. The authoritative character is portrayed as a circus-barker whose <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>mirrors</b> presentation of the American Dream leads to contentious dialogue with Badu.

[...] The press immediately saw through the marketing ploy and GM's use of [...] "simply changing the part numbers" [...] to further the claim even though a large number of the parts were actually interchangeable between the C5 & C6. Car & Driver, along with Motor Trend quickly noticed the inaccuracy, noting that the C6 was more an [...] "evolution of the C5, instead of a complete redo". [...] This even lead C to term the C6 as the [...] "C5 and 11/16ths". GM did give the C6 a nice face lift; reducing the exterior body overhangs for a noticeably overall reduction in outward dimension. [...] The front headlights were also redone, deleting the traditional [...] "pop-up" [...] headlights, and thereby shedding a few more parts off of the list that could cause quality problems. [...] Beyond that, the majority of the C6 difference focused upon a concerted effort to upgrade the interior quality. Some are quick to point to a change in wheelbase between the C5 and C6, but here again it was <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>mirrors.</b> [...] The change was necessitated by the use of a different automatic transmission which resulted in the rear linkage points being relocated; thus presenting a [...] "longer" [...] wheelbase. [...] However, many people have studied the change and determined that it actually did nothing to alter the suspension geometry from the C5 and thus the [...] "smoke & mirrors" [...] idea that it was an [...] "all new" [...] geometry (NOTE: Interestingly, the C7 has returned to a [...] "shorter" [...] wheelbase more akin to the C5). [...] If one were to Photoshop the C5, C6, and C7's basic chassis' frame to all be one color, they would look the same. [...] So there was far more than just the front engine and rear transmission design of the C5 that was still very much present underneath the C6's skin.|$|E
