40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the use}} of explicit <b>statistical</b> <b>duration</b> models for Cantonese connected-digit recognition. Cantonese is a major Chinese dialect. The phonetic compositions of Cantonese digits are generally very simple. Some of them contain only a single vowel or nasal segment. This makes it difficult to attain high accuracy in the automatic recognition of Cantonese digit strings. Recognition errors are mainly due to the insertion or deletion of short digits. It is widely admitted that the hidden Markov model does not impose effective control on the duration of the speech segments being modeled. Our approach uses a set of <b>statistical</b> <b>duration</b> models that are built explicitly from automatically segmented training data. They parametrically describe the distributions of various absolute and relative duration features. The duration models are used to assess recognition hypotheses and produce probabilistic duration scores. The duration scores are added with an empirically determined weight to the acoustic score. In this way, a hypothesis that is competitive in acoustic likelihood, but unfavorable in temporal organization, will be pruned. The conventional Viterbi search algorithms for connected-word recognition are modified to incorporate both state-level and word-level duration features. Experimental results show that absolute state duration gives the most noticeable improvement in digit recognition accuracy. With the use of duration information, insertion errors are much reduced, while deletion errors increase slightly. It is also found that explicit duration models are more effective for slow speech than for fast speech...|$|E

30|$|Unfortunately, in {{practice}} the WSSUS assumption {{is not often}} met. The nature of the time-varying channel is such that the spatial structures of the multipath components, i.e., their number, time-of-arrivals, angle-of-arrivals (AOA), and magnitudes, change with time and location, leading to nonstationary statistics [2, 3]. More also scattering by the same object as well as variation in the AOA caused by mobility {{with respect to a}} <b>statistical</b> stationary <b>duration</b> of reference may result in correlation among scatterers. This condition violates the uncorrelated scattering assumption. And like stationarity, nonstationarity also carries informative features of the channel. Hence, developing approaches that would tap into the information that can be obtained from nonstationary analysis of the channel will be of great merit to optimal system design.|$|R
40|$|For {{scholars}} of international relations, reputation for resolve - {{the belief that}} an actor will stand firm in future disputes - {{has served as a}} seminal explanation for the outcome of interstate crises. Scholars studying state reputation remain divided as to which characteristics of the state determine reputation for resolve. Recent scholarship questions this traditional state-centric view of international relations, indicating leaders can be as influential as states in international affairs. My dissertation investigates whether individual leaders can develop reputations for resolve independently from the states they serve. In doing so, my dissertation bridges the state-centric and leader-centric literatures, contributing to our understanding of both reputations for resolve and the impact of individual leaders on international politics. My theory focuses on reputation development as I examine which information decision-makers use to make assessments of resolve. As leaders are the primary arbiters of foreign policy and interact substantially with each other during international crises and negotiations, I conclude that leaders should be able to develop independent reputations for resolve based on their behavior while in office. I further theorize that, due {{to the ways in which}} individuals access and process information, a leader's early actions while in office will matter more in assessments of his/her resolve, making initial reputations difficult to change. To test my theory against alternative hypotheses, I employ a multi-methods research design using experimental surveys, <b>statistical</b> <b>duration</b> analysis, and a historical case study. The experiments focus on the internal causal mechanisms by which individuals process information to make predictions of a leader's resolve. To test the external validity of my theory, I employ a duration analysis to examine how the resoluteness of a leader's response to a crisis helps prevent that leader from being a target of future crises. Finally, the case study uses process tracing methods to investigate the extent to which individual leaders develop reputations for resolve over time. Through these multiple methods, I find robust evidence that leaders do develop reputations for resolve independently from their state's reputation. The experiments indicate that leader behavior is influential on perceptions of resolve even when accounting for state-based characteristics. Furthermore, I find that participants are more likely to seek out and prioritize leader-based information. I also find that early perceptions of resolve have a significant impact on later perceptions. The duration analysis indicates that the resoluteness of a leader's behavior can affect his/her risk of future crisis onset. Finally, the case study shows that potential challenger leaders do take leader-based information into account when making assessments of resolve and that a leader's early behavior is particularly influential to the development of his/her reputation for resolve. Based on this evidence I conclude that leaders can develop reputations for resolve. These reputations are primarily based on a leader's statements and behavior, even when controlling for state-based variables, and are resistant to change once formed. Dissertatio...|$|E

It incorporates two types of temporal information into the recognition search. One is a <b>statistical</b> syllable <b>duration</b> model which considers the influences of 411 basesyllables, 5 tones, 4 position-in-word factors, and 3 position-in-sentence factors on syllable duration.

40|$|We {{study the}} use of a <b>statistical</b> phone <b>duration</b> model for {{separating}} intact utterances from corrupted ones in a computer-assisted pronunciation training system. Our system performs forced alignment between the input utterance and the canonical transcription of the prompted text. Intact utterances contain spoken content that correspond to the text prompt. For these utterances, our system performs detailed phonetic analysis of the alignment and generates corrective feedback to highlight the occurrence of phonetic errors. Corrupted utterances result from disfluencies, truncated recordings, or spoken content that does not correspond to the text prompt. For these cases, the appropriate feedback is to invite the user to record again. We develop a filtering mechanism for intact input utterances by means of phone duration modeling. The likelihood-ratiotest involving the phone-specific duration probability and an antimodel probability gave the best EER of 17. 16 %, which is a 20 % relative improvement over the baseline approach that incorporates phone-posterior probabilities.

METHODS: Sixty-four patients received pregabalin (150 - 300 mg twice a day) or matching placebo for 3 consecutive weeks. Responders to treatment were defined as patients with a reduction in clinical pain scores of 30 % or greater. Factors associated with timing of pain treatment (ie, duration of CP and opioid usage) were collected at baseline. In addition, other factors that potentially could influence outcome (eg, clinical pain scores prior to study medication, diabetes, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) were also included. Conventional groupwise logistic regression and analysis on the individual patient level with a machine learning technique were used to predict treatment response. RESULTS: In the conventional <b>statistical</b> analysis <b>duration</b> of CP (odds ratio, 0. 9; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 8 - 1. 1; P = 0. 3) and opioid treatment (odds ratio, 1. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 9 - 1. 1; P = 0. 6) were not associated with pain relief. In addition, none of the supplementary factors were associated with treatment response (all P > 0. 1).

At Apple Computer, statistical prosodic modeling exploits the Vic-toria corpus, recently created to broadly support ongoing speech synthesis research and development.

This paper focuses {{on the use of}} the Victoria corpus in the <b>statistical</b> estima-tion of <b>duration</b> and pitch models for Apple’s next-generation text-to-speech system in Macintosh OS X. Duration modeling relies primarily on the subcorpus of prosodic contexts, which is instrumental to uncover empirical evidence in favor of a piece-wise linear transformation in the well-known sums-of-products approach.

The data from 513 deaths were used to determine sensitivity and specificity of education in death certificate and estimate agreement rates of education level between NHANES data and death certificate data. Odds ratios for agreement in education were also estimated. Covariates considered in the analyses were gender, age, duration between NHANES and death, and cause of death. Results The proportion of deaths without recorded education in death certificate was very low (0. 2 %). A total of 29. 4 % discordant pairs were found. Sensitivity and specificity for college or higher education were 0. 84 (95 % confidence interval 0. 71 – 0. 97) and 0. 99 (0. 98 – 1. 00). However, sensitivity was poor for middle school education. The overall agreement rate was 70. 7 % (66. 8 %– 74. 6 %) when education was categorized into five groups and increased up to 88. 9 % (86. 2 %– 91. 6 %) when three education categories were used. The magnitude of validity and reliability for education did not generally vary with age, duration between health survey and death, and cause of death. However, a significantly smaller likelihood of agreement was found for middle and elementary school education after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion Low percentage of missing information on education in South Korean death certificate data could provide a great potential to monitor mortality inequalities. A more collapsed categorization in education would be recommended when a more definitive conclusion on educational mortality inequality is required. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Education {{level is}} one {{indicator}} of socioeconomic position which, {{in several countries}} including South Korea, is provided though death certificate data. Its validity determines the usefulness of death certificate data for exploring the association between socioeconomic position and mortality.
