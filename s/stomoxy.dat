40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of trypanosomosis in white Fulani cattle in Ladduga District, Kachia LGA of Kaduna State and further highlight the importance of human behavior, belief, attitude and activity in the epidemiology and control of African trypanosomosis. A total of 65 animals were sampled randomly. Blood collected from the jugular vein was stored in heparinized blood containers. The standard trypanosomosis diagnostic method was employed. An overall infection rate of 29. 2 % was recorded in the herd with bulls accounting for 20. 0 % and cows 32. 0 %. The average Packed Cell Volume (PCV) of infected animals (23. 6 ± 0. 4 %) was lower than non-infected (36. 4 ± 0. 7 %). These values were statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Clinical signs observed were lacrimation, pale mucus membrane, rough hair coat and presence of ticks. However, despite good appetite and availability of forage, emaciation was observed in 29 animals (45. 0 %). The trypanosomes encountered were T. vivax (42. 0 %), T. congolense (15. 7 %), T. brucei (21. 0 %) and mixed infection (21. 0 %).

We conducted a phylogenetic analysis including 10 representative species of the genus including multiple exemplars, together with the closely related genera Prostomoxys Zumpt, Haematobosca Bezzi, and Haematobia Lepeletier & Serville. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods from DNA fragments from the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI, 753 bp) and cytochrome b (CytB, 587 bp) mitochondrial genes, and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS 2, 426 bp). The combination of mitochondrial and nuclear data strongly supports the paraphyly of the genus <b>Stomoxys</b> because of the inclusion of Prostomoxys saegerae Zumpt. This unexpected result suggests that Prostomoxys should be renamed into <b>Stomoxys.</b> Also, the deep molecular divergence observed between the subspecies <b>Stomoxys</b> niger niger Macquart and S. niger bilineatus Grünbreg led us to propose that they should rather be considered as distinct species, in agreement with ecological data. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses support three distinct lineages within the genus <b>Stomoxys</b> with a strong biogeographical component. The first lineage consists solely of the divergent Asian species S. indicus Picard which appears as the sister-group to all remaining <b>Stomoxys</b> species.

40|$|Understanding {{the pattern}} of {{abundance}} of vector populations is important to control the potential of transmission of associated pathogens. The pattern of abundance of <b>Stomoxys</b> Geoffroy, an ubiquitous blood-sucking fly, is poorly known in tropical Africa. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal pattern of abundance of the <b>Stomoxys</b> genus along a gradient of man-made disturbance in north-eastern Gabon. Three sites (one in primary forest, one in secondary forest and one in a man-made environment) were monitored during 13 months using Vavoua traps. Seven species and subspecies were found to live in sympatry, but with distinct patterns of abundance with respect to space and time. The most abundant species was <b>Stomoxys</b> transvittatus Villeneuve, whereas the rarest species was S. xanthomelas Roubaud. <b>Stomoxys</b> calcitrans Linné was preferentially found in man-made environments, whereas S. xanthomelas was preferentially found in primary forest. <b>Stomoxys</b> abundance was the greatest in secondary forest, then in man-made environments and finally in primary forest. A seasonal variation in <b>Stomoxys</b> abundance was also found. In conclusion, forest degradation and deforestation are likely both to favour the concentration of populations of <b>Stomoxys,</b> and to change the specific composition of the <b>Stomoxys</b> community.

50|$|<b>Stomoxys</b> is a genus {{of flies}} in the family Muscidae. The genus is unusual among the Muscidae in that it {{includes}} species that are bloodsucking ectoparasites of mammals. The best-known species is <b>Stomoxys</b> calcitrans, most {{commonly known as the}} stable fly.|$|R
25|$|Typical genera are Musca, Hydrotaea, <b>Stomoxys</b> and Haematobia.|$|R
2500|$|Species {{within the}} genera <b>Stomoxys</b> stable-flies, and Haematobia horn-flies are highly adapted for blood feeding, having {{mouthparts}} {{consisting of a}} strong projecting labium with cutting elements at its point. This is used to pierce deeply into skin of host to access blood (see photograph of <b>Stomoxys</b> in the Gallery below. Females of these flies typically take repeated small meals from their hosts to support production of their batches of eggs. Both females and males feed only on blood. Cattle and domestic buffalo are also the main hosts of <b>Stomoxys</b> and Haematobia [...] flies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stomoxys</b> calcitrans is {{commonly}} called the stable fly, barn fly, biting house fly, dog fly, or power mower fly. Unlike {{most members of}} the family Muscidae, <b>Stomoxys</b> calcitrans ('sharp mouth' + 'kicking') and others of its genus suck blood from mammals.

Cold anthrone assays showed a significantly higher prevalence of sugar feeding amongst all three species at the lagoon site than at the site near Mopti.

In this study, the seasonality and daily flight activity of <b>Stomoxys</b> species were observed on two dairy farms in Saraburi Province, Thailand.

Most <b>Stomoxys</b> species peaked in September (rainy season) and gradually decreased in number toward February (dry season); a second peak occurred between March and April (hot season). <b>Stomoxys</b> calcitrans was caught through-out the year and was the most abundant species in this study.

40|$|A {{survey of}} biting dipterans was {{conducted}} in Kaura LGA of Kaduna State between November 2000 and October 2001. Fifteen species of biting flies were caught in two families, Tabanidae and Muscidae distributed in the following 4 genera: Tabanus 10, Haematopota 2, Chrysops 1 and <b>Stomoxys</b> 2. The genus <b>Stomoxys</b> represented by <b>Stomoxys</b> calcitrans Linnaeus and S. nigra Macquart had the highest abundance (62. 5 %), followed by the Tabanus (34. 6 %), Haematopota (1. 8 %) and Chrysops (1. 1 %).

Population explosions of <b>Stomoxys</b> flies may also have natural causes, affecting not only domestic and/or wild animals but also humans.

Their correct identification is important to target the vectors involved in the transmission of the pathogens and also helps in the fly control program.

Modern morphometrics, both landmark and outline-based, was used to access wing geometry of S. pullus, S. uruma and S. indicus.
