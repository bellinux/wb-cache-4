40|$|Introduction The XEMgaus program fits {{a mixture}} model of multivariate normal {{components}} {{to a given}} data set with either a density estimation [13], or a clustering [6], or a discriminant [15] analysis point of view. Estimation of the mixture parameters is performed either through maximum likelihood via the EM [14] or the SEM [9] algorithms or through classification maximum likelihood via the CEM algorithm [10]. These three algorithms can be chained (e. g. CEM then EM with results of CEM) to use advantages of each {{of them in the}} estimation process. It is possible to constrain some parameters. For example, a partition may be totally (discriminant analysis situation) or partially fixed, centers may be fixed, etc. Moreover, the 14 models on variance matrices obtained by eigenvalue decomposition [11] are implanted. It allows constraints as same variance matrices between clusters, <b>spherical</b> <b>variance</b> matrices, etc. Selection of these 14 models and/or the number of components may also b...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new path}} {{planning}} method for robots used in outdoor environments is presented. The proposed method applies Fast Marching to a 3 D surface represented by a triangular mesh to calculate a smooth trajectory from one point to another. The method uses a triangular mesh instead of a square one since this kind of grid adapts better to 3 D surfaces. The novelty {{of this approach is}} that, before running the algorithm, the method calculates a weight matrix W based on the information extracted from the 3 D surface characteristics. In the presented experiments these features are the height, the <b>spherical</b> <b>variance,</b> and the gradient of the surface. This matrix {{can be viewed as a}} difficulty map situated over the 3 D surface and is used to limit the propagation speed of the Fast Marching wave in order to find the best path depending on the task requirements, e. g., the least energy consumption path, the fastest path, or the most plain terrain. The algorithm also gives the speed for the robot, which depends on the wave front propagation speed. The results presented in this paper show how, by varying this matrix W, the paths obtained are different. Moreover, as it is shown in the experimental part, this algorithm is also useful for calculating paths for climbing robots in much more complex environments. Finally, at the end of the paper, it is shown that this algorithm can also be used for robot avoidance when two robots approach each other, and they know each other's position.

40|$|In this work, we generalize {{the theory}} of {{localized}} surface plasmons {{to the case of}} high-Tc cuprate superconductors, spatially confined in the form of small <b>spherical</b> particles. At <b>variance</b> from ordinary metals, cuprate superconductors are characterized by a low-energy bulk excitation known as the Josephson plasma wave (JPW), arising from interlayer tunneling of the condensate along the c-axis. The effect of the JPW is revealed in a characteristic spectrum of surface excitations, which we call Josephson surface plasmons. Our results, which apply to any material with a strongly anisotropic electromagnetic response, are worked out in detail for the case of multilayered superconductors supporting both low-frequency (acoustic) and transverse-optical JPW. Spatial confinement of the Josephson plasma waves may represent a new degree of freedom to engineer their frequencies and to explore the link between interlayer tunnelling and high-Tc superconductivity...|$|R
40|$|Geometric {{characteristics}} of the spherical earth are shown {{to be responsible for}} the increase of variance with latitude of zonally averaged meteorological statistics. An analytic model is constructed to display the effect of a spherical geometry on zonal averages, employing a sphere labeled with radial unit vectors in a real, stochastic field expanded in complex <b>spherical</b> harmonics. The <b>variance</b> of a zonally averaged field is found to be expressible in terms of the spectrum of the vector field of the spherical harmonics. A maximum variance is then located at the poles, and the ratio of the variance to the zonally averaged grid-point variance, weighted by the cosine of the latitude, yields the zonal correlation typical of the latitude. An example is provided for the 500 mb level in the Northern Hemisphere compared to 15 years of data. Variance is determined to increase north of 60 deg latitude...|$|R

40|$|The EGM 2008 {{model is}} {{nowadays}} {{one of the}} description of the global gravitational field at the highest resolution. It is delivered with two, not fully consistent, sources of information on its error: <b>spherical</b> harmonic coefficient <b>variances</b> and a geographical map of error variances, e. g. in terms of geoid undulation. In the present work, the gravity field information derived from a GOCE satellite-only global model is used to improve the accuracy of EGM 2008 model in the low to medium frequencies, especially in areas where no data were available at the time of EGM 2008 computation. The key issue is to set up the error covariance matrices of the two models for an optimal least-squares combination: the full error covariance matrix of GOCE spherical harmonic coefficients is approximated by an order-wise block-diagonal matrix, while for EGM 2008, the pointwise error variances are taken from the provided geoid error map and the error spatial correlations from the coefficient variances. Due to computational reasons the combination is directly performed in terms of geoid values over a regular grid on local areas. Repeating the combination for overlapping areas {{all over the world and}} then performing a harmonic analysis, a new combined model is obtained. It is called GECO and extends up to the EGM 2008 maximum degree. Comparisons with other recent combined models, such as EIGEN- 6 C 4, and a local geoid based on new gravity datasets in Antarctica are performed to evaluate its quality. The main conclusion is that the proposed combination, weighting the different input contributions not only on a global basis but also according to some local error information, can perform even better than other more sophisticated combinations in areas where the input global error description is not reliable enough...|$|R
40|$|The most {{advanced}} global gravity model, EGM 2008, is nowadays competing with local models {{in terms of}} resolution and accuracy {{in the definition of}} the Earth gravity field. This global model, complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 2159, is however affected by several biases mainly due to datum inconsistencies and variability of the input observations density and accuracy. This article addresses the problem of improving the EGM 2008 model exploiting a satellite-only model based on the Gravity and steady state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) mission. The GOCE model, apart from being more accurate in the medium frequencies, is not affected by local biases since it is obtained by a global homogeneous data set referred to a unique geocentric ellipsoid: so both effects of different data sources and inconsistent height datums are not present. The resulting combination can vary depending on the weighting of the two global models. A first simple solution is to average spherical harmonic coefficients of the same degree and order by computing the weights as the inverse of their error variance. Another attempt is to consider for the GOCE model also the error correlations of the coefficients that are available through an order-wise covariance matrix. The paper shows also a way to integrate the two available, but not fully consistent, sources of information about the EGM 2008 error, i. e., the <b>spherical</b> harmonic coefficient <b>variances</b> and a geographical estimate of the geoid variance. The study has been performed on the Mediterranean area because it was required for the GOCE-Italy project and because in this area the obtained merged geoid can be validated, e. g., by using available drifter data. The main conclusion {{is that there is no}} a general criterion to chose which is the optimal way to merge the EGM 2008 and GOCE models. This is because the full stochastic structure of EGM 2008 is not available and only approximations can be used. This means that each case study has to be dealt with separately. In particular for the Mediterranean area the differences between the proposed combinations are here presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe β decays View the MathML sourceMn 68 →Fe 68, View the MathML sourceMn 69 →Fe 69 and View the MathML sourceMn 70 →Fe 70 {{have been}} {{measured}} at the RIBF facility at RIKEN using the EURICA γ spectrometer combined with an active stopper consisting of a stack of Si detectors. The nuclei were produced as fission fragments from a beam of 238 U at a bombarding energy of 345 MeV/nucleon impinging on a Be target and selected using the BigRIPS separator. Half-lives and β-delayed neutron emission probabilities have been extracted for these decays, together with first experimental information on excited states populated in 69, 70 Fe. The data indicate a continuously increasing deformation for Fe isotopes up to A= 70 A= 70. This is interpreted, as for Cr isotopes, {{in terms of the}} interplay between the quadrupole correlations of the ν 1 d 5 / 2 ν 1 d 5 / 2 and ν 0 g 9 / 2 ν 0 g 9 / 2 orbitals and the monopole component of the π 0 f 7 / 2 –ν 0 f 5 / 2 π 0 f 7 / 2 –ν 0 f 5 / 2 interaction. Magic numbers, originating from large energy gaps in the shell structure of the single-particle states, constitute one of the fundamental features governing nuclear structure. The access to new exotic species, where the number of protons (Z) and neutrons (N) is highly asymmetric, showed the onset of new magic numbers and an evolution of shell gaps driven by the enhanced role of pairing interactions and of tensor terms [1] and [2]. These interesting findings, obtained using radioactive beams and confirmed by the many developments in shell model calculations, are based on a very extensive experimental and theoretical work. Presently they are motivating additional experimental and theoretical investigations addressing these important issues on shell structure in nuclei further away from stability. Indeed, the evolution of shell structure depends strongly on the occupations of proton and neutron orbitals near the Fermi surface and on their mutual interactions, and, therefore, it can only be identified via systematic studies of nuclear properties in different isotopic and isotonic chains. In this context, one region in the chart of nuclides attracting particular attention is that around 78 Ni, a key region to study the path toward the N= 50 N= 50 shell closure and its implications on the astrophysical r-process [3], [4] and [5] for nucleosynthesis. In particular, the study of the evolution of excited states for the Cr, Fe, Zn, Ge isotopes provides a stringent test to shell model calculations leading to N= 50 N= 50. The existence of the sub-shell closure at N= 40 N= 40 was proposed since a relatively large gap separates the pf shell from the neutron g 9 / 2 g 9 / 2 single-particle state. This picture was initially confirmed by the measurement of a large energy of the first 2 + 2 + state in 68 Ni and, more recently, of its B(E 2) value: the level energy is much higher than the neighbouring even–even isotopes [6], while the B(E 2) is indeed the smallest in the Nickel chain [7]. Langanke and collaborators [8] argued, however, by comparing several approaches, that the small experimental B(E 2) value could not be a conclusive argument in favour of a shell closure, since the missing strength lies in excited states above 4 MeV. Recent mass measurements support this picture, implying a relatively small shell gap [9]. The study of nuclei around 68 Ni, in particular removing protons from the 0 f 7 / 20 f 7 / 2 orbital, confirmed the picture of the vanishing of the shell closure at N= 40 N= 40 : the observed rapid drop in the energies of the 2 + 2 + states in Fe (Z= 26 Z= 26) [10], [11], [12], [13] and [14] and Cr (Z= 24 Z= 24) [15] and [16] isotopic chains points to an increased collectivity in these nuclei, which is expected to reach its maximum at N= 40 N= 40 and N= 38 N= 38 in Fe and Cr, respectively [17]. It has also been suggested that the ground states of 62 – 68 Fe are dominated by <b>spherical</b> configurations, at <b>variance</b> with the ground states of 60 – 64 Cr, which are associated to deformed shapes [18]. A very recent intermediate Coulomb excitation experiment [19] extended the measurement of the View the MathML sourceB(E 2 : 01 +→ 21 +) which were known only up to 66 Fe [13] and [14] and gave the first result at N= 40 N= 40 in the Cr chain. The large B(E 2) value found for 68 Fe suggests an increased collectivity in this nucleus as compared to the lighter isotopes. This large body of experimental works suggest that shell-model calculations have to include the neutron 1 d 5 / 21 d 5 / 2 orbital in order to reproduce the large quadrupole collectivity found in these isotopic chains. These computational-heavy calculations predict an onset of deformation for N= 40 N= 40 in the Fe chain and at N= 38 N= 38 in the Cr one. Chromium isotopes are expected to show maximum deformations in this region, being the proton 0 f 7 / 20 f 7 / 2 orbital half filled [17], [20] and [21]. The work presented in this letter is intended to extend the experimental knowledge of the isotopic chain of Fe in the neutron rich side by new measurements that have provided the half-lives and β-delayed neutron emission probabilities of their β-decaying parents 68, 69, 70 Mn, and the excitation energies of the first excited states up to N= 44 N= 44. These data are compared with the experimental systematics for Ni, Fe, Zn, Ge, and with recent shell model calculations to deduce the orbitals involved in these new excitations and collective effects, supporting the picture of an increasing deformation while adding neutrons. The experiment here discussed was performed at RIKEN as part of the EURICA campaign at the Radioactive-Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) facility. The nuclear species were produced by means of in-flight fission of a 238 U beam at a bombarding energy of 345 MeV/nucleon. The experiment collected data for an equivalent time of 3 days with an average primary beam intensity of 10 pnA. The resulting fragments were separated in the Big-RIPS separator, by the use of degraders at the intermediate dispersive foci [27]. The cocktail beam was transported through the ZeroDegree spectrometer down to the final focal plane where it was then slowed down in an Al degrader to ensure the implantation of the species of interest in the 5 silicon detectors of the WAS 3 ABi array [28]. The total count rate at the final focal plane was limited to 100 pps to ensure correct ion-β correlations. The Si array was surrounded by the EURICA spectrometer consisting of 12 EUROBALL HPGe cluster detectors [29]. Eighteen small volume LaBr 3 (Ce) scintillator detectors were also employed for fast-timing measurements [30]. The yields for the mother nuclei, after implantation, were: 6700 68 Mn ions, 4300 69 Mn ions and 400 70 Mn ions. Once the different isotopes were identified, they were associated to their subsequent β decay by imposing spatial and temporal correlations: we requested the β event to be registered in the pixel where the implantation occurred, or in the closest neighbours, and, in addition, a time correlation window was imposed. All β events satisfying these conditions were associated with an implant. Typical β efficiency for 68, 69, 70 Mn was estimated to be around 60 %. Since the half-lives of the Mn isotopes of interest {{are similar to those of}} their Fe and Co successors [22], a fit to the Bateman equations [31], including the activity of daughter and grand-daughter nuclei, was performed for each species. Half-lives of decay successors were fixed to their literature values [22] if known. The β-delayed neutron emission branch is expected to contribute significantly to the total decay rate of the neutron-rich Mn isotopes [23]. Since β -delayed neutron emission probabilities (PnPn) are not measured in 68 – 70 Mn, they have been deduced as free parameters in the fit. When the statistics were sufficiently high, the half-lives were cross-checked with values obtained gating on de-exciting γ-ray transitions of the daughter nuclei, by fitting the decay spectrum with an exponential decay curve. The evaluated half-lives for the discussed decays are the following: View the MathML sourceMn 68 →Fe 68 T 1 / 2 = 38. 3 ± 3. 6 msT 1 / 2 = 38. 3 ± 3. 6 ms, and T 1 / 2 = 35. 2 ± 2 msT 1 / 2 = 35. 2 ± 2 ms gating on γ transitions (521 + 865 + 1250 + 1514 keV 521 + 865 + 1250 + 1514 keV); View the MathML sourceMn 69 →Fe 69 T 1 / 2 = 24. 1 ± 2. 6 msT 1 / 2 = 24. 1 ± 2. 6 ms, and T 1 / 2 = 25. 8 ± 2. 8 msT 1 / 2 = 25. 8 ± 2. 8 ms with gates on the following γ rays: 135, 325, 355, 521, 1207 keV. In the case of View the MathML sourceMn 70 →Fe 70 the half-life could only be extracted from a fit of the decay curve, resulting in T 1 / 2 = 19. 9 ± 1. 7 msT 1 / 2 = 19. 9 ± 1. 7 ms. Error bars include both statistical and systematic errors, calculated from the χ-square minimization described earlier. The measured half-lives are reported in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 : filled circles represent the values extracted from a fit to the β-decay spectrum, while filled triangles are obtained gating on de-exciting γ transitions in the daughter nuclei...|$|R
