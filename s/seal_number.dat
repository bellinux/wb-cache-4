Therefor {{the value of a}} b field must be collected by the verifier before verification can be performed. This is useful to link a physical object with an barcode and/or RFID tag to be used as an anti-counterfeiting measure; for example the <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> of a bottle of wine may be a b field. The verifier needs to enter the <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> for a successful verification since it is not stored in the barcode on the bottle. When the seal is broken the <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> may also be destroyed and yielded unreadable; the verification can therefore not take place since it requires the <b>seal</b> <b>number.</b> A replacement seal must display the same seal number; using holograms and other techniques may make the generation of a new copied <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> not viable. Similarly the unique tag ID, also known is the TID in ISO/IEC 18000, can be used in this manner to prove that the data is stored on the correct tag. In this case the TID is a b field. The interrogator will read the DigSig envelope from the changeable tag memory and then read the non-changeable unique TID to allow for the verification. If the data was copied from one tag to another, then the verification process of the signed TID, as stored in the DigSig envelope, will reject the TID of the copied tag.|$|E

Here, we examine how Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) at Seal Rocks, Victoria, Australia, responded to normal climatic conditions from August 2009 to January 2010, which included their Austral spring-summer breeding period, to investigate their tolerances {{to a range of}} environmental stimuli. <b>Seal</b> <b>numbers</b> ashore and a range of climatic variables were collected hourly during daylight periods and compared using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs). Air temperature was the most consistent predictor of haul-out behavior, with <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> ashore declining as air temperature increased (effect size - 50 %, edf 1. 00, P < 0. 001). Increased wave height (effect size 74 %, edf 1. 00, P < 0. 001) and wind speed (effect size 79 %, edf 1. 00, P < 0. 001) were associated with increased <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> ashore. Potentially, higher air temperatures reduce the seals tolerance to remain out of the water, while high wind/wave action increases at-sea metabolic costs. These results demonstrate how changes in climate could alter a seal's ability to remain ashore, to rest or breed, and its ability to forage effectively, thus driving changes in population status and range...|$|R

40|$|The {{project was}} carried out from the {{beginning}} of May to the beginning of July 1994, at Seal Sands, in the Tees estuary. The study aimed to examine (i) ecological and (ii) behavioural aspects of two species of seals, common seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). The aims of the study were (i) : (a) to document the seasonal fluctuation in number of seals using haul-out sites during May and June, (b) To compare activities between day and night time, (c) To examine possible factors influencing the proportion of the Tees population of common and grey seals hauling-out at Seal Sands, and factors conditioning haul- out site choice, (ii) : (a) To examine distribution on haul-out sites and haul-out site fidelity, group and individual behaviour, (b) To determine vigilance behaviour in common and grey seals in relation to time of the day and group size. The number of seals hauled-out at Seal Sands, varied from day to day and night to night, and between successive low tides. The common <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> hauling-out, varied from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 39, at day time, and from 9 to 15 at night time, these number increased gradually during the study period. The number of grey seals varied from nil on two occasions to 27 at daytime, and from 2 to 26 at night time. Both high and low number of common and grey seals tended to occur on the same days. The number of animals hauling out could be influenced by both environmental factors and population size at Teesmouth. Numbers of common seals at site C during day time was significantly and inversely related to the tide level at low water. The numbers of grey seals at site C at night time were inversely related to wind speed and positively related to maximum temperature. The changes in sites use are discussed in relation to physical characteristics of the sites and tide levels. Common and grey seals were observed to haul-out in restricted areas, although space availability was not a limiting factor. Common seals showed site fidelity both as individuals and as a group. Grey seals, show site fidelity as a group. Vigilance behaviour varied considerably within the two species of seals. In relation to the time of the day, the percentage of common seals alert, tended to decrease progressively after low tide. The percentage of grey seals alert was lower than in common seals with few peaks caused by sudden disturbance. Common seals show a strong negative correlation between the percentage of individuals alert and group size, whereas grey seals did not show any relation {{to the size of the}} group...|$|E

Trends in the abundance of the harbour seal population on the whole coast and in coastal regions of Iceland waters were estimated using ANCOVA on the survey counts, corrected for the influence of several covariates. Harbour seals were found in every coastal area, but were most abundant in Faxaflói, Breiðafjörður and on the northwest coast in the beginning of this study. Harbour <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> declined significantly at a rate of rest = - 0. 04 (SE 0. 005) yr- 1 during this period.

40|$|The haul-out {{behaviour}} of {{harbour seal}} (Phoca vitulina vitulina) {{is influenced by}} several {{factors such as the}} tidal state and environmental variables. Understanding these effects is important for designing counting-surveys providing data necessary to be able to estimate population size. The haul-out behaviour of harbour seals was investigated during the moulting period in three different localities by performing repeated land based visual counts at haul-out sites. The results from the counts were modelled using generalized additive mixed modelling {{to gain a better understanding}} of the relationship between the fine scale haul-out behaviour of harbour seals and the tidal cycle, as well as other sources of variability affecting the <b>number</b> of <b>seals</b> hauled out. In addition, results from aerial survey photographs of harbour seals from the same areas were compared to the results from the land based counts. The development of hauled out seals in time at haul-out sites was explained by the tidal cycle and other sources of variation on haul-out behaviour such as disturbance, time of day and movement of seals between haul-out sites were factors influencing <b>seal</b> <b>numbers.</b> The within-day variation in <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> along the tidal cycle was also investigated through the use of correction factors which revealed that counting-surveys should be performed around low tide when corrected estimates have a small uncertainty. The unexpected between-days variation in <b>seal</b> <b>numbers,</b> together with the investigated quality of aerial surveys, revealed the need for replicate counts at haul-out sites to provide a measure of uncertainty in the population estimates of Norwegian harbour seals...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{fur seals}} {{are known to}} {{interact}} directly (i. e. operational interactions) with trawlers fishing in the winter blue grenadier trawl fishery of western Tasmania, Australia. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the environmental and operational aspects of the fishery that were associated with increased <b>numbers</b> of <b>seals</b> observed at the surface. The incidence of net entry was determined in order to establish the effectiveness of the currently used Seal Exclusion Device (SED) at reducing by-catch and mortalities. In addition, the stage and depth at which seals were at greatest risk of entering the net at depth and becoming by-catch were also identified. An increase in <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> observed at the surface is assumed to be proportional to the increased risk of by-catch and mortality incidences at trawlers. The most important subset of environmental and operational factors for predicting the <b>number</b> of <b>seals</b> observed at the surface both in the fishing ground in general and during fishing operations were identified using Generalised Linear Modelling. The final model yielded a significant result (R 2 = 0. 63, P < 0. 01, n = 149) and indicated that the <b>number</b> of <b>seals</b> observed increased when weather conditions deteriorated, particularly when barometric pressure decreased and when swell height and visibility increased. Vessel operations also influenced the <b>number</b> of <b>seals</b> observed; <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> increased when the number of nearby vessels and trawl frequency increased, but decreased when vessel speed increased. <b>Seal</b> <b>numbers</b> also increased as the distance from the nearest breeding colony and haul-out site decreased. <b>Seal</b> <b>numbers</b> at the surface generally increased steadily during trawling operations (n = 475), although brief declines were noted during shooting and hauling phases. Sub-surface net interactions were also examined using a submersible video camera unit. Seal activity at depth was converse to that observed at the surface, with increased <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> noted during shooting and hauling, suggesting that seals dived to forage on fish in the submerged net. All seal by-catch occurred during the day and almost half occurred during shooting. Mortalities were significantly higher during shooting compared with hauling (Fishers exact test: coef. = 0. 65, P < 0. 05). However, mortality rates were similar between tows with the Seal Exclusion Device (SED) attached and those without (Fishers exact test: coef. = 0. 07, P < 0. 99). Only one seal was detected entering and exiting the net mouth during monitored tows, suggesting that the recently observed reduction in by-catch levels (and mortalities) may not necessarily be attributed to the introduction of the Seal Exclusion Device. Seal by-catch recorded during hauling typically occurred when haul speeds exceeded minimum average swimming speeds for fur seals. Recommendations based on these findings have been made to assist with the future management of fur seal populations that interact with trawl fisheries. Derek J. Hamer and Simon D.

40|$|In theory {{there should}} be a strong {{coupling}} between host and parasite population sizes. Here, we investigated population size and structure in 3 species of acanthocephalans, Corynosoma semerme, C. strumosum and C. magdaleni, in ringed seals (Phoca hispida) from the Bothnian Bay over a period ofmore than 20 years. During this period, <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> first decreased markedly and then increased steadily; at the same time, a paratenic fish host particularly important for C. strumosum has gradually disappeared from the bay due to decreasing salinity. We found no evidence that the mean abundance of any of the 3 acanthocephalan species changed significantly over time, nor was there any relationship between parasite abundance at any point in time and <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> in the corresponding year. Based on the proportion of sexuallymature female worms per infrapopulation, and on relationships between the sex ratio of worms and infrapopulation size, both C. magdaleni and C. semerme appear to be doing well, independently of the population size of their seal definitive hosts. In contrast, perhaps because of the loss of its main paratenic host, C. strumosum appears more at risk in the Bothnian Bay. Our results show that in complex natural systems, there are not necessarily simple, direct links between definitive host population size or density, and parasite population dynamics.
