5|$|According to the Domesday Survey of 1086, Tameside {{was divided}} into four manors, those of Tintwistle, Hollingworth, Werneth, and Mottram. The land east of the River Tame was in the Hundred of Hamestan in Cheshire and held by the Earl of Chester while {{to the west of}} the river was in the Hundred of Salford under Roger de Poitevin. These manors were divided to create further manors, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 13th century most of them were owned by local {{families}} and remained in the hands of the same families until the 16th century. Manorialism continued as the main for of administration and governance until the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers {{documented}} {{the lives of}} Day, Haggart, Hill and McDonnell as they attempted to write, record and release a charity single through crowdsourcing. The series was shown in real time, {{with each of the}} first ten episodes detailing the events of the previous seven days. On 5 September 2009, one week before the programme's first episode aired, the group announced on the YouTube channel ChartJackersProject their intention to release a number one single within their ten-week time frame. A different task would be undertaken each week, <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the project, the song would be completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the 4th Parachute Brigade, {{although}} {{still part of}} the 1st Airborne Division, was {{kept out of the}} Allied invasion of Sicily by a shortage of transport aircraft. The 1st Airlanding Brigade took part in Operation Ladbroke and the 1st Parachute Brigade in Operation Fustian. Both brigades suffered heavy casualties, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time Operation Slapstick was proposed, only the 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades were up to strength. Slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert German forces from the main Allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact the Italian ports of Taranto, Bari and Brindisi.|$|E
25|$|Over {{time the}} wartime battalions {{that had been}} disbanded in 1946 were re-raised, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> 1965 <b>the</b> Regiment {{consisted}} of five battalions once more.|$|R
3000|$|... pH {{changes were}} quite {{different}} in {{both types of}} soils <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> amount of crumb rubber, loamy sand soil’s pH value decreases, whereas silty clay soil’s pH was increased.|$|R
50|$|Because {{no other}} work was {{available}} to her, Root began defending rape and murder cases. She became <b>so</b> skilled <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s young prosecutors and defense attorneys would gather to watch her cross-examination of prosecuting witnesses.|$|R
5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many {{administrative positions}} to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices {{to the old}} aristocracy, {{and at the same}} time elevating the rank of already existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the century}} that followed, Norman feudal law {{gradually}} replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 13th century the Norman-Irish {{had established a}} feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and {{the seeds of the}} modern county system. A version of the Magna Carta (the Great Charter of Ireland), substituting Dublin for London and Irish Church for Church of England, was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing {{a number}} of vessels from a British troop convoy and sending the prizes, with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's intention was to raid the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year. However, on 23 December he was pursued by Duckworth and driven far off course, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time he reached the Cape of Good Hope, where he planned to resupply his ships, {{it had already been}} captured by a British expeditionary force. Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force to raid shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E
30|$|According to Eq.  12, {{specific}} cake {{resistance is}} strongly dependent on d p. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> size of solids the cake resistant would decrease. In this case, increasing concentration at low temperature led to forming larger particles that caused decreasing cake resistant and increasing permeate flux.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of capital or credit to invest in their lands many campesinos sold their lands after the land reform was over. After the land reform there was a process of reconcentration of land {{ownership}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> 1997 <b>the</b> land ownership was more concentrated {{than it had been in}} 1955.|$|R
50|$|By this time, {{however, the}} Argives became advocates for liberty {{of speech and}} laws of their own making, and they diminished {{the power of their}} king <b>so</b> much <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of his reign, Cisus had become a king in name only. He was succeeded by Lacidaus.|$|R
5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
5|$|France hosted England at Colombes on 1 January 1908 for {{the third}} rugby {{encounter}} between the two nations. Although France lost the game 0–19, the press did not consider it a crushing defeat, given that on the previous occasions England had scored 35 points and then 41. During the first half, two French players departed the field injured, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> second half, England had the advantage in numbers {{and were able to}} control the game, which at the start had appeared (to the French press) to be well-balanced. The forwards were considered to be at least equal to, if not better, than the English. Guillemin and Duval amongst the forwards, as well as the backs Hubert and Moure, drew praise from Reichel.|$|E
5|$|Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model—commander of Army Group B—had {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Arnhem and was re-establishing defences {{in the area}} and co-ordinating the reorganisation of the scattered units <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time the Allies launched Market Garden there would be several units opposing them. To the west of Arnhem was Kampfgruppe Von Tettau, a force equivalent to seven battalions made up of all manner of German units (including Das Heer, Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, rear echelon and Waffen-SS troops) under the command of General Hans von Tettau at Grebbeberg. This included the SS Non-commissioned officer school SS Unteroffizierschule Arnheim and the 16th SS Training Battalion under the command of SS Sturmbannführer Sepp Krafft whose unit would {{play a crucial role in}} the opening phases of the battle. Within Arnhem itself, the town garrison was under the command of Major-General Friedrich Kussin.|$|E
50|$|Cheese {{and butter}} making were {{important}} businesses in Blandford throughout the 19th century. Their introduction {{was attributed to}} Amos Collins, a Connecticut merchant, who had settled in Blandford in 1807. He was <b>so</b> successful <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time he left Blandford in 1816, Collins had gained a comfortable fortune.|$|R
50|$|From 1855 the Sächsische Maschinenfabrik also {{produced}} turbines and mill equipment, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> 1857 <b>the</b> work force {{had grown to}} about 1,500 employees. In the mid-1860s, steam locomotive production reached a very high level; to wit in 1868 a new production hall was built in which up to 36 locomotives could be simultaneously mounted.|$|R
50|$|Further {{branches}} {{were established}} in Uruguay (1952) and Beirut (1954), <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> 1957, <b>the</b> HBU maintained branches in the Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, Argentina, Brazil, Israel, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Suriname. The branch network was expanded further into Ecuador, and in 1965 into Paraguay. After the 6-Day War in 1967 the branches in Israel were closed.|$|R
5|$|Having been an {{important}} through route since Roman times, businesses were established along the road during the Middle Ages. Senior clergy lived in Fleet Street during this period where there are several churches including Temple Church and St Bride's. Fleet Street became known for printing and publishing {{at the start of}} the 16th century and it became the dominant trade <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 20th century most British national newspapers operated from here. Much of the industry moved out in the 1980s after News International set up cheaper manufacturing premises in Wapping, but some former newspaper buildings are listed and have been preserved. The term Fleet Street remains a metonym for the British national press, and pubs on the street once frequented by journalists remain popular.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose the}} use of the photopolymers that have been {{optimized}} in our laboratory to obtain holographic lenses in non-plane substrates. Because photopolymers are self-developing, it is possible to introduce them between two spherical plates of glass which are concentric <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> using <b>the</b> adequate spacers, we generate a uniform layer of photopolymer on the spheric substrates...|$|R
25|$|Senator Henry Clay, {{though an}} {{advocate}} of protection and a political rival of Jackson, piloted a compromise measure through Congress. Clay's 1833 compromise tariff specified that all duties more than 20% {{of the value of}} the goods imported were to be reduced <b>by</b> easy stages, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> 1842, <b>the</b> duties on all articles would reach the level of the moderate tariff of 1816.|$|R
500|$|Subercase, {{concerned}} that the British might return the following year, worked to strengthen the fortifications at Port Royal. [...] He also built a small warship {{to assist in the}} colony's defenses, and convinced Morpain to raid New England shipping. [...] The privateer was <b>so</b> successful <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of 1708 Port Royal was overcrowded with prisoners from the captured prizes.|$|R
5|$|In {{late summer}} 1342, Kantakouzenos, {{accompanied}} by several Serbian magnates, marched into Macedonia {{at the head}} of a Greek and Serbian force, intending to break through to his wife, who still held out at Demotika. His advance was stopped almost immediately before Serres when the city refused to surrender, and the subsequent siege had to be abandoned after an epidemic killed most of his men, forcing him to retreat into Serbia with a rump force of barely 500 soldiers. Dušan led a more successful parallel campaign, capturing Vodena (Edessa). Serbian forces captured Florina and Kastoria shortly afterwards, thereby extending their hold over western Macedonia. The Serbs also expanded their control over Albania, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1343, with the exception of Angevin-controlled Dyrrhachium, all of the region appears to have fallen under Serbian rule. Morale among Kantakouzenos' followers fell dramatically. Rumours circulated in Constantinople that a dejected Kantakouzenos planned to retire to Mount Athos as a monk, and riots broke out in the city in which several rich men were killed and their houses looted by the populace.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
5|$|Linois sailed from Toulon on 13 June 1801 {{with three}} ships {{of the line}} and one frigate {{carrying}} 1,560 soldiers under Brigadier-General Devaux. Ganteaume's earlier expedition was still in the Eastern Mediterranean, and so the British blockade force under Sir John Borlase Warren detailed to watch Toulon was instead off Malta hoping to intercept Ganteaume on his return. Therefore, the only British ships on hand when Linois emerged from the port were a few frigates, which were easily chased away by the larger warships of the French squadron. Linois's passage was slow, facing winds from the southwest that delayed his squadron <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 30 June they were only off Cape de Gata in the Alboran Sea. On 1 July they were spotted from Gibraltar, although the only warship there was the 14-gun HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas which was unable to influence their advance. Instead, Captain Dundas ordered Lieutenant Richard Janvarin to take a boat and communicate with the Cadiz blockade force of seven ships of the line, under Saumarez.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Social Security website, [...] "The {{tax rate}} in the {{original}} 1935 law was 1% each on the employer and the employee, on the first $3,000 of earnings.

25|$|In 1961, {{after leaving}} Hollyfield School in Surbiton, Clapton {{studied at the}} Kingston College of Art but was {{dismissed}} {{at the end of}} the academic year because his focus remained on music rather than art. His guitar playing was <b>so</b> advanced <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> age of 16, he was getting noticed. Around this time, Clapton began busking around Kingston, Richmond, and the West End.|$|R
5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The opencast mining activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the nineteenth}} century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E
5|$|President Paul von Hindenburg {{appointed}} Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. Over {{the next}} few months, during the so-called Gleichschaltung, Hitler dispensed {{with the need for}} the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic as a legislative body and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> middle of 1933 the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected veteran field marshal. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence {{during the early years of}} the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|The 1951–52 season saw {{the club}} nearly win the Double, but {{ultimately}} end up empty-handed; {{a series of}} injuries and a fixture pile-up {{at the end of}} the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches, including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season; after losing 6–1, the Gunners finished third, equal on points with Tottenham. A week later, Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final, with several recovering players rushed back into the first team; Walley Barnes was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes (no substitutes were allowed then), and ten-man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton, Roper and Daniel, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch; with the numerical advantage in their favour, Newcastle won 1–0 with a goal from George Robledo.|$|E
2500|$|Around 15BC the Roman Empire merged the {{settlements}} into one city. At this time, {{the city was}} called [...] "Juvavum" [...] and was awarded {{the status of a}} Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontiers collapse, Juvavum declined <b>so</b> sharply <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.|$|R
25|$|The {{settlements}} near to Fort Zeelandia expanded as {{a result}} of the Dutch trading post in the area. In 1653, the Dutch built a new fort, Fort Provintia, in the Sakam area as a center for an agricultural colony. The Dutch encouraged Chinese farmers to migrate to Taiwan to grow rice and sugar cane.
