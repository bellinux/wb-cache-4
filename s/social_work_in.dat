Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E

STOLETÍ PARISH SOCIAL WORKS IN THE CZECHOSLOVAK CHURCH FROM 1920 - 1955 Autor: Františka Tichá <b>In</b> this <b>work,</b> I {{pursued the}} parish <b>social</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> the Czechoslovak church from its rise to 1950 's. I {{partially}} captured an {{origin of the}} roots of the Christian church's <b>social</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> chapter two. Chapter three describes the rise of the Czechoslovak church and its <b>social</b> <b>works</b> development. The views of some of the Czechoslovak church's theologians on social concerns are captured in chapter four. Chapter five analyzes the <b>social</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> three selected parishes. In chapter six, I explained how the Czechoslovak church's teachings were implemented in parishes. Chapter seven discusses the downfall of the <b>social</b> <b>works</b> within the Czechoslovak church after February 1948. In conclusion, I have arrived at an opinion that the <b>social</b> <b>works</b> unions laid out an admirable effort in this field.
