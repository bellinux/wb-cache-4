40|$|Using recent {{developments}} in capture–mark–recapture modelling, I analysed <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> of adults of two species of water frogs, the parent species Rana lessonae and its sexual parasite, the hybrid Rana esculenta. Frogs were caught in four different breeding ponds between 1995 and 1998 {{and the effects of}} genotype (= species), sex, pond, and time on <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> and recapture probabilities were tested. <b>Survival</b> <b>rates</b> were consistently higher in R. lessonae than in R. esculenta. Recapture probability was higher in males than in females. In both species, <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> were constant during spring and summer and similar in all years of the investigation, average monthly <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> being lower than those during autumn and winter. The variation in annual <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> (72 – 84 % for R. lessonae and 53 – 70 % for R. esculenta) is probably caused by differences in winter <b>survival</b> <b>rates.</b> Capture–mark–recapture models cannot separate mortality and emigration and hence usually underestimate <b>survival</b> <b>rates.</b> To eliminate this source of error, I quantified emigration, which ranged from 0 to 29 % at the four ponds. After correcting for these emigration rates, I found no differences in <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> among the four ponds. The overall high <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> of adult R. lessonae compared with R. esculenta partially compensate for the hybrid's initial reproductive advantage in terms of mating, fertility, and larval development and, hence, contribute to stabilising mixed populations...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chinese and South Asians {{are among}} the fastest growing {{minority}} populations in Canada; however {{little is known about}} the burden of cancer in these populations. Objective:The objective is to examine <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> for breast, cervical and colorectal cancers in women within these two ethnic populations, as compared to the BC general population. Methods: <b>Survival</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated for three time periods in the Chinese, South Asian and BC general populations, using the BC cancer registry. Ethnicity within the registry was determined using surnames. Results: <b>Survival</b> <b>rates</b> for female breast, cervical and colorectal cancers have improved over time in all three population groups, however general differences were found among the groups. Chinese women had higher <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> than both South Asians and all BC women for breast and cervical cancer, and intermediate <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> between South Asians and all BC women for colorectal cancer. South Asian women had the highest <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> for colorectal cancer, similar <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> to all BC women for breast cancer, and lower <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> for cervical cancer. Interpretation: Differences in the observed <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> may be explained by variations in screening and early detection, treatment practices, and cancer biology.

5|$|The Alpine chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar.

5|$|Untreated DPB {{leads to}} bronchiectasis, {{respiratory}} failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> of 62.1%, while the 10-year <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB {{now have a}} much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P.aeruginosa. The 10-year <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment {{has been allowed to}} end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} Alaska Native cancer <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> {{and stage}} of disease at diagnosis.

For one of the study populations, the data did support seasonal variation in survival, with monthly <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> being lower during winter than during summer (0. 65 v. 0. 99). For the remaining two populations, there was no evidence for seasonal variations in monthly <b>survival</b> <b>rates,</b> but monthly <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly different (0. 87 v. 0. 99). No evidence was found for size-dependent winter survival.

5000|$|Five-year {{relative}} <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> {{describe the}} percentage of patients with a disease alive {{five years after the}} disease is diagnosed, divided by {{the percentage of}} the general population of corresponding sex and age alive after five years.

5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual <b>survival</b> <b>rate</b> rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions.

40|$|Relative <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> {{are among}} the most {{commonly}} reported outcome measures of cancer patients. They are calculated as ratios of observed <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> and the expected <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> in the absence of cancer. Standard errors of relative <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> are commonly calculated by dividing the standard error for absolute <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> by the expected survival, without taking possible random variation of the latter into account. The aim {{of this study was to}} empirically assess the validity of these commonly reported standard errors. Using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry, the authors calculated 5 - and 10 -year absolute, expected, and relative <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> for patients with 25 common forms of cancer in Finland in 1989. The authors used bootstrap analysis to empirically assess the random error of absolute and relative <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> and then compared the results with conventionally derived estimates of standard errors. The conventional and bootstrap standard errors were closely similar for all estimates of absolute survival. By contrast, the conventional estimates of standard errors of 5 - and 10 -year relative survival exceeded the bootstrap estimates by up to 17 % and 32 %, respectively.

30|$|When {{evaluating}} the realism {{of a model}} or performing a validation, a detailed look at the applied methodology for obtaining the data used for parameterisation or validation of a model is required. For example, in birds or mammals, <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> and population densities are often calculated based on minimum number alive [MNA]. Using this method, animals are captured or trapped in regular intervals, and when an animal is not observed anymore (until {{the end of the}} study), it is assumed that this animal has died. However, animals which are not trapped may just have been lucky to miss all traps or may have dispersed. Hence, <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> based on MNAs are always considerably underestimated. Other capture-recapture methods [CRM] are based on probabilities and include the probability of being captured and of dispersal [37 – 39]. These methods result in much more accurate estimates of both population size and <b>survival</b> <b>rates.</b> In a study by Höller [40], in which <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated with both the MNA method and the CRM, <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> based on MNA were almost 20 % lower than the <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> based on a CRM. Markedly lower <b>survival</b> <b>rates</b> calculated from MNA compared to rates calculated with a CRM are also reported by Pollock et al. [37]. This demonstrated that field methodology can have a considerable influence on the parameterisation and validation of a population model.|$|R
