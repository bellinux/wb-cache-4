40|$|We {{present an}} {{abstract}} framework for designing and developing globalised <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> from simple components viewed as games [1] (K. Stathis, M. J.

Winder (Eds.), People and Computers XI (Proceedings of HCI' 96), August 1996, London, UK, BCS Conference Series, Springer-Varlag, pp. 19 [...] 33). We identify {{a set of}} concepts required to specify and implement interactions, {{in such a way}} whereby instantiating the specifications and implementations of games we obtain components that correspond to localised instances of an <b>interactive</b> <b>system.</b> Localisation is also obtained by either customising the specification or the implementation of the <b>interactive</b> <b>system,</b> or both. The framework also caters for complex <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> which are interpreted as compound games built-up from sub-games. In this case, coordination of sub-games is the main issue that we must address at the global level. This is resolved by specifying and implementing sub-games as active components of the more complex games, and, as a result, we localise the coordination of components in the <b>interactive</b> <b>system.</b> The framework lends itself towards a methodology that is suitable for globalising the development of <b>interactive</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The evolution of <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> is generally termed maintenance. Traditionally maintenance soaks up large portions of <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> budgets.

40|$|<b>Interactive</b> <b>systems</b> can be {{analysed}} {{and developed}} {{in terms of}} functionality, presentation and behaviour. In this paper we demonstrate how testing information for <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be derived from}} formal specifications of these aspects. The paper uses the Multi-modal Airline Travel Information System (MATIS) specification of Duke and Harrison. Their specification considers these aspects separately using both Z and CSP. Differences between the aspects, supported by the differing notations, carry through into the testing information we derive. This demonstrates that partial or viewpoint specifications of <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> are useful for test derivation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{evaluation}} of <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> {{has been an}} active subject of research for many years. Many methods and tools have been proposed {{but most of them}} do not take architectural specificities of agent-based <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> into account. In addition, electronic informers are popular evaluation tools but current ones have often some limits. In order to solve these problems, we propose an electronic informer to evaluate agent-based <b>interactive</b> <b>systems.</b> This tool captures interaction events occurred in agent-based <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> and then, based on such captured data, it realizes treatments such as calculations, statistics and generates Petri Nets (PNs) to assist evaluators in evaluating three aspects of the system: user interface, non-functional properties (e. g. response time, reliability, etc.) and userâ€™s properties (e. g. abilities, preferences, etc.). The approach has been validated by applying it to evaluate an agent-based <b>interactive</b> <b>system</b> used for the supervision of urban transport network...|$|R
40|$|Agents are {{becoming}} increasingly common {{as a means of}} structuring <b>interactive</b> <b>systems,</b> due to the highly complex and concurrent nature of modern systems. The manner in which interaction between these agents is specified is of fundamental importance, and must pay heed to expressivity and reuse concerns. There are also concerns specific to <b>interactive</b> <b>systems,</b> and in particular the need to specify and reason about user-system dialogue. We have shown previously that the standard model of object interaction is inadequate with respect to these concerns, and that the action model performs better with respect to these criteria. In this paper these results are drawn together with approaches previously taken in <b>interactive</b> <b>systems.</b> From this basis a schema calculus with interleaving semantics is proposed, which better addresses the concerns of expressivity and reuse in the <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> context. 1 Introduction Modern <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> are large, complex entities comprisin [...] ...|$|R
