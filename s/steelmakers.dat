5|$|Huntsman's {{process was}} only made {{obsolete}} in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's {{invention of the}} Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued {{until well into the}} 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce <b>steelmakers</b> to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the largest}} steel-producing {{companies}} in the world mostly based on the list by the World Steel Association.

25|$|The Capehart Amendment put intense {{pressure}} on the Truman administration's inflation program. On August 8, the federal government imposed stricter economic controls on the economy. In the steel industry, production quotas and procurement orders were extended to all civilian <b>steelmakers,</b> not just large manufacturers. Steel companies had reported record and near-record profits in the summer, but by mid-fall net revenues were down as defense needs consumed larger and larger quantities of raw and finished steel and <b>steelmakers</b> were unable to sell steel to the higher-margin civilian market. On September 4, DPA again increased the amount of steel needed for defense use, sharply scaling down allotments for the civilian economy. When <b>steelmakers</b> balked at expanding plant and equipment {{in order to meet}} new defense quotas, ODM officials ordered the chief executives of the nation's largest steel manufacturers to attend a meeting in Washington where they were threatened with additional government regulation and oversight. The <b>steelmakers</b> quickly acceded to the government's demands.|$|E

25|$|First, small <b>steelmakers</b> {{once more}} began {{breaking}} ranks. The union settled another {{contract with a}} small steel manufacturer on July 17. Several other agreements seemed near, leading the larger companies to fear that they were losing the battle for employer sentiment.|$|E
25|$|President Truman {{certified}} {{the dispute}} to the Wage Stabilization Board on December 22. Although <b>steelmakers</b> {{agreed not to}} shutter production until the Board made its wage determination, Murray kept the nation in suspense until December 28 before agreeing to postpone the strike.|$|E
25|$|President Eisenhower asked {{both sides}} to extend the {{agreement}} and resume bargaining. McDonald and Goldberg offered to extend the contract by one year. They also proposed creating a joint committee to study changes to Section 2(b) and to the contract's benefit structure. <b>Steelmakers</b> rejected the offer.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{a budding}} {{friendship}} between Goldberg and Kaiser Steel heir Edgar Kaiser {{led to an}} independent settlement between the union and Kaiser Steel on October 26. Although the Steelworkers won only a fractionally higher wage increase than the <b>steelmakers</b> had proposed, the settlement included the nine-member committee proposed earlier by Goldberg and McDonald.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, 1959, Eisenhower met {{privately with}} McDonald and Goldberg and {{threatened}} to invoke the back-to-work provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. McDonald was unwilling to budge on Section 2(b) without other concessions from the <b>steelmakers.</b> The steel companies, realizing that they could wait until Eisenhower forced union members back to work, refused to make any such concessions.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court heard oral {{argument}} for two days, May 12 and May 13. Arguing {{the case for}} the government was Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman, and representing the union was Arthur Goldberg, general counsel for the USWA and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (and a future Supreme Court justice). Former Solicitor General John W. Davis argued {{the case for the}} <b>steelmakers.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first {{indication}} of what the employer position was in the upcoming negotiations became known on October 25, when the chairman of Bethlehem Steel indicated <b>steelmakers</b> would make no wage proposal when talks opened. Furthermore, the company made it known that it had seen a significant fall in profits and that it lacked any financial ability to award a pay increase.|$|E

25|$|In December, Nixon met {{privately with}} the <b>steelmakers</b> and cautioned them that Congress would soon begin {{hearings}} on the steel strike. Neither Republicans nor Democrats would support the steel companies if the strike triggered an election-year recession, and Nixon urged management to accept {{the terms of the}} Kaiser Steel settlement. Industry executives agreed to a new contract similar to the Kaiser Steel settlement the last week of December.|$|E

25|$|The USWA struck on June 4. The strike lasted 51 days. The {{supply of}} steel shrank to almost nothing, {{armament}} deliveries dropped by 25 percent, and ammunition and airplane assembly plants shut down. Truman began preparations to draft the steelworkers {{into the military}} under Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948, and public opinion began to turn against the union. These factors led Murray to agree to negotiations with the <b>steelmakers.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{preparations}} for the district court hearing began, the government tried to secure a wage settlement. Independent talks failed. Sawyer oversaw {{the next round of}} negotiations, his personal intervention also did not work. Arnall threatened to give the steel companies no price rise, then Putnam ordered a $3-per-ton price increase. Neither tactic budged the <b>steelmakers.</b> Sawyer threatened to impose a wage increase; that stratagem failed. Sawyer then formally gave the workers a small pay raise; once more, the talks stalled.|$|E
25|$|President Truman {{referred}} {{the wage}} dispute to ODM's Wage Stabilization Board (WSB). In March 1952, the WSB recommended a 16.5-cent-an-hour wage increase. The <b>steelmakers</b> lobbied Congress, DOD and defense manufacturers, opposing any wage increase {{unless there was}} an accompanying price increase. The pressure led Congress to threaten to overturn any WSB wage increase. Republicans demanded that the president invoke the Taft-Hartley Act and force the steelworkers back to work. But Truman, needing labor's support in the 1952 presidential campaign, refused to do so.|$|E

25|$|Roach had {{recognized}} {{the growing demand}} for steel products in the U.S. economy, and in 1880 he established the Combination Steel and Iron Company downriver from his Chester shipyard, which began production in January 1881. He soon discovered however that U.S. <b>steelmakers</b> could {{not keep up with}} national demand, so he also established his own steel manufacturing company, the Standard Steel Casting Company, which began production early in 1884. All these new facilities would soon be utilized for supplying steel to his shipyard.|$|E
25|$|The steel wage panel {{recessed}} {{for three}} weeks after its opening hearings {{in order to allow}} the employers time to make their arguments. In the interim, OPS announced it was granting the <b>steelmakers</b> a price increase of $2 to $3 per ton—even though they had not applied for it. OPS chief DiSalle hoped that the price increase would placate the employers and relieve pressure on the steel wage panel. But the employers began publicly talking about a price increase of $6 to $9 per ton, and the stratagem failed.|$|E
25|$|President Eisenhower asked {{both sides}} to extend the {{agreement}} and resume bargaining. McDonald and Goldberg offered to extend the contract by one year {{and to create a}} joint committee to study changes to Section 2(b) and to the contract's benefit structure. <b>Steelmakers</b> rejected the offer, and on July 15 500,000 steelworkers struck. The strike shuttered nearly every steel mill in the country. By the end of August, the United States Department of Defense voiced concern that there would not be enough steel to meet national defense needs in a crisis.|$|E
