40|$|While the WTO Member {{countries}} {{continue to}} increase their FTA arrangements with divergent frameworks, {{they have begun to}} adopt modified WTO trade remedy systems in FTAs. Although the content and degree of these modified systems may not be significant yet, they still set very important precedents, or 'seeds', for 'rule diversification' in the world trading system. Such modification typically aims to further liberalize mutual trade between FTA parties and thereby contribute to a freer world trading system. However, such rule diversification appears to be inconsistent with the mandate of Article XXIV of GATT by worsening economically inferior trade diversion. The reinterpretation of the legal obligations in Article XXIV commensurate with economically more reasonable structures implies that trade remedy rules in FTAs should be applied on a non-discriminatory basis. Moreover, an FTA <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> must precede a WTO <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> to ensure optimal competitive conditions among trading partners.

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to empirically examine whether the United States' {{imposition}} of a special import restraint distorts foreign exports and thus affects world trade flows. We first develop a theoretical model of worldwide trade in which {{the imposition of a}} special import restraint by one country - an antidumping duty or a <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> - causes significant distortions in world trade flows. We then empirically test this model by investigating the effect of US special import restraints on Japanese exports of roughly 3500 commodities into 29 countries between 1992 and 2001. Our estimation of a fixed-effects model of Japanese exports yields evidence that US import restraints both deflect and depress Japanese export flows. Imposition of a US antidumping duty against Japan deflects trade: export growth to non-US trading partners rises by 11 to 22 percentage points. The simultaneous imposition of a US antidumping duty against both Japan and a third country depresses trade: Japanese export growth to the third country falls by 0 to 18 percentage points. The magnitude of the trade depression effect is also larger when the US imposes an antidumping duty against a third country but not against Japan. A US <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> leads Japanese export growth to third countries to rise 12 to 15 percentage points. Trade; Exports; Antidumping duties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the multi-party consultative process of designing <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> and the necessary safeguards infrastructure for the Encapsulation Plant (EP) and the Geological Repository (GR) in Finland. These facilities, now under design and construction, {{are the first}} of this type in the world. After a Decision-in-Principle by the Finnish Government in 2001, the spent nuclear fuel management company Posiva provided a construction license application for the encapsulation plant and geological repository to the Government in December 2012. In November 2015 the Government granted the license to construct the EP and the GR. The operator (Posiva), Finnish State Regulatory Authority (STUK), IAEA and the European Commission are cooperating on developing <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> and on designing the necessary safeguards infrastructure for these facilities. The international and national <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> have to create confidence that no nuclear material is diverted and no undeclared nuclear activities {{take place at the}} facilities.

Cost-efficiency is assured by including into the facility design safeguards equipment such as cameras, radiation detectors, cables and conduits etc. The experience gained so far with this project has confirmed once more that the early provision of design information and safeguards by design dialogue between international and national actors is mutually beneficial and essential for the overall success of safeguards...|$|R

40|$|This study surveys {{safeguard}} provisions on {{trade in goods}} in 232 regional trade agreements (RTAs) notified to the GATT/WTO up to 31 December 2012. In particular, it identifies those RTAs that modify the conditions applicable to the RTA partner (either substantively or procedurally) {{in the event that}} a global safeguard is invoked. In the case of bilateral (or intra-RTA safeguards), the study analyses provisions governing injury assessment, causation, conditions for the invocation of a measure and the types of measures that may be employed. We use the yardstick of GATT Article XIX and the WTO Safeguards Agreement to determine whether the provisions applicable to bilateral safeguard measures are more or less stringent than the corresponding multilateral rules. The study also includes an inventory of infant industry, balance of payments, and special safeguards applicable to agricultural products found in RTAs. We demonstrate through various examples that {{safeguard provisions}} have become more prescriptive in recent years, though little homogeneity in their design is found even for a given country. In the case of global safeguards, roughly a quarter of RTAs provide for the possible exclusion of the RTA partner, subject to certain criteria, thus discriminating against non-parties. In the case of bilateral safeguards, some RTAs use looser language to define the trigger mechanism to invoke a safeguard and to determine injury standards, thus potentially offering greater scope to use such measures. We found wide variety in the types of bilateral safeguard measures that are permitted in RTAs. A number of more recent RTAs tighten the conditions for application of a bilateral safeguard through limiting the duration of the <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure,</b> allowing the use of tariff-based measures only, and binding the use of the measure to the transition period. Other RTAs specify neither the length of the bilateral <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> nor the conditions for its reapplication, thus providing greater scope to impose such measures than in the multilateral context...|$|E

40|$|Japan {{has been}} one of the major GATT/WTO member {{countries}} with relatively little experience in implementing protectionist measures. However, in April 2001, for the first time in its history, Japan invoked provisional <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> against imports of Welsh onions, Shiitake mushrooms and Tatami mats mainly from China. This paper reviews and evaluates the chain of events regarding these safeguard actions, and considers the means by which Japan might be able to deal with its 'trilemma' policy problem involving how to coordinate the promotion of trade liberalisation, the administration of WTO-consistent safeguards and responses to domestic political demands for protection. The paper first attempts to review the theoretical rationale for implementing <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> and counterarguments against these measures. Second, it discusses the economic circumstances in which Japan implemented the <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> and evaluates these measures critically from the standpoint of economic efficiency and the political economy interests involved. Finally, it concludes with a recommendation that the aforementioned 'trilemma' policy problem in Japan can be best addressed by means of the introduction of a 'well-institutionalised' domestic programme to provide adjustment assistance to ameliorate the displacement resulting from import surges.
