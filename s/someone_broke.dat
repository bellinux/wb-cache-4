500|$|According to U.S. border surveillance, a white Mercury Grand Marquis with Mexican {{license plates}} 821-THE7 crossed at Brownsville border entry at 6:39p.m. CT on March 2. This car had crossed to Brownsville from Matamoros {{eighteen}} times between August 1992 and March 1993. When police {{went to the}} motel to check the register, they discovered that at 8:26p.m. CT that evening, Puentes Pizaña and Ramón Palomares, another hitman of the Cuellar organization, checked in with the receptionist. She registered the car in her notebook as a white Grand Marquis, but it was unclear if she wrote 821-WEX or 821-THE7 as the license plate number. Other evidence showed that several calls were made from Puentes Pizaña's and Garza's rooms to an identical Dallas number {{on the day of}} the murder. The police were never able to connect the number with the investigation, or identify the Dallas contact. Other evidence showed that Garza, along with Cuellar and Moya, visited a gun shop in Dallas to purchase a [...]38 Super pistol. After Fischer was killed, Garza said that the gun was stolen from his house in San Antonio after <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> into it. The weapon was never recovered.|$|E
500|$|Steinman rejoined Meat Loaf and {{the band}} for a live {{performance}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 {{with the intention of}} going through the songs for Bat II after the show. However, <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was a horrifying sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel." [...] Not being able to [...] "bear for people not to hear those songs," [...] Steinman recorded the album, retitled Bad for Good, as a solo project, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs. Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II. Meat Loaf says [...] "Jim put [...] "It Just Won't Quit" [...] on Original Sin without telling me. I could have strangled him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Smit {{assessed}} {{the evidence and}} concluded that an intruder had committed the crime. Smit's theory was that <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> into the Ramseys' home through the broken basement window. The intruder subdued JonBenét using a stun gun and took her down to the basement. JonBenét was killed and a ransom note was left. Smit's theory was supported by former FBI agent John E. Douglas, who had been hired by the Ramsey family. [...] Believing that the Ramseys were innocent, Smit resigned from the investigation on September 20, 1998, {{five days after the}} grand jury convened against the Ramseys.

2500|$|The {{government}} {{was beginning to}} make concessions but refused to move on the core issue of recognising the classification of [...] "political prisoner". In the eyes of officials, if <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> the law then that was a personal act, not a political one, and they were common criminals. By now, the condition of another hunger striker, Jatindra Nath Das, lodged in the same jail, had deteriorated considerably. The Jail committee recommended his unconditional release, but the government rejected the suggestion and offered to release him on bail. On 13 September 1929, Das died after a 63-day hunger strike. Almost all the nationalist leaders in the country paid tribute to Das' death. Mohammad Alam and Gopi Chand Bhargava resigned from the Punjab Legislative Council in protest, and Nehru moved a successful adjournment motion in the Central Assembly as a censure against the [...] "inhumane treatment" [...] of the Lahore prisoners. Singh finally heeded {{a resolution of the}} Congress party, and a request by his father, ending his hunger strike on 5 October 1929 after 116 days. During this period, Singh's popularity among common Indians extended beyond Punjab.|$|E

Leslie Felperin of Variety described it as [...] "like a fancy, retro-styled pocket watch that <b>someone</b> accidentally <b>broke</b> and tried to reassemble with only a vague idea of clockwork".

5000|$|Quinn was {{critical}} of President Bill Clinton during the impeachment trial, stating that he had [...] "fouled the nest". Quinn had a long-standing animus for the Clintons, possibly due to a perceived snub by First Lady Hillary Clinton, who declined a party invitation from Quinn. Regarding Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr, she wrote: [...] "Similarly, independent counsel Ken Starr is not seen by many Washington insiders as an out-of-control prudish crusader. Starr is a Washington insider, too. He has lived and worked here for years. He {{had a reputation as}} a fair and honest judge. He has many friends in both parties. Their wives are friendly with one another and their children go to the same schools."

50|$|The {{life and}} career of Reima Pietilä has been well charted in the {{writings}} of British architectural historian-critics Roger Connah and Malcolm Quantrill, as well as Norwegian theorist and historian Christian Norberg-Schulz. Their basic question is to what extent Pietilä goes against the grain of a Finnish modernist architecture concerned with rationalism and economy. The whole question is problematic, however, because Finland's most famous architect, Alvar Aalto, was also seen as <b>someone</b> who <b>broke</b> the mould of pure modernism, someone who indeed talked about extending the notion of rationalism. Pietilä saw his work as organic architecture, but also very much modern. Pietilä intellectualised his position, and was well-read in philosophy. He was very much concerned with the issue of a phenomenology of place, epitomised by the Student Union building Dipoli (1961-66) at Helsinki University of Technology. This concern for place also extended to his concerns about national identity and Finnishness, even exploring the Finnish language to generate architectural form. The same then applied also for his works abroad, in Kuwait and Delhi.|$|R

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and Maternity Leave The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) requires that employers treat pregnant workers the same as other employees with temporary medical disabilities in all conditions of employment, such as pay and fringe benefits, including paid sick days, health insurance coverage, and temporary disability insurance (TDI). 1 This means that an employer who provides job leave for any employee with a temporary disability, such as <b>someone</b> who <b>broke</b> his leg for example, must also provide leave to a woman on maternity leave. The PDA also forbids employers from discriminating against pregnant women when they make decisions about who to hire, promote, or dismiss. 2 The PDA does not require employers to provide paid leave, but if they provide paid leave, for example through Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI), for some medical conditions, they must also provide it for pregnancy- and childbirth-related conditions.
