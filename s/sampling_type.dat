40|$|The {{detection}} of avian viruses in wild populations has considerable conservation implications. For DNA-based studies, feathers {{may be a}} convenient <b>sample</b> <b>type</b> for virus screening and are, therefore, an increasingly common technique. This is despite recent concerns about DNA quality, ethics, and a paucity of data comparing the reliability and sensitivity of feather sampling to other common <b>sample</b> <b>types</b> such as blood. Alternatively, skeletal muscle tissue may offer a convenient sample to collect from dead birds, which may reveal viraemia. Here, we describe a probe-based quantitative real-time PCR for the relative quantification of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), a pathogen of serious conservation concern for parrots globally. We used this method to test for BFDV in wild crimson rosellas (Platycercus elegans), and compared three different <b>sample</b> <b>types.</b> We detected BFDV in samples from 29 out of 84 individuals (34. 5 %). However, feather samples provided discordant results concerning virus presence when compared with muscle tissue and blood, and estimates of viral load varied somewhat between different <b>sample</b> <b>types.</b> This study provides evidence for widespread infection of BFDV in wild crimson rosellas, but {{highlights the importance of}} <b>sample</b> <b>type</b> when generating and interpreting qualitative and quantitative avian virus data...|$|R

To determine the most reliable <b>sample</b> <b>type</b> for measuring specific blood analytes in the cohort, a pilot study was performed from a subset of 24 subjects comparing serum, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma, and EDTA plasma with proteinase inhibitors (P 100 ™). Methods: 105 analytes, chosen for potential relevance to COPD, arranged in 12 multiplex and one simplex platform (Myriad-RBM) were evaluated in duplicate from the three <b>sample</b> <b>types</b> from 24 subjects. The reliability coefficient and the coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated. The performance of each analyte and mean analyte levels were evaluated across <b>sample</b> <b>types.</b> Results: 20 % of analytes were not consistently detectable in any <b>sample</b> <b>type.</b> Higher reliability and/or smaller CV were determined for 12 analytes in EDTA plasma compared to serum, and for 11 analytes in serum compared to EDTA plasma. While reliability measures were similar for EDTA plasma and P 100 plasma for a majority of analytes, CV was modestly increased in P 100 plasma for eight analytes. Each analyte within a multiplex produced independent measurement characteristics, complicating selection of <b>sample</b> <b>type</b> for individual multiplexes. Conclusions: There were notable detectability and measurability differences between serum and plasma. Multiplexing may not be ideal if large reliability differences exist across analytes measured within the multiplex, especially if values differ based on <b>sample</b> <b>type.</b> For some analytes, the large CV should be considered during experimental design, and the use of duplicate and/or triplicate samples may be necessary.

In order to determine whether detecting differences in dust environments would depend on the <b>sampler</b> <b>type,</b> we compared different passive, settled dust sampling approaches with respect to displaying qualitative and quantitative aspects of the bacterial and fungal indoor microbiota. Results: Settled dust sampling approaches—utilizing plastic petri dishes, TefTex material, and electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs) —were evaluated in indoor spaces in the USA and Finland and in an experimental chamber study. The microbial content was analyzed with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify total bacterial and fungal biomass and through high-throughput sequencing to examine bacterial community composition. Bacterial composition and diversity were similar within a sampling environment regardless of the <b>sampler</b> <b>type.</b> The <b>sampling</b> environment was the single largest predictor of microbial community composition within a study, while <b>sampler</b> <b>type</b> was found to have much less predictive power. Quantitative analyses in indoor spaces indicated highest yields using a petri dish approach, followed by sampling with EDCs and TefTex.

Serum samples gave about two-fold levels of TIMP- 1 compared to plasma samples (p < 0. 001), with a strong linear correlation between these two (r = 0. 79). Pro-MMP- 9 levels were significantly affected by the presence of a blood coagulation activator in the serum sample, or a different anticoagulant in the plasma sample. The serum and plasma values had only a weak correlation (r = 0. 37). In conclusion, <b>sample</b> <b>type</b> should be carefully considered, especially when measuring proMMP- 9, and plasma should be preferred for this measurement.

Based on four public microarray gene expression datasets for SLE covering three representative <b>types</b> of blood-born <b>samples</b> (monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC; whole blood), we utilized three statistics (fold-change, FC; t-test p value; false discovery rate adjusted p value) to scrutinize genes simultaneously regulated with SLE across various <b>sample</b> <b>types.</b> For common marker genes, we conducted the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction analysis to gain insights into their functions. We identified 10 common marker genes associated with SLE (IFI 6, IFI 27, IFI 44 L, OAS 1, OAS 2, EIF 2 AK 2, PLSCR 1, STAT 1, RNASE 2, and GSTO 1). Significant up-regulation of IFI 6, IFI 27, and IFI 44 L with SLE was observed in all the studied <b>sample</b> <b>types,</b> though the FC was most striking in monocyte, compared with PBMC and whole blood (8. 82 - 251. 66 vs. 3. 73 - 74. 05 vs. 1. 19 - 1. 87).
