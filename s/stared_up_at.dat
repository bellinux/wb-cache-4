60|$|Dawes <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the picture}} with a caustic {{expression}} on his face.|$|E
60|$|Ferris <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{his face}} showed almost livid through the {{luminous}} night.|$|E
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the window-sill {{overhead}} and measured {{the size of}} the room with his eye.|$|E
60|$|The lineman, a young fellow, {{paused in}} the {{cracking}} of a hard-boiled egg to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the couple.|$|R
60|$|He {{wanted to}} get right away from London and {{everybody}} and lie in the quiet darkness and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the stars.|$|R
25|$|That night, Walt {{is unable}} to fall asleep, and this time, a fly lands on the smoke detector's {{flashing}} light as Walt <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Gratian <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. She had {{a longing}} for George--to know what he thought and felt.|$|E
60|$|They {{stopped and}} stood in a row, and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed his}} chair back and, rising slowly from the table, confronted him. Captain Brisket, red-faced and confident, <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him composedly.|$|E
60|$|He would {{sneak out}} on moonless winter nights and <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the stars, and {{afterwards}} {{find it difficult}} to tell his father where he had been.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What! Don't {{you love}} him?' said Jocelyn, with a {{surprised}} <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her as she}} stood, in her concern appearing the very Avice who had kissed him twenty years earlier.|$|R
40|$|A {{young boy}} wearing a patron saint medal <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{a figure of}} Christ crucified on a cross. The {{following}} information is printed {{on the back of}} the postcard: “Proprieta dell ’Istituto Saveriano. Missioni Estere – Parma. Foto Frassineti S. X. Giuntoli – Milan. ” There is no handwriting on the back...|$|R
60|$|The {{searcher}} {{placed the}} photo {{in the pool}} of light. The tiny face of a girl <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> them, unmoved, from its short hair.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Stringham <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{surprised}} at this picture. But she had plainly {{an idea that}} after an instant resisted it. [...] "That was his professional propriety." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lionel <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "O God!" [...] {{he cried}} presently, [...] "I know not what to believe. I am a shuttle-cock flung {{this way and}} that way." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{horror of}} the spirit came over me, and, as if rapt away from myself, I <b>stared</b> sheer <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... [BURLACOMBE {{touches his}} forelock and goes. MRS. BRADMERE stands [...] quite still, thinking. Then {{going to the}} photograph, she <b>stares</b> [...] <b>up</b> <b>at</b> it.] ...|$|R
50|$|Next, Arthur “rescues” Eliza from boredom {{by placing}} her with Mrs. Fielding. This accomplished, Arthur can finally {{concentrate}} on his apprenticeship, {{but he quickly}} realizes {{that he is in}} love with Mrs. Fielding. This comes as such a shock to him that he actually goes out to the house in the country where Mrs. Fielding is staying and <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her window at night. She is frightened, recognizes him, and tells him to see her in the city. The next day they finally admit their feelings to each other and agree to marry.|$|R
6000|$|... "C-consent to this marriage, c-consent to this marriage." [...] There was yet {{room for}} Isaac Worthington to be amazed, {{and for a}} while he <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Jethro, speechless.|$|E
60|$|He lay on {{his back}} and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me, and his eyes had a glassy stare. Then he roused himself by an effort, and raised himself upon his elbow.|$|E
60|$|Derek {{had come}} closer; {{he put his}} hand down and gripped her arm. Her eloquence dried up before the intentness of his face, and she just <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Someone {{has told}} them--I think I first started {{the idea in}} my pamphlet--that the thing is to sleep {{on a pile of}} hemlock branches. I think I told them to listen to the wind sowing (you know the word I mean), sowing and crooning in the giant pines. So there they are upside-down, doubled up on a couch of green spikes that would have killed St. Sebastian. They <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky with blood-shot, restless eyes, waiting for the crooning to begin. And there isn't a sow in sight.|$|R
2500|$|... "'Don't Tell Me' was {{the most}} {{unlikely}} follow-up to 2000's 'Music'. Stop-and-go guitar riffs, an atypical structure and peculiar lyrics ('Tell the bed not to lay/Like the open mouth of a grave/Not to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me/Like a calf down on its knees') made it an unlikely hit to boot. But a hit is exactly what it was, earning Madonna her 27th Top 5 hit and 24th gold single (tying the Beatles). [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] found Madonna at her most soulful, with a vocal performance reminiscent of the forceful tone of [...] "Express Yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a certain}} grimly genteel street they paused to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{a row of}} grimly respectable houses; for, though the name wasn't {{on any of the}} doors, they were sure Mr. Dombey still lived there. A rough dog lay on one of the doorsteps, and a curtain fluttered at an open upper window. Poor Di was {{growling}} in his sleep, and above there little Paul was watching for the golden water on the wall, while faithful Florence sung to him, and Susan Nipper put away derisive sniffs and winks in closets and behind doors for the benefit of 'them Pipchinses.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Peckover was {{apparently}} not much {{used to hear}} such sentiments as these from strangers. She <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Blyth with two big tears rolling over her plump cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|Little Joe Otter stopped {{swimming}} and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Jerry Muskrat. [...] "They look {{all right to}} me," [...] said he, as he started to climb up on the Big Rock.|$|E
6000|$|Nedda {{raised her}} head, <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her aunt, and a delighted smile spread over her face. [...] "Is it time again? How lovely!" [...] Then, before either could speak or stop her, she was gone.|$|E
60|$|Young Chinn, walking {{like a man}} in a dream, had fetched {{a compass}} round the entire {{cantonment}} before going to his own tiny cottage. The captain's quarters, in which he had been born, delayed him for a little; then he looked at the well on the parade-ground, where he had sat of evenings with his nurse, and at the ten-by-fourteen church, where the officers went to service if a chaplain of any official creed happened to come along. It seemed very small as compared with the gigantic buildings he used to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at,</b> but it was the same place.|$|R
60|$|Lord Roberts B, {{even in his}} {{partially}} deflated {{condition in}} his shed, was a fine thing to <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at.</b> I stood {{side by side with}} Cothope regarding him, and it was borne in upon me more acutely than ever that all this had to end. I had a feeling just like the feeling of a boy who wants to do wrong, that I would use up the stuff while I had it before the creditors descended. I had a queer fancy, too, I remember, that if I could get into the air it would advertise my return to Beatrice.|$|R
60|$|Even in his happier hours his diversions {{were not}} many. He {{never tired of}} {{watching}} and studying the Indian children. When he had an opportunity without being observed, which was seldom, he amused himself with the papooses. The Indian baby was strapped to a flat piece of wood {{and covered with a}} broad flap of buckskin. The squaws hung these primitive baby carriages up on the pole of a tepee, on a branch of a tree, or threw them round anywhere. Isaac never heard a papoose cry. He often pulled down the flap of buckskin and looked at the solemn little fellow, who would <b>stare</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with big, wondering eyes.|$|R
60|$|They {{stopped and}} stood {{in a row and}} <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised. Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.|$|E
60|$|Never again shall I {{wonder that}} the sea is hard. I walked apart from the second mate and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the {{magnificent}} fabric of the Elsinore sweeping and swaying great blotting curves of darkness {{across the face of}} the starry sky.|$|E
60|$|They <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the roosts {{where the}} biddies were huddled together, fast asleep. They {{were too high}} up to be reached from the floor even when Reddy and Granny stood on their hind legs and {{stretched}} {{as far as they}} could.|$|E
60|$|The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the {{converse}} of his companion. His stature {{could not have}} exceeded four feet. A pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath {{with an air of}} complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by the owner's habit of licking them at intervals. He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> occasionally in his face as the red setting sun <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the crags of Ben Nevis.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Hans awoke, {{and sitting}} <b>up,</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{me through the}} bright flame which I had {{recently}} fed with dry wood.|$|R
5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> an old mansion {{when two}} {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning {{to enter the}} house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|R
