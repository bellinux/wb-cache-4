However the shield switching field can spread to far track position from the <b>side</b> <b>shield</b> to the trailing shield, and it originates from magnetic boundary of the domains and wall formed during the dynamic writing process.

Development is now underway for ProtoEXIST 2, which ultimately will be comprised of a closely tiled 8 × 8 array of 19. 9 mm × 19. 9 mm, 5 mm thick Redlen CZT crystals, analogous to ProtoEXIST 1, but will now utilize the NuASIC which accommodates the direct bonding of CZT detectors with a 32 × 32 pixilated anode with a 604. 8 μm pixel pitch and a guard ring surrounding the perimeter of the anode pattern. Currently 6 prototype detectors have been fabricated and tested. An energy threshold of approximately 6 keV and energy resolutions of 2. 5 keV FWHM at 122. 0 keV and 2. 1 keV at 59. 6 keV have been achieved with individual detectors. The performance and energy resolution of the individual prototype detectors is discussed in detail. In addition, during preliminary testing of the prototype ProtoEXIST 2 detectors reduced photopeak efficiency and pixel distortions were observed for pixels within approximately 3 mm of the CZT edge. These distortions have been largely corrected with two independent techniques: the application of an 73 mm × 73 mm extended cathode centered directly above the detector and the use of a grounded, 6 mm tall, electrostatic <b>side</b> <b>shield</b> surrounding the perimeter of the detector.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this doctoral dissertation introduces a developmental path to realize micro coaxial transmission lines for wafer-level microwave and millimeter wave circuits. The micro coax lines conceptualized in this research are three-dimensional, with a uniquely low vertical profile of 20 mu m. They are distinguishable from other transmission line topologies due to frequency limitless, cross-talk free performance in high density circuits resulting from the totally shielded construction. Design and optimization was done using equations and electromagnetic simulations. Extensive process development {{has been carried out}} to fabricate these devices on CMOS grade silicon wafers using processes amenable to the IC manufacturing industry. Micro coax lines of three different core types including air, semi-dielectric and all-dielectric cores were designed, fabricated and analyzed from 1 - 40 GHz with respect to line impedance and the volume of polyimide (dielectric) in the micro coax cavity. The insertion loss of the lines was found to vary from 2 to 9 dB/cm depending on the width the center conductor, total cross-sectional area and core type. The versatility of the micro coax technology developed in the earlier part of this research has been successfully integrated with RF MEMS to embed a MEM varactor inside the micro coax cavity capable of achieving a capacitance ratio around 7 with an actuation voltage of 40 - 60 V. The vertical integration capability of the micro coax was demonstrated by locating a millimeter wave slot antenna on the top <b>side</b> <b>shield</b> of a rectangular micro coax line, also acting as the electromagnetically coupled feed for the antenna. The antenna was designed to operate in the full range of the unlicensed 57 - 64 GHz spectrum capable of Gbps data rates. A 15 dB bandwidth of 17 % and a hemispherical radiation pattern was achieved. Lastly, a diversified application involving the application of an integrated micro coax probe-microfluidic chamber approach to detect bacteria through impedance measurements has been introduced. In summary, {{the development and implementation of}} micro coax technology on a large scale is bound to create a paradigm shift in the development of high density microwave and millimeter wave circuits for RF MEMS and integrated antennas...|$|E

40|$|Data {{storage in}} current hard disk drives {{is limited by}} three factors. These are thermal {{stability}} of recorded data, the ability to store data, {{and the ability to}} read back the stored data. An attempt to alleviate one factor can affect others. This ultimately limits magnetic recording densities that can be achieved using traditional forms of data storage. In order to advance magnetic recording and postpone these inhibiting factors, new approaches are required. One approach is recording on Bit Patterned Media (BPM) where the medium is patterned into nanometer-sized magnetic islands where each stores a binary digit. This thesis presents a statistical model of write errors in BPM composed of single domain islands. The model includes thermal activation in a calculation of write errors without resorting to time consuming micromagnetic simulations of huge populations of islands. The model incorporates distributions of position, magnetic and geometric properties of islands. In order to study the impact of island geometry variations on the recording performance of BPM systems, the magnetometric demagnetising factors for a truncated elliptic cone, a generalised geometry that reasonably describe most proposed island shapes, were derived analytically. The inclusion of thermal activation was enabled by an analytic derivation of the energy barrier for a single domain island. The energy barrier is used in a calculation of transition rates that enable the calculation of error rates. The model has been used to study write-error performance of BPM systems having distributions of position, geometric and magnetic property variations. Results showed that island intrinsic anisotropy and position variations have a larger impact on write-error performance than geometric variations. The model was also used to study thermally activated Adjacent Track Erasure (ATE) for a specific write head. The write head had a rectangular main pole of 13 by 40 nm (cross-track x down-track) with pole trailing shield gap of 5 nm and pole <b>side</b> <b>shield</b> gap of 10 nm. The distance from the pole to the top surface of the medium was 5 nm, the medium was 10 nm thick and there was a 2 nm interlayer between the soft underlayer (SUL) and the medium, making a total SUL to pole spacing of 17 nm. The results showed that ATE would be a major problem and that cross-track head field gradients need to be more tightly controlled than down-track. With the write head used, recording at 1 Tb/in² would be possible on single domain islands. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceEPSRCSchool of Computer ScienceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
