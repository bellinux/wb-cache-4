40|$|Based on {{arguments}} of the `reference- dependent' theory of consumer choice we assume that a retailer's discount of a manufacturer's <b>suggested</b> retail price changes consumers' demand. We can show that the producer benefits from <b>suggesting</b> a retail price. If consumers are additionally sufficiently `loss averse', e. g. consumers' disappointment from higher than <b>suggested</b> retail prices is sufficiently high, the producer can force the retailer to take the <b>suggested</b> price in equilibrium and thus capture some of the retailer's profits.

5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might <b>suggest</b> mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might <b>suggest</b> schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can <b>suggest</b> chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might <b>suggest</b> poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must {{be present}} to {{diagnose}} acne. In their absence, an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne would <b>suggest</b> a different skin disorder.

There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may <b>suggest</b> hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's menstrual cycle; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.|$|E
