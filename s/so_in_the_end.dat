5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, <b>so,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{solution}} redistribution was {{an important}} phenomenon during the solidification of multi-component alloys. The changing disciplines during solidification of different component Al-Si-Mg alloys were calculated <b>in</b> this paper. <b>The</b> calculations were coupled with CALPHAD technology. The interaction of solutes would change the solute redistribution coefficients during <b>the</b> solidification especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of solidification. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> solidification, {{the slope of the}} curves turned to bigger and bigger. The results of the calculating of the eutectic fraction of the alloys show that errors exist under assuming the partition coefficients of solutes as a constant due to the interaction between solutes <b>in</b> ternary alloys. <b>The</b> predicted eutectic fractions of Al-Si-Mg alloys agree well with the experimental results for using the CALPHAD methods...|$|R

25|$|John Edrich led {{the team}} again against the 1973-74 Sheffield Shield champions Victoria under Ian Redpath, who won the toss and chose to bat. The MCG pitch proved to be as slow and flat at the Adelaide Oval and Victoria {{struggled}} to make 293/8 in 6½ hours. The wickets were shared around the English bowlers who struggled to dismiss the tailenders Ray Bright (53), Max Walker (23 not out) and Alan Thomson (11 not out), <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> Redpath declared on the second morning. Brian Luckhurst carried on from the Victorian Country game with 116 and Dennis Amiss made 158 as they piled up 268 for the first wicket, but nobody else made 20 except for Alan Knott's 48 not out and Edrich declared on 392/9, 99 runs ahead on the first innings. Victoria held out for a draw and though the highest score was only 36 most of the batsmen dug themselves in in good Victorian style. After 333 minutes of batting they had reached 174/8, 75 runs ahead and the game was called off as a draw.|$|E
25|$|Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans {{detained}} by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities {{were set up}} in the camps. Allowing them to continue their education, however, did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Not only that the education/instruction was all in English, the schools in Japanese Internment Camps also didn't have any books or supplies to go on as they opened. The state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening. Wood stoves were used to heat the buildings, and instead of using separate rooms for different kinds of activities only partitions were used to accomplish that. Japanese Internment Camps also did not have any libraries (and consequently no library books), writing arm chairs or desks, and no science equipment. These ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows. In the Southwest, when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. Class sizes were immense. At the height of it attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. This was due to a few things. One of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the US at the moment, {{and the fact that the}} teachers were required to live in those poor conditions in the camps themselves. “There was persistent mud or dust, heat, mosquitoes, poor food and living conditions, inadequate instructional supplies, and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”. Despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps, they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel, and <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> they had to hire non-certified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants.|$|E

500|$|For the plutonium-producing {{production}} reactors, {{the same}} reasons mandated the use of natural uranium fuel and graphite as a moderator; but it was originally assumed {{that they would be}} water-cooled like the American reactors at the Hanford Site. A water-cooled reactor of the required size would require about [...] of water per day, preferably very pure so as to avoid corroding the metal pipes. Moreover, there were concerns about safety. Water absorbs neutrons, so if there is a sudden loss of cooling water this will result in an increase in the neutron flux and the reactor temperature, and possibly a catastrophic nuclear meltdown. Such an event did indeed occur in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The American solution was to locate the facility in a remote location, but in the densely-populated British Isles the only such locations were in the north and west of Scotland. By April 1947, Hinton had convinced Portal of the advantages of a gas-cooled system. Helium was at first the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, <b>So,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> air cooling was chosen.|$|E
500|$|Udo Lattek {{took charge}} in 1970. After winning the DFB-Pokal {{in his first}} season, Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship. The {{deciding}} match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion, and {{was also the first}} live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1 and thus claimed the title, also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored. Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay. This title– after winning the Cup Winners' trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (1968 and 1972) in that competition– marked the club's breakthrough as a force on the international stage. During the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. [...] "We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> we were the winners but we were very, very lucky", stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was [...] "very suspicious". Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years. A year later in Glasgow, Saint-Étienne were defeated by another Roth goal and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs. The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. Bayerndusel was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.|$|E

2500|$|On {{arrival in}} Italy, {{he moved into}} a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome, today the Keats–Shelley Memorial House museum. Despite care from Severn and Dr. James Clark, his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical {{attention}} Keats received may have hastened his death.

Clark eventually diagnosed consumption (tuberculosis) and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach.

Severn's biographer Sue Brown writes: [...] "They could have used opium in small doses, and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didn't realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn't let him have it.
