5000|$|TB to DS so {{what did}} you do? Well I wrote a {{masterpiece}} to the RFL Chairman at Chappeltown Rd Mr David Oxley asking him if the time was not right now for the development of League in SA given the IRB sanction of a world 15 to play against the Springboks at Ellis Park - Mr Oxley replied [...] "...sport and politics are inextricably mixed, and to ignore one without the other is simply to bury ones head in the sand..." [...] <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to do now Dave? Well not quite sure at the moment. TB-Why don't we do it ourselves? What? Start League in SA? DS-Yeah I'm up for that how should we start? TB-I'm actually going to the UK for a month when I'm back why don't we get together and talk?(This sounded like a cooling off period for me DS to forget about the idea as far as I could tell) Tony gave me his tel number and I duly phoned him in Jan 89 as arranged. Tony needed to be prompted as to who I was and what we had agreed but we set a meeting up to discuss. I was playing RU for Old Edwardians (Old Eds) at the time in a suburb of Jhb called Houghton. My connections were good with the coaching staff and {{as luck would have it}} one of the coaches Gary Lewis had a brother in law called Ray Mordt the ex Wigan winger from the 80's.|$|E

40|$|An {{introductory}} {{conversation with}} a new person I just met usually goes like this: So, where is your accent from ? Are you American? Well, yes, [...] . but no. Not really. I do have American citizenship and I lived in the US for fifteen years but I grew up in France. Ok, so you’re French? Well, yes, but [...] . not totally. My mother is French but my father is Tunisian. Ok, so you’re Tunisian? Well, yes, but [...] . not wholly. I don’t speak Arabic, so I don’t totally feel Tunisian. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> American? French? Tunisian?

40|$|There {{is a nice}} {{scene in}} Annie Hall where Woody Allen’s character, standup Alvy Singer, meets Carol Kane’s character, stage manager Allison Portchnik. Waiting in the wings at a variety show, Singer remonstrates with Portchnik over the scheduling. “What do you mean, ‘next’?” he asks with amazement. “I’m not going after another comedian... because they’re laughing... <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> telling me? They’re gonna laugh {{at him for a}} couple of minutes then I’ve gotta go out there and get laughs too? How much can they laugh? They’re laughed out!” I know how he feels. Our {{previous}} special issue— Experimental Writing about Music, edited by David Gutkin—is impossible to follow. But only in that sense do I relate to Singer: although Experimental Writing has its laugh–out–loud moments, it is also possibly the most ambitious and unique volume of Current Musicology to date. (If you haven’t already, find it at our website or order a hard copy). For the present issue, general operations resume: the articles collected here continue the journal’s unabating commitment to diverse content, high–quality scholarship, and rigorous peer review...|$|R

5000|$|One asked: [...] "What is {{the realm}} of the Three Eyes?" [...] The master said: [...] "I enter with you {{the realm of}} utter purity, wear the robe of purity and expound the Dharmakaya Buddha. Or we enter the realm of non-differentiation and expound the Sambhogakaya Buddha. Or again, we enter the realm of deliverance, wear the robe of {{radiance}} and speak of the Nirmanakaya Buddha. The realms of the Three Eyes depend on change. To explain it from the point of the Sutras and Treatises, the Dharmakaya is the fundamental. The Sambhogakaya and the Nirmanakaya are the functions. But as I see it, the Dharmakaya cannot expound (or comprehend) the Dharma. Thus an old master said: [...] "The (Buddha's) bodies are set up with reference to meaning; The (Buddha's) realms are differentiated with reference to the bodies." [...] The nature of the bodies and of the realms is clear; they are the temple of the Dharma, and so are only relative. [...] "Yellow leaves in the empty fist to entice unweaned children." [...] Spikes of water-chestnuts — <b>what</b> juice <b>are</b> <b>you</b> looking for in those dry bones? There is no Dharma outside the heart mind, nor anything to find inside. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> looking for? ...|$|R

[...] "But I don't purpose {{defending}} them; and I don't purpose {{telling you}} what I shall or shall not do with the property when it is in my hands again.
