25|$|As a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid {{was only}} a partial success – albeit a unique, {{visually}} imposing one; {{it is also the}} only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original <b>smooth</b> <b>outer</b> limestone casing intact. As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look.|$|E
25|$|Based on a mark in an {{interior}} chamber naming the work gang and {{a reference to}} fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at , the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure {{in the world for}} more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a <b>smooth</b> <b>outer</b> surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are {{based on the idea that}} it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, varnished to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were semi-monocoque (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's fuselage section should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of double-skinned construction, with a <b>smooth</b> <b>outer</b> skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated inner skin. The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of round-cornered rectangular cross-section and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be observed}} in the shells of this species: the shells of the males tend to be more elongate with a <b>smoother</b> <b>outer</b> surface, whereas the shells of the females are generally wider and more nodulose. The angle of the spire also differs between males and females.|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} claimed that fiber-reinforced {{composite}} retainers provide a <b>smoother</b> <b>outer</b> surface, while {{there seems to}} be more retention areas along the spiral wire retainers which can contribute to the formation of more calculus along the retainer wire [15],[24]. In our study, however, in both groups, there was {{a significant increase in the}} accumulation of the calculus in the mandibular arch with the mean scores being worse in the fiber-reinforced group.|$|R

500|$|The dorsal {{scales are}} {{generally}} small, acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened, while {{the throat and}} pectoral (chest) scales are keeled. Granular (bumpy) scales are found {{on the top of}} the head and the [...] neck, while the scales on the middle of the neck are keeled, acute, flattened, and imbricate. In the middle of the back, there is some crowding and size reduction in the scales, and none of these scales are granular. On the dorsal side of the tail, the scales are acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened. On the underside of the tail, the scales are smooth, rounded, and enlarged towards the centre of the tail (mid-ventrally). The ventral scales are rounded, smooth, cycloid (have a <b>smooth</b> <b>outer</b> edge), and imbricate. The scales on the ventral caudal (head) scales are smooth, cycloid, and enlarged mid-ventrally.|$|E
500|$|Lycoperdon pulcherrimum {{closely resembles}} L.echinatum, but its spines are stouter, do not turn brown in age, {{and the surface}} of the fruit body {{underneath}} the spines is smooth, not pitted. Alexander H. Smith noted that in youth, they are [...] "difficult if not impossible to distinguish from each other, but this will cause no inconvenience to those collecting for the table, since both are edible." [...] In some areas the two species appear to intergrade, as specimens may be found whose spines turn brown but do not fall off. Young specimens of L.pedicellatum may also be difficult to distinguish from L.echinatum, but the former [...] has a <b>smooth</b> <b>outer</b> surface when mature, and has spores attached to a pedicel (a narrow extension of the basidium on which the sterigmata and spores are formed) that is [...] about 4–5 times as long as the spore. Lycoperdon compactum, found only in New Zealand, also resembles L.echinatum in appearance, but differs in having smaller spores, capillitia that are hyaline (translucent) and septate (with partitions that divide the capillitia into compartments).|$|E
500|$|Astraeus pteridis is larger, [...] or {{more when}} expanded, and often {{has a more}} {{pronounced}} areolate pattern on the inner surface of the rays. It is found in North America and the Canary Islands. A.asiaticus and A.odoratus are two similar species known from throughout Asia and Southeast Asia, respectively. A.odoratus is distinguished from A.hygrometricus by a <b>smooth</b> <b>outer</b> mycelial layer with few adhering soil particles, 3–9 broad rays, and a fresh odor similar to moist soil. The spore ornamentation of A.odoratus is also distinct from A.hygrometricus, with longer and narrower spines that often joined together. A.asiaticus has an outer peridial surface covered with small granules, and a gleba that is purplish-chestnut in color, compared to the smooth peridial surface and brownish gleba of A.hygrometricus. The upper limit of the spore size of A.asiaticus is larger than that of its more common relative, ranging from 8.75–15.2μm. A.koreanus (sometimes named as the variety A.hygrometricus var. koreanus; see Taxonomy) differs from the more common form in its smaller size, paler fruit body, and greater number of rays; microscopically, it has smaller spores (between 6.8 and 9μm in diameter), and the spines on the spores differ in length and morphology. It is known from Korea and Japan.|$|E

60|$|His face, voice, and manner--while I {{was in his}} company--were {{under such}} perfect control that they set all {{scrutiny}} at defiance. But he had given me one chance of looking under the <b>smooth</b> <b>outer</b> surface of him, for all that. He had not shown the slightest sign of attempting to fix anything that I had said to him in his mind, until I mentioned the time at which it was customary to permit the earliest repayment, {{on the part of}} a debtor, of money that had been advanced as a loan. When I gave him that piece of information, he looked me straight in the face, while I was speaking, for the first time. The inference I drew from this was--that he had a special purpose in asking me his last question, and a special interest in hearing my answer to it. The more carefully I reflected on what had passed between us, the more shrewdly I suspected the production of the casket, and the application for the loan, of having been mere formalities, designed to pave the way for the parting inquiry addressed to me.|$|E
