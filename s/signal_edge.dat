The design of a lightweight, user-adaptable, and cost-effective thimble with four contact force sensors is described in this paper. The sensors are calibrated before being placed in the thimble to provide normal and tangential forces. Normal forces are exerted directly by the fingertip and thus can be properly measured.

40|$|Attitude {{estimation}} {{is often}} inaccurate during highly dynamic motion {{due to the}} external acceleration. This paper proposes extended Kalman filter-based attitude estimation using a new algorithm to overcome the external acceleration. This algorithm {{is based on an}} external acceleration compensation model {{to be used as a}} modifying parameter in adjusting the measurement noise covariance matrix of the extended Kalman filter. The experiment was conducted to verify the estimation accuracy, that is, one-axis and multiple axes sensor movement. Five approaches were used to test the estimation of the attitude: (1) the KF-based model without compensating for external acceleration, (2) the proposed KF-based model which employs the external acceleration compensation model, (3) the two-step KF using weighted-based switching approach, (4) the KF-based model which uses the threshold-based approach, and (5) the KF-based model which uses the threshold-based approach combined with a softened part approach. The proposed algorithm showed high effectiveness during the one-axis test. When the testing conditions employed multiple axes, the estimation accuracy increased using the proposed approach and exhibited external acceleration rejection at the right timing.

The goal was to determine the ability of different cell types to <b>signal</b> <b>edge</b> location. For comparison, parafoveal vernier thresholds of human observers were measured with pairs of flashed edges. Cells of the magnocellular (MC-) pathway gave larger responses than cells of the parvocellular (PC-) pathway. Neurometric analyses comparing a cell's response at different edge positions were performed. The positional signal from single MC-pathway cells was more precise than from PC-pathway cells, especially at lower contrasts. In a second analysis, based on the neurophysiological results, responses from a matrix of ganglion cells were generated. Using a simple model, vernier performance expected from such a matrix was predicted {{as a function of}} edge length and contrast. Again, the MC-pathway gave a more precise positional signal than the PC-pathway despite the latter's numerical advantage.

At higher contrasts either the MC- or PC-pathway could provide an adequate signal...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of inductorless frequency synthesizers into standardized wireless systems still requires {{a high level}} of innovation in order to achieve the stringent requirements of low noise and low power consumption. Synthesizers based on the so-called multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) represent {{one of the most promising}} architectures in this direction [1 - 3]. An MDLL resembles a ring oscillator, in which the <b>signal</b> <b>edge</b> traveling along the delay line is periodically refreshed by a clean edge of the reference clock. In this manner, the phase noise of the ring oscillator is filtered up to half the reference frequency and the total output jitter is reduced significantly. Unfortunately, the concept of MDLL, and in general of injection locking (IL), is inherently limited to integer-N synthesis, which makes it unacceptable in practical RF systems. A first extension of injection locking to coarse fractional-N resolution has been shown in [4], in which however the fractional resolution is bounded to the inverse of the number of ring-oscillator delay stages. This paper introduces a fractional-N MDLL-based frequency synthesizer with a 1 b time/digital converter (TDC), which is able to outreach the performance of inductorless fractional-N synthesizers. The prototype synthesizes frequencies between 1. 6 and 1. 9 GHz with 190 Hz resolution and achieves RMS integrated jitter of 1. 4 ps at 3 mW power consumption, even in the worst-case of near-integer channel...|$|E

30|$|The {{next step}} was to select the gray image {{threshold}} before it was binary processing. It could acquire a much better accurate threshold value after combining the optimal threshold segmentation principles and experience value. The effect of the optimal threshold method alone was acceptable, yet it was also a more time-consuming algorithm. To avoid that drawback, it was a fast and simple way to combine the algorithm and the reference value being stored in the database to calculate the threshold. After setting 0 (black) to the pixel value above the threshold and setting 255 (white) to the pixel below above the threshold, binarization image was easily obtained. From Fig.  5 b, we can see that there are too much <b>signal</b> <b>edge</b> noise points after the image was processed by the Sobel operator and Prewitt operator, with wide boundary signal region. Besides, there is no obvious boundary {{from both sides of the}} image after treated with the Roberts operator. Meanwhile, the image noise points were still not decreased after the process of the Log operator, while the one which treated with the improved operator can clearly see the left and right boundaries of the strip, with clear and narrow signal region boundary. Therefore, after comparison of these five algorithms (improved Sobel convolution operator algorithm, Sobel algorithm, Prewitt algorithm, Log algorithm, and Roberts algorithm), apparently, the improved Sobel convolution operator algorithm was the best one which derived a clear boundary and had less noise point.|$|E
40|$|Time {{measurement}} plays {{a crucial}} rule {{for the purpose}} of particle identification in high energy physical experiments. With the upgrading of physical goal and the developing of electronics, modern time measurement system meets the requirement of excellent resolution specification as well as high integrity. Due to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), FPGA time-to-digital converter (TDC) becomes one of mature and prominent time measurement methods in recent years. For correcting time-walk effect caused by leading timing, time-over-threshold (TOT) measurement should be added in the FPGA TDC. TOT can be obtained by measuring the interval time of signal leading and trailing edge. Unfortunately, a traditional TDC can recognize only one kind of <b>signal</b> <b>edge,</b> the leading or the trailing. Generally, to measure the interval, two TDC channels can be used at the same time, one for leading, the other for trailing. However, this method will increase the amount of used FPGA resource and reduce the TDC's integrity unavoidably. This paper presents one method of TOT measurement implemented in a Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA. In this method, TOT measure can be achieved in only one TDC input channel. The consumed resources and time resolution can both be guaranteed. Test shows that this TDC can achieve resolution better than 15 ps for leading edge measurement and 37 ps for TOT measurement. Furthermore, the TDC measuring dead time is about 2 clock cycles, which makes it be good for applications of higher physical event rateComment: 5 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|Circuit {{and system}} {{techniques}} for reducing phase noise in frequency synthesizers, and cancelling phase noise effect in quadrature receivers are presented. Phase noise performance of digital phase-locked loops (PLLs) {{is limited by}} the time resolution of time-to-digital converters (TDC). In contrast to TDCs in the past that concentrate on the arrival time difference between the divider feedback edge and the reference <b>signal</b> <b>edge.</b> Our approach extracts the timing information that is embedded in voltage domain. This approach not only achieves a higher time resolution, lower phase noise, but also consumes less power. A digital background calibration circuit is also presented to reduce the output spurious tones when the digital PLL operates under fractional-N divisions. Ring Oscillators (ROs) have the advantage of small area, wide tuning range, and multiphase output. However, their higher phase noise and higher sensitivity to supply noise may seriously deteriorate the wanted signal in wireless receivers. To circumvent this non-ideality, a low overhead phase noise cancellation technique for ring oscillator-based quadrature receivers is presented. The proposed technique operates in background and extracts ring oscillator phase noise as well as supply-induced phase noise from the digital PLL. The obtained phase noise information is then used to restore the randomly rotated baseband signal in digital domain. In recent years, the unsilenced band at 57 ~ 64 GHz frequency range has motivated the building of high-data rate radio systems targeting wireless personal area network (WPAN) applications. To address this demand, a low-noise wide-band integer-N PLL is presented which serves as the carrier generator of a 60 GHz heterogeneous transceiver. The PLL employs sub-sampling phase detection technique to achieve low-noise performance, and provides 48 GHz LO and 12 GHz IF carrier signals for the heterogeneous transceiver...|$|E
