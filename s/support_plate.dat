TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.|$|E

50|$|The mazda BPD engine (also {{commonly}} referred to as a BP2) was a revamp of the original BP engine (sometimes called BP1 for clarity's sake). It featured a larger crank nose, larger piston oil squirters, a main bearing <b>support</b> <b>plate,</b> better flowing inlet and exhaust ports. This was also the base engine for the Mazda Familia GT-R and GT-Ae. It is commonly known as the 'big turbo' variant as it utilised a much larger IHI RHF6CB water-cooled turbocharger(vj23). The BPD was used {{as the basis for the}} engine, with changes such as sodium-filled exhaust valves, larger (and front-mounted) intercooler, larger (440 cc) low impedance fuel injectors and stronger engine internals helping to up the performance of the engine to produce 209 hp (156 kW) and 184 lb·ft (255 N·m). The VICS system of the N/A BP has been removed, as well as the boost cut from the ecu. This engine was designed to power Mazda to a world rally championship win, and was thus used in the limited production Mazda Familia GT-R (2,200 built) and GTAe (300 built).|$|E
50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure <b>support</b> <b>plate,</b> fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|E

Through either oversight or deliberate fraud, the manufacturer construction logs however showed that this work had been carried out. In reality, an improper adjustment had been made to the locking pin and warning light mechanism, causing the locking pin travel to be reduced. This meant that the pins did not extend past the torque tube flanges, allowing the handle to be closed without excessive force (estimated by investigators to be around [...] ) despite the improperly engaged latches. These findings concurred with statements made by Mohammed Mahmoudi, the baggage handler who had closed the door on Flight 981; he noted that no particular amount of force was needed to close the locking handle. Changes had also been made to the warning light switch, so that it would turn off the cockpit warning light even if the handle was not fully closed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{crash was}} caused when an {{improperly}} secured cargo {{door at the}} rear of the plane broke off, causing an explosive decompression which severed cables necessary to control the aircraft. Because of a known design flaw left uncorrected before and after the production of DC-10s, the cargo hatches did not latch reliably, and manual procedures were relied upon to ensure they were locked correctly. Problems with the hatches had occurred previously, most notably in an identical incident that happened on American Airlines Flight 96 in 1972, the so-called [...] "Windsor Incident". Investigation showed that the handles on the hatches could be improperly forced shut without the latching pins locking in place. It was noted that the pins on the hatch that failed on Flight 981 had been filed down to make it easier to close the door, resulting in the hatch being less resistant to pressure. Also, a <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> for the handle linkage had not been installed, although manufacturer documents showed this work as completed. Finally, the latching had been performed by a baggage handler who did not speak Turkish or English, the only languages provided on a warning notice about the cargo door's design flaws and the methods of compensating for them. After the disaster, the latches were redesigned and the locking system significantly upgraded.|$|E
