In this study, twenty-five students were enrolled in an expository writing class in an Intensive English Program (IEP) of a private, American university in Madrid, Spain, where they attended 25 contact hours of English per week and experienced anonymous, or blind, peer review (PR). It was hoped that removing <b>social</b> <b>interferences</b> would force the participants to focus on the type and number of corrections they made to an unknown classmate’s essay and as well as increase the type and number of corrections s/he incorporates into her/his original essay.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{there has been}} little {{consensus}} on the benefits of peer review (PR) with respect to the teaching of expository writing in English to non-native speakers. Lu & Bol (2007) reported on several ESL writing instruction studies (Chaudron, 1983; Mangelsdorf, 1992; Paulus, 1999) that suggested peer feedback was as good as, and in some cases better than teacher feedback in helping revise and improve students' papers (p. 101). Brammer & Rees (2007), however, reported, "We frequently hear students complain bitterly that peer review {{is a waste of time}} or blame their peers for `not catching all the mistakes' and students do not stay on task during the peer review process" (p. 71). The literature also identifies social issues that can negatively affect the outcome of face-to-face PR, such as students being easily biased or not honest when providing feedback due to friendship, gender, race, interpersonal relationships, or personal preferences (Carson & Nelson, 1996; Ghorpade & Lackritz, 2001; MacLeod, 1999; Nilson, 2003; Zhao, 1998). To maximize the benefits of PR and reduce <b>social</b> <b>interferences,</b> this study incorporated anonymous electronic-peer review with 25 EFL students enrolled in an expository writing class in Spain. The goal of this dissertation is to explore the relationship between students' attitudes towards peer review and one) the amount and type of corrections a student makes to an essay in anonymous electronic-peer review, and two) the amount and type of corrections a student incorporates into his/her original essay after receiving feedback from a peer. The participants completed several Likert questionnaires, participated in PR training, wrote two drafts of an essay and were interviewed. The interviews provided data not only on the corrections mentioned above, but also how the participants viewed the experience, the effects PR had on their writing, insecurities about their English writing skills, and confidence they had in themselves and their peers based on perceived target language competence. Findings include discussion on perceptions and implications of electronic peer review on EFL learners' ability to provide helpful feedback and the willingness of the students to participate in peer review again in the future...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a {{well-established}} instrument {{used to evaluate}} the health status of heart failure (HF) patients. There has been a lack of clarity about the best way to conceptualize the KCCQ. The purpose of this investigation of the KCCQ was to: (1) explore the factor structure with an exploratory factor analyses; (2) perform reliability and validity testing to determine the best factor solution for item groupings; and (3) determine the most meaningful components of health status captured by the KCCQ. Methods and Results: A secondary analysis of data from 280 adults with stage-C HF enrolled from three US northeastern sites was conducted to test the KCCQ subscale structure. Criterion-related validity for the Self-efficacy subscale was tested with the Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge Scale and the Self-care of Heart Failure Index Self-care Confidence Scale. Overall, internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) for the KCCQ and subscales was 0. 92, <b>social</b> <b>interference</b> (seven items, 0. 90), physical limitation (four items, 0. 84), symptoms (eight items, 0. 86), independent care (two items, 0. 80), and self-efficacy (two items, 0. 63).

However, there may also be negative effects of social environments on the diabetic patient. This study developed and validated a new diabetic unsupportive social interaction scale (USIS), including two subscales: interference and insensitivity. Methods: A list of 22 items depicting unsupportive interactions associated with management of diabetes was developed. A telephone survey was administered to 764 Israelis with diabetes. The questionnaire included the USIS and questions about social networks, social support, health behaviors, and health. The characteristics, validity, and reliability of the scale were tested. Results: A principal component analysis was performed for extraction of two factors describing unsupportive <b>social</b> interaction concepts: <b>interference</b> and insensitivity. Cronbach’s alpha for the full 15 -item scale was 0. 84, indicating internal consistency. The two subscales were calculated to have Cronbach’s alphas of 0. 85 and 0. 73, respectively. The USIS showed construct validity as it was associated with social support, some measures of social networks, subjective measures of health, and health behaviors. Arabs, older respondents, those defining themselves as more religious, and the less educated reported higher rates of unsupportive interactions. Conclusion: This study suggests a new concept of unsupportive interactions including interference and insensitivity. These unsupportive interactions may adversely affect patients’ ability to adhere to treatment and may undermine their health in various ways. Identifying these problems may enable clinicians to help patients cope with their unsupportive environments.

40|$|A/B {{testing is}} a {{standard}} approach for evaluating the effect of online experiments; {{the goal is to}} estimate the `average treatment effect' of a new feature or condition by exposing a sample of the overall population to it. A drawback with A/B testing is that it is poorly suited for experiments involving <b>social</b> <b>interference,</b> when the treatment of individuals spills over to neighboring individuals along an underlying social network. In this work, we propose a novel methodology using graph clustering to analyze average treatment effects under <b>social</b> <b>interference.</b> To begin, we characterize graph-theoretic conditions under which individuals can be considered to be `network exposed' to an experiment. We then show how graph cluster randomization admits an efficient exact algorithm to compute the probabilities for each vertex being network exposed under several of these exposure conditions. Using these probabilities as inverse weights, a Horvitz-Thompson estimator can then provide an effect estimate that is unbiased, provided that the exposure model has been properly specified. Given an estimator that is unbiased, we focus on minimizing the variance. First, we develop simple sufficient conditions for the variance of the estimator to be asymptotically small in n, the size of the graph. However, for general randomization schemes, this variance can be lower bounded by an exponential function of the degrees of a graph. In contrast, we show that if a graph satisfies a restricted-growth condition on the growth rate of neighborhoods, then there exists a natural clustering algorithm, based on vertex neighborhoods, for which the variance of the estimator can be upper bounded by a linear function of the degrees. Thus we show that proper cluster randomization can lead to exponentially lower estimator variance when experimentally measuring average treatment effects under interference.

We studied five broadly sympatric species of viviparous montane skinks within the genera Egernia and Eulamprus in southeastern Australia. Previous work has shown strong interspecific overlap in abiotic attributes of shelter-sites for these taxa, but no joint occupancy of retreats. Laboratory trials in which we manipulated the identity of co-occurring lizards revealed frequent displacement from “preferred ” (hotter) shelters, with interspecific interactions more intense than intraspecific conflicts. The five species displayed a linear interspecific dominance hierarchy, with larger species displacing smaller taxa. Field manipulations confirmed that interspecific interactions between these species affect shelter-site use.

The data was based on European Social Survey, round 2, conducted in the years 2004 - 2005. Descriptive statistics and ordinal regression analysis {{were used to assess}} the outcomes. Work to home interference was not especially frequent among mothers in Finland. However, interference that comprised other family members was more common than in the other countries investigated. With regard to work characteristics, Finnish mothers differed both negatively and positively from mothers in the other countries. Long working hours increased time-based interference from work to family members. Time pressure at work increased both time- and strain-based <b>interferences.</b> <b>Social</b> support from co-workers decreased strain-based interference. Work to family member interferences, especially strain-based interference, were negatively connected to life satisfaction. Both working and non-working mothers in Finland appeared to be satisfied with their life...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the psychosocial factors affecting {{the quality of life}} (QOL) of 171 individuals with chronic pain. Participants completed a battery of self-rated inventories measuring three sets of predictor variables—demographic (age, gender, income, marital status), pain-specific (chronicity, severity, duration, frequency, pain impairment), and psychosocial (<b>interference,</b> <b>social</b> support, depression, coping) —and one criterion variable with five models (physical, psychological, social, environmental, total). Hierarchical multiple regression indicates that income predicts the psychological and envi-ronmental domains of QOL. Across all five models, 56 % to 76 % of the variance was accounted for with the three sets of variables. Demographics remained minimally predictive of all models. Pain impairment was predictive of all five models. Depression was predictive of all but physical QOL, and coping was predictive of all but physical and environmental QOL. The pain impairment variable and the two psychosocial variables (depression and coping) remained imperative in predict-ing QOL of individuals with chronic pain...|$|R
