5000|$|An {{adolescent}} boy (Phoring, for [...] "Dragonfly") {{grows up}} in a back-of-beyond township in North Bengal. Surrounded by the lush Dooars countryside, the town barely survives the <b>shutdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>factory.</b> Maladjusted and a born loser, Phoring fights {{the voices in}} his head which he calls God. A new teacher (Doel) arrives in school, and opens up his mind to things unknown. Phoring starts {{to believe that this}} is not a dream. Doel invites Phoring to her house to nurture his creative skills. She also presents a cell phone to Phoring during Phoring's birthday.Phoring records a video of Doel while celebrating. This video tape is leaked out by one of Phoring's classmates.Doel is harassed by a group of older teachers. An enraged Doel starts avoiding Phoring. Phoring is suspended from his school. Then Doel's brother comes and resides in Doel's house. One day Phoring and his friend discovers some firearms in the locked down factories. Doel and his brother disappears abruptly leaving behind a trail of doubt and suspicion.Police then searches for them due to be linked with terrorism. Phoring decides to go looking for her in Kolkata.He stays many a days doing hard labour to survive in the city.At last he meets Doel in a jail.|$|E

40|$|During acute T cell immune {{responses}} to viral infection, antigen-specific T cells first proliferate and differentiate into effector cells, but after pathogen clearance most are deleted by apoptosis. The developmentally programmed death of antigen-specific T cells during <b>shutdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> T cell response is {{mediated by the}} Bcl- 2 -regulated apoptotic pathway and partly depends on the proapoptotic BH 3 -only protein Bim. However, loss of Bim enhanced survival of antigen-activated T cells {{to a lesser extent}} than Bcl- 2 overexpression, indicating that other proapoptotic factors must contribute to T cell killing. In this study, we investigated the contributions of several BH 3 -only proteins to the <b>shutdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acute T cell immune response in vivo. After infection with human herpes simplex virus (HSV- 1), mice lacking Noxa, Bid, or Bad had a normal increase and subsequent decline in the numbers of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells. In contrast, Puma-deficient mice showed an abnormally prolonged persistence of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells in the spleen, associated with enhanced in vitro survival of these cells in the absence of cytokines. Puma was dispensable for viral clearance and also did not play a role in proliferation or activation of HSV- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cells in vivo. Collectively, these findings show that Puma contributes to the death of antigen-specific T cells during <b>shutdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immune response...|$|R

5000|$|A scram or SCRAM is <b>an</b> {{emergency}} <b>shutdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear reactor. It is <b>a</b> type <b>of</b> kill switch. In commercial reactor operations, {{this type}} <b>of</b> <b>shutdown</b> {{is often referred}} to as a [...] "SCRAM" [...] at boiling water reactors (BWR), and as a [...] "reactor trip" [...] at pressurized water reactors (PWR).

50|$|Scram: A Nuclear Power Plant Simulation is an Atari 8-bit family game {{written by}} Chris Crawford and {{published}} by Atari, Inc. in 1981.

40|$|A digital {{computer}} study <b>of</b> emergency <b>shutdowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 60 -kWe reactor Brayton power system was conducted. Malfunctions considered were (1) loss of reactor coolant flow, (2) loss of Brayton system gas flow, (3) turbine overspeed, and (4) a reactivity insertion error. Loss of reactor coolant flow {{was the most}} serious malfunction for the reactor. Methods for moderating the reactor transients due to this malfunction are considered...|$|R

50|$|Today {{standards}} only {{define the}} {{safety integrity level}} (SIL) for safety functions. Standards do not define STL levels because they do in first instance not represent safety but economic loss. Despite this the STL is also a safety attribute, specially for safety functions in the process, oil & gas, chemical and nuclear industry. In those industries <b>an</b> undesired <b>shutdown</b> <b>of</b> the process leads to dangerous situation as the plant needs to be started up again. Startup and <b>shutdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> process plant are considered the two most dangerous operational modes of the plant and {{should be limited to}} the absolute minimum.|$|R

50|$|When <b>a</b> major piece <b>of</b> process {{equipment}} like a charge pump, compressor, or fired heater shuts down, many alarms become unnecessary.
