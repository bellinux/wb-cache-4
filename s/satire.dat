Composed in dactylic hexameters, the <b>Satires</b> explore the secrets of human happiness and literary perfection. Published probably in 35 BCE and at the latest by 33 BCE, the first book of <b>Satires</b> represents Horace's first published work, and it established {{him as one of}} the great poetic talents of the Augustan Age. The second book was published in 30 BCE as a sequel.|$|R
5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} Discworld novels {{were written}} largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series evolved into straightforward (though still comedic) <b>satire.</b>|$|E

50|$|The author makes {{constant}} {{allusion to}} history and myth {{as a source of}} object lessons or exemplars of particular vices and virtues. Coupled with his dense and elliptical Latin, these tangential references indicate that the intended reader of the <b>Satires</b> was highly educated. The <b>Satires</b> are concerned with perceived threats to the social continuity of the Roman citizens: social-climbing foreigners, unfaithfulness, and other more extreme excesses of their own class. The intended audience of the <b>Satires</b> constituted a subset of the Roman elite, primarily adult males of a more conservative social stance.|$|R

5|$|She was {{assigned}} {{to try to stop}} the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park <b>satire</b> which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the <b>satire</b> from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper. Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman, instead of the personality test.|$|E
5|$|The play {{established}} Fielding as {{a popular}} London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new <b>satire</b> of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised {{the way in which}} the London theatre scene, in his view, abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres. The Author's Farce is now considered to be a critical success and a highly skilled <b>satire.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the <b>satire</b> comes from the depiction of the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E
