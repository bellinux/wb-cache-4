40|$|Background: Teaching {{hospitals}} are medical institutes at which most nursing education institutions provide their <b>students</b> with practical <b>nursing</b> experience. Although {{the focus of}} care is the patient, attention is sometimes focused more on the <b>nursing</b> <b>students</b> {{rather than on the}} patients who are undergoing care at the hands of both the <b>nursing</b> professionals and <b>students.</b> However, proper <b>nursing</b> care should also take into account the experiences of patients during the care process in the health facility. Objectives: The study had three objectives: to describe the experiences of patients <b>nursed</b> by <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> in a teaching hospital in the Western Cape; to identify patterns in the experiences of patients receiving patient care from student nurses; and to analyse aspects of the experiences that may need further attention for the training of <b>student</b> <b>nurses.</b> Method: A descriptive phenomenological approach was used to explore the experiences of patients <b>nursed</b> by <b>student</b> <b>nurses.</b> Participant selection took place purposively from different wards of the identified teaching hospital, and thematic saturation was achieved at 10 participants. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: Three main themes were discovered after data analysis: methods of identification of <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> by patients; positive perceptions of <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> by patients; and negative perceptions of <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> by patients.

500|$|The Final Frontier, the {{previous}} {{film in the}} series, was a critical and financial disappointment; {{the cast and crew}} were worried that the franchise {{would not be able to}} recover from the blow. With the looming 25th anniversary of [...] in 1991, producer Harve Bennett revisited an idea Ralph Winter had for the fourth film: a prequel featuring young versions of Kirk and Spock at Starfleet Academy. The prequel was designed to be a way of keeping the characters, if not the actors, in what was called [...] "Top Gun in outer space". Bennett and The Final Frontier writer David Loughery wrote a script entitled The Academy Years, where Dr. Leonard McCoy talks about how he met Kirk and Spock while addressing a group of Academy graduates. The script shows Kirk and Spock's upbringing, their meeting McCoy and Montgomery Scott at the Academy and defeating a villain before parting ways. The script would have established that George Kirk, James T. Kirk's father, was a pilot who went missing—presumed dead—during a warp experiment with Scott.

40|$|Background: Caring for intellectually {{disabled}} {{people can be}} demanding for <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> who are novices in the nursing profession. To ensure that quality nursing care is provided, <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> should {{have an understanding of}} and a positive attitude towards intellectually {{disabled people}}. Nursing intellectually disabled people can be a challenge for the <b>student</b> <b>nurses.</b> Therefore, <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> {{need to be able to}} deal with challenges of caring for intellectually disabled people. Objective: This article aims to explore and describe experiences of <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> caring for intellectually disabled people in a public psychiatric institution. Design and method: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was used. Data were collected through individual in-depth phenomenological interviews, naïve sketches and field notes. Thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the collected data. Results were contextualised within the literature and measures to ensure trustworthiness were adhered to. Ethical principals were also applied throughout the research process. Results: Five themes emerged from the data. <b>Student</b> <b>nurses</b> experienced a profoundly unsettling impact on their whole being when caring for intellectually disabled people; they developed a sense of compassion and a new way of looking at life, and experienced a need for certain physical, mental and spiritual needs to be met. Conclusion: From the results, it is evident that <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> were challenged in caring for intellectually disabled people. However, they developed a sense of awareness that intellectually disabled people have a need to be cared for like any other person.

40|$|Workplace {{violence}} {{directed at}} <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> in training in psychiatric institutions {{is a significant}} concern as it negatively affects the quality of learning and causes the students to have a negative perception of nursing as a profession. The absence of scientific data describing the perceptions of <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> about workplace violence and their clinical learning outcome motivated the researcher to conduct the study. Quantitative, descriptive research was conducted to explore the influence that workplace violence will have on clinical learning outcomes of <b>student</b> <b>nurses</b> who are studying psychiatric nursing at psychiatric institutions in KwaZulu-Natal, in South Africa. Data was gathered using a 71 question questionnaire, which was adapted from the one used by Hewett (2010).
