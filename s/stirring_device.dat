50|$|Electric {{stirring}} explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry. This property {{can be used}} {{to induce}} spin polarization in conventional semiconductors by purely electric means. Strictly speaking stirring is a non-linear effect, because in linear response theory (LRT) an AC driving induces an AC current with the same frequency. Still an adaptation of the LRT Kubo formalism allows the analysis of stirring. The quantum pumping problem (where we have an open geometry) can be regarded as a special limit of the quantum stirring problem (where we have a closed geometry). Optionally the latter can be analyzed within the framework of scattering theory. Pumping and <b>Stirring</b> <b>devices</b> are close relatives of ratchet systems.

50|$|Superheating {{can occur}} when an {{undisturbed}} container {{of water is}} heated in a microwave oven. At the time the container is removed, the lack of nucleation sites prevents boiling, leaving the surface calm. However, once the water is disturbed, some of it violently flashes to steam, potentially spraying boiling {{water out of the}} container. The boiling can be triggered by jostling the cup, inserting a <b>stirring</b> <b>device,</b> or adding a substance like instant coffee or sugar. The chance of superheating is greater with smooth containers, because scratches or chips can house small pockets of air, which serve as nucleation points. Superheating is more likely after repeated heating and cooling cycles of an undisturbed container, as when a forgotten coffee cup is re-heated without being removed from a microwave oven. This is due to heating cycles releasing dissolved gases such as Oxygen and Nitrogen from the solvent. There are ways to prevent superheating in a microwave oven, such as putting a popsicle stick in the glass or using a scratched container.|$|E

We first present a volume-of-fluid simulation, which {{is able to}} predict {{the surface of the}} droplets during coalescence.

The first model is simple enough to yield an ex-act expression for the velocity field and so allow numerical par-ticle tracking {{to be carried out}} to high precision. The choice of a suitable mode of operation of the device is essentially a matter of optimising the system parameters.

40|$|It {{will be very}} {{interesting}} for many important reactions to endow highly active catalysts with momentum-transfer efficiency.

The CCGC magnetically transferred momentum in a batch or continuous flow reactor. The external magnetic field can drive the catalyst to transfer momentum for excellent agitation. The catalyst can be fixed at an appointed position in the continuous flow for efficient separation. The separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture also becomes facile. The CCGC showed superior retention as a pollutant adsorbent for the removal of Rhodamine B (Rh-B) from water in the absence of magnetic or mechanical stirring apparatus.

The semi-automated system {{is capable of}} measuring reactions with half lives of 20 seconds or more with data being collected every second. Experimental data obtained with the device are superior to those collected by batch shakers, fixed interface cells, falling drop, or other <b>stirring</b> <b>devices.</b> The use of a microporous Teflon membrane phase separator along with the thermodynamic relation, the Gibbs Equation, enabled the measurement of drop sizes in a two phase liquid-liquid dispersion.

The effect of interfacial area on the rate of extraction of five different chelating agents with various divalent metal ions was determined in this study. The role of the interfacial area in extraction kinetics was found in a system where diffusional effects are negligible. This information provides an {{answer to the question of}} whether the rate determining step of extraction occurs in either the bulk aqueous phase or in the interfacial region. The proportionality between rate and specific interfacial area was employed to find the magnitude of the contributions of the bulk and interfacial components and also allowed the calculation of the individual rate constants. Evaluation of the bulk and interfacial rate constants yields important fundamental information as to the chemical nature and differences between the chloroform/water interface and the bulk aqueous phase. The results appear to illustrate that the interface is a more conducive medium for reaction between metal and ligand than the aqueous phase.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was {{to address the problem of}} engulfments in flowing grain that occur in on-farm metal grain storage bins. This was accomplished by utilizing a systems approach to identify contributing factors to engulfment which were used to develop a 28 -question hazard assessment tool. A numerically weighted high- and low-risk response accompanied each question, the sum of which resulted in a potential-risk-of-engulfment score for on-farm grain handling and storage systems. ^ The assessment tool was pilot tested using nine farms where previous engulfment incidents had been reported and nine farms with no history of engulfment. A revised version was used to score an additional 26 farms with unknown histories of engulfment and by three individuals personally familiar with prior engulfment incidents. It was found that the difference between the mean of the assessment tool scores of farms with a history of engulfment and the mean of the scores of farms with no prior reported engulfment incident was significant (p = 0. 001). ^ It was found that the management of grain during storage and an individual 2 ̆ 7 s perception of risk and willingness to avoid flowing grain hazards had the most impact on reducing the potential for an engulfment. In contrast, a history of plugging problems resulting from out-of-condition grain was not found to make a considerable difference in scores between the two groups of farms. The presence of <b>stirring</b> <b>devices</b> in bins, accommodation for lockout devices on electrical controls, and utilizing grain storage bins smaller than 20, 000 -bushel capacity also had little impact on the difference in scores.

Findings also contributed to the revision of a potential engineering standard for on-farm grain storage structures. ...|$|R

The influences of the wall temperature, the stirrer speed, the dryer load and the location of the stirrer against the heated wall were studied. Three different rheological behaviors were observed during sludge drying. In particular, the sludge goes through a ``glue'' phase, and high levels of mechanical strain are recorded when the compact mass begins to break up.

40|$|In many {{engineering}} applications involving {{mixing of}} highly viscous fluids or mixing at micro-scales, efficient mixing must {{be accomplished in}} the absence of turbulence. Similarly in geophysical flows large-scale, deterministic flow structures can account for a considerable portion of global transport and mixing. For these types of problems, concepts from non-linear dynamical systems and the theory of chaotic advection provide the tools for understanding, quantifying, and optimizing transport and mixing processes. In this thesis chaotic advection is studied numerically in three, steady, experimentally realizable, three-dimensional flows: 1) steady vortex breakdown flow in a cylindrical container with bottom rotating lid, 2) flow in a cylindrical container with exactly counter rotating lids, and 3) flow in a new model stirred-tank with counter-rotating disks. For all cases the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically and the Lagrangian properties of the computed velocity fields are analyzed using a variety of computational and theoretical tools. For the flow in the interior of vortex breakdown bubbles it is shown that even though from the Eulerian viewpoint the simulated flow fields are steady and nearly axisymmetric the Lagrangian dynamics could be chaotic. Silnikovs mechanism is shown to {{play a critical role in}} breaking up the invariance of the bubble and giving rise to chaotic dynamics. The computations for the steady flow in a cylindrical container with two exactly counter-rotating lids confirm for the first time the findings of recent linear stability studies. Above a threshold Reynolds number the equatorial shear layer becomes unstable to azimuthal modes and an intricate web of radial (cats eyes) and axial, azimuthally-inclined vortices emerge in the flow paving the way for extremely complex chaotic dynamics. Using these fundamental insights, a new <b>stirring</b> tank <b>device</b> with exactly counter-rotating disks is proposed. Results show for the first time that counter rotation of the middle disk in a three-disk stirred tank can create a flow with large chaotic regions. The results of this thesis serve to demonstrate that fundamental studies of chaotic mixing are both important from a theoretical standpoint and can potentially lead to valuable technological breakthroughs.
