5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order Echinosteliales, and {{the only}} <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, algae-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E

5|$|In his 1986 infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Boletus, Rolf Singer placed C.calopus as the type <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> section Calopodes, which includes species characterised by having a whitish to yellowish flesh, bitter taste, and a blue staining reaction in the tube walls. Other species in section Calopodes include C.radicans, C.inedulis, B.peckii, and B.pallidus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that C.calopus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes {{were part of a}} dupainii clade (named for Boletus (now Rubroboletus)dupainii), well-removed from the core group of the type species B.edulis and relatives within the Boletineae.

5|$|Lactifluus piperatus was the {{original}} type <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Lactarius. However, after the finding that Lactarius actually represented more than one genus, the species Lactarius torminosus was conserved as type for that genus. Thus, L. piperatus is now the type species of Lactifluus, which was split from Lactarius and contains mainly tropical milk-caps, but also some <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north temperate zone. Phylogenetic research showed that L. glaucescens, sometimes considered only a variety of L. piperatus, is a distinct species in Europe. Furthermore, the existence of at least ten lineages worldwide, with no overlap among continents, was shown for the group around L. piperatus, suggesting that populations in North America might actually be distinct species.|$|E
