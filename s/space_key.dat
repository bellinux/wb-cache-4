30|$|To {{improve the}} {{scalability}} of the random keys schemes, two random <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> schemes [5, 7] {{have been proposed}} independently at ACM CCS 2003. These two works are similar in nature, except that they apply different <b>key</b> <b>space</b> models, which will be summarized in Subsection 3.1. Each sensor preloads several keying shares, with each belonging to one <b>key</b> <b>space.</b> Two sensors can establish a shared key if they have keying information from the same <b>key</b> <b>space.</b> References [7] also proposes to assign one <b>key</b> <b>space</b> to each row or each column of a virtual grid. A sensor residing at a grid point receives keying information from exactly two <b>key</b> <b>spaces.</b> This realization involves more number of <b>key</b> <b>spaces.</b> Note that these random <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> schemes also improve resilience and key-sharing probability because more <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> are available, and because two sensors compute a unique key within one <b>key</b> <b>space</b> for their shared links.|$|R

30|$|Two {{neighboring}} nodes sharing {{at least}} one <b>key</b> <b>space</b> (having obtained <b>keying</b> information from {{at least one}} common service sensor) can establish a shared key accordingly. The actual computation procedure {{is dependent on the}} underlying <b>key</b> <b>space</b> model. We refer the readers for the details to Subsection 3.1. Note that this procedure involves the exchange of either node ids, if polynomial-based <b>key</b> <b>space</b> model is utilized [19], or columns (seeds) of the public matrix, if matrix-based <b>key</b> <b>space</b> model is utilized [18]. To further improve security, nonces can be introduced to protect against replay attacks.|$|R

50|$|The player {{takes the}} role of Jeremy Flynn, who is {{controlled}} using a joystick and the keyboard. The joystick is used for movement (running, jumping, ducking, crawling), using the primary weapon (a dagger at first), operating switches/levers and carrying boxes. Additionally a parachute can be deployed for slowing down descent as larger falls can kill Flynn. The weapon does not work while {{in the air and}} is replaced by a ground-stomp used to destroy breakable blocks.The keyboard's arrow keys are used to navigate through Flynn's inventory while the <b>Space</b> <b>key</b> uses/activates the selected inventory item. The Escape key kills Flynn in case the player fell into a trap he/she can't escape from through other means.|$|E
