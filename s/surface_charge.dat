5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of {{a single}} and negatively charged polyion with varying flexibility onto a surface carrying both negative and positive charges representing a <b>charged</b> membrane <b>surface</b> has been investigated by using a simple model employing Monte Carlo simulations. The polyion was represented by a sequence of negatively charged hard spheres connected with harmonic bonds. The <b>charged</b> <b>surface</b> groups were also represented by charged hard spheres, and they were positioned on a hard surface slightly protruding into the solution. The <b>surface</b> <b>charges</b> were either frozen in a liquidlike structure or laterally mobile. With a large excess of positive <b>surface</b> <b>charges,</b> the classical picture of a strongly adsorbed polyion with an extended and flat configuration emerged. However, adsorption also appeared at a net neutral surface or at a weakly negatively <b>charged</b> <b>surface,</b> and at these conditions the adsorption was stronger with a flexible polyion as compared to a semiflexible one, two features not appearing in simpler models containing homogeneously <b>charged</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The presence of <b>charged</b> <b>surface</b> patches (frozen <b>surface</b> <b>charges)</b> {{and the ability of}} polarization of the <b>surface</b> <b>charges</b> (mobile <b>surface</b> <b>charges)</b> are the main reasons for the enhanced adsorption. The stronger adsorption with the flexible chain is caused by its greater ability to spatially correlate with the <b>surface</b> <b>charges.</b> [URL]...|$|R

The figure shows a uniform array of identical dipoles between two surfaces. Internally, the heads and tails of dipoles are adjacent and cancel. At the bounding surfaces, however, no cancellation occurs. Instead, on one surface the dipole heads create a positive <b>surface</b> <b>charge,</b> while at the opposite surface the dipole tails create a negative <b>surface</b> <b>charge.</b> These two opposite surface charges create a net electric field in a direction opposite to {{the direction of the}} dipoles.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Chang Wei and his {{colleague}} discovered that ion rectification occurs {{at the tip of}} a nano-sized pipe.

25|$|A {{physically}} {{more realistic}} modeling of p(r) {{would have the}} dipole moment density drop off rapidly, but smoothly to zero at the boundary of the confining region, rather than making a sudden step to zero density.

Also less negatively charged growing cells of A. simplex and B. subtilis adhered stronger to polystyrene. This was also true for biosurfactant-coated polystyrene surfaces (the correlation coefficient is 0.55). However, no correlation {{was found between the}} <b>surface</b> <b>charges</b> of bacterial cultures and their adhesion inhibition by the biosurfactant (corresponding correlation coefficients for resting and growing cells are 0.15 and − 0.26).

25|$|Once a {{conductive}} channel bridges the air {{gap between the}} negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> excess below, {{there is a large}} drop in resistance across the lightning channel.

25|$|Since the {{conductance}} of {{ionic current}} flow {{is controlled by}} the gate voltage, using a material with high dielectric constant as the wall of the channel is desired. In this case, there is a stronger field seen within the channel due to a higher gate capacitance. A channel surface with a low <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> is also desired in order to strengthen the effect of potential tuning by gate electrode. This increases the ability to spatially and temporally tune the ionic and electrostatic environment in the channel.|$|E
25|$|At {{locations}} {{inside the}} charge array, to connect {{an array of}} paired charges to an approximation involving only a dipole moment density p(r) requires additional considerations.

In particular, as in the example above that uses a constant dipole moment density confined to a finite region, a <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> and depolarization field results. A more general version of this model (which allows the polarization to vary with position) is the customary approach using electric susceptibility or electrical permittivity.|$|E

25|$|Ionic bipolar {{transistors}} {{can be made}} from two conical channels with the smallest opening in nano-scaled dimension. By introducing opposite surface charges at each side, it is able to rectify ionic current as an ionic diode. An ionic bipolar transistor is built by combining two ionic diodes and forming a PNP junction along the inner surface of the channel. While the ionic current is from emitter end to collector end, the strength of the current can be modulated by the base electrode. The <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> at the channel wall can be modified using chemical methods, by changing the electrolyte concentration or pH value.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{interpretation}} of the microneurographic readings can be difficult because axonal membrane potential {{can not be determined}} from this method. A supplemental method used to better understand these readings involves examining recordings of post-spike excitability and shifts in latency; these features are associated with changes in membrane potential of unmyelinated axons like C fibers. Moalem-Taylor et al. experimentally used chemical modulators with known effects on membrane potential to study the post-spike super-excitability of C fibers. The researchers found three resulting events. Chemical medulators can produce a combination of loss of super-excitability along with increased axonal excitability, indicating membrane depolarization. Secondly, membrane hyperpolarization can result from a blockade of axonal hyperpolarization-activated current. Lastly, a non-specific increase in <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> and a change in the voltage-dependent activation of sodium channels results from the application of calcium.|$|E
25|$|Of decisive {{importance}} for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either {{be caused by a}} reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments {{under the influence of the}} external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> density upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1cm3 cube of quartz with 2kN (500lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V.|$|E
