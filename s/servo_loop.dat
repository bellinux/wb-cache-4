As described in the section on the PDH readout function, photodetector signal is demodulated (that is, passed through the mixer and the low-pass filter) to produce an error signal that is fed back into the laser's frequency control port.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary mirror}} control system (M 1 CS) keeps the 492 {{segments}} of the Thirty Meter Telescope primary mirror aligned {{in the presence of}} disturbances. A global position control loop uses feedback from inter-segment edge sensors to three actuators behind each segment that control segment piston, tip and tilt. If soft force actuators are used (e. g. voice-coil), then in addition to the global position loop there will be a local <b>servo</b> <b>loop</b> to provide stiffness. While the M 1 control system at Keck compensates only for slow disturbances such as gravity and thermal variations, the M 1 CS for TMT will need to provide some compensation for higher frequency wind disturbances in order to meet stringent error budget targets. An analysis of expected high-wavenumber wind forces on M 1 suggests that a 1 Hz control bandwidth is required for the global feedback of segment edge-sensor-based position information in order to minimize high spatial frequency segment response for both seeing-limited and adaptive optics performance. A much higher bandwidth is required from the local <b>servo</b> <b>loop</b> to provide adequate stiffness to wind or acoustic disturbances. A related paper presents the control designs for the local actuator servo loops. The disturbance rejection requirements would not be difficult to achieve for a single segment, but the structural coupling between segments mounted on a flexible mirror cell results in control-structure interaction (CSI) that limits the achievable bandwidth. Using a combination of simplified modeling to build intuition and the full telescope finite element model for verification, we present designs and analysis for both the local <b>servo</b> <b>loop</b> and global loop demonstrating sufficient bandwidth and resulting wind-disturbance rejection despite the presence of CSI...|$|E
