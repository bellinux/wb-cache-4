5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.|$|E
5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front {{and his ability to}} inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and places <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E

5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Rare for the Nintendo 64 video game console. It was released in North America on October 11, 1999 and in Europe on November 2, 1999. The game follows the story of {{three members of the}} Jet Force Gemini team and their efforts to stop the advances of the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his army. It features a single-player mode where the player must explore a galaxy and save Tribals, a race of survivors who have been enslaved and imprisoned by Mizar, and places <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where two to four players can compete in traditional deathmatch games.|$|E
5|$|SimTower {{allows the}} player {{to build and}} manage the {{operations}} of a modern, multi-use skyscraper. They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, hotel rooms, retail stores and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player must keep their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms {{with the help of}} housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing elevator traffic. SimTower, which was built around an elevator simulation program, places a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> good elevator management.|$|E

5|$|The {{sketches}} {{he made in}} the Alhambra {{formed a}} major source for his work from that time on. He also studied {{the architecture of the}} Mezquita, the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This {{turned out to be the}} last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|The {{tensions}} {{between these two}} competing historical and cultural traditions erupted into political and social conflict during the Ukrainian crisis, which began when then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union on 21 November 2013. Support for closer ties with Europe was strong in western and central Ukraine, whilst many in eastern and southern Ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with Russia. President Yanukovych, who drew most of his support from eastern regions, was forced out of office in February 2014. His ouster was followed by protests in eastern and southern Ukraine that placed a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the importance of historical ties to Russia, the Russian language, and antipathy towards the Euromaidan movement.|$|E
5|$|These revelations {{make the}} {{painting}} difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> colour and tone {{suggest that the}} work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form {{can be seen to}} mark the beginning of the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter with shoot 'em up and action-adventure elements, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Weapons have no magazines restrictions and range from grenades to a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much {{of the game is}} spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, hang from most ledges, swim and fly using jet packs when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with the targeting camera fixed behind the character's head. When using this technique, a crosshair appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.|$|E
5|$|Nagatos {{presence}} at Yokosuka was {{revealed to the}} Allies by photographs taken during the 10July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink {{the remnants of the}} IJN, and placed a particularly <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the straight and level flight needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{achievement}} for PLOT was the award-winning VM Houses in Ørestad, Copenhagen, in 2005. Inspired by Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation concept, they designed two residential blocks, {{in the shape}} of the letters V and M (as seen from the sky); the M House with 95 units, was completed in 2004, and the V House, with 114 units, in 2005. The design places <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> daylight, privacy and views. Rather than looking over the neighboring building, all of the apartments have diagonal views of the surrounding fields. Corridors are short and bright, rather like open bullet holes through the building. There are some 80 different types of apartment in the complex, adaptable to individual needs. The building garnered Ingels and Smedt the Forum AID Award for the best building in Scandinavia in 2006. Ingels lived in the complex until 2008 when he moved into the adjacent Mountain Dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{video game}} adaptations of the Alien franchise, Alien: Isolation places a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid and outsmart a single alien creature {{over the course}} of the game with the help of gadgets like a motion tracker and a flamethrower. It was designed more in line with Scott's film as opposed to James Cameron's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future would look like. The game runs on an entirely new engine that was built from scratch to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects as well as the alien's behavioural design. Creative Assembly originally intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but the perspective was later changed to first-person in order to create a more intense experience.|$|E
5|$|Veteran Disney Channel writers Schooley and McCorkle were {{recruited}} by the network to develop an animated series that could attract both younger and older audiences, and conceived Kim Possible as a show about a talented action heroine and her less competent sidekick. Inspired by the scarcity of female-led animated series at the time, the episodes, {{some of which are}} based on the creators' own high school experiences, combine elements of action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy to appeal to both girls and boys, while parodying the James Bond franchise, spy and superhero films, and teen sitcoms. Distinct from other Disney Channel shows in its use of self-referential humor, Schooley and McCorkle developed fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue to cater to adult viewers. Set in fictional Middleton, USA, the show's setting and locations exhibit a retro-influenced aesthetic. With a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> modern-day technology and the Internet, the series also explores themes such as feminism, girl power and relationships, and receives heavy comparisons to other female-driven action shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Alias and The Powerpuff Girls.|$|E

5|$|The Final Fantasy {{series and}} several {{specific}} games within {{it have been}} credited for introducing and popularizing many concepts that are today widely used in console RPGs. The original title is often cited {{as one of the}} most influential early console RPGs, and played a major role in legitimizing and popularizing the genre. Many console RPGs featured one-on-one battles against monsters from a first-person perspective. Final Fantasy introduced a side view perspective with groups of monsters against a group of characters that has been frequently used. It also introduced an early evolving class change system, as well as different methods of transportation, including a ship, canoe, and flying airship. Final FantasyII was the first sequel in the industry to omit characters and locations from the previous title. It also introduced an activity-based progression system, which has been used in later RPG series such as SaGa, Grandia, and The Elder Scrolls. Final Fantasy III introduced the job system, a character progression engine allowing the player to change character classes, as well as acquire new and advanced classes and combine class abilities, at any time during the game. Final Fantasy IV is considered a milestone for the genre, introducing a dramatic storyline with a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> character development and personal relationships. Final FantasyVII is credited as having the largest industry impact of the series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In, {{located on}} Commissary Lane across from Star Tours and {{adjacent}} to ABC Commissary, opened on April 20, 1991 {{as one of}} the twenty new attractions opened at Walt Disney World to mark the complex's twentieth anniversary. The restaurant was created with a <b>strong</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> theme, in emulation of the 50's Prime Time Café, which had opened two years prior. Disney hoped that the focus on theme would bring the Sci-Fi Dine-In the level of success that had been garnered by the 50's Prime Time Café. Within five weeks of opening, it was serving between 1,500 and 2,000 meals on a daily basis, just as the 50's Prime Time Café was doing. A year after opening, the Sci-Fi Dine-In had become the most popular restaurant in the park, serving more than 2,200 people per day at peak periods. Starting from its earliest days, the restaurant equipped its servers with point of sale mobile devices that relayed orders to a printer in the kitchen, which was considered at the time to be in keeping with the science fiction theme because the technology had been developed shortly prior.|$|E
