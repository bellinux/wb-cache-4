40|$|Objective To {{characterize}} hereditary {{retinal degeneration}} in the Abyssinian cat (rdAc) in a recently established closed colony segregating for the rdAc mutation, and evaluate possible {{differences in the}} age of onset and progression of disease phenotype since the initial description of rdAc 25 years ago. The sample size of an earlier study was increased {{in order to determine the}} allele frequency in Abyssinian and <b>Somali</b> <b>cats</b> on a worldwide basis. Animals studied Twenty rdAc affected cats from the closed animal facility, 87 Abyssinian and <b>Somali</b> <b>cats</b> for study of genotype-phenotype concordance, and DNA from 131 Abyssinian and <b>Somali</b> <b>cats</b> from Scandinavia, the UK and Australia for evaluation of the rdAc allele frequency. Procedures DNA was extracted from blood and buccal swabs using commercially available kits, followed by genotyping. Ophthalmic examinations were performed in the USA and Sweden by two board-certified veterinary ophthalmologists. Results A greater variation {{in the age of}} onset and progression of the disease was observed compared to that previously described. An excellent correlation between genotype and phenotype was observed. A population genetic survey revealed that the rdAc allele is in moderate abundance in the Abyssinian breed in Europe and Australia. Surprisingly, homozygosity for the mutant allele was observed in a Siamese cat with ophthalmoscopic findings similar to those originally described for affected rdAc individuals. Conclusions Alertness to the potential of rdAc is needed on the part of the veterinary ophthalmology community, not only in Abyssinian and <b>Somali</b> <b>cats</b> but possibly also in other related cat breeds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					 					Erythrocyte {{pyruvate}} kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) is an inherited hemolytic anemia that has been documented in the Abyssinian and Somali breeds as well as random bred domestic shorthair cats. The disease results from mutations in PKLR, the gene encoding the regulatory glycolytic enzyme {{pyruvate kinase}} (PK). Multiple isozymes are produced by tissue-specific differential processing of PKLR mRNA. Perturbation of PK decreases erythrocyte longevity resulting in anemia. Additional signs include: severe lethargy, weakness, weight loss, jaundice, and abdominal enlargement. In domestic cats, PK deficiency has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance with high variability in onset and severity of clinical symptoms. 				 				 					 						Results 					 					Sequence analysis of PKLR revealed an intron 5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 304 concordant with the disease phenotype in Abyssinian and <b>Somali</b> <b>cats.</b> Located 53 nucleotides upstream of the exon 6 splice site, cats with this SNP produce liver and blood processed mRNA with a 13 bp deletion at the 3 &# 8217; end of exon 5. The frame-shift mutation creates a stop codon at amino acid position 248 in exon 6. The frequency of the intronic SNP in 14, 179 American and European cats representing 38 breeds, 76 western random bred cats and 111 cats of unknown breed is 6. 31 % and 9. 35 % when restricted to the 15 groups carrying the concordant SNP. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					 					PK testing is recommended for Bengals, Egyptian Maus, La Perms, Maine Coon cats, Norwegian Forest cats, Savannahs, Siberians, and Singapuras, in addition to Abyssinians and Somalis as well an any new breeds using the afore mentioned breeds in out crossing or development programs...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Somali</b> <b>cat</b> {{is often}} {{described}} as a long-haired Abyssinian. The first Somali cats appeared in the litters of Abyssinians as long-haired kittens. The Somali is a product of a recessive gene in Abyssinian cats, though how the gene was introduced into the Abyssinian gene pool is still a mystery.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, the {{association}} recognised the <b>Somali</b> <b>cat,</b> {{as well as}} the lilac and chocolate colours of the Persian cat. In 1984, the AFC adopted the standards set by the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFé). The Balinese cat was recognised in 1985. In 1986, the ACF began to distance itself from the FIFé, and would not return until 1988. 1986 also saw an important modification in the Exotic Shorthair standard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Somali</b> <b>cat</b> {{is usually}} healthy, with few breed-related health issues, though some {{problems}} may occur. These include gingivitis, tooth decay, and renal amyloidosis, {{which are also}} seen in many other breeds of cats. Renal amyloidosis (often called RA) is {{a condition in which}} there is a deposition of the protein, amyloid, in various tissues which hinders that part of the body's normal functioning. Other problems that are prevalent in most cat breeds, the Somali included, are feline infectious anemia (FIA) and autoimmune-mediated hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Some AIHA-related diseases are inherited erythrocyte disorders, such as pyruvate kinase deficiency and osmotic fragility.|$|E
40|$|In humans, PK {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common hereditary forms of haemolytic anaemia caused by an enzymopathy. PK deficiency has also been described in several canine breeds. In 1992, the first case of feline PK deficiency has been described in the United States in an Abyssinian male cat and in 2002 the first case was described in Germany. Since then, the disease was identified in other Abyssinians, Somalis, and a few domestic shorthair cats. Since only limited clinical data has been published until now, the objective of this study was to evaluate clinical signs, laboratory parameters, and the progression of the disease in PK deficient cats. Moreover the prevalence of PK deficiency in Germany and other European countries should be evaluated. The progression of the disease in affected cats was evaluated with a questionnaire and all available laboratory parameters were analysed. PK DNA test results of 503 <b>Somali</b> and Abyssinian <b>cats</b> from Germany and other European countries were available. 7. 5 % were homozygous affected, 23. 3 % were heterozygous carriers, and 69. 2 % had no mutation of the PK allele. Affected cats were identified in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and the Netherlands. The distribution of affected cats, carriers and healthy cats was similar in both breeds and showed no remarkable difference between males and females. The progression of the disease of 26 PK deficient cats could be followed over a time of 0. 8 to 11. 3 years (median 4. 2). In 11 cats, the owners did not notice any signs of disease up to an age of 0. 8 to 7. 8 years (median 4. 4). 15 cats started displaying various clinical signs at ages ranging from 0. 1 to 5 years (median 1. 7). The clinical signs included lethargy, diarrhoea, pale mucous membranes, and icterus. Four owners observed a relationship between stressful situations and the appearance of clinical signs. A haematological examination was performed for 22 PK deficient cats and the CBC revealed anaemia with PCV values of 0. 13 - 0. 31 l/l (median 0. 28) in 16 cats. In 12 cats, the owners noticed no signs of disease and 4 cats were clinically healthy despite PCV values of 0. 25 – 0. 29 l/l. In 5 of 14 cats with follow-up examinations the PCV was below the reference range in every sample, 6 other cats had periods with normal PCV values as well as periods with PCV values below the reference range and 3 cats did not display anaemia at any time and had a stable PCV over a time period of 1, 2. 9, and 3. 8 years. The absolute number of aggregated reticulocytes was increased in 95 % of the cats. In contrast to cats suffering from the disease “Increased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes”, the mean erythrocytic osmotic fragility of most cats suffering from PK deficiency was within the reference range. Therefore, the osmotic fragility test can be useful to differentiate between these two diseases. 44 % of the cats displayed mild to severe hyperbilirubinaemia and in another 44 % at least one liver enzyme was increased. Hyperglobulinaemia was present in 88 % of the cats. 13 of 30 affected cats died or were euthanised at ages ranging from 1. 3 – 11. 3 years (median 4. 8), the others were alive until to an age of 0. 8 – 7. 8 years (median 4. 3). Nine of 15 cats with clinical signs were treated by different veterinarians, 6 of them with prednisolon. In 5 of these 6 cats a transient or partial effect was observed, but the number of treated cats did not warrant any conclusions. One cat did develop a severe haemolytic crisis and required a transfusion. For 3 cats a histopathologic examination was performed. Next to haemosiderosis and extramedullary haematopoesis, a cirrhosis caused by severe iron deposits could be shown in one cat. Based upon this survey, the mutant PK allele appears to occur frequently in Somalis and Abyssinians from Germany and other European countries. Since PK deficiency can be asymptomatic in regard to clinical and laboratory parameters for a long time, DNA analysis in Abyssinian and <b>Somali</b> <b>cats</b> before use for breeding is strongly recommended. Carriers and affected cats should be excluded from breeding to eliminate this disease. Should carriers be used because of breeding aspects they should paired only with healthy cats...|$|R
