5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's <b>Supper</b> is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the <b>Supper</b> serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The <b>Supper</b> is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The <b>Supper</b> is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The <b>Supper</b> is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{doctrine}} of the Lord's <b>Supper</b> became a point of controversy between American Reformed theologians John Williamson Nevin and Charles Hodge. Nevin, influenced by German Lutheran Isaak August Dorner, wrote that through the Lord's <b>Supper,</b> Christians are mystically united to Christ's whole person, and that this union is through Christ's flesh. Hodge thought that Nevin overemphasized the idea of mystical union, and argued that when Christians are said to commune with Christ in the <b>Supper,</b> it is Christ's virtue as a sacrifice for their sins which is meant rather than a mystical union with his flesh. Hodge also taught that nothing is communicated in the Lord's <b>Supper</b> which is not communicated in the preaching of God's word. American Presbyterians generally agreed with Hodge. Nineteenth-century Reformed Congregationalist followers of the New England theology generally held a symbolic, memorial view of the <b>Supper.</b>|$|E
5|$|John Calvin, a very {{influential}} early Reformed theologian, believed the Lord's <b>Supper</b> fed Christians with the spiritual food of union with Christ. He believed {{that in the}} <b>Supper</b> Christians feed on Christ's flesh, which he saw as an inexplicable miracle. Calvin taught that the <b>Supper</b> confirms the promises communicated to Christians in the preaching of the gospel. He also saw its purpose as provoking praise for God and love for other people. He believed it necessary for Christians to partake of Christ's humanity in the <b>Supper</b> {{as well as his}} Spirit, and that the bread and wine really present, rather than simply symbolize or represent, Christ's body and blood. Calvin spoke of the communication involved in the Lord's <b>Supper</b> as spiritual, meaning that it originates in the Holy Spirit. Calvin's teaching on the Lord's <b>Supper</b> was followed by many others in the Reformed tradition, including Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli. Calvin, like Zwingli and against Luther, did not believe that Christ is bodily present in the elements of the Eucharist. He taught that Christ remains in heaven and that we commune with him in the Lord's <b>Supper</b> by being raised up to him rather than him descending to us. Calvin believed the elements of the <b>Supper</b> to be used by God as instruments in communicating the promises which they represent, a view called symbolic instrumentalism.|$|E

The originals of Four Times of the Day were sold to other collectors, but the scenes were reproduced at Vauxhall by Francis Hayman, and two of them, Evening and Night, hung at the pleasure gardens until at least 1782.|$|E

5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} {{statements of the}} beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the <b>Supper.</b> They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the <b>Supper,</b> while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E
