50|$|A ''''''sell/buy back'''''' is the <b>spot</b> <b>sale</b> and {{a forward}} {{repurchase}} of a security. It is two distinct outright cash market trades, one for forward settlement. The forward price is set {{relative to the}} spot price to yield a market rate of return. The basic motivation of sell/buy backs is generally {{the same as for}} a classic repo, i.e. attempting to benefit from the lower financing rates generally available for collateralized as opposed to non-secured borrowing. The economics of the transaction are also similar with the interest on the cash borrowed through the sell/buy back being implicit in the difference between the sale price and the purchase price.|$|E
40|$|As more buyers become {{interested}} in the spot purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the share of spot trade in LNG business increases. This means that the cash flowing into the upstream of LNG projects {{is a combination of}} that generated by deliveries to long-term contract (LTC) customers and uncommitted product and arbitrage <b>spot</b> <b>sales.</b> LTC cash flows are more predictable while uncommitted product and arbitrage cash flows, affected by the dynamics of supply and demand, are more volatile and therefore less predictable. In this research, we formulate an inventory routing problem (IRP) which maximizes the profit of an LNG producer with respect to uncommitted product and arbitrage <b>spot</b> <b>sales,</b> and also LTC deliveries at an operational level. Using the model, the importance of arbitrage, interest rates and compounding frequency in profit maximization, and also the significance of interest rates and fluctuation in spot prices in decision-making for <b>spot</b> <b>sales</b> of uncommitted product are studied. It is proven that writing traditional LTCs with relaxed destination clauses which assist in arbitrage is beneficial to the LNG producer. However, in contrast to what was predicted neither the interest rate nor the compounding frequency has any importance in profit maximization when no change of selling strategy is observed. Apart from these, it is shown that there is a trade-off between the expectation of higher spot prices and the inventory and shipping costs in decision-making for <b>spot</b> <b>sales</b> of uncommitted product in the LNG industry. Finally, it is observed that the interest rate can affect the set of decisions on <b>spot</b> <b>sales</b> of uncommitted product, although the importance of such changes in profit remains to be further explored.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) in global gas trade has grown steadily over the past decades; the article focuses on this significant form of energy and provides an exhaustive portrait of its trade. LNG trade flows both regionally and by country are described {{and the future of}} trade is forecast. Next, the business structure is discussed. The traditional LNG trade on long-term contracts (LTCs) is considered and it is explained how vital these contracts are in distributing the volume and price risks in the industry, furthermore, in securing finance for the LNG projects. The essence of gas market liberalization and its effect on LTCs is considered and it is shown that in liberalized gas markets, risk has migrated to upstream. In the light of this risk redistribution, the suppliers’ intent in moving toward vertical integration of the industry is discussed. Later, various types of LNG <b>spot</b> <b>sale</b> in arbitrage, and for uncommitted product to LTCs, are considered and the biggest <b>spot</b> <b>sale</b> markets are identified. Finally, pricing of LNG for different markets in both LTCs and spot sales is discussed and it is forecast that due to the surge of supply, rather than any change in oil prices, LNG prices are anticipated to decrease globally at least for the next 5 years...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impacts a presale {{contract}} has on a developer’s pricing and production decisions in a game-theoretical framework. In {{an environment where}} developers have full capital market access, we find that both developers and buyers are indifferent between a presale and a <b>spot</b> <b>sale</b> method. This is true because a developer will adjust the presale price {{to compensate for the}} option value he gives to the buyer. However, in an environment with financing constraints, both developers and buyers are better off when a presale method is used. This is the case because the presale method solves the financing constraint by injecting equity into the development and, hence, reducing financing costs. The latter benefit can then be shared by both developers and buyers. Also, the additional equity the developers receive makes it more feasible for them to increase the size of their developments. This model prediction seems to describe well the real world situations seen in some of the property markets in Asia with nascent financial systems. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) is rising as demand for it grows rapidly and steadily due to growth in energy demand, {{the transition to a}} low carbon economy and the longer distances over which natural gas is now traded. Given its importance, this work proposes an optimization model that assists to decide on when and where LNG should be delivered by coordinating tanker type, assignment and routing, inventory management, contract obligations, arbitrage and uncommitted LNG. The model maximizes the profit mainly by taking advantage of price differences between different markets. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, following the analysis of expenses and revenues, a new mixed integer programming model for LNG liquefaction and shipping is proposed from a corporate finance perspective. Furthermore, a solution approach for it is implemented and tested. Second, the model is used to derive a short term trade policy for the Middle Eastern LNG producers regarding the <b>spot</b> <b>sale</b> of their uncommitted product to Japan or to the UK, namely to: dispatch to whichever market has the higher current spot price, regardless of the variability of the transport expenses...|$|E

40|$|Sales and {{distribution}} innovations have increased productivity in the salmon aquaculture industry. In this article, we investigate {{the use of}} fixed price contracts for Norwegian salmon exports to France based on all export transactions between the two countries. Our analysis shows that almost 25 % of these exports were traded using fixed price contracts and contract prices were renegotiated at different intervals, including as infrequently as once a year. Some contracts allow the contracting parties to adjust contract prices when the export price moves significantly. Benchmark analysis, which shows a marginal 0. 5 % difference between average unit revenue for the year from <b>spot</b> <b>sales</b> relative to contract sales, indicates that contracts primarily change revenue time profiles. The use of contracts creates a wedge between salmon export prices and spot prices in periods of price volatility, which in turn reduces price transmission.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} power sector model in any country is to allocate different sources of risks among different agents (generators, traders and consumers) {{through a set of}} (market) rules such that the tariff for the final consumer is the least possible. Two alternatives for selling the electricity are usually available for generators: <b>spot</b> and contract <b>sales.</b> Each one presents opportunities and risks. For example, contract sales are good mechanisms to mitigate energy spot prices volatilities. But contract sales can also bring hydrological risks for hydro generators, associated with the inability to deliver the contracted amount during the dry periods. The objective is then to devise a competitive pricing strategy that is sufficient to remunerate investment, cover operating costs and hedge the project against the different sources of risks. For <b>spot</b> <b>sales,</b> the challenge is to verify if forecasted energy spot prices can recover investment and operational costs. Risks may be understood as the uncertainties associated with project returns caused by hydrology, market prices, costs overruns, construction delays, fuel prices, and others. A proper assessment of the diverse types of risks associated to the project is extremely important when managing their economical impacts by the investors. An interesting aspect is the relative effect of the risks among the projects when analyzing investment alternatives.

40|$|By {{the end of}} 2004, {{there were}} over sixty {{proposals}} for new LNG facilities at both the producing and importing ends of the operation. Since the mid 1990 s, the costs of every step in the LNG chain have dropped substantially and today are considerably below those of domestic pipeline gas in Europe, China, and the United States. This paper examines the causes of these cost reductions and examines how the LNG industry is likely to evolve. It also explores the national security implications of the projected volume of natural gas traded {{in the form of}} LNG. The paper concludes that the financial risks inherent in the investments to liquefy, ship, and regasify LNG will force companies to continue to rely heavily on contracts, as opposed to relying on <b>spot</b> <b>sales,</b> and will advantage the larger private multinational companies. Security concerns will increase as China and the United States dramatically increase their imports of LNG, but security risks will remain less than those for oil and, as demonstrated by the Japanese experience, are manageable. ...|$|R

40|$|Developers often conduct forward sales (or presales) before {{building}} completion to relieve financial risk and burden. However, there are worries that housing units sold {{in this way}} {{will turn out to}} be substandard because developers, who have been paid for the unfinished units, may have incentives to cut costs by lowering the quality.

We first test for settlement effects, ie pure time-value explanations, and found that these are theoretically small and empirically almost undetectable, despite the potentially high power of our tests. Experimenting six arbitrage trading rules to seek for an explanation of what else might behind the price diferences, we found a clue in the autocorrelation of the premiums: positive premiums tent to persist while negative ones do not. The persistence is too weak to allow profitable low-risk `arb' trading, but the pattern still suggests that there is a `cash is king' effect: sellers tend to prefer <b>spot</b> <b>sales,</b> and buyers tend to go for forward purchases. This is consistent with the idea that the cost of financing consists of not just pure time value but also of a fixed shadow cost (re ecting the hassle and delays caused by raising cash), and that this cost is larger and arises more often and more persistently than the hassle costs of shorting stocks. status: publishe...|$|R
