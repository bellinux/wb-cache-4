2500|$|Fluorescent lamps using a {{magnetic}} power line frequency ballast {{do not give}} out a steady light; instead, they flicker at twice the supply frequency. This results in fluctuations not only with light output but color temperature as well, which may pose problems for photography {{and people who are}} sensitive to the flicker. Even among persons not sensitive to light flicker, a stroboscopic effect can be noticed, where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp. This effect is eliminated by paired lamps operating on a lead-lag ballast. Unlike a true <b>strobe</b> <b>lamp,</b> the light level drops in appreciable time and so substantial [...] "blurring" [...] of the moving part would be evident.|$|E

In the latter case, a warning siren and <b>strobe</b> <b>lamp</b> will first be activated {{for a few seconds}} to warn personnel to evacuate the area. The rapid discharge of halon and consequent rapid cooling fills the air with fog, and is accompanied by a loud, disorienting noise.|$|E

40|$|Vehicle mounted warning beacons have {{developed}} from flashing tungsten filament bulbs through constant luminance bulbs with rotating reflectors to multiple, high intensity, <b>strobe</b> <b>lamps</b> with various phase options. Warning beacons are {{used on a}} number of types of vehicles, each undertaking its own range of tasks, to either alert other road users of their presence or warn of potential danger. With the wider use of flashing beacons, not just on vehicles but also for road works, it is necessary to review the current safety requirements and the regulations covering their use. Whilst this study has a broad ranging remit, of particular concern is the conspicuity of vehicles fitted with amber warning beacons (e. g. recovery vehicles) when they are in environments where other flashing amber lights are present...|$|R
40|$|The {{baseline}} {{avionics system}} features a central digital computer that integrates {{the functions of}} all the space tug subsystems {{by means of a}} redundant digital data bus. The central computer consists of dual central processor units, dual input/output processors, and a fault tolerant memory, utilizing internal redundancy and error checking. Three electronically steerable phased arrays provide downlink transmission from any tug attitude directly to ground or via TDRS. Six laser gyros and six accelerometers in a dodecahedron configuration make up the inertial measurement unit. Both a scanning laser radar and a TV system, employing <b>strobe</b> <b>lamps,</b> are required as acquisition and docking sensors. Primary dc power at a nominal 28 volts is supplied from dual lightweight, thermally integrated fuel cells which operate from propellant grade reactants out of the main tanks...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} {{flight test}} of two electro-optical pilot warning indicators, using a flashing xenon strobe and silicon detectors as cooperative elements, pointed out several design deficiencies. The present laboratory evaluation program corrected these faults and calibrated {{the sensitivity of}} both systems in azimuth elevation and range. The laboratory tests were performed on an optical bench and consisted of three basic components: (1) a xenon <b>strobe</b> <b>lamp</b> whose output is monitored at the indicator detector to give pulse to pulse information on energy content at the receiver; (2) a strobe light attenuating optical system which is calibrated photometrically to provide simulated range; and (3) a positioning table on which the indicator system under study is mounted and which provides spatial location coordinates for all data points. The test results for both systems are tabulated...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of a radio beacon position locator {{during and after the}} remotely controlled transport aircraft is discussed. The radio beacon transmission was actuated and was picked up by the Navy P- 3 A chase aircraft for a short time, after which reception was lost. The pilot reported that he received a signal on both 121. 5 MHz and 243 MHz for a period of approximately 5 seconds. Five minutes after the crash a portable direction finding unit located {{on the roof of the}} NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, 4 miles distant from the crash, was unable to pick up the beacon transmission. The fire crews started fighting the fires approximately 90 seconds after the time of impact. Navy personnel access to the crash site was allowed on the morning of December 2, 1984. Radio beacon locator was found resting top side up, 15 feet forward and 13 feet perpendicular from the tray location the starboard side of the aircraft. An immediate inspection indicated the airfoil suffered moderate fire damage with paint peeling but not intumescing. The visual marker <b>strobe</b> <b>lamp</b> housings were intact but extensively burned such that it was impossible to see if the lamps had survived. The airfoil suffered minor structural damage, with assorted dents, etc. The extended plunger on the ARU- 21 release unit indicated that the pyrotechnic deployment system operated. The radio beacon base (tray) suffered some heat and fire damage, and was charred and blackened by smoke. The frangible switch in the nose survived and the switch in the belly was recovered and found to have actuated. It is assumed that this switch fired the ARU- 21 squib. There were no other release switches installed in the normally open system in the aircraft...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{studying}} {{the breakup of}} swirling liquid sheets discharging from the outer orifice of gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Such atomizers are considered as propellant injection systems for semi-cryogenic liquid rocket engines. A gas centered swirl coaxial type atomizer discharges an annular swirling liquid sheet which is atomized by a gaseous jet issuing from the central orifice of the atomizer. The primary objectives of this work were to understand the fluid dynamic interaction process between the outer liquid sheet and the central gas jet and its role on the breakup process of the liquid sheet. Cold flow experiments were carried out by constructing custom made gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Two different atomizer configurations with varying swirl effect were studied. The jets were injected into ambient atmospheric air medium with tap water and air as experimental fluids. The flow conditions were {{described in terms of}} Weber number (Wel) and Reynolds number (Reg) for liquid sheet and the air jet respectively. Spray images were captured by employing an image acquisition system comprising a high resolution digital camera and a <b>strobe</b> <b>lamp.</b> The captured spray images at different combinations of Wel and Reg were analyzed to extract quantitative measurements of breakup length (Lb), spray cone angle (Î¸s), spray width (SW) and two-dimensional surface profile of liquid sheets. Quantitative analysis of the variation of Lb with Reg with different values of Wel suggested that low inertia liquid sheets undergo an efficient breakup process. High inertia liquid sheets ignore the presence of central air jet at lower values of Reg however undergo air jet breakup at higher values of Reg. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations revealed that the entrainment process, established between the inner surface of the liquid sheet and the boundary of central jet, triggers the air assisted sheet breakup by drawing the liquid sheet closer to the spray axis. The entrainment process may be developing corrugations on the surface of liquid sheet which promotes the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the liquid sheet, quantified by means of tortuosity of liquid sheet profile, increases with increasing Reg. Limited studies on the effect of variation swirl intensity on the air assisted breakup process of liquid sheets did not show any significant influence for the atomizers examined in the present work...|$|E
