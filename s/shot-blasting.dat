Survival analysis at {{five to ten years}} showed better results in the HA-coated (100 % at five to six years) and cemented stems (100 % at 5 to 6 years) than in the two press-fit groups. There was a higher mean rate of migration in the smooth and ridged Ti-Al-V <b>shot-blasted</b> press-fit groups (0. 8 mm/year and 0. 6 mm/year, respectively) when compared with the HA-coated and cemented prostheses (both 0. 3 mm/year). More radiolucent lines and osteolytic lesions were seen in the press-fit groups than in either the HA-coated or cemented implants, with a trend for a lower incidence of both in the HA compared with the cemented group. Proximal osteopenia increased in the press-fit and cemented prostheses with time, but did not do so in the HA group. There was a higher incidence of resorption of the femoral neck with time in the cemented group than in the other three.

The present study aims to further investigate the influence of femoral stem surface finish on the apparent static shear strength at the stem–cement interface {{through a series of}} pull out tests, where stainless steel rods are employed to represent the femoral stem. The results demonstrated that there was a general tendency for the apparent static shear strength to be increased with the rise of surface roughness. The polished and glass bead-blasted rods illustrated a slip-stick-slip failure whereas the <b>shot-blasted</b> and grit-blasted rods displayed gross interface failure. Following pull out test, cement transfer films were detected on the polished rods, and there was cement debris adhered {{to the surface of the}} grit-blasted rods. Micropores, typically 120 μm in diameter, were prevalent in the cement surface interfaced with the polished rods, and the cement surfaces in contact with the <b>shot-blasted</b> and grit-blasted rods were greatly damaged. There was also evidence of metal debris embedding within the cement mantle originating from the tests of the grit-blasted rods, indicating an extremely strong mechanical interlocking at the interface.

30|$|The working {{conditions}} of the shearer walk gear are harsh, thus the shearer walk gear {{is one of the}} weakest parts in the shearer. In order to improve its work life, the electro-slag remelted steel material 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WE was used to make the shearer walk gear. The electro-slag remelting greatly reduces the harmful content of non-metallic materials (these ingredients are the causes of quenching crack and fatigue crack), increases the purity of materials, and maximizes material performance. As the gear modulus was large and there was no standard hob, the gear tooth was machined twice, the first machining cut using NC wire cutting, leaving 2 – 3  mm allowance. The second machining was precisely machined to its place using a processing center. In particular, in the last processes, the amount of feed and cutting speed should be strictly controlled to avoid obvious cutting marks (machining marks are the stress concentration source of gear’s tooth; currently fracturing of the shearer walk gear is often caused by these marks). To reduce the gear tooth’s early failure due to stress concentration, it should be treated by <b>shot-blast</b> after heat treatment.|$|R

Most commercial dental implants offer a <b>shot-blasted</b> rough surface. It is also known that apatite layers coating the surface of titanium implants improve bone response, but the adhesion of the layer to the substrate poses some problems. In this study the roughness and adhesion strength to a titanium dental implant surface of an apatite layer deposited via wet chemistry after a thermochemical treatment were {{compared with those of}} plasma-sprayed apatite layers and machined titanium surfaces.

The morphology and roughness of the samples were measured and compared. The adhesion of the apatite layers to the titanium was compared by means of a scratch test. Measured roughness showed that the deposition of an apatite layer did not affect roughness but plasmasprayed apatite produced a decrease on roughness values when compared to control samples.

40|$|Dental implant {{failure is}} {{commonly}} associated to dental plaque formation. This problem starts with bacterial colonization on implant surface upon implantation.

However the effects on bacterial adhesion on that sort of surfaces have not been elucidated at all. A methodological procedure to test bacterial adherence to titanium shot-blasted surfaces (alumina and silicon carbide) by quantifying bacterial detached cells per area unit, was performed. In parallel, the surface properties of samples (i. e., roughness and surface energy), were analyzed in order to assess the relationship between surface treatment and bacterial adhesion.

The defect retention of AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel, in relation to comparable austenitic grades, means that conventional mechanical scale-breaking techniques such as <b>shot-blasting</b> can leave unacceptable levels of damage in the metal surface. Although this can often be masked by high apparent surface quality in the intermediate sheet, final forming can reveal serious defects. Division of the aspects of roll-breaking into bend and tension elements led to two areas of laboratory investigation. Bend tests showed the effects of strain on both convex and concave surfaces, and suggested a mechanism for oxide failure. Tension tests illustrated that the failure mechanisms apply over the same range of strain, regardless of the loading state.

30|$|Metal {{stamping}} character (MSC) {{automatic identification}} technology {{plays an important}} role in industrial automation. To improve the accuracy and stability of segmentation and recognition for MSCs, an algorithm based on multi-directional illumination image fusion technology is proposed. First, four grayscale images are taken with four bar-shape directional light sources from different directions. Next, based on the difference in surface grayscale characteristics for the different illumination directions of the surface’s stamped depression regions and flat regions, the image background is extracted and eliminated. Second, the images are fused using the difference processing on the images in the two groups of relative illuminant directions. Third, mean filter, binarization, and morphological closing operations are performed on the fused image to locate and segment the character string in the image, and the characters are normalized by correcting the skew of the segmented character string. Finally, histogram of oriented gradient features and a backpropagation neural network algorithm are employed to identify the normalized characters. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively eliminate the interference of factors such as oil stains, rust, oxide, <b>shot-blasting</b> pits, and different background colors and enhance the contrast between MSCs and background. The resulting character recognition rate can reach 99.6 %.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{experimental}} results are studied {{to determine the}} factors (including those not previously identified) affecting the strength of grouted connections. The current bond strength formula is evaluated and its limitations noted. Previous analytical work is examined and strengths and weaknesses investigated. A nonlinear finite element analysis is developed using a friction gap element to model the steel/grout bond. This includes a dilation effect when slip occurs and successfully simulates the behaviour of plain pipe connections up to ultimate load. An elastic-plastic, work-hardening, cracking and crushing constitutive model is developed to represent the behaviour of grout material. This is used for a detailed finite element analysis of the load-slip behaviour of individual shear keys of various shapes. The friction-gap element is adapted to give {{a representation of the}} shear keys using data derived from the detailed shear key analysis. A confinement factor is used to give higher ultimate shear key loads when the bond opening is small. This accounts for the observed fact that higher key loads are achieved with increased sleeve and pile dimensions due to greater confinement of the grout. Load-slip behaviour and strains up to ultimate load for shear keyed connections are successfully simulated using the friction-gap element. Bond stress distributions show that high normal bond stress concentrations are necessary to balance the bending moments in the grout annulus. Various extreme geometries are analysed and their failure modes determined. The effects of connection length, stiffeners, alternative loading arrangements, scale and shear key geometry are also fully investigated. Results are used to produce a new bond strength formula which takes into account most factors affecting bond strength and is stle to give good results over the full rang of geometries.

40|$|In the {{development}} and production of industrial parts, both the macroscopic shape and the microstructure of the parts surface on a µm-scale strongly influence the parts properties. For instance, a surface in frictional contact should be structured {{in a way to}} reduce the expected wear by optimizing its lubrication properties. A gasket surface must not be too rough to prevent leakage, etc. The measurement of surface roughness started a few decades ago with the advent of tactile profilometers. These drag a stylus along a line over the surface and record the vertical deflection of the stylus as it moves over the surface, thus recording the height of the surface at the sampling points. Modern measurement techniques make it possible to acquire a complete three-dimensional height map of the surfaces. Obviously, the techniques for analysing two-dimensional profiles are not adequate for the analysis of three-dimensional height maps. Although many propositions for 3 D-analysis have been made, these often lack a sound theoretical background. Hence, their understanding is limited and only a few are used regularly, resulting in an inadequate surface descrip- tion. A simple but powerful approach is to use the Minkowski functionals of the excursion sets of the data to charactarize the surface structure. These func- tionals can be interpreted in different ways depending on the model for the surface. Two models seem especially suited for technical surfaces: Random fields for surfaces with no obvious structure, e. g. <b>shot-blasted</b> surfaces and Boolean grain models for surfaces consisting of smaller structuring elements, e. g. sintered materials. In this thesis, a complete framework for the analysis of three-dimensional surface data using the Minkowski functionals is developed. This novel ap- proach allows for a stepwise data reduction: A complex data set is first reduced to three characterizing functions, from which further parameters can be derived. Due to a novel fast and accurate estimator for the characterizing functions, this technique is also suitable for time-critical tasks like the application in production automation...|$|R
