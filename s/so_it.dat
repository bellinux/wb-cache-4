The Incredible Hulk and Dragon Challenge, both at Universal's Islands of Adventure, were closed in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Hulk was scrapped <b>so</b> <b>it</b> could be rebuilt completely in 2016 and Dragon Challenge will be dismantled <b>so</b> <b>it</b> {{can be replaced}} by an unknown coaster in 2019. Lightning at Kuwait Entertainment City is currently closed due to its park being closed for a refurbishment. Some have been relocated and renamed.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} {{to have a sense}} of unpredictability <b>so</b> <b>it</b> can be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, {{was designed to}} be simple <b>so</b> <b>it</b> would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E
