5|$|The THSR 700T {{trainset}} {{is based}} on the 700 Series <b>Shinkansen</b> trainset used by JR Central and JR West in Japan. This marked the first time <b>Shinkansen</b> technology was exported to a foreign country. Customization was focused on adapting to Taiwan's climate and geography, and the nose shape was optimized for tunnels wider than those in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Japan has 20 World Heritage Sites, {{including}} Himeji Castle, Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto and Nara. Popular {{tourist attractions}} include Tokyo and Hiroshima, Mount Fuji, ski resorts such as Niseko in Hokkaido, Okinawa, riding the <b>shinkansen</b> and {{taking advantage of}} Japan's hotel and hotspring network.|$|E
5|$|The {{bidding process}} pitted Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium (THSRC) against the Chunghwa High Speed Rail Consortium (CHSRC). THSRC's bid {{was based on}} the {{high-speed}} technology platform of Eurotrain, a joint venture between GEC-Alsthom, the main maker of the French TGV, and Siemens, the main maker of the German ICE, while CHSRC's bid was based on Japanese <b>Shinkansen</b> technology supplied by Taiwan <b>Shinkansen</b> Consortium (TSC), a joint venture of Japanese companies. THSRC, which submitted the lower bid and promised to build the line with zero net cost from the government, was chosen as preferred bidder in September 1997. The group was renamed and formally established as the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC) in May 1998. THSRC and the government signed the BOT agreement on 23 July 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the diversion channel has resulted in marsh fields drying on the Niigata plain which allows for greater production. Likewise, drier land has also allowed for the {{construction of}} infrastructure such as expressways and the <b>Shinkansen</b> express-train network, to support a greater population in the area.|$|E
5|$|Candidates for {{the lower}} house must be 25 years old or older and 30 years or older for the upper house. All {{candidates}} must be Japanese nationals. Under Article 49 of Japan's Constitution, Diet members are paid about ¥1.3million a month in salary. Each lawmaker is entitled to employ three secretaries with taxpayer funds, free <b>Shinkansen</b> tickets, and four round-trip airplane tickets a month {{to enable them to}} travel back and forth to their home districts.|$|E
5|$|Since {{privatisation}} in 1987, {{dozens of}} Japanese railway companies compete in {{regional and local}} passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed <b>Shinkansen</b> trains connect major cities and Japanese trains {{are known for their}} safety and punctuality. Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo and Osaka are at an advanced stage.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan High Speed Rail (abbreviated THSR or HSR) is a {{high-speed}} rail line that runs approximately , {{along the west}} coast of Taiwan, from the national capital Taipei to the southern city of Kaohsiung. With construction managed by a private company, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC), which also operates the line, the total cost of the project was US$18billion. At the time it was built, {{this was one of the}} world's largest privately funded rail construction schemes. The system is based primarily on Japan's <b>Shinkansen</b> technology.|$|E
5|$|However, {{controversy}} arose during rolling-stock selection. In May 1999, as THSRC faced {{difficulties in}} raising capital, {{the government of}} Japan promised soft loans if THSRC switched to TSC. Although Eurotrain promised to match TSC's financial offerings, the Eschede train disaster in combination with TSC offered the newer 700 Series <b>Shinkansen,</b> convinced THSRC to reopen core system bid, and ultimately resulting in TSC selected as the preferred rolling-stock supplier in December 1999. Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay a compensation for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for unjust enrichment. THSRC agreed to pay US$65 million (US$89 million with interest) to Eurotrain in November 2004.|$|E
5|$|Two rail {{companies}} have major train stations downtown: JR Central (Central Japan Railway Company) and Meitetsu (Nagoya Railroad). The JR Tōkaidō Main Line runs through and the Takayama Line begins at JR Gifu Station. Other JR Stations {{in the city}} include Nishi Gifu Station and Nagamori Station. The JR Tōkaidō <b>Shinkansen,</b> however, does not run through Gifu Station; its nearest stops are Nagoya Station and Gifu Hashima Station. The Meitetsu lines include the Nagoya Line, the Kakamigahara Line, and the Takehana Line, all of which originate at Meitetsu Gifu Station. Other Meitetsu Stations in the city include Chajo Station, Kano Station, Tagami Station, Hosobata Station, Kiridoshi Station, Tejikara Station, and Yanaizu Station. Until April 1, 2005, Meitetsu also operated a streetcar line that ran through Gifu.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the United States {{military}} and its navy took precautions against the approaching storm. Okinawa was put under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 1-E, {{which means that}} all outdoor activities are prohibited as there are sustained winds of at least 50knots (95km/h, 60mph) in force, on September 16, with over 100 flights {{into and out of}} Naha International Airport on the island cancelled. Kadena Air Base moved various aircraft to other undisclosed locations in the Pacific. Sasebo Naval Base declared TCCOR 1-E on September 17. The USS Harpers Ferry (LSD-49) and USS Juneau (LPD-10) both left the base, while the USS Patriot (MCM-7) was moved to a wet berth. Only one vessel, the USS Tortuga (LSD-46) remained in port for repairs, because authorities thought that the ship could withstand the storm. Elsewhere in Japan, some flights and <b>Shinkansen</b> bullet trains were delayed or cancelled. In Miyazaki and Hiroshima prefectures, evacuation orders were issued for almost 170 families. In Kyūshū, 10,000people voluntarily evacuated their houses for higher ground. The island's seven main airports were closed, causing 41,900 passengers to be stranded when 357 flights were cancelled. Ahead of an expected landfall on Hokkaidō, the JMA warned residents of the possibility of high winds.|$|E
25|$|E3 series: Introduced in 1997 on Akita <b>Shinkansen</b> Komachi and Yamagata <b>Shinkansen</b> Tsubasa {{services}} {{with a maximum}} speed of 275km/h. Now operated solely on the Yamagata <b>Shinkansen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Tokaido <b>Shinkansen</b> is not {{physically}} {{connected to the}} lines of the Tohoku <b>Shinkansen</b> at Tokyo Station. Therefore, there is no through service between those lines. All northbound services from Tokyo travel along the Tohoku <b>Shinkansen</b> until at least Ōmiya.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{derailments}} of <b>Shinkansen</b> {{bullet train}} services {{in and out}} of Tokyo, but their services were also suspended. The Tōkaidō <b>Shinkansen</b> resumed limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next day, while the Jōetsu and Nagano <b>Shinkansen</b> resumed services late on 12 March. Services on Yamagata <b>Shinkansen</b> resumed with limited numbers of trains on 31 March.|$|E
25|$|Two mini-shinkansen routes {{have been}} constructed: the Yamagata <b>Shinkansen</b> and Akita <b>Shinkansen.</b> <b>Shinkansen</b> {{services}} to these lines traverse the Tohoku <b>Shinkansen</b> line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, {{resulting in the}} local services being operated by standard gauge versions of 1,067mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, {{one of the two}} narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for <b>Shinkansen</b> services to pass each other without stopping.|$|E
25|$|The Tōkaidō Shinkansen's rapid success {{prompted}} {{an extension}} westward to Okayama, Hiroshima and Fukuoka (the Sanyō <b>Shinkansen),</b> which {{was completed in}} 1975. Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was an ardent supporter of the <b>Shinkansen,</b> and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the Tōhoku <b>Shinkansen</b> and Jōetsu <b>Shinkansen,</b> were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as JNR slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, {{largely because of the}} high cost of building the <b>Shinkansen</b> network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Cumulative {{ridership}} since October 1964 is over 5 billion passengers for the Tokaido <b>Shinkansen</b> Line {{alone and}} 10 billion passengers for Japan's entire <b>shinkansen</b> network.|$|E
25|$|The Narita <b>Shinkansen</b> {{project to}} connect Tokyo to Narita International Airport, {{initiated}} in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and {{removed from the}} Basic Plan governing <b>Shinkansen</b> construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the Narita Sky Access Line which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to <b>Shinkansen</b> specifications {{and there are no}} plans to convert it into a full <b>Shinkansen</b> line.|$|E
25|$|JR Kyushu is {{constructing}} {{an extension}} (to {{be known as}} the West Kyushu <b>Shinkansen)</b> line of the Kyushu <b>Shinkansen</b> to , partly to full <b>Shinkansen</b> standard gauge construction standards (Takeo Onsen – Nagasaki) with the existing narrow gauge section between Shin-Tosu and Takeo Onsen to be upgraded as part of this project.|$|E
25|$|The first Japanese {{double-decker}} train {{appeared in}} 1904. It was Type 5 train of Osaka City Tram. Sightseeing trains that feature double-decker carriages include the JR Shikoku 5000 series, Keihan 8000 series, JR Central 371 series, and Odakyu 20000 series RSE. The first JNR/JR double-decker trains were 200 series <b>Shinkansen</b> and 100 series <b>Shinkansen,</b> for <b>Shinkansen</b> lines.|$|E
25|$|Tokyo – Aomori (675km): The fastest <b>Shinkansen</b> service {{between these}} cities is 3 hours. JAL is {{reported}} to have reduced the size of planes servicing this route since the <b>Shinkansen</b> extension opened in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Tokyo – Nagoya (342km), Tokyo – Sendai (325km), Tokyo – Hanamaki (Morioka) (496km), Tokyo – Niigata (300km): There were air {{services}} {{between these}} cities, {{but they were}} withdrawn after <b>Shinkansen</b> services started. <b>Shinkansen</b> runs between these cities in about two hours or less.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Shinkansen</b> {{has used}} the {{electric}} multiple unit configuration from the outset, with the 0 Series <b>Shinkansen</b> having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations (e.g. Talgo used the locomotive configuration with the AVE Class 102 and continues with it for the Talgo AVRIL {{on account of the}} fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of the Talgo Pendular system). In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the <b>Shinkansen</b> does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. <b>Shinkansen</b> lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} Chuo <b>Shinkansen</b> maglev in Japan {{was estimated}} to cost approximately US$82 billion to build, with a route requiring long tunnels. A Tokaido maglev route replacing the current <b>Shinkansen</b> would cost 1/10 the cost, as no new tunnel would be needed, but noise pollution issues made this infeasible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shinkansen</b> routes are {{completely}} separate from conventional rail lines (except Mini-shinkansen which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the <b>shinkansen</b> is {{not affected by}} slower local or freight trains, and {{has the capacity to}} operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without road crossings at grade. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000meters (2,500meters on the oldest Tōkaidō <b>Shinkansen).</b>|$|E
25|$|Tokyo – Okayama (676km), Tokyo – Hiroshima (821km): <b>Shinkansen</b> is {{reported}} to have increased its market share from ~40% to ~60% over the last decade. The <b>Shinkansen</b> takes about three to four hours and there are Nozomi trains every 30 minutes, but airlines may provide cheaper fares, attracting price-conscious passengers.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{intended}} to carry passenger and freight trains {{by day and}} night, the <b>Shinkansen</b> lines carry only passenger trains. The system shuts down between midnight and 06:00 every day for maintenance. The few overnight trains that still run in Japan run on the older narrow gauge network that the <b>Shinkansen</b> parallels.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} extend the {{benefits}} of the Hokuriku <b>Shinkansen</b> to stations west of Tsuruga before the line to Osaka is completed, JR West is working in partnership with Talgo on the development of a Gauge Change Train (CGT), which will be capable of operating under both the 25kV AC electrification used on the <b>Shinkansen</b> and the 1.5kV DC system employed on conventional lines. The six-car train is due to start trials on the Hokuriku <b>Shinkansen</b> and the 1067mm-gauge Hokuriku and Kosei lines in 2017. As part of the project JR West has already begun trials with a purpose-built 180-metre-long gauge-changer at Tsuruga.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} two {{derailments}} of <b>Shinkansen</b> trains in passenger service. The first one occurred during the Chūetsu earthquake on 23 October 2004. Eight of ten cars of the Toki No. 325 train on the Jōetsu <b>Shinkansen</b> derailed near Nagaoka Station in Nagaoka, Niigata. There were no casualties among the 154 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Railways using <b>Shinkansen</b> {{technology}} {{are not limited}} to those in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Development of the <b>Shinkansen</b> by the privatised {{regional}} JR companies has continued, {{with new}} train models developed, each generally {{with its own}} distinctive appearance (such as the 500 series introduced by JR West). Since 2014, <b>shinkansen</b> trains run regularly at speeds up to , placing them alongside the French TGV and German ICE as the fastest trains in the world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shinkansen</b> uses a 25kV AC {{overhead}} power supply (20 kV AC on Mini-shinkansen lines), {{to overcome the}} limitations of the 1,500 V direct current used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars. The power supply for the Tokaido <b>Shinkansen</b> is 60Hz.|$|E
25|$|The Tōhoku <b>Shinkansen</b> {{line was}} worst hit, with JR East {{estimating}} that 1,100 {{sections of the}} line, varying from collapsed station roofs to bent power pylons, will need repairs. Services on the Tōhoku <b>Shinkansen</b> partially resumed only in Kantō area on 15 March, with one round-trip service per hour between Tokyo and Nasu-Shiobara, and Tōhoku area service partially resumed on 22 March between Morioka and Shin-Aomori. Services on Akita <b>Shinkansen</b> resumed with limited numbers of trains on 18 March. Service between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori was restored by May, but at lower speeds due to ongoing restoration work; the pre-earthquake timetable was not reinstated until late September.|$|E
25|$|Tokyo – Hokuriku (345km): The fastest <b>Shinkansen</b> service {{between these}} cities is 2½ hours. ANA is {{reported}} to have reduced the number of services from Tokyo to Kanazawa and Toyama from 6 to 4 per day since the <b>Shinkansen</b> extension opened in 2015. The share of passengers travelling this route by air {{is reported to}} have dropped from 40% to 10% in the same period.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{will provide}} <b>Shinkansen</b> {{technology}} for a high-speed rail link between Bangkok {{and the northern}} city of Chiang Mai under an agreement reached with Thailand on 27 May 2015. Total project costs are estimated in excess of 1 trillion yen ($8.1 billion). Several hurdles remain, however, including securing the funding. If the project is realized, it would mark the fifth time <b>Shinkansen</b> technology has been exported.|$|E
25|$|The JR Central Tōkaidō <b>Shinkansen</b> {{runs through}} areas of Ōtsu, but stops at no {{stations}} in the city.|$|E
25|$|Braking: Braking and {{overhead}} wire wear have caused {{problems for the}} Fastech 360 rail <b>Shinkansen.</b> Maglev would eliminate these issues.|$|E
