6000|$|... 'Well, it's Saturday night,' <b>she</b> returned, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> child's coming home. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> {{child is}} a {{troublesome}} bad child, and costs me a world of scolding. I would rather you didn't see my child.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Both <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> son disobeyed me in marrying; {{therefore}} I have {{no interest}} in their households. Their troubles are of their own making."

6000|$|... "Well, that's a pity too," [...] the Colonel said, with a sneer. [...] "Mrs. Mason is a {{relation}} of yours--at least by marriage.

6000|$|Minver asked him, almost compassionately {{and with}} unwonted gentleness, {{as from the}} mood in which his reminiscence had left him: [...] "You {{suspected}} a hoax?

6000|$|... "Yes, we're cousins, and {{not very}} far removed.

60|$|She {{spoke in}} a level voice, with a ring of {{hardness}} in it, for which I was to learn the true reason later. At the time {{it seemed to me}} due to resentment at having to speak of the man she had loved to me, whom <b>she</b> disliked, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> bitterness increased.|$|R

6000|$|... “Yes; I {{often feel}} that, when I {{think of the}} hard {{struggle}} she must have had. Though I was very young then, I can remember the shabby boardinghouses we stayed in, and my mother’s pale, anxious face when <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father used to talk in the evenings.

6000|$|... 'I chanced {{to see it}} done, that is all. She prayed me to {{tell you}} of her end and the child's, and that she died hiding your name, loving and forgiving.

60|$|Mamma {{had kept}} the house in Duke Street {{for more than two}} years. I recollected some of the chairs and tables from dear old Sloffemsquiggle, and the bowl in which I had made that famous rum-punch, the evening she went away, which <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> sisters left untouched, and I was obliged to drink after they were gone; but that's not to the purpose.|$|E

6000|$|She hid her face, {{she murmured}} between her lips The low word [...] "Don't."

60|$|It was on {{this very}} first day that I had the misfortune to throw her, though she was not subject to such {{weakness}} in general, {{into a state of}} violent consternation. I came into the room where <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mother were sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being on my mother's lap, I took it very carefully in my arms.

60|$|She was clumsy {{enough with}} her needle, poor girl, and pricked her fingers {{as much as}} she had been used to ink them.
