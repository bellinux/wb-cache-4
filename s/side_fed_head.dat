40|$|Introduction: Gastrostomy <b>fed</b> <b>head</b> or neck cancer {{patients}} frequently have impaired speech capacities. Enteral feeding teams frequently depend on laboratorial or anthropometrical parameters for nutritional assessment. Aims: In these patients, this study aimed to evaluate: (1) the practicability of Scored - Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA); (2) their nutritional status using the Scored-PG-SGA; (3) association of serum albumin and transferrin values to the nutritional status rating using PG-SGA. Methods: On adult outpatients with head or neck cancer under prolonged (> 1 month) gastrostomy feeding, Scored-PG-SGA, albumin and transferrin were evaluated {{during the same}} appointment. Results: Scored-PG-SGA was easily feasible in 42 patients, even in patients with speech difficulties. Twenty-five patients were moderately/severely undernourished (PG-SGA/B+C). Scored-PG-SGA rated 41 patients as ≥ 2, thus needing nutritional/pharmacologic intervention. Albumin was low in 13 patients. Transferrin was low in 19 patients. Average albumin and transferrin in moderately/severely undernourished patients (PG-SGA/B+C) was significantly lower than in well-nourished (PG-SGA/A). There was association between Scored-PG-SGA rating, albumin and transferrin. Conclusions: In PEG <b>fed</b> <b>head</b> or neck {{cancer patients}}, PG-SGA was practicable and useful, even in patients with impaired speaking skills. Most patients displayed moderate/severe malnutrition (PG-SGA/B+C). Scored-PG-SGA rated 41 patients as needing for nutritional/pharmacological intervention. Scored-PG-SGA should be systematically included {{in the evaluation of}} these patients. In these patients, albumin and transferrin levels showed relation with Scored-PG-SGA and should be considered as nutritional biomarkers. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{analysis}} of a new printed antenna is presented and discussed. This antenna consists of a printed monopole, {{with one or two}} sleeves on each <b>side,</b> <b>fed</b> by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) line. Switches are used to control the length of the monopole and the sleeves and to tune the resonant frequencies of the antenna. In the case of the double-sleeved antenna, the switch is used to connect or disconnect a second sleeve in the cactus antenna. Measurement results show that the cactus antenna maintains the dipole-like ra-diation patterns for all the different resonant frequencies.

The proposed protective concept implements a simple current signal sequential over lapping derivative, SOD transform to detect transmission line transient disturbances. It uses both polarity {{and magnitude of}} the first disturbance, arrived at relay location, to identify internal and external faults rapidly. The proposed unit protective relaying concept is applied to two <b>sides</b> <b>fed</b> transmission lines. The simulation results presented show that the protective concept is simple with high reliability, sensitivity and achieve an extra high speed relaying.

A description of pollution caused by cattle feedlots is undertaken {{as part of the}} study. The 26 feedlots analyzed had a capacity to/or did feed over 1, 000 head. They were broken down into four groups {{on the basis of their}} pollution problems: those having no apparent pollution problem, those having minor problems, those having major problems, and those requiring relocation. The cost impact of meeting environmental standards with regard to runoff control was found to be very slight for the cattle feeding industry as a whole - only 18 cents per <b>head</b> <b>fed</b> on the average. The feedlots with minor problems averaged costs of slightly over 2 cents per <b>head</b> <b>fed.</b> The feedlots with major problems averaged costs of almost 5 cents per <b>head</b> <b>fed</b> using the least cost method of natural evaporation ponds and mechanical disposal systems.

25|$|On May 31, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston {{attempted}} to overwhelm two Federal corps that appeared isolated {{south of the}} Chickahominy River. The Confederate assaults, although not well coordinated, succeeded in driving back the IV Corps and inflicting heavy casualties. Reinforcements arrived, and both <b>sides</b> <b>fed</b> more and more troops into the action. Supported by the III Corps and Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's division of Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner's II Corps (which crossed the rain-swollen river on Grapevine Bridge), the Federal position was finally stabilized. Gen. Johnston was seriously wounded during the action, and command of the Confederate army devolved temporarily to Maj. Gen. G.W. Smith. On June 1, the Confederates renewed their assaults against the Federals, who had brought up more reinforcements, but made little headway. Both sides claimed victory.|$|R

American naval and Marine aviation made Rabaul a frequent bombing target.A Japanese airfield was spotted under construction at Guadalcanal. The Americans made an amphibious landing in August 1942 to seize it, sent in the Cactus Air Force and started to reverse the tide of Japanese conquests. As a result, Japanese and Allied forces both occupied various parts of Guadalcanal. Over the following six months, both <b>sides</b> <b>fed</b> resources into an escalating battle of attrition on the island, at sea, and in the sky, with eventual victory going to the Americans in February 1943. It was a campaign the Japanese could ill afford. A majority of Japanese aircraft from the entire South Pacific area was drained into the Japanese defence of Guadalcanal. Japanese logistics, as happened time and again, failed; only 20% of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there.|$|R
5000|$|The {{colonial era}} Hindu revivalism and mobilisation, along with Hindu nationalism, states Peter van der Veer, was {{primarily}} a reaction to and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism. The successes of each <b>side</b> <b>fed</b> the fears of the other, leading {{to the growth of}} Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism in the Indian subcontinent. In the 20th century, the sense of religious nationalism grew in India, states van der Veer, but only Muslim nationalism succeeded with the formation of the West and East Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh), as [...] "an Islamic state" [...] upon independence. Religious riots and social trauma followed as millions of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs moved out of the newly created Islamic states and resettled into the Hindu-majority post-British India. After the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu nationalism movement developed the concept of Hindutva in second half of the 20th century.|$|R

The renewed offensive began on 25 June against IV Corps’ defences in the Tali area. After four days of intense fighting, during which both <b>sides</b> <b>fed</b> reserves into the battle, the Finns were pushed back, but their lines did not break. On 3 July, 21st Army attacked Finnish defensive positions at Ihantala, but the attack had been anticipated by the Finns and after several days of effort, 21st Army’s forces had made few gains. By 6 July, after four weeks of intense fighting and after having sustained heavy casualties, 21st Army’s offensive capacity was exhausted. Within days some of 21st Army’s best units were being withdrawn for deployment to other Soviet armies further south, and by mid-July the offensive in the Karelian Isthmus had been terminated. 21st Army remained with Leningrad Front until the end of September 1944, when it was again returned to the high command reserve.|$|R
