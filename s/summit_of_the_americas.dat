25|$|Many Latin Americans {{perceived}} that neo-liberalism reforms were failures in 1980s and the 1990s and intensified {{their opposition to}} the Washington consensus. This led to a resurgence in support for Pan-Americanism, support for popular movements in the region, the nationalisation of key industries and centralisation of government. America's tightening of the economic embargo on Cuba in 1996 and 2004 also caused resentment amongst Latin American leaders and prompted them to use the Rio Group and the Madrid-based Ibero-American Summits as meeting places rather than the United States-dominated OAS. This trend has been reinforced through the creation of a series of regional political bodies such as Unasur and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and a strong opposition to the materialisation of the Washington-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas at the 2005 4th <b>Summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas.</b>|$|E

His speech at the 5th <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> points {{to the fact that the}} Caribbean is situated between the narcotic producing South American continent and the narcotic consuming North American continent. Some of his crime detection and prevention methods included the introduction of the Special Anti-Crime Unit of Trinidad and Tobago (SAUTT), two surveillance airships (commonly referred to as blimps), and the inclusion of six high speed off-shore patrol vessels for better control of the country's maritime borders and coastlines on 15 February 2010.
