40|$|In this project, {{have been}} studied to {{determine}} the appropriate model to spatial, temporal and diversity of demersal fishes in the Sea of Oman, including Trichiuridae, Nemipteridae, Haemulidae, Arridae, Synodontidae, Batoidfishes, Carangidae, <b>Scianidae,</b> Carchariniformes and Serranidae. This research became operational from catch data during 2003 to 2013 (in 2007, {{due to the lack}} of ship failed). Processing and calculations was evaluated by using the software Excel, SPSS, Arc GIS and table curve 3 D highest biomass and abundance was showed in strata A and C and 10 - 30 m depth layers was showed the best condition biomass. In other words, highest biomass was showed in the eastern region in the Oman Sea than the central and western regions. Batoidfishes and Trichiuridae had the highest biomass. Depth factors was showed a significant correlation with the biomass. <b>Scianidae,</b> Serranidae and Haemulidae were showed a large decline. Synodontidae was showed a very large increase. The largest of Shannon index belong to central and western region of the Oman Sea. The highest Shannon index was showed 10 - 20 and 50 - 100 m, respectively. The Distribution maps based on the biomass was analyzed by using Arc GIS software. So that were identified in the first time in a ten-year period and carefully catch stations any economic of aquatic group.

40|$|A {{total of}} 6, 575 larvae in the preflexion, flexion and post-flexion stages of 15 families, 26 genera and 29 species were {{captured}} in the surf zone of Pontal do Sul beach, Paraná, Brazil. Samples of the families Gerreidae and <b>Scianidae</b> predominated and larvae of Eucinostomus argenteus (Baird&Girard, 1854), Micropogonias furnieri (Desmarest, 1823), Eucinostomus gula (Cuvier, 1830), Menticirrhus ameri-canus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Anchoa tricolor (Agassiz, 1829) were the most dominant species. Greater abundance of larvae was observed during the summer, followed by winter and in a less extent during spring and autumn. The number of species was greater in the summer, {{and there were no}} significant differences in the rest of the seasons...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} Lontra longicaudis {{have been studied}} in several areas in South America. In Brazil, the studies are {{concentrated}} on the species’ feeding habits in fresh water ecosystems. Different authors reported the use of marine waters by L. longicaudis, although fresh water ecosystems {{were found to be}} the main environment providing food for this species. In the Environmental Protection Area of Anhatomirim in Southern Brazil, the marine environment proved to be the main feeding habitat for L. longicaudis. Fish and crustaceans are the main prey groups. Four fish families were identified and the <b>Scianidae</b> represents 85 % of the prey. Intensive use of the coastal areas and lack of knowledge on the otters’ use of these environments can compromise its conservation in Santa Catarina coastal habitats...|$|E
40|$|Odontoscion dentex is reef fish (Sciaenidae) {{commonly}} found in the coastal shallow waters of Florida (US) until Santa Catarina (BR). Sciaenids, in general, are highly acoustic fish, both producing and receiving water vibrations through the lateral line system. As consequence they have large and irregular otoliths, associated to a well-developed lateral line and swimbladder. Several irregularities have been observed in fish sagittal otoliths, but mainly restricted to {{the replacement of the}} mineral form, i. e. aragonite by vaterite, in the carbonate matrix. This is usually recorded in rockfishes, including one <b>scianidae</b> species. However, these structures have been assumed to be anomalous and occasional in some individuals. In sagittae of O. dentex a permanent structure was however recorded, as a deep hole near the otolith’s core, usually with a U-shape. This irregularity was observed in all specimens analyzed, in both optic and scanning electron microscopy images, during the grinding and polishing procedures, after embedding the otolith in epoxy resin, for ageing purposes. Our result suggests that this is a non-artifact and permanent structure observed in O. dentex sagittal otoliths, which biological meaning is, at present, unknown...|$|E
40|$|Fish catch {{composition}} of some selected small scale fishing gears (gill net, cast net, beach seine and long line) were investigated in Bonny River, Rivers State, Nigeria from August 2014 to January 2015. A {{total number of}} 25 fish species from 18 families were recorded during the study. The Mugilidae with only one species constituted the dominant family while Cichlidae, Lutjanidae, Clupeidae, had three species and <b>Scianidae</b> had two species of fish caught and the remaining families had one species each. Mugil cephalus constituted 28. 48 % of the total catches followed by C. nigrodigitatus (22. 48 %). In the dry season M. cephalus forms the major component landings (32. 65 %), followed by C. nigrodigitatus (26. 53 %) and S. galilaeus (12. 24 %) while in the wet season M. cephalus (31. 06 %), C. nigrodigitatus (18. 63 %) and T. zillii (11. 80 %) were the dominant fish species. Cast net was the most efficient fishing gear while gill net was the least efficient. The comparison analysis between the wet and dry seasons using t-test showed {{no significant difference between}} dry and wet seasons (t = 0. 092, P > 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{compared}} fish assemblages in two adjacent areas, one with drifting algae (A) and another without it (WA), {{in order to}} assess seasonal changes in diversity and composition. Both areas were located in São Cristóvão beach, Rio Grande do Norte state, on the semi-arid North-Northeastern coast of Brazil. A total of 4988 individuals were caught, the most species-rich families being <b>Scianidae,</b> Ariidae, Engraulidae and Carangidae. Species richness and abundance were slightly higher in site A, but diversity and evenness were higher in site WA. However, with the exception of evenness, such differences were not significant {{at any time during the}} study. Species composition was also similar between the two sites over the year. Nevertheless, in spite of the similarities, seasonal changes of environmental conditions, particularly rainfall, seemed to influence fish assemblages differently in the two areas. This may have led to changes in assemblage structure, causing the differentiation of the communities in the dry season. The present study presents evidence that fish assemblages in habitats with and without drifting seaweeds are not static and may become more similar or different, depending on the environmental conditions, suggesting that there is a complex relationship between primary productivity, trophic level and the structure of fish assemblages...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Fishes {{from the}} {{families}} Sciaenidae and Sparidae, the former comprising coastal species associated with shallow waters on the continental shelf {{and the latter}} composed of typically marine species, are of significant economic value. Karyotypic data are available for about 20 % {{of the total number}} of species in these groups. In the present study, cytogenetic analyses were carried out in three Sciaenidae species, Menticirrhus americanus, Ophioscion punctatissimus and Pareques acuminatus, as well as in the sparid fish, Archosargus probatocephalus, using conventional staining (Giemsa) and Ag-nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) and C-banding techniques. The diploid values (2 n) and number of chromosome arms were equal to 48 in all species analyzed. NORs were located at pericentromeric positions, equivalent to large heterochromatic blocks, in M. americanus (1 st pair), O. punctatissimus (10 th pair), P. acuminatus (2 nd pair), and A. probatocephalus (3 rd pair). Heterochromatin was detected at the centromeric position in most chromosome pairs, being more conspicuous among <b>Scianidae</b> members. The remarkable karyotypic conservativeness detected in these species is similar to that observed in other perciform groups previously studied, regarding both the number of acrocentric chromosomes and NOR location. However, unusual events of heterochromatinization seem to have taken place along the karyotypic evolution of members of the family Sciaenidae. For the family Sparidae, distinct cytotypes between samples of Northeast Brazil and those previously analyzed on the southeastern coast were identified, suggesting that putative biogeographic barrier...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe ichthyofauna of the Manche-à-Eau {{mangrove}} lagoon was regularly sampled in 2002 with a {{fixed net}} at seven stations during 4 months corresponding to two hydrological seasons. Physicochemical variables (depth, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH) and population descriptors (species and family richness, density and biomass) were measured. The Whitefield and the well-being indexes were calculated to appreciate species equilibrium. Canonical correspondence analysis and generalized linear models {{were used to}} link species assemblages to physicochemical variables and {{to search for a}} special link with salinity. A total of 30, 733 individuals belonging to 34 species and 23 families were collected. The Gerreidae, Clupeidae, Engraulidae, <b>Scianidae,</b> and Sparidae represented almost 98 % {{of the total number of}} individuals. Our results show that organization of the fish assemblages in the lagoon is poorly dependent on salinity, whereas dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH could have a stronger role. Looking at response curves to salinity change, most fishes species appeared to be visitors, either temporarily present or regular migrators. Only a few species compose the year-round resident population. They have a high patrimonial value and could be considered bioindicator species for long-term studies (e. g., of global change and natural or anthropogenic disturbances). The Euclidean distance and biomass variables were not useful descriptors of confinement and biological zonation in the lagoon, whereas the negative gradient of specific richness, number of individuals, Whitefield index, and index of well-being better described confinement. On the basis of these last parameters, biological zonation in the Manche-à- Eau lagoon was established and is provided...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Gulf of California (UGC) is a Biosphere Reserve {{that despite}} its extreme {{environmental}} conditions (macrotidal inverse estuary) houses a high fish species richness. An intensive sampling of fish larvae and hydrography {{was carried out}} during June 2008 in the UGC. From 56 zooplankton sampling stations with a maximum of three sampling strata (each 5 m deep, from 0 to 15 m), a total of 29, 505 fish larvae were collected, included in 99 taxa and 32 families. The Bray–Curtis Index defined three main larval fish habitats that varied in composition. (i) The “Mixed” larval habitat was mostly defined in the vertically mixed western sector of the UGC; the coastal pelagic Anchoa spp. presented high abundance in this habitat, associated with demersal species such as Gobulus crescentalis and <b>Scianidae</b> type 1. The lowest diversity and abundance, and the highest salinity, temperature and chlorophyll distinguished this larval habitat. (ii) The “Front” habitat was located mostly on the physical–chemical frontal zone between the UGC and the Northern Gulf; it had the highest specific richness and larval abundance. The dominant species were the coastal pelagics Anchoa spp. and Opisthonema sp. 1; the latter was almost limited to the north by the frontal zone. (iii) The “Shelf” habitat, found over the shelf off the mainland, was the deepest and less salty, and was also dominated by Opisthonema sp. 1, but included epipelagic species such as Scombridae (e. g., Scomber japonicus, Auxis spp., Scomberomerus sierra), probably from the adjacent deeper zone. These larval fish habitats had well-defined limits that coincided with marked environmental gradients, with the lowest larval diversity in the saltiest environment; {{this suggests that the}} human-induced shift to hypersaline conditions may have reduced the preferred larval habitat for some species. The habitats most likely change with the seasons, with implications for the management of the reserve...|$|E
