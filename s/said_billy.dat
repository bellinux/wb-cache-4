2500|$|Jane Rackham {{from the}} Radio Times called the episode [...] "highly topical", while Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said: [...] "With London hosting the Games, {{this is an}} {{appropriate}} and ambitious story for Enders to tackle", and called both Fenwick and Harold [...] "superb". Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail questioned the choice of Billy for the torch, saying, [...] "Many people have carried the Olympic torch—sports men and women, entertainers, individuals who have contributed something to their community—so why oh why did Walford choose Billy for the honour? Failed husband, failed father—heck, even failed criminal, it's {{hard to see how}} he will manage to do anything with it other than burn down Albert Square." [...] Talking of the live insert, she said, [...] "maybe [...] just so that Billy can ruin the thing for the whole nation, as opposed to just Walford." [...] Boyd Hilton from Heat <b>said</b> <b>Billy</b> carrying the Olympic torch was a [...] "gimmick", and said the entire episode should have been live, whilst Heat Karen Edwards said Harold acting out a live birth would be [...] "amazing", adding, [...] "much respect goes out to Danielle who will be working hard to make the episode a success." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Me! no,” <b>said</b> <b>Billy,</b> casting {{his eyes}} oven his own huge frame with evident self-satisfaction; “I’m {{not to be}} skeared so easy.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Crellin told Digital Spy that Billy {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make money and live a [...] "champagne lifestyle like everybody else has."

Billy is a [...] "product of his environment" [...] and just wants to live a life where he has his own house and possessions. Billy's desire for more and his lack of achievement force him to make [...] "some ridiculous and monumental mistakes." ...|$|R
