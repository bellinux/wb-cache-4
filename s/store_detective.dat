In his senior year, he changed his major from English to drama. He also took advantage of any opportunity to meet stars, routinely going to shows in New York to hang around stage doors or venture backstage. He would {{go so far as}} to carry a copy of Variety or an appropriate piece of company stationery in order to look inconspicuous while sneaking backstage or into a TV studio. Cavett took many odd jobs ranging from <b>store</b> <b>detective</b> to label typist for a Wall Street firm, and as a copyboy at Time Magazine.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A Christmas special in all but name, and a touching look at the relationship between Marge and her growing Bart." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "thanks to the keen eye of the writers and the rarely shown good side of Bart, this episode works very well as both an amusing insight to the way a child’s mind works and as a strong relationship building episode between Bart and Marge." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite {{being one of the}} [...] "sappier" [...] episodes at times, it [...] "still packs some terrific laughs". Jacobson commented that he [...] "absolutely lost it when Homer’s drawing of a robot grilling a hot dog was seen - it’s funnier if you see it - and Lawrence Tierney’s guest turn as the <b>store</b> <b>detective</b> adds hilarious grit to the show." [...] He added that the episode does not [...] "fall into the classic" [...] category, [...] "but it offers more than enough entertainment to satisfy". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when a depressed Bart makes a snowman from the dirty, leftover snow under the car. She called the scene [...] "amazingly pathetic". Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B. In 2011, Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire cited it as the best Christmas episode of The Simpsons, noting that [...] "it's very sweet and there are some funny videogame jokes". He added that the episode [...] "features a terrific guest starring voice performance from the late Lawrence Tierney". Charlie Sweatpants, author of the online book Zombie Simpsons: How the Best Show Ever Became the Broadcasting Undead and creator of the blog Dead Homer Society, claims that it is the [...] "one bad episode" [...] in season seven, due to it being an example of a very special episode; however, he claims that it is only bad by the [...] "towering" [...] standards of the earlier seasons.|$|E

50|$|Shoplifting may be {{prevented}} and detected. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring {{is an important}} anti-shoplifting technology. Electronic article surveillance (EAS) is another method of inventory protection. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is an anti-employee-theft and anti-shoplifting technology used in retailers such as Walmart, which already heavily use RFID technology for inventory purposes. Loss prevention personnel can consist of both uniformed officers and plain-clothed <b>store</b> <b>detectives.</b> Large department <b>stores</b> will use both and smaller stores will use {{one or the other}} depending on their shrink strategy. <b>Store</b> <b>detectives</b> will patrol the store acting as if they are real shoppers.|$|R

Gilder is pleased because he had asked the judge to make her an [...] "example" [...] to other employees. Turner asks to speak with Gilder before she goes to prison. While Gilder waits for her arrival, his <b>store</b> <b>detective</b> detains another woman, a customer, for stealing. This woman is the wife of a prominent banker, so rather than have her arrested, Gilder apologizes to her and lets her go. Turner arrives and tells Gilder she has been wrongly convicted. Although she says she never stole, she pleads with Gilder to increase the wages of his clerks, so no one who works there will be forced to steal. Gilder rejects her arguments, and she leaves for prison swearing revenge on him for his treatment of her.|$|E

5000|$|The job {{involves}} patrolling {{stores in}} the role of an ordinary shopper, watching for shoplifters. The detective observes any shopper behaving suspiciously and keeps a mental record of such observations. The objective of the <b>Store</b> <b>Detective</b> is to observe a complete crime taking place. They achieve this by observing a shoplifter approaching an item, appropriating the item (picking it up), concealing the item (not always) and leaving the store having not paid for said item. The key difference between a <b>store</b> <b>detective</b> and a security guard is that the former's role is covert. If they observe an individual shoplifting, they may detain them as they attempt to exit the store or apprehend the suspect(s) during the theft. Laws vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regarding what constitutes the crime of shoplifting and how a suspect may be detained/arrested. In Canada, detectives may arrest the individual utilizing powers given to them by the Criminal Code.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Store</b> <b>Detective</b> {{has several}} {{techniques}} {{that they use}} to detect shoplifters.

They usually have a clear understanding of the law as it applies to their role depending on jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|As a {{requirement}} of the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the UK now requires all contract security officers to have a valid Security Industry Authority license.

This dispensation is not available to Vehicle Immobilisers. Licenses are valid {{for three years and}} require the holders to undergo formal training, and are also to pass mandatory Criminal Records Bureau checks. Licences for Vehicle Immobilisers are valid for one year. Armed guarding and guarding with a weapon are illegal.|$|R

Apparently now disbelieving in a link between them, the manager asks Susan for her address, and Martin appears to make a mental note when she offers it. Sympathetic to him, Susan pays for the toy. Implying that this was a misunderstanding, the manager lets them leave.|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} put shoplifting into a historical perspective. The offence {{is related to the}} changing social, economic and legal structure of English society. The second chapter describes and accounts for the trends in criminological research with regard to shoplifting from {{the turn of the century}} until the present day. Also, the aims of the present survey are outlined and an examination of the research data is made. Following this, the main factors contributing to store shrinkage are described, and an account of amateur and professional shoplifting techniques is related. Chapters 4 and 5 contain a detailed analysis of the survey's statistical material on shoplifting. Social characteristics of shoplifters such as age, sex, and occupation are elicited from the data. Characteristics of the thefts such as when they took place, their value, etc., are also recorded. Where the survey material is lacking or insufficient, a critical examination of previous research in the relevant area is made. General store security is examined. A description is given of both mechanical methods used to catch or deter shoplifters, and those involving <b>store</b> <b>detectives.</b> Role conflict among <b>store</b> <b>detectives</b> is examined. The following chapter's theme is the false picture of shoplifting created by the official statistics. Systematic bias occurs at a number of levels before certain cases are officially recorded. Pressure is occasionally exerted on suspects to plead guilty; guilty pleas may hide minor violations of the law by enforcement agents. Finally, the conclusion is reached that, with regard to shoplifting, positivistic theory relating economic status and crime is still relevant, though somewhat unfashionable, today. But also, as an offence, shoplifting is found to have certain negative qualities and these are considered in the light of Sutherland's theory of differential association. Some likely future trends in shoplifting are outlined. <p...|$|R
50|$|Economists say {{shoplifting}} {{is common}} {{because it is}} a relatively unskilled crime with low entry barriers that can be fitted into a normal lifestyle. People of every nation, race, ethnicity, gender and social class shoplift. Originally, analysis of data about apprehended shoplifters and interviews with <b>store</b> <b>detectives</b> suggested that females were almost twice as likely as males to shoplift. However, since 1980 data suggest that males are equally or more likely to shoplift than females. The average shoplifter first did it at the age of ten: shoplifting tends to peak in adolescence then steadily declines thereafter. People of all races shoplift equally, and poor people shoplift only slightly more than rich people. Men tend to shoplift using knapsacks, and women using strollers. When caught, a shoplifter has on average $200 worth of unpaid-for merchandise.|$|R
60|$|He {{began by}} informing himself {{on all the}} {{technicalities}} of tea-rooms. He lunched at tea-rooms. He prowled in front of tea-rooms. He dreamed about tea-rooms. He became a dabster at tucking paper napkins into his neat little waistcoat without tearing them. He got acquainted with the waitress at the Nickleby Tavern, which was not a tavern, though it was consciously, painstakingly, seriously quaint; and he cautiously made inquiry of her regarding tea and china. During his lunch-hours he frequented auction sales on Sixth Avenue, and became so sophisticated {{in the matter of}} second-hand goods that the youngest clerk at Pilkings & Son's, a child of forty who was about to be married, respectfully asked Father about furnishing a flat. He rampaged through department stores without buying a thing, till <b>store</b> <b>detectives</b> secretly followed him. He read the bargain-sale advertisements in his morning paper before he even looked at the war-news head-lines.|$|R
50|$|He {{worked for}} various {{security}} companies as a <b>store</b> <b>detective</b> and undercover investigator.

The CPS dropped the attempted murder charge and the man received five years imprisonment for the attack.|$|E
50|$|A <b>store</b> <b>detective</b> (sometimes {{called an}} SD) {{is a member}} of Loss Prevention whose main role is to prevent and detect theft (commonly known as shoplifting) and reduce shrink in retail outlets. They do this by patrolling the store in plain clothes looking to {{identify}} members of the public who are stealing from the store. More common terms today with major retailers are Loss Prevention Agent, Detective or Investigator and Asset Protection Officer. Special Officer, once common, is now rarely used, as few jurisdictions still allow it.|$|E

50|$|All persons {{licensed}} to perform security activities {{are required to}} undertake a course of professional development in associated streams that are recognised nationally. This {{has not always been}} the case and the introduction of this requirement is expected to regulate the educational standards and knowledge base so that the particular job can be competently performed. Strict requirements are laid down as to the type of uniform and badge used by security companies. Uniforms or badges that may be confused with a police officer are prohibited. Also, the use of the titles 'Security Police' or 'Private Detective' are unacceptable. While the term security guard is used by companies, government bodies and individuals, the term security officer is deemed more suitable. Bouncers use the title Crowd Controllers, and <b>Store</b> <b>Detectives</b> use the title Loss Prevention or Asset Protection Officers. Security Officers may carry firearms, handcuffs or batons where their role requires them to do so and then only when working and have the appropriate sub-class accreditation to their license.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules are}} very similar to the federal process; the grand jury usually only hears from law {{enforcement}} personnel, with the exception of property crimes, where <b>store</b> <b>detectives</b> or actual victims of theft or vandalism are called to testify. The only cases brought to the grand jury are those initiated from the Commonwealth's Attorney's office (the prosecutor for felonies). For the vast majority of cases, the grand jurors generally only hear a recitation of facts from the police report, crime laboratory & medical examiner reports, and other documentation generated during the evidence gathering process. Grand jurors can ask factual questions of the witnesses and legal questions of the Commonwealth's Attorney or Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney. The ability to broaden or narrow indictments does technically allow for grand juries to open new avenues of investigation, although since it is dependent on prosecutors for facts, this is very rarely done. Rules of confidentiality that apply to Kentucky grand jurors are similar to those that apply to federal grand juries.|$|R
