30|$|Much prior {{research}} on {{learning to use}} topographic maps has focused on trying to facilitate comprehension of the topography by providing the user with additional visual information on the map, such as with shaded relief (e.g., Phillips, Lucia, & Skelton, 1975; Potash, Farrell, & Jeffrey, 1978; Rapp et al., 2007). A critical finding from this work is {{that the benefits of}} additional visual information are limited to reasoning about specific kinds of topographic map problems (e.g., shaded relief shows a moderate improvement over contour lines for landscape visualization tasks, but decreases accuracy for <b>spot</b> <b>elevation</b> problems; Potash et al., 1978).

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that caves in the Florida Peninsula {{are tied to}} Quaternary sea levels was proposed by hydrogeologists, without data, some 40 years ago. The hypothesis is a version of glacial control of cave levels, which is the logical combination of the water-table theory of speleogenesis and the concept that base level positions the water table. At the USA type example of glacial control of cave levels—Mammoth Cave in the Paleozoic rocks of Kentucky—the intermediary is base level determined by rivers. By hypothesis, the intermediary for Florida is glacioeustatic sea level. This paper presents elevation data that supports this hypothesis. Recent cave surveys in the air-filled caves and <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> from archived maps reveal prominent levels of passages centered at 5, 12, 21, and 30 m above sea level over broad areas. They do not follow the large-scale structure of the Floridan aquifer. Instead, they align with nearby, coastal marine terraces identified as modal peaks on frequency plots from various topographic data bases. Levels matching with the three highest terraces—Wicomico, Penholoway, and Talbott—are particularly clear. Lower levels, if they accord with sea-level stands, are likely composites. Data from cavities encountered in drilled wells (e. g., bit drops) and <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> from archived underwater cave maps demonstrate passage levels at depths of 15, 30, 70, and 90 – 120 m below the modern water table. The depths below water table {{are similar to the}} depths below sea level of distant submerged terraces and paleoshoreline features identified using multibeam bathymetric data in the Gulf of Mexico. The cave, bit-drop, and terrace data are all consistent with the concept that Quaternary sea level is the fundamental control on the cave-scale porosity within the Floridan aquifer. This conclusion does not {{rule out the possibility that}} lithologically favored positions, paleokarst features and confining units, and mixing zones are also involved in the location of caves levels in this near-coastal environment...|$|R

40|$|In 41 {{patients}} who underwent coronary bypass surgery, creatine kinase (CK) -MB mass concentration was repeatedly measured in serum {{during and after}} the intervention using a new two-site immunoenzymetric assay (IEMA). Serum CK-MB activity was determined with the use of four different techniques: immunoinhibition, immunoinhibition-immunoprecipitation, column chromatography and electrophoresis. Myoglobin (Mb) was also measured in each specimen by radioimmunoassay. In the 33 {{patients who}} followed a completely uneventful postoperative course, the cumulated CK-MB release was, on the average, 12. 2 -fold less than after acute myocardial infarction. The CK-MB peak concentrations using the IEMA were 33 +/- 3 micrograms/l (X +/- SEM) and occurred 6. 4 +/- 0. 5 h after the intervention was started; CK-MB levels had decreased to 2. 9 +/- 0. 4 micrograms/l {{at the end of the}} first postoperative day. The evolution of the CK-MB concentration was parallel to that of the enzyme activity. The serum Mb maximum concentrations (518 +/- 39 micrograms/l) were reached after 3. 3 +/- 0. 1 h. The other eight patients developed perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI); in this group, the cumulated CK-MB release was higher, and the serum CK-MB postoperative curves were of three different types.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess possible differential movement across an inferred fault beneath Byrd Glacier, and to measure the timing of unroofing in this portion of the Transantarctic Mountains. Apatites separated from rock samples collected from known elevations at various locations north and south of Byrd Glacier were dated using single crystal (U–Th) /He analysis. Results indicate a denudation rate of c. 0. 04 mm a 21 in the time range c. 140 – 40 Ma. Distinct age v. elevation plots from north and south of Byrd Glacier indicate an offset of c. 1 km across the glacier with south side up.

The difference in elevation of the erosion surface across Byrd Glacier also shows an offset of c. 1 km with south side up.
