40|$|The {{classical}} way {{of assessing}} fatigue performance of bituminous materials is {{to study the}} loss of stiffness during constant amplitude <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>loading</b> test performed in laboratory. This kind of signal {{is different from the}} signal induced by traffic load in real pavement. The temperature, frequency, rest periods and shape of the waveform may affect the results of the fatigue test, and therefore the results of pavement thicknesses computation based on fatigue performances. The study presented in this paper focuses on the influence of the shape of the periodic signal, by comparing the fatigue performances derived from classical sinusoidal signal; to those resulting from more realistic signal as it can be measured by strain gauges in full-scale pavement structures. Some multi-peak signals are studied modeling the effect of two axles loading. The main parameter studied is the decrease of the load between the two loading peaks within one cycle. The Wöhler curves of the different multi-peak test results are compared to the classical <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>loading.</b> The study clearly shows that, for same loading amplitude, the two peaks signals are less damaging than the classical <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>loading.</b> Moreover, loading (or unloading) rate effect within the signals appears to affect fatigue life. Analytical analysis of signal aggressiveness is then proposed {{to take into account the}} signal shape complexity. Therefore the effect of the frequency is also explored showing fatigue life reduction with the increase of frequency. This last point confirms the increase of damage with the frequency and opens future prospects...|$|R

40|$|When {{the supply}} {{voltages}} are balanced and <b>sinusoidal,</b> <b>load</b> compensation can give both unity power factor (UPF) and perfect harmonic cancellation (PHC) source currents. But under distorted supply voltages, achieving both UPF and PHC currents are not possible and contradictory to each other. Hence {{there should be}} an optimal performance between these two important compensation goals. This paper presents an optimal control algorithm for load compensation under unbalanced and distorted supply voltages. In this algorithm source currents are compensated for reactive, imbalance components and harmonic distortions set by the limits. By satisfying the harmonic distortion limits and power balance, this algorithm gives the source currents which will provide the maximum achievable power factor. The detailed simulation results using MATLAB are presented to support the performance of the proposed optimal control algorithm. ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{analytical}} studies {{focusing on}} the sliding of building contents usually make an assumption that the friction force-sliding displacement behaviour is elasto-plastic (e. g. friction coefficient remains constant during sliding). This preliminary study uses experimental data to verify if this assumption is reasonable. Shake table tests of a desk on common flooring materials were conducted to investigate the factors influencing friction behaviour, and to observe the behaviour of the contents under sinusoidal motion. Up to a 15 % decrease in friction coefficient was observed with either an 80 % increase in mass or a 20 times decrease in relative velocity, indicating that the friction coefficient is dependent on these two parameters. A comparison of the experimental and analytical sliding response of the desk under a single <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>loading</b> pattern on carpet flooring was conducted. Results show that the displacement amplitude of a single sliding excursion and the general sliding trend is well approximated using the elasto-plastic assumption. As such, despite the dependence of friction coefficient on sliding mass and velocity, the elasto-plastic behaviour assumption appears to be reasonable for the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>loading</b> pattern examined in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the behaviour of articular cartilage under compressive loading. An apparatus was built to apply <b>sinusoidal</b> and constant <b>loading</b> to specimens of cartilage. The majority of the tests performed were on specimens of bovine cartilage although some tests have been conducted on human patella cartilage. Confined tests, with load, deformation and flow confined to an axial direction, were considered most realistic to the conditions in the body, and so the majority of the work was on this type of test. However some tests of an 'unconfined' nature, with axial load but radial flow and deformation, were carried out. An already established computer model of this behaviour of cartilage was modified and used to reproduce the experimental results. The model is based on fluid flow phenomena only and hence agreement with the experimental work was not entirely satisfactory. However, the model does allow the effect of changes in cartilage properties to be studied. The model yielded its most useful results for <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>loading,</b> where it forecast similar results to the experimental work. The cartilage is shown to be visco-elastic under conditions of steady load, the creep deformation being achieved by fluid flowing out of the specimen. The creep deformation is shown to be recoverable on removal of <b>load.</b> Under <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>loading,</b> around the frequency of the walking cycle, flow processes are shown to contribute practically nothing to the sinusoidal deformations achieved, the deformations in this case arising almost entirely from the elastic compressibility of the specimens...|$|R
