40|$|Linking <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> {{to modern}} markets, whether {{domestically}} or for export, increasingly entails participation in modern supply chains coordinated by contract farming. Concerns {{have been raised}} regarding the possible disadvantages from contract farming facing <b>small</b> <b>farmers.</b> Most empirical work points to {{a positive correlation between}} participation in contract farming and net farm income. Such a correlation fails to correct for endogeneity of participation; few studies have performed multivariate analysis with such a correction. This case study, based on a survey of smallholders in the tobacco industry, seems to be the first such application for the Philippines. The study finds that, correcting for endogeneity, participation in contract farming causes a sizable increase in farm profitability; moreover, participation appears to be biased toward smaller farm sizes. The findings are robust to the econometric method used and even definition of participation. This is further evidence to confirm that supply chains linking agribusiness with <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> via contract <b>schemes</b> are a viable model of value addition and inclusive growth in rural areas.

40|$|Assessing the ‘new’ CAP after 2013 reveals some {{positive}} developments encouraging MAs (Managing Authorities) to recognise the particular characteristics {{of small and}} SSFs, in designing and implementing appropriate policy options. Because Pillar I aid is unavoidably linked to scale and many small farms cannot or do not claim it, the financial impact of Pillar I on small and SSFs will remain modest. Nevertheless, more options exist for increasing this impact through explicit or implicit tailoring, where Member States so choose. The <b>Small</b> <b>Farmers</b> <b>Scheme,</b> in particular, offers benefits by reducing transaction costs. For Pillar II, the new framework offers more scope for funding tailored to {{the specific needs of}} small and SSF farms, but {{there is no guarantee that}} this will translate into more cost-effective Rural Development Programmes, and there is concern that such developments may be disincentivised by other aspects of the approach. Stronger guidance from the European Commission, as well as support from the European Network for Rural Development, could help Managing Authorities to consider the needs of these farms more fully in Rural Development Programme design. In sum, the ‘new’ CAP offers greater potential to support and enhance the value of Europe's small and SSFs than its predecessor.

40|$|ABSTRACT Deforestation is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} problem in the Brazilian Amazon. <b>Small</b> <b>farmers</b> {{play a key role}} in this process in that they earn their livelihood by ranching and farming. Many studies have addressed the link between deforestation and livelihood strategies adopted by <b>small</b> <b>farmers.</b> Most have focused on advanced monitoring systems, simulation models, and GIS approaches to analyze the interaction of both dimensions, i. e., livelihoods and forest cover change. Although the current toolbox of methods has proved successful in increasing our understanding of these interactions, the models and approaches employed do not consider small farmers’ perspectives. On the assumption that local <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> are agents of land-cover change, understanding how they perceive their own situation is essential to elucidate their actions. Our objective is to explore future changes in livelihood security and environmental sustainability as envisaged by local <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> in the Brazilian Amazon. Previous livelihood cluster analysis of <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> located in southeast Pará was integrated with fuzzy cognitive mapping to determine present perceptions and to explore future changes, using global scenarios downscaled to the local situation. Overall, system description differs only on details; all results indicate a strong trade-off between livelihood security and environmental sustainability in all livelihood systems, as identified by the <b>small</b> <b>farmers.</b> However, fundamentally different outcomes are obtained from the future analysis, depending on the livelihood strategy cluster. Achieving win-win outcomes does not necessarily imply a positive scenario, especially if <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> are dependent on income transfers from the government to provide their livelihood...|$|R

40|$|Facing {{the general}} trend towards larger but fewer farms since 1935, the US {{government}} implemented a protective {{safety net for}} <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> during 1933 - 96 which did not halt it but incurred market distortions and other drawbacks. It then switched to market oriented measures in 1996 which have made <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> more exposed to market risks. A suitable solution to both preserving small and strengthening large farms has not been found. This paper provides a proposal {{not included in the}} 145 recommendations in the report `A Time to Act' by the National Commission on Small Farms of the USDA in January 1998 : to promote part ownership of land by encouraging <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> to develop off-farm activities and lease the land beyond self-need to part owners (including competent <b>small</b> <b>farmers)</b> to boost large farmers. In this way, while part owners could achieve economies of scale, <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> would be boss of self-used land and landlord of rented-out land, integrated with large farmers, gain more income from rent, increase time for and earnings from off-farm activities, so that <b>small</b> <b>farmers,</b> rural communities, democracy roots and landscape could be conserved. It shows an example of how some black <b>farmers</b> who were <b>small</b> in terms of owned land but became large after renting in land achieved success in farming. Although part ownership has been increasing, it has never been promoted as a policy direction and even be neglected.

40|$|Agriculture {{development}} {{efforts in the}} past have focused heavily on increasing aggregate output in less developed countries (LDC). In the last 2 - 3 decades, technology served as a key policy instrument used by developed countries to aid the less developed ones. However, such a policy had led to the neglect of certain farming groups, particularly <b>small</b> <b>farmers.</b> Recent trends in agriculture development tend to pay special attention to the needs of <b>small</b> <b>farmers.</b> It is the <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> who form the backbone of agriculture in many LDC's. As their development receives priority, so does the need {{to gain a better understanding}} of their farming needs. <b>Small</b> <b>farmer</b> response to technology has been unevenly distributed. This has not only varied amongst the LDC's, but technology adoption rates differ within countries. Besides many socio-economic constraints experts consider risk and uncertainty to play a dominant role in technology adoption. The major issue is to what extent should risk and uncertainty be taken into account while evaluating potential technology. Farmers in many developing countries have shown preference for traditional technology over the improved one. The discussion of this paper focuses on the decision making strategies of farmers. Particularly those strategies adopted in choice of varieties and allocation of resources to agriculture. The interest here is to see to what extent does risk and uncertainty enter the farmers decision process. The focus here is not limited to the <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> alone, however, they are of special interest in this paper.
