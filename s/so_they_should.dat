25|$|After {{the match}} {{there were reports}} in the media that Australia had batted {{conservatively}} in their final 8 overs after the final re-start, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands' par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, {{in the same way}} that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings would be a mistake. At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), so the only undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands' par score was Australia's final score, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have tried to maximise this.|$|E
25|$|When Emperor Wu {{wanted to}} {{reassign}} Jia Chong {{to guard the}} Guanzhong region, Xun Xu told his colleague Feng Dan (馮紞) that their status in the imperial court depended on Jia Chong's presence <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> {{try to stop the}} emperor from sending Jia Chong out of the imperial capital, Luoyang. Xun Xu thought of persuading Emperor Wu to arrange a marriage between Sima Zhong, the crown prince, and Jia Chong's daughter, Jia Nanfeng. In this way, Jia Chong, as the crown prince's father-in-law, would have to remain in Luoyang. Xun Xu and Feng Dan then sang praises of Jia Chong's daughter in front of Emperor Wu and managed to convince him to arrange the marriage. Many officials were disgusted by Xun Xu's fawning behaviour and called him a sycophant.|$|E

25|$|When Sun Quan {{noticed that}} the rivalry between his sons had a polarising effect on his subjects, he forbid his sons from {{interacting}} with the outside world, and ordered them to focus on academic studies. The official Yang Dao (羊衜) wrote a memorial to Sun Quan, urging the emperor to lift the ban on his sons interacting with the outside world. He pointed out that both Sun He and Sun Ba held considerable prestige among the literati and scholar-gentry, who were eager to meet the two princes, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be allowed {{to interact with the}} outside world. Yang Dao also explained to Sun Quan that isolating the two princes from the outside world might make people think that Eastern Wu was experiencing internal instability and allow rumours to breed and spread. Sun Quan probably heeded Yang Dao's advice.|$|E
25|$|In any {{community}} of scientists, Kuhn states, {{there are some}} individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a crisis exists, embark on what Kuhn calls revolutionary science, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear {{to be accompanied by}} numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should.</b> To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a paradigm shift will have occurred.|$|E
25|$|Around the time, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} in the imperial court {{over the issue of}} restoring the nobles to their fiefs and allowing them to govern from their respective fiefs. When Emperor Wu sought his opinion, Xun Xu disapproved because he believed that since the nobles also held gubernatorial appointments, they might neglect their original jurisdictions once they return to their respective fiefs. He also pointed out the possible complications such as having to subdivide the fiefs into commanderies and counties, as well as the risk of making people unhappy since the subdividing would require relocating residents from one area to another. He further pointed out that they would need to reassign troops from the borders and place them under decentralised command in the various fiefs. When Emperor Wu asked Xun Xu to reconsider his views, Xun Xu explained further that the best course of action was to maintain the status quo, since the redrawing of boundaries between the fiefs might lead to resentment and potential unrest if it was not carefully managed. He also pointed out that there were far more important issues that required immediate attention, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> focus on those first. Emperor Wu thought that Xun Xu's advice was appropriate and heeded it.|$|E

500|$|There still {{remained}} {{the question of}} Leask's concession, the existence of which Rudd's negotiating team had learned in Bulawayo {{towards the end of}} October. Rhodes resolved that it must be acquired: [...] "I quite see that worthless as [...] concession is, it logically destroys yours," [...] he told Rudd. This loose end was tied up in late January 1889, when Rhodes met and settled with Leask and his associates, James Fairbairn and George Phillips, in Johannesburg. Leask was given £2,000 in cash and a 10% interest in the Rudd Concession, and allowed to retain a 10% share in his own agreement with Lobengula. Fairbairn and Phillips were granted an annual allowance of £300 each. In Cape Town, with Rhodes's opposition removed, Robinson altered his stance regarding the Matabele mission, cabling Whitehall that further investigation had shown Babayane and Mshete to be headmen after all, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to board ship for England.|$|E
500|$|The {{division}} {{among the}} generals {{came to a}} head {{at a meeting of the}} MRC on August 26–27. Khánh said the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), whom he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the Đại Việt included Thieu and Khiêm. Khiêm blamed Khánh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses to the communists. Thieu and another Catholic General Nguyễn Hữu Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh claimed that Khánh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> support him, prompting Khiêm to angrily say [...] "Obviously, Khánh is a puppet of the US government, and we are tired of being told by the Americans how we should run our internal affairs."

We were there to teach them that just because they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be aware that just because it is not Sharia today, they can’t just do whatever they like.” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.|$|E
