5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (<b>suite</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools)</b> for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E
5|$|PRSA members receive {{access to}} a <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> that fosters {{professional}} development and career growth. PRSA hosts an accreditation program called APR (accreditation in public relations) that evaluates a PR professional in four categories: research, planning, implementation and evaluation. Accreditation is usually granted to candidates with {{five to seven years}} of experience upon completion of written and oral examinations. About 20 percent of PRSA's members are accredited. PRSA hosts the Anvil awards, which are issued based on four components: research, planning, execution and evaluation. The Gold Anvil is awarded to individuals. The Silver Anvil is awarded for strategy and the Bronze for tactics. It also issues awards such as Grand Gold Pick, Rookie of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and PR person of the year.|$|E
5|$|These {{rapid changes}} raised {{tensions}} between officers and their charges, and over thirty sailors {{were arrested in}} early December and accused of planning a new rebellion—which led to that feared second rebellion. On 9 December, crewmen onboard Rio Grande do Sul, {{the only one of}} Brazil's major new warships to not take part in the Revolt of the Lash, mutinied but did not gain enough traction to take the ship. Shortly after, the marine infantry battalion at the naval facilities on Ilha das Cobras revolted. The government acted quickly and put down both rebellions, but they caused the Brazilian Congress to declare that Rio de Janeiro {{was in a state of}} siege, thereby giving President Fonseca a <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> to combat the unrest. The vote was nearly unanimous; the only vote against came from Rui Barbosa.|$|E

25|$|This {{database}} aims at {{providing a}} quick {{overview of the}} current available biomedical information about the searched gene, including the human genes, the encoded proteins, and the relevant diseases. The GeneCards database provides access to free Web resources about more than 7000 all known human genes that integrated from >90 data resources, such as HGNC, Ensembl, and NCBI. The core gene list is based on approved gene symbols published by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). The information are carefully gathered and selected from these databases by the powerful and user-friendly engine. If the search does not return any results, this database will give several suggestions to help users accomplish their searching depended {{on the type of}} query, and offer direct links to other databases’ search engine. Over time, the GeneCards database has developed a <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> (GeneDecks, GeneLoc, GeneALaCart) that has more specialised capability. Since 1998, the GeneCards database has been widely used by bioinformatics, genomics and medical communities for more than 15 years.|$|E

25|$|The Building Architect Tool (BAT) is a <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> {{developed}} for producing custom buildings. The suite {{consists of three}} applications: The Building Architect game pack for Gmax, which enabled users to render Gmax models into SimCity 4 sprites or props to be imported into the LE; {{an updated version of}} the LE; and the standalone Plug-in Manager, which enables users to modify simulation properties for new lots. Several modified versions have been released that have, in effect, served as bug fixes for various problems that had not been discovered before the initial release. First released on February 2004, it enabled the modding community to produce custom buildings and props for SC4. SimCity 4s Building Architect Tool is similar in function to SimCity 3000s Building Architect Tool and SimCity 2000s Urban Renewal Kit; however, previous programs of this kind were created from scratch by Maxis and used completely different interfaces. The SC4 BAT required a third-party application (Gmax) to function and was never bundled with SC4s or the Rush Hour expansion pack, as SimCity 3000 Unlimited had with its own BAT.|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} an {{introductory}} discussion {{of the principles of}} steam engines and the relevant physical principles, as well as designs for the Evans high-pressure steam engine, boilers, screw-mills and others. Evans developed a similar <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> and tables for potential steam engineers as he had for potential millers, such as tables itemizing the heat and pressure tolerances of various metals, instructions for assembling the basic components of a steam-powered system, and schematics for useful components such as valves and boilers. Evans also used the book to justify the safety of high-pressure steam engines if properly constructed, despite the fact that by this time Evans himself had experienced several boiler explosions in his workshop. However, thermodynamics were little understood in his time. As such, many of Evans's theoretical contentions, including the 'grand principle' of steam he develops to guide the mathematical modelling of pressure and fuel in steam engines, were substantially flawed. Although Evans was to be quite successful in the development of high-pressure steam engines (and his designs were widely used), his theoretical understanding of them was limited and he was generally unable to accurately predict the inputs and outputs of his machines. The guide also indulged in a far wider range of topics of interest to Evans, including a compendium of inventions from others which he deemed to be worthy of further circulation—such as a straw-cutter and flour press developed by his brother Evan, and a horse-drawn scraper and earth mover invented by Gershom Johnson. Evans also used the opportunity to encourage government sponsorship of research: ...|$|E
