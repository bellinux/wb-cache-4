5000|$|A <b>stove</b> is an {{enclosed}} {{space in which}} fuel is burned to provide heating, either to heat the space in which the <b>stove</b> is situated, or to heat the <b>stove</b> itself and items placed on it.

50|$|<b>Stoves</b> differ {{widely in}} {{their size and}} portability. The {{smallest}} models are generally termed backpacking <b>stoves.</b> They are designed for use in backpacking and bicycle touring, where light weight and small size are paramount considerations. Backpacking <b>stoves</b> consist only of the burner, fuel tank and pot supports. The legs - if any - are often collapsible to minimize the space required. The weight may range from about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 g) for simple alcohol <b>stoves,</b> 11 to 14 oz for MSR-type <b>stoves</b> (without fuel weight) and canister <b>stoves</b> (with gas cartridge), and up to 1 lb for larger <b>stoves.</b> Single burner alcohol <b>stoves,</b> beverage can <b>stoves,</b> and small liquid fuel and gas canister <b>stoves</b> are well suited for backpacking.|$|R

Unpressurised stoves use solid/liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition. Combustible stove hangers use a form of volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner i.e. bottled gas stoves.

50|$|Alkyd {{coatings}} {{are typically}} sold in three classes: long, medium, and short. These terms represent the oil length in the resin.Alkyds are also modified with phenolic resin, styrene, vinyl toluene, acrylic monomers (to make them dry more quickly), and polyurethanes. By adding certain modifying resins, {{it is possible}} to produce thixotropic alkyds for decorative use. The latest alkyds are short oil A/D resins where the oil length is shortened by chain stopping with benzoic acid and now para-tert-butylbenzoic acid (Alkydal M 48), these have a better controlled molecular weight distribution and better durability. Alkyds for decorative use have extra oil cooked in to lengthen them and to make them more durable. Short oil resins used in <b>stoving</b> enamels are made from non-drying saturated oils or fatty acids. These usually have much higher hydroxyl and acid values, to be able to react with the hydroxyl groups of the amino resins. These mixtures are usually stabilized with amines to prevent gelling on storage.|$|E
