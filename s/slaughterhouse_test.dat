40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a reliable, practical and affordable combined farm and slaughter identification for Dutch breeding pigs (sows and boars) before 1 January 2012. In consultation with representatives of pig farmers, breeding institutions, traders, slaughterhouses and governments a list of requirements for the combined ear tag has been set up. After initial interest for prototyping nine manufacturers have been visited and the requirements were discussed. Ultimately, six of the manufacturers produced a total of 13 prototypes for testing. Prototypes were subjected to a visual test and a test in two different slaughterhouses. Only four of the 13 prototypes met the established slaughterhouse criteria (loss rate < 5 %). These four were then tested on three pig farms. The infections, irritations and inflammation depend on husbandry conditions and the type of ear tag. The on farm loss rate of ear tag prototypes was less than 2 %. The readability of the combined ear tags on the farms is not problematic. Retagging after loss was possible for one person using the existing hole but resulted in slight discomfort for the animal. During transport of the animals there were no losses. In the following <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>test</b> no physical losses occurred. However, the functional loss rate in the slaughterhouse was above 5 %. Practical implementation of the combined ear tags was studied by interviews with several stakeholders. Focus in the interviews was on the regulations, the attachment of the combined ear tags, the process of transporting pigs to the slaughterhouse, including transport, assembly and export, the need to renumber pigs, the service of the slaughterhouses for blood sampling, and the I&R in relation to the needed documentation and forms during transport. From the interviews it becomes clear that implementation in practice needs numerous reattachments and renumbering of ear tags. This leads to slight discomfort to the animals and increased labour for the farmers. This retagging has negative influence on the reliability of the data and on the guarantees of food safety. The results lead to the overall conclusion that the introduction of a combined ear tag under the current conditions is not justified as a solution to go from three to two identification procedures for breeding pigs...|$|E

Tests were performed with silicone tubes (1 / 2 x 3 / 16 inches) in fluid analogous to blood and fresh bovine blood from <b>slaughterhouse.</b> <b>Tests</b> with analogous solution to blood were performed varying the dynamic calibration pressure between 78 and 500 mm Hg. Tests with fresh bovine blood were performed with the three pumps simultaneously, and pressure differences and free hemoglobin in the plasma were measured during 360 minutes. Tests with both analogous solution to blood and fresh bovine blood showed differences of mean pressures of pump 2 related to pumps 1 and 3 (p < 0. 01). The different models of roller pumps analyzed presented differences in pressure amplitudes (p < 0. 01) and hemolysis (p < 0. 01) adjusted for the same dynamic calibration pressure. Raceway profile of pump 2 resulted in smaller pressure amplitude, implying lower hemolysis rate compared with pumps 1 and 3. ASAIO Journal 2012; 58 : 40 - 45...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella {{serotyping}} data, qualitatively {{described by}} van Hoek et al. (2012), {{were used to}} quantify potential sources of Salmonella in a Dutch pig <b>slaughterhouse.</b> Statistical <b>tests</b> to compare per-day Salmonella prevalence and serotyping data from multiple points in the chain were used to find transmission pathways. A statistical model based on serotyping data was developed to attribute Salmonella on dressed carcasses to the most likely source. Approximately two-third of dressed carcasses carrying Salmonella on the medial surface had been contaminated by house flora. For carcasses carrying Salmonella on the distal surface, transient Salmonella from incoming pigs was a more important source. The relevance of the different sources of Salmonella varied within and between sampling days. Results were compared to those of another modeling approach, in which Salmonella concentration data from the same samples were used (Smid et al., 2012). They mostly agreed.

40|$|Feeding {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the efficacy of low fish-meal-based diets for juvenile grouper Epinephelus coioides (Hamilton). A diet containing 44 % protein was formulated using fish meal as the major protein source. Processed meat solubles, a rendered by-product of <b>slaughterhouses,</b> was <b>tested</b> {{as a replacement for}} fish meal at increasing percentages from 0 to 100 % in isonitrogenous diets. Eight dietary treatments representing fish-meal replacements were arranged in a completely randomized design with four replicates per treatment. Twenty-five fish were reared in circular fibreglass tanks of capacity 250 L, maintained in a flow-through seawater system and fed at 5 â€“ 6 % of total biomass, provided daily at 08 : 00 and 16 : 00 for 60 days. Results indicate that processed meat solubles can replace 40 % of fish-meal protein with no adverse effects on weight gain, survival and or feed conversion ratio of E. coioides juveniles. Higher inclusion levels resulted in a significant decline in growth performance and inefficient feed conversion ratios, which may partly result from the lack of essential nutrients such as essential amino acids in meat solubles. This study has shown that the use of processed meat solubles substantially lowers the level of fish meal required in juvenile grouper diet and can be an efficient means of turning byproducts from slaughterhouses into a useful feed resource.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the prevalence of}} hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the pork production chain in Czech Republic, Italy, and Spain during 2010. A total of 337 fecal, liver, and meat samples from animals at <b>slaughterhouses</b> were <b>tested</b> for HEV by real-time quantitative PCR. Overall, HEV was higher in Italy (53 %) and Spain (39 %) than in Czech Republic (7. 5 %). HEV was detected most frequently in feces in Italy (41 %) and Spain (39 %) and in liver (5 %) and meat (2. 5 %) in Czech Republic. Of 313 sausages sampled at processing and point of sale, HEV was detected only in Spain (6 %). HEV sequencing confirmed only g 3 HEV strains. Indicator virus (porcine adenovirus) was ubiquitous in fecal samples and absent in liver samples and was detected in 1 slaughterhouse meat sample. At point of sale, we found porcine adenovirus in sausages (1 %– 2 %). The possible dissemination of HEV and other fecal viruses through pork production demands containment measures. Human hepatitis E is endemic worldwide, particularly in Asia, where large waterborne outbreaks have been reported (1). Seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is> 60 % in rural southern People’s Republic of China (2) and 4 %– 10 % in western Europe (3) and the United States (4).

40|$|Abstract: Listeriosis is the {{infectious}} disease of numerous mammals’ species, including cattle, sheep, goat, pigs, and humans. Cause is Listeria monocytogenes, {{widespread in the}} nature and relatively resistant microorganism. Listeria come in environment by excretes of sick humans and animals {{as well as of}} clinically healthy organisms. This microorganism can be found in waste and water, soil, plants, feedstuffs, walls and floors of the buildings where live animals, various kinds of foods of plant and animal origin, as well as in animals and people. In goats, the disease is manifested in the form of abortion, encephalitis and septicemia. After infection, sometimes there are no clinical symptoms and goats come to the slaughterhouse as clinically healthy animals (latent infection). When the goats come to the slaughterhouse, it is n not necessary the transmission of the cause to meat, but it can be transferred to the equipment, walls, floors, aprons and boots. In our study, twenty clinically healthy goats, slaughtered in <b>slaughterhouse,</b> were <b>tested</b> – one hyperemic uterus and meat of all goats. Floor swabs (from nine different locations) and swabs from the carriage bottom (20 swabs) in which were placed intestines and uterus were taken three days after slaughter. Uterus and carriage swabs were tested according to method RES, chapter 2. 10. 14. B. 1. and meat by ISO 11290 / 1 : 1996 (E). From the uterus, which was slightly hyperemic it was isolated Listeria monocytogenes and from five samples of floor and three samples of the carriages. It was not isolated from meat samples. These results indicate the possibility of indirect transmission of this bacterium to meat...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is {{recognized}} as one of the major foodborne pathogens. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that T. gondii is one of the public health hazards in pigs to be covered within a modern meat inspection and advised to include serological testing of pigs and audits of pig farms to control T. gondii. A project is presented that develops a framework where this idea is practically implemented in a pork supply chain. The aim of the program is to reduce the contribution from the pork chain to the human toxoplasmosis disease burden. In the pilot at least one blood sample per batch at delivery at the <b>slaughterhouse</b> is <b>tested</b> with a Toxoplasma Elisa. With this screening 20 (1 %) high risk herds were identified. These high risk farms and their controls, 2 per high risk farm, were followed up. More samples of risk farms and their controls were collected to get a better estimate of the within herd prevalence and to follow the development of serology over time. Additional MC-PCR was performed on hearts of pigs from these herds to confirm presence of infection, tissue cysts. Also farm assessments were done to verify the presence of risk factors at the identified farms. In the first farm where hearts were tested by PCR the presence of toxoplasma tissue cysts was shown. The results give insight in how risk based approaches with food chain information (FCI) for animals sent to slaughter could work, by substantiating how risk herds can be practically identified and which interventions are feasible.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has been increasingly monitored in animals {{in order to}} prevent the spread of these strains through the food supply chain. Particularly, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has been investigated worldwide. In the current study, the frequency of antimicrobial resistance of generic Escherichia coli and Enterococcus isolated from swine carcasses sampled at the pre-chill stage was assessed. A total of 319 strains of E. coli and 240 strains of Enterococcus sp. from carcasses sampled in three Brazilian <b>slaughterhouses</b> were <b>tested</b> by the agar diffusion test, according to the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Escherichia coli strains showed high frequency of resistance against tetracycline (79. 3 %), ampicillin (64. 3 %), sulfonamide and florfenicol (64. 9 %). Five isolates were resistant to either cefotaxime or ceftazidime, but only one of them displayed a positive result in the confirmatory phenotypic test recommended by CLSI. The five isolates were subjected to PCR for detection of blaTEM and blaPSE genes and three strains presented amplification for blaTEM. The most prevalent resistance profiles found among Enterococcus strains were tetracycline (42. 5 %), erythromycin (26. 7 %) and high level streptomycin (HLAR, 20. 4 %). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and ampicillin. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for resistant and intermediate erythromycin Enterococcus strains. The determined MIC ranged from 1 µg/mL to 4 µg/mL for erythromycin intermediate strains, while among the resistant strains it ranged from 6 µg/mL to> 256 µg/mL.

40|$|Taenia solium {{cysticercosis}} {{was reported}} in official veterinary and medical statistics to be highly prevalent in pigs and humans in Madagascar, but few estimates are available for pigs. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of porcine cysticercosis among pigs slaughtered in Antananarivo abattoirs. Firstly, the diagnostic performance of two antigen-ELISA techniques (B 158 B 60 Ag-ELISA and HP 10 Ag-ELISA) and an immunoblotting method were compared with meat inspection procedures on a sample of pigs suspected to be infected with (group 1; n = 250) or free of (group 2; n = 250) T. solium based on direct veterinary inspection in Madagascar. Sensitivity and specificity of the antigen ELISAs were then estimated using a Bayesian approach for detection of porcine cysticercosis {{in the absence of}} a gold standard. Then, a third set of pig sera (group 3, n = 250) was randomly collected in Antananarivo <b>slaughterhouses</b> and <b>tested</b> to estimate the overall prevalence of T. solium contamination in pork meat traded in Antananarivo. The antigen ELISAs showed a high sensitivity (> 84 %), but the B 158 B 60 Ag-ELISA appeared to be more specific than the HP 10 Ag-ELISA (model 1 : 95 % vs 74 %; model 2 : 87 % vs 71 %). The overall prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in Antananarivo slaughterhouses was estimated at 2. 3 % (95 % credibility interval [95 %CrI]: 0. 09 – 9. 1 %) to 2. 6 % (95 %CrI: 0. 1 – 10. 3 %) depending on the model and priors used. Since the sample used in this study is not representative of the national pig population, village-based surveys and longitudinal monitoring at slaughter are needed to better estimate the overall prevalence, geographical patterns and main risk factors for T. solium contamination, in order to improve control policies.

40|$|Introduction: Trypanosomes infect {{a variety}} of animals and cause fever, weakness, and lethargy, which lead to weight loss and anemia. In {{livestock}} the disease is fatal unless treated and causes serious economic losses. Present {{study was conducted to}} detection of Trypanosoma from one-humped camels slaughtered in Najafabad slaughterhouse.   Materials and methods: 278 blood samples were taken at three different time periods from one-humped camels slaughtered in Najafabad <b>slaughterhouse</b> and were <b>tested</b> by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detection of Trypanosoma.   Results: The overall infection rate of Trypanosoma was 1. 07 %.

40|$|International audienceFollowing the two "mad cow" {{crises of}} 1996 and 2000, {{there was an}} urgent need for rapid and {{sensitive}} diagnostic methods to identify animals infected with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent. This stimulated {{research in the field}} of prion diagnosis and led to the establishment of numerous so-called "rapid tests" which have been in use in Europe since 2001 for monitoring at-risk populations (rendering plants) and animals slaughtered for human consumption (<b>slaughterhouse).</b> These rapid <b>tests</b> have {{played a critical role in}} the management of the mad cow crisis by allowing the removal of prion infected carcasses from the human food chain, and by allowing a precise epidemiological monitoring of the BSE epizootic. They are all based on the detection of the abnormal form of the prion protein (PrP^ Sc or PrP^ res) in brain tissues and consequently are only suitable for post-mortem diagnosis. Since it is now very clear that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) can be transmitted by blood transfusion, the development of a blood test for the diagnosis of vCJD is a top priority. Although significant progress has been made in this direction, including the development of the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology, at the time this paper was written, this objective had not yet been achieved.

40|$|Food {{safety is}} an {{important}} concern in mod-ern food production. The transmission of Salmonella from animals to humans via pork meat exemplifies this (Hald and Wong). Managing Salmonella in pork production in-volves quality management in supply chains with multiple players. The Salmonella preva-lence in pork meat can be reduced through measures taken both before slaughtering and during the slaughtering process. We focus on the farm-level control measures. Actions can be taken both {{in the production of}} piglets (the multiplying stage) and in the fattening of the pigs (the finishing stage) (Hald and Wong). Salmonella control measures in the finishing stage have the highest effect if there are severe Salmonella problems in the multiplying stage, and vice versa (Dahl). Hence, the control mea-sures are substitutes. Salmonella rarely causes noticeable health problems to pigs and has no direct effect on productivity (Dahl). Hence, the incentives to implement control measures at farm level must come from economic incen-tive schemes. One can test for Salmonella prevalence us-ing an inexpensive serological test (approxi-mately $ 1. 00 per <b>test)</b> at the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> Also, bacteriological <b>testing</b> of the piglets is possible, but expensive (approximately $ 1, 000 per test) and, therefore, rarely used (Wegener et al.; Dahl).

The preliminary laboratory {{results of this study}} are presented here. A screening of sera by a commercial competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for influenza A was done in Vietnam, and further serological analyses on cELISA positive sera and virological analyses were performed in the Pasteur Research Centre in Hong Kong. Results: A total of 2340 pigs were sampled in farms and 678 in slaughterhouse, with 22. 3 % positive by cELISA in farms, and 37. 2 % in slaughterhouse; 1554 poultry (ducks and chickens) were sampled in farms, with 30. 4 % positive by cELISA. In Hong Kong, 710 pigs and 37 poultry swabs were analyzed by isolation in cell culture and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and 677 pigs and 472 poultry cELISA positive sera by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests and H 5 pseudoparticle-based seroneutralization assay (H 5 pp). No virus was isolated nor detected by qRT-PCR in swabs from pigs and poultry. Among pigs, 13. 3 % of sera in farms and 17. 6 % in slaughterhouse were positive for at least one strain tested, 19. 1 % for poultry sera. According to the considered subsets, 5. 5 % to 11. 3 % of sera were positive by cELISA but remained negative by HI test and H 5 pp assay for the tested strains. Pig sera were tested positive against strains of H 1 N 1 (12. 1 % in farms, 17. 1 % in slaughterhouse), H 9 N 2 (1. 7 % in farms, 1. 2 % in slaughterhouse), and H 5 N 1 (0. 7 % in farms, 0. 1 % in <b>slaughterhouse),</b> HI <b>tests</b> did not reveal evidence of infection by a H 3 subtype. For poultry, some sera were positive against H 5 N 1 (11. 8 %) and H 9 N 2 (9. 7 %) strains, but no positive serum against H 6 strains was detected. Sera in pigs and poultry were found to cross-react between several subtypes and strains within a subtype. Conclusion: Several strains were found in both pigs and poultry sera, suggesting the occurrence of inter-species transmission. The interpretation of analyses can be challenging {{due to the lack of}} information on the viral strains circulating in field and to the potential cross-reaction between different strains. Further analyses are carried out in order to identify the possible circulation of other strains and to evaluate the performance of the cELISA...|$|R

The fastfood sold in public streets had higher contamination by Salmonella spp. SausageS had Salmonella in 28. 1 % of the samples by RT-PCR and 12. 3 % by the conventional method; cheese, 18. 4 % by RT-PCR, and 5. 3 % by the conventional method: pork meat, 23. 1 % by RT-PCR, and 15. 4 % by the conventional method, and ground meat, 9. 3 % by RT-PCR, and 15. 6 % by the conventional method. Cattle carcasses showed a 1. 8 % of Salmonella spp., a significant difference was observed with respect to spent time for each technique, RT-PCR yielded results within 24 hours as compared to four days for the conventional method. Conclusions: The study showed that RTPCR is a valuable alternative to determine Salmonella spp. in foods for their specificity and promptness, furthermore, the high presence of Salmonella in public fastfood outlets is a public health problem for consumers...|$|R
