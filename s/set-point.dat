40|$|The behavior-regulation {{approach}} to learned performance {{has been the}} subject of misapprehension and disagreement concerning: (1) the nature and importance of behavior regulation, (2) the definition and role of behavioral <b>set-points,</b> (3) the relation of optimal schedule performance to behavioral <b>set-points,</b> and (4) the question of whether deviations from total responding or from response patterns are the primary determinant of molar responding under schedule constraint. After clarifying the nature and role of behavior regulation and <b>set-points,</b> this paper shows that the data used to question optimal schedule performance (Allison, 1981 a) actually strongly support the general behavior-regulation approach.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a two-layer {{scheduling}} {{scheme for}} pump stations {{in a water}} distribution network has been proposed. The upper layer, which works in one-hour sam-pling time, uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) to produce continuous flow <b>set-points</b> for the lower layer. While in the lower layer, a scheduling algorithm {{has been used to}} translate the continuous flow <b>set-points</b> to a discrete (ON-OFF) control operation sequence of the pump stations with the constraints that pump stations should draw the same amount of water as the continuous flow <b>set-points</b> provided by the upper layer. The tuning parameters of such algorithm are the lower layer control sampling period and the number of parallel pumps in the pump station.

Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, side effects of medication, and cancer among others.

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (<b>set-point</b> targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E

The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur, as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (Greek for [...] "standing still"). Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback: any time a parameter diverges from its <b>set-point,</b> sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value.

2500|$|There is some {{evidence}} from comparative phylogenetic analysis and epidemic simulations that HIV adapts {{at the level of}} the population to maximize transmission potential between hosts. This adaptation is towards intermediate virulence levels, which balances the productive lifetime of the host (time until AIDS) with the transmission probability per act. A useful proxy for virulence is the <b>set-point</b> viral load (SPVL), which is correlated with the time until AIDS. SPVL is the quasi-equilibrium titer of viral particles in the blood during chronic infection. For adaptation towards intermediate virulence to be possible, SPVL needs to be heritable and a trade-off between viral transmissibility and the lifespan of the host needs to exist. [...] SPVL has been shown to be correlated between HIV donor and recipients in transmission pairs, thereby providing evidence that SPVL is at least partly heritable. The transmission probability of HIV per sexual act is positively correlated with viral load, thereby providing evidence of the trade-off between transmissibility and virulence. It is therefore theoretically possible that HIV evolves to maximize its transmission potential. Epidemiological simulation and comparative phylogenetic studies have shown that adaptation of HIV towards optimum SPVL could be expected over 100–150 years. These results depend on empirical estimates for the transmissibility of HIV and the lifespan of hosts as a function of SPVL.|$|E
