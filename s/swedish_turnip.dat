5000|$|During the Irish Famine (1845-1852), Poor Law Guardians in Galway City leased (on a 999-year-lease) a twenty-acre former nunnery {{to house}} one {{thousand}} orphaned or deserted boys ages {{from five to}} approximately fifteen. Here the boys were taught tailoring, shoe making, and agricultural skills.

Brassica napus {{has given rise to}} two large groups, namely, <b>Swedish</b> <b>turnips</b> (believed to be of hybrid origin) (9/76. 'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1856 page 729.

Brassica rapa (of Koch) has also given rise to two races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving rape. The evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants, though so different in external appearance, belong to the same species; for the turnip has been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots in uncultivated soil; and when rape and turnips are sown together they cross {{to such a degree that}} scarcely a single plant comes true. (9/77. 'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1855 page 730.)

Many similar cases of analogous variation have been observed by Naudin in the great gourd family, and by various authors in our cereals. Similar cases occurring with insects under natural conditions have lately been discussed with much ability by Mr. Walsh, who has grouped them under his law of equable variability.|$|E
60|$|We can understand, {{on these}} views, the very {{important}} distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. Lamarck first {{called attention to}} this distinction, {{and he has been}} ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance, {{in the shape of the}} body and in the fin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a pachydermatous animal, and the whale, and between both these mammals and fishes, is analogical. Amongst insects there are innumerable instances: thus Linnaeus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth. We see something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties, as in the thickened stems of the common and <b>swedish</b> <b>turnip.</b> The resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct animals. On my view of characters being of real importance for classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character, although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist. For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus assume a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--will rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of descent. We can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so many characters, great and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor. So it is with fishes.|$|E
60|$|This, however, {{does not}} prove that the law of which we have been {{speaking}} does not exist, but only {{that there is some}} antagonizing principle at work, capable for a time of making head against the law. Such an agency there is, in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land; and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed. It is no other than the progress of civilization. The most obvious [part of it] is the progress of agricultural knowledge, skill, and invention. Improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds: (1) some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce, without an equivalent increase of labor; (2) others have not the power of increasing the produce, but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained. (1.) Among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows, by means of the rotation of crops; and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation. The change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century, by the introduction of turnip-husbandry, is spoken of as amounting to a revolution. Next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food, containing a greater amount of sustenance, like the potato, or more productive species or varieties of the same plant, such as the <b>Swedish</b> <b>turnip.</b> In the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures, and of the most effectual modes of applying them; the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents, such as guano, and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted; inventions like subsoil-plowing or tile-draining, by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied; improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle; augmented stock, of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted; and the like. (2.) The other sort of improvements, those which diminish labor, but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce, are such as the improved construction of tools; the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor, as the winnowing and thrashing machines. These improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land, but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce, to rise with the progress of population and demand.|$|E
60|$|Analogous facts {{have been}} {{observed}} with plants: Major Trevor Clarke crossed the little, glabrous-leaved, annual stock (Matthiola), with pollen of a large, red-flowered, rough-leaved, biennial stock, called cocardeau by the French, {{and the result was}} that half the seedlings had glabrous and the other half rough leaves, but none had leaves in an intermediate state. That the glabrous seedlings were the product of the rough-leaved variety, and not accidentally of the mother-plant's own pollen, was shown by their tall and strong habit of growth. (15/19. 'Internat. Hort. and Bot. Congress of London' 1866.) in the succeeding generations raised from the rough-leaved crossed seedlings, some glabrous plants appeared, showing that the glabrous character, though incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves, was all the time latent in this family of plants. The numerous plants formerly referred to, which I raised from reciprocal crosses between the peloric and common Antirrhinum, offer a nearly parallel case; for in the first generation all the plants resembled the common form, and in the next generation, out of one hundred and thirty-seven plants, two alone were in an intermediate condition, the others perfectly resembling either the peloric or common form. Major Trevor Clarke also fertilised the above-mentioned red-flowered stock with pollen from the purple Queen stock, and about half the seedlings scarcely differed in habit, and not at all in the red colour of the flower, from the mother-plant, the other half bearing blossoms of a rich purple, closely like those of the paternal plant. Gartner crossed many white and yellow-flowered species and varieties of Verbascum; and these colours were never blended, but the offspring bore either pure white or pure yellow blossoms; the former in the larger proportion. (15/20. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 307. Kolreuter 'Dritte Fortsetszung' s. 34, 39 however, obtained intermediate tints from similar crosses in the genus Verbascum. With respect to the turnips see Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' 1837 page 370.) Dr. Herbert raised many seedlings, as he informed me, from <b>Swedish</b> <b>turnips</b> crossed by two other varieties, and these never produced flowers of an intermediate tint, but always like one of their parents. I fertilised the purple sweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus), which has a dark reddish-purple standard-petal and violet-coloured wings and keel, with pollen of the painted lady sweet-pea, which has a pale cherry-coloured standard, and almost white wings and keel; and from the same pod I twice raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts; the greater number resembling the father. So perfect was the resemblance, that I should have thought there had been some mistake, if the plants which were at first identical with the paternal variety, namely, the painted-lady, had not later in the season produced, as mentioned in a former chapter, flowers blotched and streaked with dark purple. I raised grandchildren and great-grandchildren from these crossed plants, and they continued to resemble the painted-lady, but during later generations became rather more blotched with purple, yet none reverted completely to the original mother-plant, the purple sweet-pea. The following case is slightly different, but still shows the same principle: Naudin (15/21. 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 100.) raised numerous hybrids between the yellow Linaria vulgaris and the purple L. purpurea, and during three successive generations the colours kept distinct {{in different parts of the}} same flower.|$|R
60|$|In {{confirmation}} of this view, let us {{glance at the}} classification of varieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single species. These are grouped under the species, with the subvarieties under the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon, with several other grades of difference. Nearly the same rules are followed as in classifying species. Authors have insisted on the necessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the <b>Swedish</b> and common <b>turnip</b> together, though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part {{is found to be}} most constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing varieties, I apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical classification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted in some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or less modification, that the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. In tumbler pigeons, though some of the subvarieties differ in the important character of the length of the beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any thought on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and alike in some other respects.|$|R

These are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under varieties; and with our domestic productions, several other grades of difference are requisite, {{as we have seen}} with pigeons.

If it could be proved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro, I think he would be classed under the Negro group, however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes.|$|R

5000|$|Rutabaga {{has many}} {{national}} and regional names. Rutabaga is the common North American term for the plant.

The term swede is used instead of rutabaga in many Commonwealth Nations, including much of England, Australia, and New Zealand. The name turnip is also used in parts of Northern and Midland England, the West Country (particularly Cornwall), Ireland, Manitoba, Ontario and Atlantic Canada. In Wales, according to region it is variously known as maip, rwden, erfin, swedsen or swejen in Welsh [...] and as swede or turnip in English. In Scotland, it is known as turnip, and in Scots as tumshie or neep (from Old English næp, Latin napus). Some areas of south east Scotland, such as Berwickshire and Roxburghshire, still use the term baigie, possibly a derivative of the original Swedish rutabaga. The term turnip is also used for the white turnip (Brassica rapa ssp rapa). Some will also refer to both swede and (white) turnip as just turnip (this word is also derived from næp). In North-East England, turnips and swedes are colloquially called snadgers, snaggers (archaic) or narkies.|$|E

30|$|Scope of vermicompost {{to be used}} as an {{alternative}} to commercial potting substrates or peat is indicated in present study of germination indices. Vermicompost substitution in commercial potting media and soil showed no negative effect on Linum seed germination in all proportions, so vermicompost can be used to replace the expensive commercial potting media partially or whole. Similar results have been put forth by Atiyeh et al. (1999, 2000 a, 2001) using pig manure as container media. Replacing vermicompost with commercial potting media would reduce substrate cost in nurseries thus in turn reducing peat harvesting from wetlands. Ievinsh (2011) reported that application of more than 50 % vermicompost, inhibited seed germination in radish, cabbage, <b>swedish</b> <b>turnip,</b> beet root, beans and peas. Contrary to this, in present study, germination rate of Linum varieties was not negatively affected by increasing the proportion of vermicompost in soil. Even 100 % vermicompost did not inhibit the seed germination but seedlings showed lower, relative root growth, S.V.I and biomass at 21 DAS, It can be due to excessive micro and macro nutrients in plant tissues. The concentration of nutrients in plant tissues {{have been shown to be}} directly proportional to the concentration of nutrients in medium (Truong and Wang 2015). Atiyeh et al. (2000 b) also reported similar results that 100 % vermicompost caused tomato seedling to be relatively short, with few leaves and lesser weight.|$|E
