50|$|In typography, the Thibaudeau Classification {{is a way}} {{to group}} typefaces into four general families, {{according}} to shape and <b>serif</b> <b>character.</b> Invented in 1921 by the French typographer Francis Thibaudeau, it was expanded by Maximilien Vox in 1954, and again in 1962 by Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) into the VOX-ATypI classification of 11 families. The Thibaudeau system is nevertheless still beneficial in that it is simple to comprehend. Thibaudeau later supplemented the classification by adding the category of the Écritures (for the scripts) and the Fantaisies (for the advertising or display typefaces).|$|E
50|$|Unlike legal {{requirements}} {{in all other}} European countries, a standard uniform character font is not required. The rules simply require legible black sans <b>serif</b> <b>characters,</b> no more than 70 mm high and 36 mm wide with a stroke width of 10 mm, on a white reflective background. The result is that a large variety of perfectly legal font styles may be seen, on either pressed aluminium or acrylic plates, {{both of which are}} allowed. Despite the rather relaxed lack of a specified font, the hyphen between the lettering must lie between the minimum dimensions of 13mm x 10mm or the maximum dimension of 22mm x 10mm. Vehicle owners may be fined if the plate's format does not meet the requirements, and the vehicle will fail the mandatory periodic National Car Test.|$|R
50|$|GOCR {{claims it}} can handle single-column {{sans-serif}} fonts of 20-60 pixels in height. It reports trouble with <b>serif</b> fonts, overlapping <b>characters,</b> handwritten text, heterogeneous fonts, noisy images, large angles of skew, and text in {{anything other than}} a Latin alphabet.|$|R
25|$|As serifs {{originated}} in inscription, {{they are generally}} not used in handwriting. A common exception is the printed capital I, where the addition of <b>serifs</b> distinguishes the <b>character</b> from lowercase L. The printed capital J and the numeral 1 are also often handwritten with serifs.|$|R
5000|$|Dwiggins {{chose the}} name Caledonia, the Roman name for Scotland, {{to express the}} face's basis on Scotch Roman typefaces. However, though Dwiggins began {{with the thought of}} copying the {{classical}} Scotch Romans, eventually he drew more inspiration from the Bulmer design of William Martin. [...] The G is open and the R has a curved tail. the t is unbracketed. Italic characters p and q have no foot <b>serif.</b> The <b>character</b> set, as drawn by Dwiggins was wide, including ranging (old style) figures, lining figures, and small capitals in the text and bold weights. A Greek version of the face is available.|$|R
40|$|Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the {{mechanical}} or electronic translation of scanned images of handwritten, typewritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text. OCR has many applications, such as enabling a text document {{in a physical}} form to be editable, or enabling computer searching on a computer of a text that was initially in printed form. OCR engines are widely used to digitize text documents {{so that they can}} be digitally stored for remote access, mainly for websites. This facilitates the availability of these invaluable resources instantly, no matter the geographical location of the end user. Huge OCR misclassification errors can occur when an OCR engine is used to digitize a document that is degraded. The degradation may be due to varied reasons, including aging of the paper, incomplete printed characters, and blots of ink on the original document. In this thesis, the degradation due to scanning text documents was considered. To improve the OCR performance, it is vital to train the classifier on a large training set that has significant data points similar to the degraded real-life characters. In this thesis, characters with varying degrees of blurring and binarization thresholds were generated and they were used to calculate Edge Spread degradation parameters. These parameters were then used to divide the training data set of the OCR engine into more homogeneous sets. The resulting classification accuracy by training on these smaller sets was analyzed. The training data set consisted of 100, 000 data points of 300 DPI, 12 point Sans <b>Serif</b> font lowercase <b>characters</b> ‘c and ‘e’. These characters were generated with random values of threshold and blur width with random Gaussian noise added. To group the similar degraded characters together, clustering was performed using the Isodata clustering algoirithm. The two edge-spread parameters, one calculated on isolated edges named DC, one calculated on edges in close proximity accounting for interference effects, named MDC, were estimated to fit the cluster boundaries. These values were then used to divide the training data and a Bayesian classifier was used for recognition. It was verified that MDC is slightly better than DC as a division parameter. A choice of either 2 or 3 partitions was found to be the best choice for dataset division. An experimental way to estimate the best boundary to divide the data set was determined and tests were conducted that verified it. Both crisp and fuzzy approaches for classifier training and testing were implemented and various combinations were tried with the crisp training and fuzzy testing being the best approach, giving a 98. 08 % classification rate for the data set divided into 2 partitions and 98. 93 % classification rate for the data set divided into 3 partitions in comparison to 94. 08 % for the classification of the data set with no divisions...|$|R
