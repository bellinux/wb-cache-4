500|$|Ian Douglas Smith {{was born}} on 8 April 1919 in Selukwe, a small mining and farming town about [...] {{southwest}} of the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury. He had two elder sisters, Phyllis and Joan. His father, John Douglas [...] "Jock" [...] Smith, originally came from Hamilton, Scotland; {{the son of a}} cattle breeder and butcher, he had emigrated to Rhodesia as an eighteen-year-old in 1898, and become a prominent rancher, butcher, miner and garage owner in Selukwe. Jock and his English wife, Agnes (née Hodgson), had met in 1907, when she was sixteen, a year after her family's emigration to Selukwe from Frizington, Cumberland. After Mr Hodgson sent his wife and children back to England in 1908, Jock Smith astonished them in 1911 by arriving unannounced in Cumberland to ask for Agnes' hand; they had not <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for three years. They married in Frizington, then returned together to Rhodesia, where Jock, an accomplished horseman, won the 1911 Coronation Derby at Salisbury.|$|E

By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved; Communist guerillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on walking the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order.

Rouass does not participate in any stunt work, but does appear in [...] "a lot of passionate scenes." [...] Having gotten used to filming sex scenes in Footballers' Wives, Rouass noticed that while humour was involved in Footballers' Wives, Spooks was more passionate and very choreographed.

500|$|Leigh's family, who {{had found}} out about the play, {{attended}} a private screening of it; some of them had not <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for two years. Leigh's mother Robyn objected to the fictionalisation of her daughter's murder, stating she would have preferred a documentary account. The rape and murder victim in A Property of the Clan was named Tracy, which Leigh's family also objected to, as 'Tracey' was the name of Leigh's cousin and best friend. One of Leigh's aunts asked Brian Joyce to change the character's name out of respect for the family, however, the name remain unchanged, even after the play was rewritten and retitled Blackrock. The local media reported on the family objections to the play, and the day after the play opened, Freewheels faced [...] "mounting disapproval", and attempted to distance themselves from Leigh's murder. Both Enright and Freewheels chairperson Sharon McMillan respond to the growing controversy. McMillan wrote in [...] The Newcastle Herald, stating that media coverage of the play was [...] "unfortunately" [...] focusing on Leigh's murder instead of the play's message, also stating that some people reporting on it in this manner had not even watched the play. Enright stated that while the comparison to Leigh's murder was of interest to the media, the play was actually about how any group of boys abuse any girl, and how they came to do it. Nevertheless many viewers considered the play to be a factual account of the murder. Even though the rape and murder were not shown in the play, the audience were said to be able to fill in their blanks from their knowledge of Leigh's killing.|$|E
500|$|Stump and Wentz met up for {{the first}} time in several years in early 2012 for a writing session. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a {{creative}} outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. [...] "I know what you need – you need your band," [...] Wentz told Stump. [...] "I think it's kind of weird that we haven't really <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> this year. We paid for each other's houses and you don't know my kid," [...] Wentz remarked. The result, [...] "three or four" [...] new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that [...] "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right." [...] Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form. The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: [...] "We didn't want to come back just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation," [...] said Stump. Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record. Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. As Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had a list of stipulations for rejoining the band. [...] "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music [...] then I don't want to," [...] he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition saying Trohman [...] "needed to be writing more." ...|$|E
