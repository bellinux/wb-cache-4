40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{development}} towards a common migration policy in the European Union reflects {{the emergence of a}} new form of regionalism resulting from the recent structural transformations in the global political economy. The European governments are caught in a web of contradictory interests and tendencies. On one side, the logic of global economic restructuring dictates continued deregulation and flexibilisation of the labour market, implying increased high levels of immigration. On the other hand, the political backlash against globalisation pushes towards a closure of the external borders. The result is the construction of a Fortress Europe, with a set of <b>specific</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>agreements</b> with the regions surrounding the European Union in order to regulate the inflow of migrants...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates when trade {{facilitation}} reform should be undertaken {{at the regional}} level. First, looking at both efficiency and implementation considerations, it confirms {{the perception that the}} regional dimension matters. Investigating where efficiency gains can be made, this research explains why national markets alone fail to produce the full scale economies and positive externalities of {{trade facilitation}} reform. Second, because trade facilitation policies need to address coordination and capacity failures, and because of the operational complexity challenge, the choice of the adequate platform for delivering reform is crucial. The lessons are that regional trade agreements offer good prospects of comprehensive and effective reform and can effectively complement multilateral and national initiatives. However, examples of implementation of trade facilitation reform in regional agreements do not seem to indicate that regional integration approaches have been more successful than trade facilitation through <b>specific</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>agreements</b> or other efforts, multilateral or unilateral. Customs unions may be an exception here, and the author suggests reasons why this could be the case.
