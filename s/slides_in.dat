5|$|The {{existing}} Dreamworld {{car park}} was redesigned to accommodate more {{cars and the}} addition of a water park in the southern portion. Construction of the water park began in January 2006. In June, two of the three slide towers were complete, with several <b>slides</b> <b>in</b> the early phases of construction. One month later, several attractions were announced by the park with others being speculated upon. Some attractions were nearing completion in September and all the planned attractions had been revealed by October.|$|E

25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides her ear for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. Like {{the best of}} her novelist peers... she <b>slides</b> <b>in</b> {{and out of her}} characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E
25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the <b>slides</b> <b>in</b> an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E

As such, Microsoft Office 2007 features server components for {{applications such as}} Excel, which work in conjunction with SharePoint Services, to provide a collaboration platform. SharePoint works with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, {{which is used to}} host a SharePoint site, and uses IIS and ASP.NET 2.0.

It features Excel Web Access, the client-side component which is used to render the worksheet on a browser, Excel Calculation Service which is the server side component which populates the worksheet with data and perform calculations, and Excel Web Services that extends Excel functionalities into individual web services. SharePoint {{can also be used to}} host Word documents for collaborative editing, by sharing a document. SharePoint can also be used to hold PowerPoint <b>slides</b> <b>in</b> a Slide Library, from which the slides can be used as a formatting template. It also notifies users of a slide automatically in case the source slide is modified. Also by using SharePoint, PowerPoint can manage shared review of presentations. Any SharePoint hosted document can be accessed from the application which created the document or from other applications such as a browser or Microsoft Office Outlook.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{proteins}} and specific mechanisms {{involved in their}} initial phases differ, the two pathways are similar in that they both require single-stranded DNA with a 3' end and the RecA protein for strand invasion. [...] The pathways are also similar in their phases of branch migration, in which the Holliday junction <b>slides</b> <b>in</b> one direction, and resolution, in which the Holliday junctions are cleaved apart by enzymes. [...] The alternative, non-reciprocal type of resolution may also occur by either pathway.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} via the SDSA pathway {{occurs in}} cells that divide through mitosis and meiosis {{and results in}} non-crossover products. [...] In this model, the invading 3' strand is extended along the recipient DNA duplex by a DNA polymerase, and is released as the Holliday junction between the donor and recipient DNA molecules <b>slides</b> <b>in</b> a process called branch migration. [...] The newly synthesized 3' end of the invading strand is then able to anneal to the other 3' overhang in the damaged chromosome through complementary base pairing. [...] After the strands anneal, a small flap of DNA can sometimes remain. [...] Any such flaps are removed, and the SDSA pathway finishes with the resealing, also known as ligation, of any remaining single-stranded gaps.|$|E

The first occurred {{at the end of}} August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the slide of 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle. It consisted of mainly rock and flowed three miles down the Klickitat Glacier and the Big Muddy Creek streambed. Both slides were estimated to have moved as much as [...] of material.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{picked it}} as one of Rebel Hearts best songs, calling it [...] "an expert {{evocation}} of her folktronica Y2K." [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone agreed, noting that [...] "Avicii helps Madonna revive the strums-and-beats vibe of 2000's Music." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine went further, calling it [...] "her best song in 15 years". He continued praising [...] "Devil Pray" [...] for [...] "reimagin The Animals as a folktronica band with witch-house tendencies... Her ruminations on salvation and the existential pitfalls of sniffing glue [...] rid an unexpected low-end groove." [...] Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club also saw the song as a highlight, describing it as a [...] "gospel-tinged, acoustic-guitar irresistible plea for salvation and divine guidance in the face of temptations such as drugs." [...] Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound considered [...] "Devil Pray" [...] one of Madonna's best release in years and its chorus as [...] "one of her strongest in decades". She praised [...] "Madonna's voice [...] is pitch-shifted into a ghostly echo— and unlike those 'Bitch' beats, the production <b>slides</b> <b>in</b> perfectly. It's one hell of a song about getting fucked up on every molecule imaginable, but it's also heavy with the longing for self-purification and direction." [...] The New York Times also shared this view, noting that the song [...] "showcase some of Madonna's best singing in years." [...] Saeed Saeed of The National felt that the song was similar to The Animals' version of [...] "The House of the Rising Sun" [...] and praised it for being a better country-dance song than Madonna's cover of Don McLean's [...] "American Pie".|$|E
