Baryon resonance particles are excited baryon states with <b>short</b> <b>half</b> lives and higher masses. Despite significant research, the fundamental degrees of freedom behind baryon excitation spectra are still poorly understood. The spin-parity JP (when known) is given with each particle.

5|$|Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area has trails for {{hiking and}} horseback riding. A <b>short,</b> <b>half</b> mile (800m) trail leads to Silver Springs near the park's east entrance. A longer, four mile (6.4km) trail follows {{the course of}} the Fox River through the park's wooded areas. The equestrian trail is located in the {{wildlife}} management area of the park and stretches seven miles (11km). A one-mile (1.6km) path travels through the prairie restoration area as well. During the winter, much of the park's trail system is open to cross-country skiing, and a four-mile (6km) trail is open to snowmobiling, weather permitting. When ice thickness permits, the lakes are opened to ice skating and ice fishing. Sledding is another popular activity; Toboggan Hill is located inside the park's east entrance.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new method of {{estimating}} noise variance. The method is applicable for 1 D and 2 D signal processing. The essence of this method is estimation of the scatter of normally distributed data with high level of outliers. The method is applicable to data {{with the majority of}} the data points having no signal present. The method is based on the <b>shortest</b> <b>half</b> sample method. The mean of the <b>shortest</b> <b>half</b> sample (shorth) and the location of the least median of squares are among the most robust measures of the location of the mode. The length of the <b>shortest</b> <b>half</b> sample has been used as the measurement of the data scatter of uncontaminated data. We show that computing the length of several sub samples of varying sizes provides the necessary information to estimate both the scatter and the number of uncontaminated data points in a sample. We derive the system of equations to solve for the data scatter and the number of uncontaminated data points for the Gaussian distribution. The data scatter is the measure of the noise variance. The method can be extended to other distributions...|$|R

25|$|The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} {{seems to}} play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Experiments in both animals and humans have established that NMDA antagonists such as ketamine and dextromethorphan can alleviate neuropathic pain and reverse opioid tolerance. Unfortunately, only a few NMDA antagonists are clinically available and their use is limited by a very <b>short</b> <b>half</b> life (dextromethorphan), weak activity (memantine) or unacceptable side effects (ketamine).|$|E
25|$|Each {{member of}} a {{generation}} has greater mass than the corresponding particles of lower generations. The first generation charged particles do not decay; hence all ordinary (baryonic) matter is made of such particles. Specifically, all atoms consist of electrons orbiting around atomic nuclei, ultimately constituted of up and down quarks. Second and third generation charged particles, on the other hand, decay with very <b>short</b> <b>half</b> lives, and are observed only in very high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay, and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.|$|E

This results in {{a significant reduction in}} the needed waste containment period in a geologic repository. The remaining 17% of waste products require only 300 years until reaching background levels. The radiotoxicity of the thorium fuel cycle waste is 10,000 times less than that of the uranium/plutonium fuel lifecycle.|$|E

The FDA of the US has placed it in category D. It is associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction, weight gain, anticholinergic side effects and drowsiness than the other SSRIs. Has a <b>short</b> <b>half</b> life compared to other SSRIs and hence is the most prone to causing withdrawal effects whenever a dose is missed. Paroxetine has the lowest affinity for the sigma-1 receptors of all the SSRIs. It also possesses the highest propensity of any SSRI for causing extrapyramidal symptoms. Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Flumazenil is very {{effective}} at reversing the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. One {{study found that}} only 10% of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for flumazenil. In this select population who are naive to and overdose solely on a benzodiazepine, it can be considered. Due to its <b>short</b> <b>half</b> life, the duration of action of flumazenil is usually less than 1 hour, and multiple doses may be needed. When flumazenil is indicated the risks can be reduced or avoided by slow dose titration of flumazenil. Due to risks and its many contraindications, flumazenil should be administered only after discussion with a medical toxicologist.|$|E

25|$|An eight-period table {{containing}} {{this block}} was suggested by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. IUPAC defines an element to exist if its lifetime {{is longer than}} 10−14 seconds, which is {{the time it takes}} for the nucleus to form an electron cloud. No elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature. The first element of the g-block may have atomic number 121, and thus would have the systematic name unbiunium. Elements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to radioactive decay, and have extremely <b>short</b> <b>half</b> lives, although element 126 is hypothesized to be within an island of stability that is resistant to fission but not to alpha decay. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, whether period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this may}} be seen as similar to neuroimaging techniques, {{molecular}} measures help to enhance areas of activation that would otherwise be indecipherable to neuroimaging. One such technique that aids in both the temporal and visual resolution of fMRI is the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response. Changes in the BOLD response can be seen when there is differing levels of activation in suspected areas of functioning. Energy is supplied to the brain in the form glucose and oxygen (which is transferred by hemoglobin). The blood supply is consistently regulated so that areas of activation receive higher amounts of energy compared to areas that are less activated. In positron emission tomography, the use of radionuclides (isotopes with <b>short</b> <b>half</b> lives) facilitates visual resolution. These radionuclides are attached to glucose, water and ammonia so that easy absorption into the activated brain areas is accomplished. Once these radioactive tracers are injected into the bloodstream, the efficiency and location of chemical processes can be observed using PET.|$|E
