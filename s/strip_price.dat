The price of a k-year dividend strip is {{the present value of}} the dividend paid in k years. The value of the stock market is the sum of all dividend <b>strip</b> <b>prices</b> across maturities. We study the properties of strips and find that expected returns, Sharpe ratios, and volatilities on short-term strips are higher than on the aggregate stock market, while their CAPM betas are well below one. Short-term <b>strip</b> <b>prices</b> are more volatile than their realizations, leading to excess volatility and return predictability. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} {{self-monitoring}} of blood glucose (SMBG) approached $ 8. 8 billion worldwide in 2008. Yet despite dramatic double-digit growth in sales of SMBG products since 1980, {{the business is}} now facing declining prices and slower dollar growth. Given that SMBG meters and test strips are viewed by consumers and insurers as essentially generic products, it will be extremely challenging for new market entrants to displace well-entrenched existing competitors without a truly innovative technology. Also, {{in the face of}} declining glucose test <b>strip</b> <b>prices,</b> market expansion can only occur through identification of more of the undiagnosed diabetes population and convincing existing diabetes patients to adopt glucose testing or to test more frequently. Ultimately, a combination of technology innovations, patient education, and economic incentives may be needed to significantly expand the SMBG market and build sustainable long-term dollar growth for SMBG vendors...|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 “The Term Structure of Equities” {{examines}} the term structure of equities. Using observed <b>prices</b> of dividend <b>strips,</b> <b>prices</b> of zero-coupon equities are extracted, and their yields and returns characteristics are documented. An affine term structure model {{is used to}} model the term structure of equities. The model is estimated, and model-implied equity yields and returns are shown to match the data well. However, the modelimplied long-run risk-neutral mean of the short rate is implausible. (The next chapter takes this into account and estimates bond and equity yield curves jointly using data on both zero-coupon bonds and zero-coupon equities.) Chapter 2 “Estimating a Unified Framework of Co-Pricing Stocks and Bonds” estimates a maximal identifiable affine term structure model that explains the joint prices of stocks and bonds. Using the test assets of Treasury bonds and dividend strips, it is shown that the estimated model can generally match the time series and cross-sectional properties of zero-coupon bonds, zero-coupon equities and the aggregate stock index. Moreover, imposing restrictions prevalent in the co-pricing literature on the maximal model enhances certain features of the model such as the high return of the short-term dividend strip, but reduces the model’s ability to fit {{other aspects of the}} data such as the level of the market risk premium. Chapter 3 “The Role of Asian Countries” Reserve Holdings on the International Yield Curves” studies the effect of Asian countries’ reserve holdings on the yield curves of six industrialized countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Switzerland and Australia. A Gaussian affine term structure model with three yield factors and three unspanned macro factors including reserves is estimated to fit the yield curve of each country. Impulse responses and variance decompositions show that Asian countries’ reserve holdings are an important factor affecting the international yield curves...|$|R

40|$|This {{synthetic}} {{appraisal of}} the collection of papers in this issue argues that historical injustice saturates the problem of climate change. Those most vulnerable to climate change today are largely those who already lack resources – {{who have been on}} the wrong end of colonial history, or who have been globalization’s losers, or who have suffered neglect, exclusion or simple rapacity at the hands of their own governments. They are those who have benefitted little or not at all from a carbon-intensive global economy, but who have long suffered its side effects – resource <b>stripping,</b> food <b>price</b> spikes, impoverishment and now the ravages of climate change. Following the other authors in this issue – and examining human rights law, trade law and the overarching ideal {{of the rule of law}} – the paper notes that the particular form taken by law in international and transnational affairs, having largely followed the historical progress of industrialism, colonialism and globalization, is peculiarly ill-suited to the task of addressing this vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|In Russia, {{the problem}} of {{corporate}} governance has become a frequent subject for discussion. Stories now abound about questionable corporate governance practices, such as share dilution, asset <b>stripping,</b> transfer <b>pricing,</b> complex ownership structures, limiting shareholders from attending the shareholders meetings. These practices, which have come to constitute corporate governance abuses to company shareholders, {{are considered to be}} factors adversely affecting the investment climate. At first glance, these non-transparent practices are a collection of independent cases of managerial malfeasance that are abusive to investors. However, {{there seems to be an}} internal logic in these widely used practices, as they have been functional for Russian corporates to navigate through circumstances characterised by an imperfect formal framework. The aim of this paper is to analyse such functionalities of the practices in light of an evolution of corporate Russia. Taking Yukos Oil Company as a case study, the paper demonstrates that resorting to these practices was instrumental in a process of ensuring corporate survival and strengthening market position by establishing a coherent corporate entity. This paper emphasises that these practices represent rational and logical responses by economic agents to the prevailing conditions shaped by policy choices, political and macroeconomic environment, and institutions...|$|R

50|$|Kidder's system {{incorrectly}} valued forward-dated transactions as if {{they were}} immediately settled, rather than taking into account the time value of money for the period before settlement of the trade. The method Jett followed was facilitated by this error. By buying US Treasury bond <b>strips</b> (whose <b>price</b> increases each day due to accretion), hedged by a short treasury bond position (whose price remains relatively stable over the settlement period), Jett was able to book immediate, illusory profits. Once settlement of the trade happened, any false profits immediately were reversed as a loss. Therefore, in order to continue to appear profitable, Jett had to engage in more and more such trades, enough to both offset the losses on the settling trades plus additional trades to keep delivering profits. For the scheme to persist, the size had to continually grow, and this is what eventually brought the scheme's downfall—Jett's trading size had become so large that General Electric, the owner of Kidder Peabody at the time, asked that he cut the size of his positions because of the bloating of GE's balance sheet. With no new trades to offset those settling and rolling off, the losses became apparent to Kidder senior management.|$|R
50|$|The {{toughness}} of {{the competition}} is apparent from examining other contemporary titles. The first issue of its stablemate Fantastic, published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero <b>strips),</b> a cover <b>price</b> which forced Fantastic to close within 18 months. Terrific, having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker. By contrast, the comics Dandy and Beano published by the rival DC Thomson organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. Fantastic and Terrific cost three times as much, which (even with {{double the number of}} pages, compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that Wham and Pow each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.|$|R
