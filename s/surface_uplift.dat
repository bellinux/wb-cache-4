5000|$|In {{order to}} have <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> of rock, the uplift rate must exceed the rate of exhumation.

The Transantarctic Mountains have {{experienced}} three major episodes of exhumation, also known as denudation. Geologists are able to estimate the timing of these events, as well as uplift events, using the method of Apatite fission track dating. [...] During the Cretaceous period (65-145 Ma), two separate denudation events occurred. Both episodes, one Early Cretaceous and the other Late Cretaceous, were great enough to cancel out any possible <b>surface</b> <b>uplift.</b> The third denudation event took place during the Early Cenozoic.

50|$|Features of deeper mantle {{dynamics}} such as plumes and delamination of {{the lower}} lithosphere have also been hypothesised to play important roles {{in the long term}} (> million year), large scale (thousands of km) evolution of the Earth's topography (see dynamic topography). Both can promote <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> through isostasy as hotter, less dense, mantle rocks displace cooler, denser, mantle rocks at depth in the Earth.|$|E
50|$|Understanding the {{principle}} of isostasy {{is a key element}} to understanding the interactions and feedbacks shared between erosion and tectonics. The principle of isostasy states that when free to move vertically, lithosphere floats at an appropriate level in the asthenosphere so that the pressure at a depth of compensation in the asthenosphere well below the base of the lithosphere is the same. Isostatic uplift is both a cause and an effect of erosion. When deformation occurs in the form of crustal thickening an isostatic response is induced causing the thickened crust to sink, and surrounding thinner crust to uplift. The resulting <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> leads to enhanced elevations, which in turn induces erosion. Alternatively, when a large amount of material is eroded away from the Earth's <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> occurs in order to maintain isostatic equilibrium. Because of isostasy, high erosion rates over significant horizontal areas can effectively suck up material from the lower crust and/or upper mantle. This process is known as isostatic rebound and is analogous to Earth's response following the removal of large glacial ice sheets.|$|E
50|$|A {{landscape}} evolution {{model is}} a physically based numerical model that simulates changing terrain {{over the course of}} time. This can be due to glacial erosion and deposition; erosion, sediment transport, and deposition in fluvial systems such as rivers; regolith production; the movement of material on hillslopes; more intermittent events such as rockfalls, debris flows, landslides, and other surface processes. This can also be due to <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> and/or subsidence. A typical landscape evolution model takes many of these factors into account.|$|E
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} {{variations of the}} flow of Hansbreen, a tidewater glacier in southern Spitsbergen, Svalbard, are investigated. During summer 1999, surface flow velocities were measured in the ablation zone of Hansbreen with a temporal resolution of 3 – 4 hours. Short events with strongly increased surface velocities and a typical duration of 1 – 2 days were observed. These "speed-up events" are related to periods of strongly increased water input to the glacier, due to rainfall or enhanced surface melt. A close relation is found between the surface velocities and water pressure recorded in a moulin. However, there are indications from a short time lag between velocity and water-pressure peak as well as from observed vertical <b>surface</b> <b>uplifts</b> that basal motion is related to basal water storage rather than directly to basal water pressure. The observed short-term velocity variations and associated processes on Hansbreen are very similar to those observed on land-based valley glaciers and suggest that the relevant mechanisms and physical processes that control the flow and its temporal variations are similar. In contrast to the flow of land-based glaciers, sliding velocities on Hansbreen are observed to be high all year round and velocities increase towards the calving front...|$|R

5000|$|Rift flank uplift {{occurs when}} the crust {{on the side of}} a rift zone converges with a {{stronger}} crust, usually resulting in crustal thickening and a subduction zone.

50|$|Prior to rifting, {{enormous}} continental flood basalts erupted on the <b>surface</b> and <b>uplift</b> of the Ethiopian, Somalian, and East African plateaus occurred. The {{first stage}} of rifting of the EAR is characterized by rift localization and magmatism along the entire rift zone. Periods of extension alternated with times of relative inactivity. There was also the reactivation of a pre-Cambrian weakness in the crust, a suture zone of multiple cratons, displacement along large boundary faults, {{and the development of}} deep asymmetric basins. The second stage of rifting is characterized by the deactivation of large boundary faults, the development of internal fault segments, and the concentration of magmatic activity towards the rifts.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of surface deformation associated with intruding magma {{has become an}} established method to study subsurface processes and intrusion architecture. Active subsurface magmatism induces deformation that is commonly modeled using static elastic models. To what extent, Coulomb failure of the crust affects surface deformation remains, so far, largely unexplored. In this contribution we present quantitative laboratory results of surface deformation induced by the emplacement of simulated dikes and cone sheets in a cohesive Coulomb material. The {{analysis of}} the experimental surface deformation shows that these intrusion types produce distinct and characteristic surface deformation signatures, which reflect {{the evolution of the}} intrusion at depth. Generally, dikes show a two-phase evolution while cone sheets develop gradually. In comparison, cone sheets induce larger uplifted areas and volumes than dikes relative to the depth of the injection source. Dike formation is, in turn, is likely accommodated, to a larger degree than cone sheets, by lateral opening of the host consistent with our current understanding of dike emplacement mechanics. Notably, only <b>surface</b> <b>uplifts</b> develop above the experimental dikes, consistent with a viscous indenter propagation mechanism, that is, a dike pushing ahead. The measured surface deformation patterns associated with dikes starkly contrast with established static, elastic models that predict local subsidence above the tip of a dike. This suggests that Coulomb failure of crustal rocks may considerably affect surface deformation induced by propagating igneous intrusions. This is especially relevant when a relatively high viscosity magma intrudes a weak host, such as unconsolidated sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks...|$|R

50|$|Crustal thickening, {{which for}} example is {{currently}} {{occurring in the}} Himalaya due to the continental collision between the Indian and the Eurasian plates, {{can also lead to}} surface uplift; but due to the isostatic sinking of thickened crust, the magnitude of <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> will only be about one-sixth of the amount of crustal thickening. Therefore, in most convergent settings isostatic uplift plays a relatively small role and high peak formation can be more attributed to tectonic processes. Direct measures of the elevation change of the land surface can only be used to estimate erosion or bedrock uplift rates when other controls (such as changes in mean surface elevation, volume of eroded material, time scales and lags of isostatic response, variations in crustal density) are known.|$|E
5000|$|The St. Elias Mountains is {{the highest}} coastal {{mountain}} range on Earth. It formed due to the subduction of the Yakutat microplate underneath the North American Plate. The Yakutat microplate is a wedge shaped oceanic plateau with 20-30 km thickness. Similar to the adjacent Pacific plate (7 km crustal thickness) the Yakutat plate is currently moving northwestward with a rate of ~50 mm/year with respect to North America. The Yakutat plate is transported northwards along the active Fairweather Fault, which probably started more than 35 million years ago. Due to its thickness the Yakutat plate is buoyant resulting in <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> of the overriding North American plate, which formed the Talkeetna Mountains and the Alaska Range in southcentral Alaska located above the subducted part of the Yakutat plate.|$|E
50|$|Breakup of the super-continent Gondwana {{started in}} the early Jurassic around 184 million years ago (Ma), but Antarctica did not break up from Australia until the late Cretaceous (80 Ma). Just before the {{breakaway}} in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, rifting began to occur near the soon-to-be Transantarctic Mountains. It is uncertain whether this first episode of rifting caused any uplift of the mountain range. Some researchers say this episode is a reactivation of rift that was formed during the Gondwanide Orogeny, but {{it has never been}} proven. This event was followed by low-angle extensional faulting along the East Antarctic plate. No uplift occurred during this initial phase of faulting due to counteracting erosional events. Shortly after, during the Mid Cretaceous (100 Ma), the West Antarctic Rift began to form. Certain models show that the rapid rifting and intense thermal forces are due to a shallow (50 km depth) lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary under the Transantarctic Mountains. Rifting in this area is still going on today. Such a long period of rifting leads to uplift due to prolonged lateral heat conduction in the mountain belt. This is backed by seismic evidence. Initial <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> began approximately 55 Ma during the Early Cenozoic era.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of the mid-Norwegian volcanic Vøring margin {{at the onset of}} the Maastrichtian-Paleocene extension phase reflects the cumulative effect of earlier consecutive rifting events. Lateral structural differences present on the margin at that time are a consequence of migration of the location of maximum extension in time between Norway and Greenland. The most important imprints (Moho depth, thermal structure) of these events on the lithosphere are incorporated in a numerical simulation of the final extension phase. We focus on a possible mechanism of formation of the Vøring Marginal High and address the relationship between spatial and temporal evolution of crustal thinning and thickening, <b>uplift</b> of the <b>surface</b> and strength of the lithosphere. It is found that the Vøring Basin formed the s trongest part of the margin which explains why the Maastrichtian-Paleocene rift axis was not located here but instead jumped westward with respect to the earlier rift axes locations. The modeling study predicts that local crustal thickening during extension can be expected when large lateral thermal variations are present in the lithosphere at the onset of extension. Negative buoyancy induced by lateral temperature differences increases downwelling adjacent to the rifting zone; convergence of material at the particular part of the margin is mainly taken up by the lower crust. The model shows that during the final phase of extension, the crust in the Vøring Marginal High area was thickened and the <b>surface</b> <b>uplifted.</b> It is likely that this dynamic process and the effects of magmatic intrusions both acted in concert to form the Marginal High. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|The whole Aegean Region is {{at present}} {{undergoing}} a N-S crustal stretching. During {{the last few}} years also in Thessaly (central continental Greece) specific geological, structural and morphological investigations have emphasised the existence of several recent and active faults. Though still in progress, a multi-approach neotectonic research has been carried out and almost completed. The first undertaking was a structural survey in order to detect and map all major and minor tectonic structures existing in the area; the main result is a structural map of Thessaly. Second step was to reconstruct the tectonic stratigraphy at least from Pliocene to Present and compare it with the evolution of the Aegean region. The existence of two tectonic phases has been documented: an older one during Pliocene-Lower Pleistocene? with a NE-SW direction of the sigma 3, and a younger phase from Middle Pleistocene to Present with a N-S sigma 3 direction. The next step was to detect and separate all faults showing features of recent activity and to understand their geometry and kinematics. For this purpose, a detailed structural and morphotectonic survey at the scale 1 : 5. 000 has been carried out for all these structures which have been recognised both from aerial photos and directly in the field. Most of the faults generated during this tectonic phase are trending E-W to ESE-WNW. Locally, NW-SE or even NNW-SSE structures, inherited from older phases, have been also reactivated. All the faults show clear evidences of recent tectonic activity such as triangular facets, morphological scarps and scarplets, almost unweathered sliding <b>surfaces,</b> <b>uplifted</b> and entrenched young deposits, open fractures and joints as well as outcropping faulting of Late Quaternary sediments.

40|$|The {{timing and}} {{duration}} of <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> associated with large igneous provinces provide important constraints on mantle convection processes. Here we review geological indicators of <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> associated with five continent-based magmatic provinces: Emeishan Traps (260 million years ago: Ma), Siberian Traps (251 Ma), Deccan Traps (65 Ma), North Atlantic (Phase 1, 61 Ma and Phase 2, 55 Ma), and Yellowstone (16 Ma to recent). All five magmatic provinces were associated with <b>surface</b> <b>uplift.</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>uplift</b> can be measured directly from sedimentary indicators of sea-level in the North Atlantic and from geomorpholocial indicators of relative uplift and tilting in Yellowstone. In the other provinces, <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> is inferred from the record of erosion. In the Deccan, North Atlantic and Emeishan provinces, transient uplift that results from variations in thermal structure of the lithosphere and underlying mantle can be distinguished from permanent uplift that results from the extraction and emplacement of magma. Transient <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> is more useful in constraining mantle convection since models of melt generation and emplacement are not required for its interpretation. Observations of the spatial and temporal relationships between <b>surface</b> <b>uplift,</b> rifting and magmatism are also important in constraining models of LIP formation. Onset of <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> preceded magmatism in all five of the provinces. Biostratigraphic constraints on timing of uplift and erosion are best for the North Atlantic and Emeishan Provinces, where the time interval between significant uplift and first magmatism is less than 1 million years and 2. 5 million years respectively. Rifting post-dates the earliest magmatism {{in the case of}} the North Atlantic Phase 1 and possibly in the case of Siberia. The relative age of onset of offshore rifting is not well constrained for the Deccan and the importance of rifting in controlling magmatism is disputed in the Emeishan and Yellowstone Provinces. In these examples, rifting is not a requirement for onset of LIP magmatism but melting rates are significantly increased when rifting occurs. Models that attempt to explain emplacement of these five LIPs without hot mantle supplied by mantle plumes often have difficulties in explaining the observations of <b>surface</b> <b>uplift,</b> rifting and magmatism. For example, small-scale convection related to craton or rift boundaries (edge-driven convection) cannot easily explain widespread (1000 km scale) transient <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> (Emeishan, Deccan, North Atlantic), and upper mantle convection initiated by differential incubation beneath cratons (the hotcell model) is at odds with rapid onset of <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> (Emeishan, North Atlantic). The start-up plume concept is still the most parsimonious way of explaining the observations presented here. However, observations of <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> cannot directly constrain the depth of origin of the hot mantle in a plume head. The short time interval between onset of transient <b>surface</b> <b>uplift</b> and magmatism in the North Atlantic and Emeishan means that the associated starting plume heads were probably not large (c. 1000 km diameter) roughly spherical diapirs and are likely to have formed narrow (c. 100 km radius) upwelling jets, with hot mantle then spreading rapidly outward within the asthenosphere. In cases where rifting post-dates magmatism (N Atlantic Phase 1) or where the degree of lithospheric extension may not have been great (Siberia), a secondary mechanism of lithospheric thinning, such as gravitational instability or delamination of the lower lithosphere, may be required to allow hot mantle to decompress sufficiently to explain the observed volume of magma with a shallow melting geochemical signature. Any such additional thinning mechanisms are probably a direct consequence of plume head emplacement...|$|E
