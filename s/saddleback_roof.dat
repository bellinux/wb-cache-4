50|$|The station {{building}} is a single-storey, wooden-boarded affair. It is topped with a flat, slate-covered, <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> {{is usually}} on a tower, with a ridge and two sloping sides, {{producing}} a gable at each end.|$|E
50|$|Various {{elements}} of the château de l'Hers attest to the occupation of this strategically important location as a control point for river traffic, since late Antiquity at the latest. Several tombs with <b>saddleback</b> <b>roofs</b> form a small 6th-7th necropolis {{not far from the}} first known chapel of the château, dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian. An excavation of this ruined church found lithic industries, and sherds from antiquity and the Iron Age, fragments of Tegula tiles and a cipolin cladding probably dating to Antiquity were re-used in the masonry. A large number of weapons, coins and medals were found in the area. The tollgate on the Rhône was put in place in 79 AD under Vespasian, according to V. Millet (1864).|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} bachelor's thesis is a {{detached}} house in Tlumačov. The house is {{designed as a}} partly cellared two-storey building. Roofing {{of the house is}} partly designed with a <b>saddleback</b> and flat <b>roof.</b> Vertical and horizontal structures are made of the Porotherm system. All constructions comply with the applicable ČSN standards...|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{of the church is}} largely red brick with stone dressings, and the roof is tiled. The tower with its <b>saddleback</b> gabled <b>roof</b> is in the North German style, with three arcaded openings to the belfry and plate tracery above. The detail of the nave, chancel and aisles is Early English revival. The nave has four bays with narrow aisles. The chancel is situated beneath the tower. It has a polygonal apse with plate tracery. The west end has three lancet windows, with a plate tracery rose window above. The aisles and clerestory have pointed windows in pairs.|$|R
50|$|The {{bell tower}} is {{substantially}} Norman but the upper stages were remodelled in the 14th century. The tower has a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
50|$|The tower has a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> {{topped by}} a flèche. It has three bells, all cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough in 1899.|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} built between 1862 and 1863 to designs by the {{architect}} George Frederick Bodley. It comprises a north tower, <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof,</b> nave with clerestory, aisle and chancel. The west end contains a rose window.|$|E
50|$|The parish church, on {{a hilltop}} site, is {{dedicated}} to Saint Petroc and dates from the 14th century though it was subjected to heavy restoration in the 1880s. Its most notable feature is the <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> to the tower, which is rare in Devon.|$|E
50|$|The tower has a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> {{and three}} bells. Henry I Bagley of Chacombe cast the second bell in 1636. John Briant of Hertford cast the treble bell in 1790. Robert Taylor, who had {{foundries}} at Oxford and St Neots, cast the tenor bell in 1826.|$|E
50|$|Jenkin Chapel was {{constructed}} of local gritstone in 1733. It has an external flight of steps {{leading to a}} gallery (a small tower with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> was added in 1754-55). Originally dedicated to St. John the Baptist, it was consecrated in 1894 and re-dedicated to St. John the Evangelist.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} a hallenkirche (hall church). Above the nave and two aisles rises a monumental <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> The high western tower was a symbol for {{the power and the}} wealth of the {{citizens}} of the town. It {{is still one of the}} highest towers in Lower-Saxony and a landmark of the city.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is built}} in {{sandstone}} with a Kerridge stone-slate roof. The nave and chancel are in one range of five bays. On the south {{wall is a}} porch. At the west end is a tower with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> and there are louvres in the bell-openings. [...] The tower contains one bell.|$|E
50|$|A two-storey {{gabled roof}} {{construction}} from 1839 {{connects to the}} main building. In the early 20th century another <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> building for a festival hall with space for 250 guests was erected; the Art Nouveau door {{at the entrance to}} the old building was originally part of this component. The beer garden hosts further 400 guests.|$|E
50|$|Hose House No. 12, {{also known}} as Bassemier's Gas Grills, Inc., is a {{historic}} fire station located at Evansville, Indiana. It was designed by the noted architecture firm Harris & Shopbell and built in 1908. It is a two-story, rectangular red brick building with an arched entranceway. It features a campanile style tower with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> that one housed the station's bells.|$|E
50|$|In the 13th {{century the}} two-bay nave was lengthened, {{possibly}} when the tower was added around 1240. The chancel was widened {{around the same}} period. Some of the Romanesque fabric of the original Norman building can be seen despite the remodelling in the early 17th century. The walls show herringbone pattern masonry. The three-stage tower has corner buttresses and a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tongkonan are customarily built facing north-south. Dominating {{the entire}} {{structure}} is the <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> with gables that are dramatically upswept. The internal space is small {{in comparison with}} the overwhelming roof structure that covers it. Interiors are typically cramped and dark with few windows, however, most of daily life is lived outside the homes, with interiors simply intended for sleeping, storage, meetings and occasionally protection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church has}} a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> with a {{defensive}} intent. The {{interior of the}} church contained medieval wall paintings, including scriptural quotations and vine-leaf patterns, but these were destroyed during the Victorian era. Eighteenth-century maps show the church in its present location, near a mill, which went out of use in the 19th century, and [...] "Great House", which was demolished at a similar date.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} long and narrow, {{constructed}} in stone with slate roofs. It has a simple plan consisting of a nave, and a chancel with a south porch. On the west gable is a bellcote with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> Its Norman features include the south and north doorways (the north is blocked), and slit windows towards {{the east end of}} the north and south walls of the chancel.|$|E
50|$|The {{church of}} St. Michael and All Angels {{is within the}} Oundle Deanery, in the Peterborough diocese. The church {{consists}} of chancel 27 ft. by 16 ft. with a modern vestry on the south side, clearstoried nave 36 ft. 6 in. by 19 ft., north and south aisles each 12 ft. 6 in. wide, north porch, and west tower with <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> 15 ft. by 14 ft. 6 in., all these measurements being internal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tower to}} the west is of ashlar. It sits on a {{chamfered}} plinth and has two stages, with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> There are small slit windows on {{the north and south}} sides. An inscription reads [...] "THIS WAS BUILT BY JOHN HADEN MASON JOHN FREEMAN AND JOHN HOSKINS BEING WARDENS A.D. OI 1587". The church sits on a steep slope and there is a crypt in the ground beneath the chancel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{authors of}} the Buildings of England series comment that the church and parish rooms have [...] "a mismash of an exterior". [...] The church is {{constructed}} in yellow sandstone with red sandstone dressings. The architectural style is Free Perpendicular. Standing to the southwest of the church are single-storey parish rooms, from which rises a tower with an open bell stage and a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> Inside the church is stained glass installed in 1974 and designed by Brian Clark.|$|E
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the chapel is more that of a Georgian farmhouse with a chimney stack than a church. [...] It consists of a two-storey nave, a one-storey chapel and vestry, and a three-stage tower with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> [...] The tower has an external staircase, a bell chamber and a porch with stone benches. [...] A chimney rises {{from the middle of}} the south wall. [...] The windows are Georgian in style, with sashes and small panes of glass.|$|E
5000|$|Tongkonan is the {{traditional}} ancestral house, or rumah adat of the Torajan people, in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Tongkonan have a distinguishing boat-shaped and oversized <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> Like most of Indonesia’s Austronesian-based traditional architecture tongkonan are built on piles. The construction of tongkonan is laborious work and it is usually built {{with the help of}} all family members. In the original Toraja society, only nobles had the right to build tongkonan. Commoners live in smaller and less decorated homes called banua.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{condition}} of the structures it has proved difficult to determine the original plan, but the remains suggest that it was originally a simple rectangle of suitable size for a building such as an early hall-house. Craigie Castle may originally have been a hall-house of the late 12th or early 13th century with a wide crenellate parapet enclosing a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> During the 15th century it seems that these crenellations were built over and a new hall fashioned on the walls of its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|Although still {{commanding}} great prestige in {{a ritual}} sense, the tongkonan, like many traditional Indonesian housing styles, has a small, dark and smoky interior, and consequently is losing favour amongst contemporary Torajans. Instead, many Torajan villagers {{are choosing to}} live in a single storey 'Pan-Indonesia' style residence. The more spacious, brighter and more ventilated bugis-type dwelling is also increasingly being adopted. An approach more in line with tradition is to add an extra storey and a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> which fulfils contemporary expectations of space and brightness, while maintaining the prestige of a tongkonan.|$|E
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} Saint Mary dates {{from at least}} 1074. The {{original}} church was demolished and completely rebuilt, but both the chancel and the bell tower of the present building contain small amounts of re-used Norman stonework. The present Early English Gothic chancel was built late in the 12th or early in the 13th century. The tower has a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> {{and may have been}} built in the 13th or 14th century. The present nave was built in 1793 and has a west gallery that was added in 1834.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church was}} {{designed}} by the Lancaster architect Henry Paley of Austin and Paley, and built between 1925 and 1926. Plans {{had been made in}} 1923 for a church with a spire, which would have cost about £6,500 (...) , but these were scaled back, and the planned spire was replaced by a tower with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> The new church replaced a smaller church built in 1765, and the site was given by Major T. Fermor-Hesketh. The tower was completed by the same architect in 1935 at a cost of £721.|$|E
5000|$|A {{church has}} been present on the site {{since at least the}} Norman era. Most of the fabric of the present church dates from the 15th century, with {{elements}} remaining from the Norman period and from the 13th century. The tower was rebuilt in 1722. In 1885-87 the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin added a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> to the tower. They also carried out an extensive restoration that included adding an organ loft and a vestry, repairing walls, adding windows, fittings and a floor, and removing the ceiling. The restoration cost £3,269 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} periods of the {{construction}} of the church. The longitudinal hall nave with five bays was built during the first period, approximately between 1360 and 1376. A small tower was located on the <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> And thus the nave could temporarily work as an individual church, although it did not possess a presbytery. The construction of a tower on {{the southern part of the}} church was initiated after several years. The presbytery was finished during the second period, approximately in the second quarter of the 14th century. The whole church was finished in 1390.|$|E
50|$|The three-storey {{building}} having magnificent proportions has a double-arched pediment on {{the market}} side with an open arcade, arched in Gothic style. On top of the arches, ten sculptures, decoratively patterned, are supported on columns. Originally, the longitudinal building faҫade at the Langenstrasse was decorated and structured by two dormers which were, however, not preserved. The lower portion of the Langenstrasse faҫade consists of clinker-bricks. The <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> originally had several dormers which were replaced lateron by more modern, higher dormers. The portal being the representative main entrance to the Disconto Bank at the Langenstrasse consists of three sections. It is framed by columns bearing allegoric sculptures.|$|E
50|$|The west front {{dominates the}} east side of Bishop's Stortford with its tall, broad central tower and {{distinctive}} steep <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof,</b> and three impressively tall lancets. The use of Kentish ragstone facings creates a monumental effect, reinforced by buttresses that flank the aisles and chancel. At the south west entrance there is a 19th-century timber lych gate, which is {{the only part of the}} original 1851 church that was not damaged by fire. Indeed, Dykes Bower's brief included the need to use the remains of the old church, a strategy he later employed when rebuilding the destroyed church of St John the Evangelist Church, Newbury.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} built in red ashlar {{sandstone}} with a slate roof. Its plan is cruciform, with short transepts and a west tower. It has an eight-bay arcade which {{takes in the}} nave and the chancel. The tower is in three stages with a steep <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> The entrance to the church is through the west door of the tower, above which are three lancet windows. Above these are three-light louvred bell openings and a balustrade. The windows in the gables of the chancel and transepts are rose windows containing stained glass. Elsewhere the windows are lancets. [...] At the east end are two lancets separated by a large shaft.|$|E
5000|$|The Church of England parish of Saint Mary the Virgin {{was created}} by Order in Council on 1 September 1857. It was the largest parish {{in the city and}} {{comprised}} Boongate/Eastgate, Eastfield and Newark (then an outlying village) to the east of Peterborough city centre. A church was commissioned as a [...] "poor church" [...] for the parish and its foundation stone was laid on 30 September 1859. It was designed by the Gothic Revival architect Ewan Christian, built of relatively cheap local stone, and consecrated on 7 August 1860. It had a nave, apse and south aisle, and in 1883 a tower with a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof</b> was added.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in slate rubble, with red stone dressings. The west front is rendered. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave, a south aisle, a chancel, a south transept, with a tower at the northwest corner, and a west porch. The tower has a <b>saddleback</b> <b>roof.</b> Inside the church, the arches of the arcade are in brick. The carved wooden reredos dates from 1908. Also in the church is a painting of the Descent from the Cross. The stained glass is by William Wailes. The two manual organ was built in 1866 by Wilkinson, and was moved from the west end to the chancel in 1890. The lychgate is a First World War memorial.|$|E
