5000|$|Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is an {{infrared}} spectroscopy technique used on powder samples with no preparation. The sample {{is added to}} a <b>sample</b> <b>cup</b> and the data is collected on the bulk sample. The infrared light on a sample is reflected and transmitted at different amounts depending on the bulk properties of the material. The diffuse reflection is produced by the sample's rough surfaces' reflection of the light in all directions and is collected by use of an ellipsoid or paraboloid mirror. Shape, compactness, refractive index, reflectivity and absorption of the particles are all characteristic of the material being analyzed. If the sample is too absorbent, then it can be diluted with a nonabsorbent material such as potassium bromide, potassium chloride, etc. The particle size should be smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, so this would infer {{that it should be}} less than 5 µm for mid-range infrared spectroscopy. The spectra are plotted in units of log inverse reflectance (log 1/R) versus wavenumber. Alternative plots of Kubelka-Munk units can be used, which relate reflectance to concentration using a scaling factor.|$|E

A sample of liquid metal is removed from the furnace or ladle and poured into a <b>sample</b> <b>cup</b> with a thermocouple embedded in it. The temperature is then monitored, and the phase diagram arrests (liquidus, eutectic, and solidus) are noted. From this information chemical composition based on the phase diagram can be calculated, or the crystalline structure of the cast sample can be estimated especially for silicon morphology in hypo-eutectic Al-Si cast alloys. [...] Strictly speaking these measurements are cooling curves and a form of sample controlled thermal analysis whereby the cooling rate of the sample is dependent on the cup material (usually bonded sand) and sample volume which is normally a constant due to the use of standard sized sample cups.To detect phase evolution and corresponding characteristic temperatures,cooling curve and its first derivative curve should be considered simultaneously. Examination of cooling and derivative curves is done by using appropriate data analysis software.

To address this, we performed a numerical study to evaluate the uncertainties associated with suction <b>cup</b> <b>sampling</b> in heterogeneous soils under atmospheric boundary conditions using two pesticides with contrasting sorption and degradation properties. To address the two main operation modes of suction <b>cup</b> <b>sampling,</b> continuous and weekly sampling were analyzed. First, the variability of pesticide breakthrough concentrations was analyzed for a single pesticide application in a physically heterogeneous soil profile. Second, a 10 -yr time series was used to analyze repeated pesticide applications, and estimate variability in the leached mass fraction (LMF) and mean concentrations. In both cases, pesticide break-through was compared to the breakthrough of an inert tracer. The results indicate that for a single pesticide application, pore water velocities varied only slightly for all operation sampling modes and compounds.
