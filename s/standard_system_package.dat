40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{application of}} superconducting {{magnetic energy storage}} (SMES) unit to improve power system performance. The application of SMES unit in mitigating voltage sags and in damping dynamic oscillations in power systems is discussed. To show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed controller in providing continuous voltage regulation and in enhancing power system dynamics, a three-phase short circuit is applied to the system and simulation is carried out with and with no SMES connected to the system. The results of these investigations are studied using the well-developed graphic facilities available in an industry <b>standard</b> power <b>system</b> <b>package,</b> namely PSCAD/EMTDC. Results have shown that SMES unit can effectively improve system stability and power quality of power systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the timely issue of modeling {{and analysis of}} custom power controllers, {{a new generation of}} power electronics-based equipment aimed at enhancing the reliability and quality of power flows in low-voltage distribution networks. The modeling approach adopted in the paper is graphical in nature, as opposed to mathematical models embedded in code using a high-level computer language. The well-developed graphic facilities available in an industry <b>standard</b> power <b>system</b> <b>package,</b> namely PSCAD/EMTDC, are used to conduct all aspects of model implementation and to carry out extensive simulation studies. Graphics-based models suitable for electromagnetic transient studies are presented for the following three custom power controllers: the distribution static compensator (D-STATCOM), the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), and the solid-state transfer switch (SSTS). Comprehensive results are presented to assess the performance of each device as a potential custom power solution. The paper is written in a tutorial style and aimed at the large PSCAD/EMTDC user base...|$|R
40|$|Integrated full {{electric}} propulsion systems are being introduced across both civil and military marine sectors. <b>Standard</b> power <b>system</b> analysis <b>packages</b> cover electrical and electromagnetic components but have limited models of mechanical subsystems and their controllers. Hence, electromechanical system {{interactions between the}} prime movers, power network, and driven loads are poorly understood. This paper reviews available models of the propulsion drive system components: the power converter, motor, propeller, and ship. Due to {{the wide range of}} time constants in the system, reduced-order models of the power converter are required. A new model using state-averaged models of the inverter and a hybrid model of the rectifier is developed to give an effective solution combining accuracy with speed of simulation and an appropriate interface to the electrical network model. Simulation results for a typical ship maneuver are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{operation and}} control strategies of an offshore wind farm interconnected to a high-voltage dc (HVDC) system. The offshore wind farm composed of variable speed wind turbines driving permanent magnet synchronous generators is considered in this study, based on dc-bus concept. The HVDC transmission {{system based on}} a three-level neutral point clamped voltage source converter (VSC) {{is used for the}} interconnection between the offshore wind farm and onshore grid. Detailed modeling and control strategies are developed for the individual component of the overall system. A simple fuzzy logic controller is adopted in the offshore VSC station, {{which is one of the}} salient features of this study. Real wind speed data is used in the simulation study to obtain realistic response. Both dynamic and transient analyses of the proposed system are carried out using the laboratory <b>standard</b> power <b>system</b> software <b>package,</b> PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{application}} packages {{are used to}} improve business processes and to reduce costs for information <b>systems.</b> <b>Standard</b> application <b>packages</b> {{in the form of}} ERP systems (Enterprise Resource Planning systems) are common among private sector organizations. Public sector organizations use standard {{application packages}} developed for specific areas of government operations. Today, the design, use and distribution of standard application pack-ages are changing due to the emergence of service orientation. In the private sector, ERP systems are extended to include IT services. In the public sector, standard application packages are integrated with IT services which are often referred to as e-Government. E-Government can be extended with mobile technology to add mobility to public processes, so called m-Government. The problem addressed in this thesis is how to improve organiza-tional effectiveness through the use of standard application packages and IT services. The objectives are to...|$|R

Improvements to the graphics since the release of Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories include new animations, faster load times, a longer draw distance, reductions in clumping of pedestrians and vehicles, more complex explosions, and increases in the density of objects, vehicles, and NPCs. Like the game's predecessor, the PSP version of Vice City Stories features a multiplayer mode, for up to 6 players through WiFi ad-hoc mode (local area). The game features 10 different modes of wireless multiplayer gaming, which incorporate the use of automobiles, aircraft, and water-based vehicles. Various pedestrian and character models from the single player mode are available as player avatars. These multiplayer modes are not included in the PS2 version.|$|R
