25|$|New Zealand police uniforms {{formerly}} {{followed the}} British model closely but, since the 1970s, {{a number of}} changes have been implemented. These include {{the adoption of a}} medium blue shade in place of dark blue, the abolition of custodian helmets and the substitution of <b>synthetic</b> <b>leather</b> jackets for silver buttoned tunics when on ordinary duty. The normal headdress is a peaked cap with blue and white dicing and silver badge. Baseball caps and Akubra wide-brimmed hats are authorized for particular duties or climatic conditions. Stab resistant and high visibility vests are normally worn on duty.|$|E
25|$|Vegans may avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials, such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, <b>synthetic</b> <b>leather</b> (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials, such as cork, piña(from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>leathers,</b> {{at times}} made from plastics, {{are often used}} in {{clothing}} and fabrics. Artificial leather is marketed under many names, including [...] "leatherette", [...] "faux leather", [...] "vegan leather", [...] "PU leather" [...] and [...] "pleather".|$|R
50|$|Some vegetarians, vegans {{and animal}} rights activists and groups such as PETA, boycott and promote the boycotting of all leather products, arguing {{that the use of}} leather is unjustifiable. They {{encourage}} the use of alternative materials such as <b>synthetic</b> <b>leathers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} of DMF is as a solvent with low {{evaporation}} rate. DMF {{is used in}} the production of acrylic fibers and plastics.

25|$|Entering the pro circuit, Djokovic {{used the}} Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed {{sponsors}} to Wilson in 2005. He couldn't find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson {{agreed to make}} him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head. After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign. Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Leather</b> Grip as a replacement grip. In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.|$|E
2500|$|His {{next big}} break {{came when he}} {{replaced}} Perry Como in the Freddy Carlone band in Cleveland in 1937; Como made a call to Carlone about Laine. Como was another lifelong friend of Laine's, who once lent Laine the money to travel to a possible gig. Laine's rhythmic style was ill-suited to the sweet sounds of the Carlone band, and the two soon parted company. Success continued to elude Laine, and {{he spent the next}} 10 years [...] "scuffling"; alternating between singing at small jazz clubs on both coasts and a series of jobs, including those of a bouncer, dance instructor, used car salesman, agent, <b>synthetic</b> <b>leather</b> factory worker, and machinist at a defense plant. It was while working at the defense plant during the Second World War that he first began writing songs ("It Only Happens Once" [...] was written at the plant). Often homeless during his [...] "scuffling" [...] phases, he hit the lowest point of his career, when he was sleeping on a bench in Central Park.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies on}} the 1935 cars were of {{lightweight}} timber frame construction, {{covered by a}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>leather</b> skin. This followed the structural choice still used by DKW for their small front wheel drive DKW Meisterklasse F4. However, the use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>leather</b> skin which {{had a tendency to}} rot, attracted adverse comment for both manufacturers and by 1935 buyers of the Adler Trumpf Junior saloon/sedan could pay an extra 200 Marks for a timber frame car covered not by <b>synthetic</b> <b>leather</b> but by sheet steel.|$|E
500|$|An {{oil shale}} {{research}} institute (now a department within Tallinn University of Technology) was founded at Kohtla-Järve in 1958. Preliminary research into oil shale-based chemical production began the same year, exploring {{the potential for}} the use of oil shale in bitumen, synthetic construction materials, detergents, <b>synthetic</b> <b>leathers,</b> <b>synthetic</b> fibres, plastics, paints, soaps, glues, and pesticides. Between 1959 and 1985, [...] of mineral wool were produced from oil shale coke, a solid residue of oil shale. In 1968, a branch of the Skochinsky Institute of Mining was established in Kohtla-Järve, and in 1984 the scientific-technical journal Oil Shale was founded in Estonia.|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} work was targeted at evaluating alternative additives to traditional ones {{used in the}} industry of plasticized PVC <b>synthetic</b> <b>leathers</b> for the automotive interior industry. In fact, safety and performance are the driving force in this field of application [...] In fact, the manufacturing of these materials still sees the presence of additives (i. e. phthalates plasticizers, antimony trioxide, azodicarbonamide) which pose more than an issues regarding both {{human health and the}} environment. More than 70 alternative additive, belonging to both fossil–fuel and renewable feedstock, have been selected, characterized and tested inside standard and modified plasticized PVC formulations. Moreover, novel additives as organic modified nanoclays, have been evaluated for the design of innovative high-performance <b>synthetic</b> <b>leathers.</b> An innovative dispersion technique for these nano–additives has been ideated and tuned. All of the obtained samples have been tested in plasticized PVC formulations, and the imparted properties evaluated by means of analyses typical of the automotive industry. Results allowed to identify several additives that performs better than their respective traditionally used counterparts. Finally, an economic evaluation has been made in order to verify the economic sustainability related to the use of these innovative additives...|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s <b>synthetic</b> <b>leathers</b> called pormerics were first introduced, and {{together}} with fabrics these also had lines of stretch and tension, being {{based on a}} traditional woven base having threads of warp and weft. Following the introduction of electrical/mechanised presses, the sounds changed entirely to a heavy thump and/or crack, with the board pattern with hand-knife being replaced by a 'knife' similar to a pastry cutter, although the operator still needed to learn hand-clicking {{as part of the}} training.|$|R

40|$|Textile materials, {{which are}} {{different}} in fibre content, weave type, density and thickness, as well as multi-layered <b>synthetic</b> <b>leathers,</b> are used in soft furniture upholstery production. Deformation - relaxation behaviour, which depends on mechanical properties of such materials differs significantly, also. From this standpoint substantial problem exists in soft furniture production, because the dimensions of its upholstery patterns, i. e. initial pretention must be adjusted {{taking into account the}} differences of applied materials mechanical properties. Otherwise external view and quality of upholstery may be unacceptable due to obvious visual material excess on soft furniture surfaces, which is called pull-on ease. The aim of this investigation was to determine the dependencies between three different levels of soft furniture upholstery pre-tension and corresponding values of pull-on ease. New testing method presented in this study allows defining soft furniture upholstery deformational behaviour and its regularities in respect to the initial dimensions of upholstery patterns.

50|$|Amaranth is an anionic dye. It can {{be applied}} to natural and <b>synthetic</b> fibers, <b>leather,</b> paper, and phenol-formaldehyde resins. As a food {{additive}} it has E number E123.
