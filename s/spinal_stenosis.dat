These patients were divided into two groups (the groups of patients with and without <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis)</b> {{on the basis of their}} lateral cervical spine radiographs. The six items examined were height, weight, sitting height, inter inner canthal distance, upper arm length, and head circumference in each patient, and then their values were compared between the two groups. The mean inter inner canthal distance was 2. 7  cm in the group of patients with <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> and 3. 5  cm in the group of patients without spinal canal stenosis; a significant difference (P <  0. 01) was observed. Regarding height, weight, sitting height, upper arm length, and head circumference, no significant difference was found while comparing the two groups. In conclusion, developmental cervical <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> seems to be highly likely in patients with smaller inter inner canthal distance...|$|R
40|$|Causality between {{spinal cord}} {{compression}} and polyneuropathy {{is difficult to}} define, especially under the circumstances that polyneuropathy can have many causes. Seven patients with spinal cord compression and electrophysiological signs of polyneuropathy were treated surgically on decompression of their <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> in the time from April 2010 to January 2013. Median follow up time was 9 months (2 - 23 months). Causes of polyneuropathy were: 1 patient with methotrexate-induced polyneuropathy, 1 endocrine-dysfunction-induced, 2 with diabetic- polyneuropathy, and 3 patients had unknown reasons. The localization of the <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> was also varying: 2 patients suffered of cervical <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> and 5 of lumbar. Decompressive surgery led to pain relieve in all patients initially. Surprisingly, also symptoms of polyneuropathy seemed to regress in all 7 patients for the first 5 months after surgery, and in 5 patients for the time of 9 months after surgery. There are two points {{we would like to}} emphasize in this short report. Since 5 / 7 patients with polyneuropathy and <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> improved clinically after surgery, surgery has a place in the treatment of such a combined pathology. Since {{it seems to be a}} possible causality between polyneuropathy of unknown origin and <b>spinal</b> cord <b>stenosis,</b> decompression of the spinal canal could also be a therapeutic step in a specific kind of polyneuropathy. Which patients could possibly have a <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> induced polyneuropathy remains a subject of further studies...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The role of {{osteoporosis}} in {{the etiology of}} degenerative lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> is debatable.

Results: Pain parameters showed significant improvement in Group II and III(low and very low BMC). Walking distance showed greatest increase in Group II and III, with these results being statistically significant. Conclusion: In subjects with combined LSS and osteoporosis one months conservative therapy resulted in significant improvements in pain and walking distance parameters, especially in groups with low BMC.

5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from <b>spinal</b> <b>stenosis,</b> a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification.

Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background: Obesity is {{likewise}} becoming {{more prevalent in}} patients with lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis,</b> but {{few studies have examined}} relationships between obesity levels and surgical outcomes for this condition. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to determine the influence of body-mass index (BMI) on outcomes of surgery for lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis.</b> Materials and Methods: The subjects comprised 118 patients who had underwent posterolateral fusion in a single intervertebral disc space with spinal instrumentation using a pedicle screw and rod system. Obesity levels were classified into three groups according to BMI: 35, severely obese group (n= 12); 25 to < 35, obese (n= 38); and < 25, non-obese (n= 68). Investigated items including operative time, volume of intraoperative bleeding, distance from skin surface to the posterior margin of the vertebral body, improvement rate of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system for lumbar spinal disorders and intra- and postoperative complications were all compared between the three groups. Results: Longer operative time, increased intraoperative bleeding, longer distance from the skin surface to the posterior margin of the vertebral body, poor postoperative outcomes and higher incidences of intra- and postoperative complications were observed with surgery for lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> in severely obese patients (BMI 35), compared to patients with BMI < 35.

5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing <b>spinal</b> <b>stenosis.</b> Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective.

A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or <b>spinal</b> <b>stenosis.</b> No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants.

40|$|Background: Interlaminar {{epidural}} steroid injections (ILESIs) {{are commonly}} {{employed in the}} management of patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> despite little experimental evidence to guide technique optimization. One untested performance parameter is the intervertebral level at which the ILESI should be performed for maximum patient relief. Methods: This study randomized patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> to receive an ILESI at the level of maximal <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> or at a normal/less stenotic intervertebral site 2 intervertebral levels cephalad to the level of maximal stenosis. Pain with ambulation and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores were collected prior to the procedure and at 1 -, 4 -, and 12 -week follow-ups. Results: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. Thirty patients (Group 1) received an ILESI at the level of maximal stenosis; 27 patients (Group 2) received an ILESI at a less stenotic level. The mean baseline preprocedural maximal pain with ambulation and disability scores for the 2 groups were not significantly different (P= 0. 94 and P= 0. 13, respectively). Patients 2 ̆ 7 pain with ambulation scores were significantly lower in Group 1 compared to Group 2 at 1 and 4 weeks postinjection, but they were not significantly lower at 12 weeks (1 week, P= 0. 045; 4 weeks, P= 0. 049; 12 weeks, P= 0. 08).

40|$|Objectives: The authors {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis (PEA) in patients with neural foraminal stenosis without significant central <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> of the lumbar spine. Methods: Seventeen patients with neural foraminal stenosis of the lumbar spine who underwent PEA with Racz catheters {{were included in the}} study. Patients were evaluated for pain score, medication intake, significant pain relief, and complications. Results: Pain scores and medication intake were significantly decreased 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after PEA compared to pre-PEA evaluations. However, older patients with long-standing low back pain experienced little regression of pain. There were no major complications related to the epidural adhesiolysis. Significant pain relief decreased gradually over time from 82. 4 % at 3 days to 76. 5 % at 6 months. Conclusions: Although our study had several limitations, these results suggested that PEA for neural foraminal stenosis of the lumbar spine without significant lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> was a safe and effective procedure.

25|$|The {{following}} locations have no discs and {{are therefore}} exempt from the risk of disc herniation: the upper two cervical intervertebral spaces, the sacrum, and the coccyx. Most disc herniations occur {{when a person is}} in their thirties or forties when the nucleus pulposus is still a gelatin-like substance. With age the nucleus pulposus changes ("dries out") and the risk of herniation is greatly reduced.

25|$|About 90% of {{the time}} sciatica {{is due to a}} spinal disc {{herniation}} pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Other problems that may result in sciatica include spondylolisthesis, <b>spinal</b> <b>stenosis,</b> piriformis syndrome, pelvic tumors, and compression by a baby's head during pregnancy. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying on their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. Exceptions to this are when bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern of a tumor or infection. Conditions that may present similarly are diseases of the hip and early herpes zoster before the rash appears.|$|E
500|$|Central cord syndrome, {{almost always}} {{resulting}} from {{damage to the}} cervical spinal cord, is characterized by weakness in the arms with relative sparing of the legs, and spared sensation in regions served by the sacral segments.

[...] The spinal tracts that serve the arms are more affected due to their central location in the spinal cord, while the corticospinal fibers destined for the legs are spared due to their more external location.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Delayed {{post-traumatic}} {{spinal cord}} infarction is a devastating complication described in children. In adults, spinal cord ischemia after cardiovascular interventions, scoliosis correction, or profound hypotension {{has been reported}} in the literature. However, delayed spinal cord infarction after minor head trauma has not been described yet. Case presentation We report the case of a 45 -year-old Hispanic man who had a minor head trauma. He was admitted to our hospital because of paresthesias in his hands and neck pain. A radiological workup showed cervical <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> and chronic cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Twelve hours after admission, our patient became unresponsive and, despite full resuscitation efforts, died. The autopsy revealed spinal cord necrosis involving the entire cervical spinal cord and upper thoracic region. Conclusions This case illustrates the extreme fragility of spinal cord hemodynamics in patients with chronic cervical <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis,</b> in which any further perturbations, such as cervical hyperflexion related to a minor head injury, can have catastrophic consequences. Furthermore, the delayed onset of spinal cord infarction in this case shows that meticulous maintenance of blood pressure in the acute post-traumatic period is of paramount importance, even in patients with minimal post-traumatic symptoms. </p...|$|R
30|$|Epidural blocks {{result in}} {{connective}} tissue {{growth in the}} epidural space due to microbleeding caused by the punctures, local inflammation caused by high concentration of local anesthetics, and healing process of the inflammation [5]. In our patient, it appeared that multiple epidural blocks and continuous epidural catheter insertion have contributed to this connective tissue growth. Most of the adhesions in our patient resulted from connective tissue growth, and there were few areas with strong adhesions, scarring, hyperemia, or reddening. In contrast, standard endoscopic findings of lumbar degenerative diseases such as lumbar disc herniation, lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis,</b> and failed back surgery syndrome have been reported [6, 7]. In case of lumbar disc herniation, inflammatory findings such as hyperemia and reddening are common and adhesions are often mild. In case of lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis,</b> inflammatory findings and connective tissue growth are observed due {{to the degree of}} stenosis, and adhesions are often strong. In cases of failed back surgery syndrome, the connective tissue in the epidural space is known to form scars and exhibit strong adhesions around the nerves. Comparing our endoscopic findings to previous reports, the connective tissue that developed in our patient because of epidural blocks was milder than any of other lumbar degenerative diseases.|$|R

[Purpose] This study {{investigated}} the effect of neurological symptoms and/or signs after the occur-rence of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NC) on postural sway during quiet standing of patients with lumbar <b>spinal</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> (LSS).

[Results] The total path length of COP (LC) and area sur-rounded by the outline of the path of COP (AC) significantly increased after NC. Body mass index (BMI) correlated with both the NC rate (after NC/before NC) of LC and that of AC.
