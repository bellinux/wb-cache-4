5|$|Innocent was {{succeeded by}} Alexander IV, who was facing {{increasing}} military {{pressure from the}} Empire. He {{could no longer afford}} to pay Henry's expenses, instead demanding that Henry compensate the Papacy for the £90,000 spent on the war <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>This</b> was a huge sum, and Henry turned to parliament for help in 1255, only to be rebuffed; further attempts followed, but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered. Alexander grew increasingly unhappy about Henry's prevarication and in 1258 sent an envoy to England, threatening to excommunicate Henry if he did not first pay his debts to the Papacy and then send the promised army to Sicily. Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money. Instead Henry turned to extorting money from the senior clergy, who were forced to sign blank charters, promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of the King's efforts, raising around £40,000. The English Church felt the money was wasted, vanishing into the long-running war in Italy.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>this</b> Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E

25|$|An {{incoming}} batsman is “timed out” if he willfully {{takes more}} than three minutes {{to be ready to}} face the next delivery (or be at the other end if not on strike).

The goby, having the better vision, alerts the shrimp of danger using a characteristic tail movement, and then both retreat into the safety of the shared burrow. <b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>this</b> association has been observed in species that inhabit coral reef habitats.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the species}} in the {{subgenus}} Atractophaedusa, this species is most similar to the recently described Oospira antibouddah Nordsieck, 2003. The other consubgeneric species, viz.

Oospira smithi differs from Oospira antibouddah (of which a population was discovered at Vietnam, Quang Ninh Prov., Ha Long Bay area, unnamed island in Dau Moi Temper area, 13.ix.2003, 20°55.69'N 107°09.40'E – <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>this</b> species was only known from its type locality “Vietnam, Tonkin, 4 km from Cam Pha”) by the more slender shell, with a clearly visible lamella subcolumellaris, and by the shorter plicae palatales.|$|E
25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. <b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>this</b> reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may hold the key to immortality for human beings, as he says that genetically they are not that much different from humans.|$|E
