5|$|Leccinum holopus, {{commonly}} known as the white birch bolete, white bog bolete, or ghost bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae found in northern Asia, Europe, and northeastern North America. It associates with birch trees and is typically found in boggy or swampy areas, often growing among <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P.nigrella, {{but has a}} {{more deeply}} and {{persistently}} cup-shaped fruit body, a short but distinct stem, and only grows amongst <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss.</b> Plectania melastoma has elliptical to spindle-shaped spores measuring 20–28 by 8–12µm, while P.milleri has elliptical spores, and the margin of its cups have star-shaped points.|$|E
5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss,</b> wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
30|$|Up to this point, factors {{controlling}} N 2 fixation in <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> {{have yielded}} contrasting results. This study {{has focused on}} the effect of O 2 and CH 4 on N 2 fixation activity in <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> in oligotrophic and mesotrophic subarctic peatlands. Based upon the results we conclude that CH 4 dependent N 2 fixation was not a major source of nitrogen for <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> at the studied sites. The microbial community associated with Sphagnum was dominated by Proteobacteria (mainly Alphaproteobacteria), which is comparable to other studies. Future studies should combine field and mesocosm studies, with activity assays, community analysis and transcriptomic data to uncover controls of biological nitrogen fixation in <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses.</b>|$|R

5|$|Other species within Mutabiles include X.campanelloides, {{which can}} be {{differentiated}} by {{the shape of the}} thin-walled caulocystidia and yellow flesh in the stem. X.cornui grows in softwood forests with <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>moss.</b> Both the cap and the top of stem sport yellow grains. X.fraxinophila produces larger mushrooms and has yellow gills. X.parvibulbosa, while potentially featuring similar caulocystidia to X.setulipes, has a bitter or sour taste.|$|E
5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>moss</b> is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|Pure long-fibre <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>moss</b> is an {{excellent}} potting medium, though combinations involving {{any of the following}} – peat, perlite, vermiculite, sand, lava rock, pumice, Osmunda fibre, orchid bark and horticultural charcoal – may be used with equal success. The potting medium should be well-drained and not too compacted. Moss is useful for moisture retention near the roots. The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant.|$|E
30|$|The methanotrophic {{communities}} {{isolated from}} <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> were investigated {{with use of}} general taxonomic markers like 16 S rRNA, specific for type I and II methanotrophs. The 16 S rRNA PCR products obtained (after purification, type I – 700 bp, type II – 530 bp) were sequenced using genomic DNA from <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> as a template. Then similarity of the tested sequences to nucleotide sequences from the GenBank database was assessed.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> peat <b>mosses</b> play an {{important}} role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering carbon as biomass thorough photosynthesis. Biodegradation in the northern peatlands is slow in part due to acidic and nutrient-poor soil conditions, so biomass accumulates over time as peat. <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> partner with bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen to supplement their nitrogen intake in these nutrient-poor soils. Climate change is altering temperatures, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition rates in the northern peatlands. These changes are accompanied by an increased release of greenhouse gases and a decline in Sphagnum ground coverage. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> need to be studied in order to understand how their relationship will be impacted by climate change. In this study I show that higher pH levels and nutrient concentrations can negatively impact the growth of potential nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with two species of <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses.</b> I also demonstrate that bacteria associated with these mosses overall are adapted to low-nitrogen conditions and a wide pH range.

5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss,</b> sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E
5|$|Sundews {{generally}} grow in seasonally moist or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic soils {{and high levels}} of sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species grow in association with <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss,</b> which absorbs much of the soil's nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss,</b> sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff {{overlooking}} Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the effect of O 2 and CH 4 on N 2 fixation in <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> of oligotrophic and mesotrophic subarctic Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> were sampled from two mesotrophic and three oligotrophic sites (Lakkasuo peatland in Orivesi, Finland). <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> were incubated under either ambient or low oxygen conditions in the presence or absence of 13 C-labeled CH 4 and 15 N-labeled N 2. Higher N 2 fixation activity is expected for severe nutrient limited conditions (oligotrophic) compared to mesotrophic conditions. On the other hand, more buffered conditions and higher pH prevailing in mesotrophic peatlands have previously been shown to be beneficial to N 2 fixation (van den Elzen et al. 2017). We hypothesize that CH 4 will stimulate N 2 fixation activity and this activity will be highest in low O 2 conditions.|$|R
50|$|Hemlock, <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses,</b> {{and some}} Canadian fauna {{were also found}} in Tamarack Swamp in the early 1900s, with hemlocks being found as late as 1940.|$|R
50|$|Chat Moss, a lowland raised bog, formed {{after the}} last ice age about 10,000 years ago on the site of a shallow glacial lake {{to the north of the}} River Mersey. Fen peat formed in an area colonised by reeds and rushes. <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> then colonised the area causing a change from fen to bog peat which became {{elevated}} forming a dome, the raised bog. <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> increase the acidity of the water resulting in highly specialised plant species, many of them found nowhere else.|$|R
5|$|Leccinum holopus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. It fruits on {{the ground}} (often among <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>moss),</b> singly to scattered in wet areas like cedar swamps, bogs, or soggy forests. Like most Leccinum species, the fungus is highly host-specific and associates with birch (Betula). In North America, the range of Leccinum holopus extends from eastern Canada to New York, extending west to the northern Rocky Mountains, roughly coinciding with {{the distribution of the}} paper birch (Betula papyrifera). In this range, it is common and fruits from August to October. L.holopus var. americanum is known only from North America. The fungus is rare in southern Europe, but more common in the Sphagnum swamps in the north. In Asia, it has been recorded from Taiwan and Qinghai (China).|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{is fairly}} common, {{and can be}} found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn, often among <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>moss.</b> Though it {{strongly}} favours beech, it has also been found under oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with the trees under which it grows. It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces; specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs. These are typically smaller specimens, and it is possible that they represent a dwarf variety. Despite growing on rotting wood, the species is not saprotrophic; instead, the mycelia of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood. This is a particularly useful adaptation when the soil is either wet or nutrient-poor. Mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers, but they can also be found growing in tight clumps, or solitarily when growing out of season. The species can be found in Europe, with collections in Scandinavia, the British Isles Bulgaria, Germany, and northern Turkey; in North America, it has been recorded as common in Canada and both the northern and southern United States; in northern Asia, it was found in regions near both the Oka River and the central Angara River in Siberia; and in eastern Asia, it has been collected in China.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> {{can absorb}} up to 20 times their own weight in water. In World War I, <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> {{were used as}} first-aid {{dressings}} on soldiers' wounds, as these mosses said to absorb liquids three times faster than cotton, retain liquids better, better distribute liquids uniformly throughout themselves, and are cooler, softer, and be less irritating. It was also claimed that they have mild antibacterial properties. Native Americans {{were one of the}} peoples to use Sphagnum for diapers and napkins, which is still done in Canada.|$|R
40|$|Sphagnum peatlands are {{important}} ecosystems in the methane cycle. Methane-oxidizing bacteria in these ecosystems {{serve as a}} methane filter and limit methane emissions. Yet {{little is known about}} the diversity and identity of the methanotrophs present in and on <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> of peatlands, and only a few isolates are known. The methanotrophic community in <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses,</b> originating from a Dutch peat bog, was investigated using a pmoA microarray. A high biodiversity of both gamma- and alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs was found. With <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> as the inoculum, alpha- and gammaproteobacterial acidophilic methanotrophs were isolated using established and newly designed media. The 16 S rRNA, pmoA, pxmA, and mmoX gene sequences showed that the alphaproteobacterial isolates belonged to the Methylocystis and Methylosinus genera. The Methylosinus species isolated are the first acid-tolerant members of this genus. Of the acidophilic gammaproteobacterial strains isolated, strain M 5 was affiliated with the Methylomonas genus, and the other strain, M 200, may represent a novel genus, most closely related to the genera Methylosoma and Methylovulum. So far, no acidophilic or acid-tolerant methanotrophs in the Gammaproteobacteria class are known. All strains showed the typical features of either type I or II methanotrophs and are, to the best of our knowledge, the first isolated (acidophilic or acid-tolerant) methanotrophs from <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses...</b>|$|R

50|$|This plant {{grows in}} wet {{substrates}} with groundwater at the surface. The soils are often calcareous and rich in nitrogen. It can typically {{be found in}} fens and bogs with <b>sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> and other sedges.|$|R
40|$|Sphagnum peatlands are {{important}} ecosystems in the methane cycle. Methanotrophs living in {{and on the}} <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> are able {{to act as a}} methane filter and thereby reduce methane emissions. We investigated in situ methane concentrations and the corresponding activity and diversity of methanotrophs in different Sphagnum dominated bog microhabitats. In contrast to the Northern Hemisphere peat ecosystems the temperate South American peat bogs are dominated by one <b>moss</b> species; <b>Sphagnum</b> magellanicum. This permitted a species-independent comparison of the different bog microhabitats. Potential methane oxidizing activity was found in all <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> sampled and a positive correlation was found between activity and in situ methane concentrations. Substantial methane oxidation activity (23 μmol CH 4 gDW − 1 day − 1) was found in pool mosses and could be correlated with higher in situ methane concentrations (> 35 μmol CH 4 l − 1 pore water). Little methanotrophic activity (4 gDW − 1 day − 1) was observed in living <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> from lawns and hummocks. Methane oxidation activity was relatively high (> 4 μmol CH 4 gDW − 1 day − 1) in Sphagnum litter situated at depths around the water levels and rich in methane. The total bacterial community was studied using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and the methanotrophic communities were studied using a pmo A microarray and a complementary pmo A clone library. The methanotrophic diversity was similar in the different habitats of this study and surprisingly comparable to the methanotrophic diversity found in peat mosses from the Northern Hemisphere. The pmo A microarray data indicated that both alpha- and gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs were present in all <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses,</b> even in those mosses with a low initial methane oxidation activity. Prolonged incubation of <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> from lawn and hummock with methane revealed that the methanotrophic community present was viable and showed an increased activity within 15 days. The high abundance of methanotrophic Methylocystis species in the most active mosses suggests that these might be responsible for the bulk of methane oxidation...|$|R

25|$|Decayed, dried <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss</b> has {{the name}} of peat or peat moss.

This is often necessary when dealing with very sandy soil, or plants that need increased or steady moisture content to flourish. A distinction is sometimes made between <b>sphagnum</b> <b>moss,</b> the live moss growing on top of a peat bog, and 'sphagnum peat moss' (North American usage) or 'sphagnum peat' (British usage), the latter being the slowly decaying matter underneath.|$|E
25|$|Carnivorous plants require {{appropriate}} nutrient-poor soil. Most {{appreciate a}} 3:1 mixture of Sphagnum peat to sharp horticultural sand (coir is an acceptable, and more ecofriendly substitute for peat). Nepenthes will grow in orchid compost or in pure <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|E
30|$|The CH 4 {{oxidation}} rates {{observed in}} this study are comparable to CH 4 oxidation rates measured in other <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> (Kip et al. 2010). The CH 4 oxidation rates were slightly higher in the mesotrophic sites probably due to higher pH. High CH 4 oxidation activity is essential for methanotrophs in order to fulfil the high energy required for N 2 fixation (Ho and Bodelier 2015). With these high CH 4 oxidation rates, energy seems not the limiting factor for CH 4 dependent N 2 fixation. Taken together it seems highly unlikely that CH 4 dependent N 2 fixation is a major N-supplier to the N-pool of the <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> investigated {{in this study}}.|$|R
