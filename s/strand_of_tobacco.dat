40|$|The {{negative}} <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> ringspot virus satellite RNA is a self-cleaving RNA. Its catalytic {{domain and}} substrate domain have been identified, and the catalytic domain {{has been named}} hairpin catalytic RNA. Here we report {{the construction of a}} plasmid containing a modified hairpin catalytic RNA sequence that can be transcribed in vitro. Because this plasmid has two specific restriction enzyme recognition sites {{at both ends of the}} substrate binding site in the catalytic RNA sequence, it is possible to construct new plasmids by substituting different sequences in the substrate binding site. Using this plasmid, synthetic DNA, and in vitro transcription, we obtained three ribozymes designed to cleave Escherichia coli prolipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp) mRNA at specific sites. All three ribozymes cleaved the lsp mRNA sequence in vitro at the specific sites, and two of them cleaved it efficiently. Kinetic analyses showed that one had a higher kcat/Km value than that of the well-known hammerhead ribozyme. Problems associated with attaining the goal of expressing these ribozymes in vivo also are discussed...|$|E

5000|$|In 1886, Adolf Mayer first {{described}} the tobacco mosaic disease {{that could be}} transferred between plants, similar to bacterial infections. In 1892, Dmitri Ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence {{for the existence of}} a non-bacterial infectious agent, showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through finest Chamberland filters. Later, in 1903, Ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells <b>of</b> the affected <b>tobacco</b> plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent. However, Ivanovsky remained rather convinced, despite repeated failures to produce evidence, that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium, too small to be retained on the employed Chamberland filters and to be detected in the light microscope. In 1898, Martinus Beijerinck independently replicated Ivanovsky's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells <b>of</b> the <b>tobacco</b> plant. Beijerinck coined the term of [...] "virus" [...] to indicate that the causal agent <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> mosaic disease was <b>of</b> non-bacterial nature. <b>Tobacco</b> mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized. It was achieved by Wendell Meredith Stanley in 1935 who also showed that TMV remains active even after crystallization. For his work, he was awarded 1/3 of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946, even though it was later shown some of his conclusions (in particular, that the crystals were pure protein, and assembled by autocatalysis) were incorrect. The first electron microscopical images of TMV were made in 1939 by Gustav Kausche, Edgar Pfankuch and Helmut Ruska - the brother of Nobel Prize winner Ernst Ruska. In 1955, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified TMV RNA and its capsid (coat) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses, indicating that this is the most stable structure (the one with the lowest free energy).The crystallographer Rosalind Franklin worked for Stanley for about a month at Berkeley, and later designed and built a model of TMV for the 1958 World's Fair at Brussels. In 1958, she speculated that the virus was hollow, not solid, and hypothesized that the RNA of TMV is single-stranded. [...] This conjecture was proven to be correct after her death and is now known to be the + <b>strand.</b> The investigations <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> mosaic disease and subsequent discovery of its viral nature were instrumental in the establishment of the general concepts of virology.|$|R

This result suggests that the inefficient cleavage of the wild-type substrate in frtms-acting system may be due to low efficiency at the substrate-binding step but not at the chemical cleavage step in the reaction.

This synthesized ribozyme targets the 542 position <b>of</b> the <b>tobacco</b> mosaic virus (TMV) replicase gene. As a control to verify catalysis as opposed to antisense binding, the ribozyme will be compared to a mutant ribozyme containing a substitution in the hairpin which destroys cleavage activity while retaining the target complement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco use in India is {{characterized}} by a high prevalence of smoking and smokeless tobacco use, with dual use also contributing a noticeable proportion. In the context of such a high burden <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use, this study examines the regional variations, and socioeconomic, demographic and other correlates <b>of</b> smoking, smokeless <b>tobacco</b> and dual use <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> in India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed a cross sectional, nationally representative sample of individuals from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in India (2009 - 10), which covered 69, 296 individuals aged 15 years and above. The current tobacco use in three forms, namely, smoking only, smokeless tobacco use only, and both smoking and smokeless tobacco use were considered as outcomes in this study. Descriptive statistics, cross tabulations and multinomial logistic regression analysis were adopted as analytical tools. Smokeless tobacco use was the major form <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use in India followed by smoking and dual tobacco use. Tobacco use was higher among males, the less educated, the poor, and the rural population in India. Respondents lacking knowledge of health hazards <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> had higher prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use in each form. The prevalence of different forms <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use varies significantly by states. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use increases concomitantly with age among females. Middle-aged adult males had higher prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use. Age, education and region were found to be significant determinants of all forms <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use.
