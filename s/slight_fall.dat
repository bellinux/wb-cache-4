5|$|The {{governing}} African National Congress (ANC), {{supported by}} its Tripartite Alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), have held {{a majority of}} the seats in the National Assembly since 1994. They were re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a <b>slight</b> <b>fall</b> in its majority from 69% to 65.9% in 2009. The ANC is led by Jacob Zuma. In 2012, Zuma was re-elected to a second five-year term as President of the African National Congress, beating his only rival and deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, by a wide margin. Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Motlanthe who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} {{season with the}} Oilers, Brewer {{continued}} {{his role as a}} top defenceman. On November 22, 2003, Brewer was among the participants in the historic 2003 Heritage Classic ice hockey game versus the Montreal Canadiens at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. Brewer scored the Oilers first goal of the game in a 4–3 loss in front of a then record crowd of 57,167. Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the Chicago Blackhawks, Brewer recorded his one-hundredth career point. Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league. In the final year of his two-year contract, Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his 2001–02 NHL season, a <b>slight</b> <b>fall</b> from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers.|$|E

To get Daffy's attention, Bugs states that he is from the planet Krypton, and his parents (parodying Jor-El and his wife) sent him to Earth, where he'll be able to [...] "jump higher than normal people, eat carrots, and instinctively say, 'What's up, doc?'".

25|$|In {{the last}} general {{election}} in 2011, the incumbent People's Action Party (PAP) won 81 of the 87 seats, but lost Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC to the Workers' Party of Singapore (WP). This {{was the first}} time a GRC had been won by an opposition party. With the Workers' Party ending up with six elected seats in Parliament, this was the best opposition parliamentary result since independence. Out of the current 87 elected MPs, 19 (about 16.5%) are female. This was a <b>slight</b> <b>fall</b> from the figure of about 20% for the 11th Parliament, in which 17 of the 84 elected MPs were women.|$|E
25|$|Political {{uncertainty}} {{following the}} country's 2008 general {{election and the}} 2008 Permatang Pauh by-election, falling oil prices in the late-2000s, {{and the lack of}} intervention by Bank Negara to increase already low interest rates (which remained at 3.5% between April 2006 and November 2008) led to a <b>slight</b> <b>fall</b> of the ringgit's value against the US dollar between May and July 2008, followed by a sharper drop between August and September of the same year. As a result, the US dollar appreciated significantly to close at 3.43 to the MYR as of 4 September 2008, while other major currencies, including the renminbi and Hong Kong dollar, followed suit. The ringgit spiked at 3.73 to the US dollar by March 2009, before gradually recovering to 3.00 to the US dollar by mid-2011 and normalising at around 3.10 between 2011 and 2014.|$|E

50|$|The {{issue of}} tones in the Zhenjiang dialect {{has been a}} topic {{scholarly}} study. Nanjing residents use the four tones of Mandarin, while Changzhou residents use seven or eight tones. According {{to a study by}} Qiu Chunan, Zhenjiang dialect has five citation tones: Tone1 (42) (a sharp fall from pitch 4 to pitch 2, or yinping), Tone2 (35) (a rising tone or yangping), Tone3 (32) (<b>slight</b> <b>falling</b> tone or shang), Tone4 (55) (high even or qu), and Tone5 (5) (checked tone or ru). Qiu's study used residents who had grown up in the Daxi Road area, where the standard form of the dialect is said to be spoken. The checked tone was a feature of Chinese spoken in the Middle Ages, but it is not part of Mandarin. Applying the theory of government phonology to the issue, Bao Zhiming noted that non-even tones become even when they appear before the high even, or 55, tone.|$|R
25|$|The {{church was}} {{completed}} {{four years after}} the houses and school by other architects and it seems that Andrews and Pepper's scheme anticipated a major building at this point. The impact of the completed scheme was dramatic, especially when viewed from the east. Ripley terrace was virtually level along its 750ft length. The <b>slight</b> <b>fall</b> of about 4ft was compensated for by building up gardens walls in the lower section so that doors and windows remained in alignment. Behind the south section of the terrace the school buildings rose above the house roofs with the pinnacle of the clock tower about 50 feet above the roof ridge of the houses. Behind the central and north sections of Ripley Terrace the roof lines of the successive terraces rose in echelon with the gable of St Bartholomew's rising 40 feet above the highest roofs. The pyramidical theme was repeated in the front elevations of the terraces.|$|E

The Bears were able to find their old magic again, with many players returning from service in the war, finishing the regular season 8–2–1 to claim another Western Division title and a return trip to the Championship game. The Bears won their last Championship of the decade over the New York Giants, 24–14, before a then NFL Championship Game record crowd of 58,346 at the Polo Grounds in New York.

40|$|In 2010 we rediscovered the {{complete}} set of meteorological observation protocols made by Jens Esmark (1762 – 1839) during his years of residence in the Norwegian capital of Oslo (then Christiania). From 1 January 1816 to 25 January 1839, Esmark at his house in Øvre Voldgate in the morning, early afternoon and late evening recorded air temperature with state-of-the-art thermometers. He also noted air pressure, cloud cover, precipitation and wind directions, and experimented with rain gauges and hygrometers. From 1818 {{to the end of}} 1838 he twice a month provided weather tables to the official newspaper Den Norske Rigstidende, and thus acquired a semi-official status as the first Norwegian state meteorologist. This paper evaluates the quality of Esmark's temperature observations and presents new metadata, new homogenization and analysis of monthly means. Three significant shifts in the measurement series were detected, and suitable corrections are proposed. The air temperature in Oslo during this period is shown to exhibit a slow rise from 1816 towards 1825, followed by a <b>slighter</b> <b>fall</b> again towards 1838...|$|R

40|$|Plasma beta-endorphin, {{prolactin}} (PRL), FSH and LH {{were measured}} in 17 volunteer male subjects at rest {{and under the}} stress caused by a long-distance nordic ski race. The race induced increased levels of beta-endorphin and PRL in all skiers. The changes in PRL with exercise {{were significantly related to}} the changes in beta-endorphin (r = 0. 69, p less than 0. 001). Furthermore, the highly trained skiers training over 150 km. week- 1 of nordic ski showed consistently higher post-exercise beta-endorphin and PRL levels than the moderately trained skiers who trained for 20 km. week- 1. In addition the race induced <b>slight</b> <b>falls</b> in FSH and LH; however plasma gonadotropin levels did not show any correlation with plasma beta-endorphin concentrations and did not differ between the two groups of skiers. These results suggest that endogenous opioid peptides may modulate PRL secretion in heavy exercise, since they are of minor importance in the release of FSH and LH in such a situation. The observations also suggest that the degree of previous training and the exercise intensity do seem to be responsible for the hormonal changes...|$|R

Since auditorily this sound is very close to [a] one aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether – based on acoustic data – the sequence /ar / differs from long /a/. Therefore, an acoustical analysis of contrasting words like Saar- “Saar ” (river in Germany), sah- “saw”, sehr- “very ” and Visier- “visor ” has been carried out by recording three male and three female speakers of Northern German. We analysed the frequencies of the first three formants and the vowel durations. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) after /a/, no change in quality could be found in F 1 and F 3, however F 2 showed a significant falling transition, (2) the formant frequencies of [] varied with the preceding vowel and (3) no differences in duration could be found. With regard to the results, we conclude that the <b>slight</b> <b>falling</b> transition in F 2 is not diphthongal but is nevertheless a change in quality of the vowel...|$|R
