5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a <b>side</b> <b>pocket</b> {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>side</b> <b>pocket</b> is a {{mechanism}} whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably. When an investment is side-pocketed, its value is calculated {{separately from the}} value of the fund’s main portfolio. Because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments, investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the <b>side</b> <b>pocket</b> investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio. Profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the <b>side</b> <b>pocket</b> and are not shared with new investors. Funds typically carry <b>side</b> <b>pocket</b> assets [...] "at cost" [...] for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values. This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value.|$|E
2500|$|This is a welded/machined product which {{contains}} a [...] "side pocket" [...] alongside the main tubular conduit. The <b>side</b> <b>pocket,</b> typically 1" [...] or 1½" [...] diameter {{is designed to}} contain gas lift valve, which allows flow of High pressure gas into the tubing there by reducing the tubing pressure and allowing the hydrocarbons to move upwards.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Side</b> <b>pockets</b> {{were widely}} used by hedge funds during the 2008 {{financial}} crisis amidst {{a flood of}} withdrawal requests. <b>Side</b> <b>pockets</b> allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved, a move that could reduce losses. However, as the practice restricts investors' ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged {{that it has been}} abused or applied unfairly. [...] The SEC also has expressed concern about aggressive use of <b>side</b> <b>pockets</b> and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them.|$|R

2500|$|Despite this careful planning, Berlioz {{failed to}} carry the plot through. By {{the time he had}} reached Genoa, he [...] "left his {{disguise}} in the <b>side</b> <b>pocket</b> of the carriage". After arriving in Nice (at that time, part of Italy), he reconsidered the entire plan, deciding it to be inappropriate and foolish. He {{sent a letter to the}} Academy in Rome, requesting that he be allowed to return. This request was accepted, and he prepared for his trip back.|$|E
2500|$|The rank {{insignia}} are rectangular plates {{that are}} worn {{on the left}} pocket flap of the uniform shirt, fleece, sweater, jacket, coat and/or bulletproof vest. On the right <b>side</b> <b>pocket</b> flap, a similar plate is worn, displaying the officer's name and a separating line with underneath {{the name of the}} force and/or unit the officer belongs to. In some cases (mostly commissioned officers) the function is displayed (e.g. [...] "Commissioner-General). Both plates have stylized lines on the outer corners depicting the force to which the police operative belongs. The lines are orange/red for the Federal Police, light blue for Local Police, and silver or gold for personnel of the General Inspection (depending on the rank of the personnel member).|$|E
2500|$|Studies on {{the binding}} {{mechanism}} of selective COX-2 inhibitors {{show that they}} have two reversible steps with both COX-1 and COX-2, but the selectivity for COX-2 is due to another step that is slow and irreversible and is seen only in the inhibition of COX-2, not COX-1. The irreversible step {{has been attributed to}} the presence of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) that fits into the side-pocket of COX-2. This has been studied using SC-58125 (an analogue of celecoxib) and mutated COX-2, wherein the valine 523 residue was replaced by isoleucine 523. The irreversible inhibition did not happen, but reversible inhibition was noticed. A model has been made to explain this three-step mechanism behind the inhibitory effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors. The first step accounts for the contact of the inhibitor with the gate of the hydrophobic channel (called the lobby region). The second step could account for the movement of the inhibitor from the lobby region to the active site of the COX enzyme. The last step probably represents repositioning of the inhibitor at the active site, which leads to strong interactions of the phenylsulfonamide or phenylsulfone group of the inhibitor and the amino acids of the <b>side</b> <b>pocket.</b> It is directly inhibition to postaglanding ...|$|E
