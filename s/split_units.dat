In the current investigation dynamic analysis is carried out to know the natural frequency of the outdoor unit to check the resonance.

In the current work the external excitation is due to AC fan motor and air compressor. The current work is carried out using software tools CATIA, HYPRMESH, NASTRAN and HYPERVIEW. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is the most commonly used numerical technique, which provides accurate estimates of vibration parameters for these classes of problem. In this work it is found that the natural frequency does not match with excitation frequency.

40|$|The Middle East is {{a booming}} market, {{and during the}} last years many {{buildings}} were built under the local energy code, the requirements of which {{are not at all}} comparable to those of European or American standards (see Table 1). As a result, the energy demand for cooling and dehumidification is usually very high. According to the local municipality, in Dubai 40 % of the total energy consumption is used for air conditioning. Dubai is one of the hottest and most humid cities in the world. Therefore, not only cooling but also dehumidification are major issues. However, {{there is a lot of}} room for improvement. Due to the steep increase of energy costs in recent years, energy-efficient building concepts take an increasing and important role in the design of new buildings. The goal of the investigation is a master plan with focus on a whole net-zero energy concept for a total of 32 individual buildings, each of which has a net floor area of more than 300 m², located on an island about 8 km off the coast of Dubai. While achieving a comprehensively planned and integrated community with a sense of luxury, the project also is expected to set new standards in environmental design. This means that the building energy demand is balanced over a year by renewable energies for typical Dubai climate conditions. The concept is based on two parts, the optimization of the building envelope and the development of an innovative efficient building service system with use of renewable energy; both are optimized with regard to a reduction of building energy demand. The use of passive means of climate control such as building orientation, shade structures, natural ventilation, and operable façades will provide the development with a very strong environmental meaning. For the first part, hygrothermal building simulations with WUFI-Plus and TRNSYS have been conducted in order to analyze the useful energy demand of the buildings for cooling and dehumidification, which is the prevailing building energy demand due to the hot and humid climate conditions at site. In this respect, the building envelope was initially based on the local building standard Degree 66 and was further optimized (i. e., wall insulation, window shading by obstructions and blinds, high-performance lighting, partly different occupancy times). This was completed by useful energy demand calculations for hot water and electricity for plugs and appliances. The second part of the concept comprised the development of an energy-efficient building services system, which has to provide the useful energy calculated before. A standard system for residential houses in such climates is the use of local <b>split</b> <b>units</b> with air circulation, which are typically installed in each room; natural ventilation due to openings like windows and cracks defines the air change rate. According to the problems that arise from a standard system, an efficient and aesthetically convincing (i. e., invisible for the occupants) "lean" building concept has been developed. Since only a relatively small hygienic air flow rate is required for each villa, dehumidification and sensible cooling have been realized by two separate systems: an air-based system is used to dehumidify the air, and a water-based system is used for sensible cooling (since water contains a higher heat capacity than air) ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis presents the field and laboratory work conducted to investigate the applicability of different thermal comfort indices and equations to assess the thermal sensation of very young children (6 - 10 years) and older children (11 - 17 years) in Kuwait classrooms under different ventilation modes (hybrid, natural and air-conditioned), in addition to investigating {{the quality of the}} air inside the classrooms. Few thermal comfort and indoor air quality studies have been conducted to determine the thermal comfort and indoor air quality situation inside the classrooms (especially where the young children are presents) in comparison to that for adults in other building environments such as offices or vehicles. The aim of this thesis was to provide baseline data and expand the knowledge for young children s thermal comfort (as well as older children) and the effects of the indoor air quality inside classrooms on them throughout different ventilation modes (hybrid, natural and air-conditioned). The work was achieved by conducting both laboratory and field experiments, as follows: Laboratory tests were conducted to measure the insulation value of the different schoolwear ensembles used in Kuwait classrooms. Three methods were used to indicate and compare the thermal insulation values of different schoolwear ensembles worn by girls and boys in Kuwait classrooms during summer and winter seasons. Results suggest that the clothing insulation values found from the measured and adapted data were similar to the adult s data in standards tables for the same summer and winter seasons ensembles. In addition, the temperature ratings of the clothing are close to, and in agreement with, the scholars comfort temperature. A new thermal comfort questionnaire has been designed for gathering thermal sensation and reflected data from younger children. The questionnaire has been designed employing learning and educational techniques for very young people, and was statistically tested against the standard questionnaire and with old age groups to ensure no bias was introduced. The results show that the new designed thermal comfort questionnaire can help children to assess their sensation in a better manner than that of the standard questionnaire, and that it can be considered as a new subjective assessment tool that can support the thermal comfort standard by investigating the thermal comfort sensations of younger children age groups. A large scale field study was then conducted to investigate the applicability of different thermal comfort indices for Kuwait classrooms along the academic year and under different ventilation modes to assess the thermal sensations for younger (6 - 10 years) and older (11 - 17 years) students age group during the school day. The newly designed thermal comfort questionnaire and the clothing insulation values mentioned previously were used to collect the subjects responses for comparison with a range of thermal comfort indices (PMV, ePMV, PMV 10 and adaptive, and various comfort equations). Results show that no difference in the neutral temperature between both age groups during the different ventilation modes and the PMV model is the most appropriate model to predict the thermal sensations of the younger subjects during the different ventilation modes, including the natural ventilation mode, since Kuwait classrooms largely considered as air-conditioned spaces. This work provides knowledge of thermal comfort and comfort conditions in Kuwait classrooms. The final part of the field study was conducted to investigate the adequacy of the ventilation rates during naturally and air-conditioned ventilation modes inside 10 elementary classrooms in Kuwait occupied by 6 - 10 year old children by measuring the CO 2 concentration levels inside these classrooms. The findings showed that naturally ventilated classrooms have lower average CO 2 concentration levels (708 ppm) than air-conditioned classrooms (1596 ppm). The main reason for the high CO 2 concentration in air-conditioned classrooms is attributed to the possibly inappropriate selection of ventilation system type (wall-mounted <b>split</b> <b>units)</b> inside the classrooms. This type of ventilation system cools recirculated room air provides no outside air (fresh air), which is may not be appreciated for high occupancy zones like classrooms. Suitable means for fresh air provision must be made for this mode of operation. Some remedial solutions are theoretically suggested to reduce the high CO 2 levels in air-conditioned classrooms which may enhance the students and staffs performance. The latter data on CO 2 levels being above recommended values have been communicated to Kuwaiti government...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to the steady-state simulation of heat pumps and refrigerating equipment is presented. Novel features of the proposed model are the strategy and formalism adopted in the programme development. Individual mathematical models for component design are linked to enable the simulation of a basic vapour compression cycle. This paper introduces some of the component modules, {{which can be used}} for pure as well as mixed refrigerants. Because numerous models can be used for a specific piece of equipment making up the whole refrigerating/heating unit, the Modular Modelling approach leads to a flexible and evolutive structure. A machine can actually be built-up from component libraries that include several types of heat exchangers, compressors and expansion devices and the effects of operating conditions or component geometrical parameters on cycle performance can be examined. Because actual test data are used to "calibrate " the component modules, very accurate results are obtained.

In air-condition mode, there is an option for cooling of the compressor first stage discharge gas. Experimental tests are under preparation. Realistic simulations have been carried out with the advanced in-house simulation program CSIM using input data for all components of the prototype. CSIM is a steady state circuit simulator (primarily) for trans-critical CO 2 cycles, which uses well calibrated models for all components.

In heat pump mode, the prototype CO 2 unit is predicted to perform around 30 to 40 % better at – 5 °C and 5 °C ambient temperature. ...|$|R
