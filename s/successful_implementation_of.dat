Richard Maunsell {{was given the}} newly created post of CME to the Southern Railway, and decided to revise the {{cylinder}} arrangement of the locomotive.

When the modifications were trialled in service, it became evident amongst locomotive crews that Maunsell had taken a sound design and made it better, achieving a consistent locomotive capable of undertaking all the tasks {{for which it was}} intended. With the <b>successful</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> the modifications, permission was given by the management of the Southern Railway for a second batch of locomotives to be constructed.|$|E
