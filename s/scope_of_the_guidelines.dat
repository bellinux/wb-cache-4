Objectives: The purpose of this article is to describe how a group of front-line practitioners collaborated with academics and students to develop best practice guidelines (BPG) for the management and rehabilitation of stroke in adult patients in Cameroon. Method: A working group was established and adapted internationally recognised processes for the development of best practice guidelines. The group determined the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guidelines,</b> documented current practices, and critically appraised evidence to develop guidelines relevant to the Cameroon context.

40|$|SUMMARY This {{document}} describes {{guidelines for}} accreditation of Sleep Medicine Centres in Europe. These guidelines {{are the result}} of a consensus procedure, in which represent-atives of the European Sleep Research Society (ESRS) and representatives of different European National Sleep Societies (ENSS) were involved. The information obtained during different rounds of consultation was gathered and processed by the members of the Steering Committee of the ESRS. The <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guidelines</b> is to define the characteristics of multidisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centres (SMCs), in terms of requirements regarding staff, operational procedures and logistic facilities. Accredita-tion of SMCs is proposed to be the responsibility of the individual ENSS. The Accreditation Guidelines may thus be considered an instrument for the national societies to develop new or standardize existing accreditation questionnaires, as well as procedures for visiting the site, drafting the accreditation report, and finally, granting the accreditation. The Accreditation Guidelines are meant to be a line of action, that ideally should be followed as close as possible, but that may be subject to certain exceptions, depending on local customs or regulations. k e yword s accreditation, europe, guidelines, sleep medicin...|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} {{are being developed}} for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> reducing medical errors and unjustified variations in medical practice, and for basing medical practice on evidence. Encoding guidelines in a computer-interpretable format and integrating them with the electronic medical record can enable delivery of patient-specific recommendations when and where needed. Since great effort is expended in developing high quality guidelines, and in making them computer-interpretable, it is highly desirable {{to be able to}} share them among institutions.

INTERVENTION: We listed and compared the couples' and professionals' key clinical issues (=care aspects that need improvement) {{to be addressed in}} <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> according to four domains: current guidelines, professionals, patients and organization of care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main key clinical issues suggested by more than three quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infertile couples and/or at least two professionals were identified and compared. RESULTS: Overall, we identified 32 key clinical issues among infertile couples and 23 among professionals. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> defined main key clinical issues, infertile couples mentioned eight issues that were not mentioned by the professionals.

40|$|The British and Irish Porphyria Network {{guidelines}} describe {{best practice}} in the clinical assessment, investigation and management of acute porphyria attacks and their complications, including severe attacks with neuropathy. Acute attacks of porphyria may occur in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). Aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP) is a very rare autosomal recessive porphyria; only six cases substantiated by mutation analysis have yet been described in the literature. Urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) is always raised in an acute attack due to AIP, VP or HCP and this analysis is essential to confirm the diagnosis. A positive result in a qualitative or semi-quantitative screening test must be followed by PBG quantitation at the earliest opportunity. However in a severely ill patient, treatment should not be delayed. Removal of precipitating factors, effective analgesia and control of symptoms with safe medication, attention to nutrition and fluid balance are essential. The indications for use of intravenous haem arginate are set out, together with advice on its administration. A small proportion of acute porphyria patients develop recurrent attacks and management options that may be considered include gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues, ‘prophylactic ’ regular haem arginate infusion or ultimately, liver transplantation. <b>Scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guidelines</b> The guidelines provide a practical assessment and manage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{worldwide}} {{variation in}} rehabilitation practices after {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and no agreement on which interventions will lead to optimal {{short and long term}} patient outcomes. As a first step in the development of clinical practice guidelines for post-acute rehabilitation after THA and TKA, we explored experiences and attitudes about rehabilitation practices and outcomes in groups of individuals identified as key stakeholders. Methods Separate focus groups and interviews were conducted with patients (THA or TKA within past year) and three health professional groups: allied health professionals (AHPs), orthopaedic surgeons, and other physicians, in Canada and the United States. Pairs of moderators led the focus groups using a standardized discussion guide. Discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. A content analysis within and across groups identified key themes. Results Eleven focus groups and eight interviews took place in six sites. Patients (n = 32) varied in age, stage of recovery, and surgical and rehabilitation experiences. Health professionals (n = 44) represented a range of disciplines, practice settings and years of experience. Six key themes emerged: 1) Let's talk (issues related to patient-health professional and inter-professional communication); 2) Expecting the unexpected (observations about unanticipated recovery experiences); 3) It's attitude that counts (the importance of the patient's positive attitude and participation in recovery); 4) It takes all kinds of support (along the continuum of care); 5) Barriers to recovery (at patient, provider and system levels), and 6) Back to normal (reflecting diversity of expected outcomes). Patients offered different, but overlapping views compared to health professionals regarding rehabilitation practices and outcomes following THA and TKA. Conclusion Results will inform subsequent phases of guideline development and ensure stakeholders' perspectives shape the priorities, content and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guidelines.</b> </p...|$|E

The first issue to be addressed was to limit <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> to bioequivalence studies for immediate release dosage forms with systemic action. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> refers to bioequivalence alone. Moreover, <b>the</b> new definition <b>of</b> Generic Medicinal Product has been incorporated.

Steady-state design is now restricted and other designs, such as parallel group design, replicate design and two-stage design, are now incorporated in a more explicit form. New practical guidance on Highly Variable Drug Products and Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs has been incorporated. The possibility for a biowaiver based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification System is now more explicit for Class I drugs and can be extended to Class III drugs under restricted conditions. We are aware that <b>the</b> initial goal <b>of</b> providing a very specific and clear guidance on these issues has not been entirely achieved, mainly because it is almost impossible to cover all individual cases and predict every possible situation that may arise.

A literature search identified relevant randomized trials published since 2002. <b>The</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> was narrowed to chemotherapy and biologic therapy. An Update Committee reviewed the literature and made updated recommendations. One hundred sixty-two publications met the inclusion criteria. Recommendations were based on treatment strategies that improve overall survival. Treatments that improve only progression-free survival prompted scrutiny of toxicity and quality of life. For first-line therapy in patients with performance status of 0 or 1, a platinum-based two-drug combination of cytotoxic drugs is recommended. Nonplatinum cytotoxic doublets are acceptable for patients with contraindications to platinum therapy. For patients with performance status of 2, a single cytotoxic drug is sufficient. Stop first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy at disease progression or after four cycles in patients who are not responding to treatment. Stop two-drug cytotoxic chemotherapy at six cycles even in patients who are responding to therapy. <b>The</b> first-line use <b>of</b> gefitinib may be recommended for patients with known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation; for negative or unknown EGFR mutation status, cytotoxic chemotherapy is preferred. Bevacizumab is recommended with carboplatin-paclitaxel, except for patients with certain clinical characteristics. Cetuximab is recommended with cisplatin-vinorelbine for patients with EGFR-positive tumors by immunohistochemistry. Docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib, or pemetrexed is recommended as second-line therapy. Erlotinib is recommended as third-line therapy for patients who have not received prior erlotinib or gefitinib.

It draws on different types of evidence – from users, experienced practitioners, local custom and practice, research and other related literature. It addresses both in-patient and community care, and situates the profession and its practices in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> National Service Frameworks. The document begins with description of Art Psychotherapists’ long-standing history of work with this client population and, in so doing, outlines something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discipline’s theory and clinical practice. It describes <b>the</b> <b>Guideline’s</b> development, <b>the</b> aims and objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project and <b>the</b> overall <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guideline.</b> <b>The</b> processes <b>of</b> generating evidence through consultation with two expert panels – one comprising Art Psychotherapists experienced in this area of work and another comprising service users – are also described. The identification and critical appraisal of research and other texts relevant to <b>the</b> <b>Guideline’s</b> topic, and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> evidence weightings appropriate to the discipline, are also explained. <b>The</b> <b>Guideline</b> then moves on to an extensive Evidence Review. This narrative describes <b>the</b> evidence <b>the</b> <b>Guideline</b> Development Group gleaned from all possible sources - textual, oral and practical. This includes research-based literature, other academically rigorous and descriptive literature and <b>the</b> opinions <b>of</b> expert practitioners, local practitioners and local expert users. The findings from the review process are described in the narrative and each is assigned to an evidence level. The evidence is reviewed thematically, for example regarding the contexts and settings of Art Psychotherapy practice, the referral process, assessment and clinical approaches. The theory that underpins clinical work is described first, followed by practice itself; the former (theory) derives almost entirely from the literature, but the latter (practice) is significantly informed by <b>the</b> opinions <b>of</b> our two expert panels and by the custom and practice of Art psychotherapists at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust. In so doing, <b>the</b> <b>Guideline</b> addresses some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gaps in the current Art Psychotherapy literature. The Evidence Review is followed by Recommendations. These distil <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Review into General Principles and specific Recommendations for Art Psychotherapy practice with users who are prone to psychotic states.

40|$|Abstract Background The World Health Organization (WHO), {{like many}} other organisations around the world, has {{recognised}} the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the third {{of a series of}} 16 reviews that have been prepared as background for advice from the WHO Advisory Committee on Health Research to WHO on how to achieve this. Objective In this review we address the composition of guideline development groups and consultation processes during guideline development. Methods We searched PubMed and three databases of methodological studies for existing systematic reviews and relevant methodological research. We did not conduct systematic reviews ourselves. Our conclusions are based on the available evidence, consideration of what WHO and other organisations are doing and logical arguments. Key questions and answers What should be the composition of a WHO-panel that is set up to develop recommendations? The existing empirical evidence suggests that panel composition has an impact on the content of the recommendations that are made. There is limited research evidence to guide the exact composition of a panel. Based on logical arguments and the experience of other organisations we recommend the following: • Groups that develop guidelines or recommendations should be broadly composed and include important stakeholders such as consumers, health professionals that work within the relevant area, and managers or policy makers. • Groups should include or have access to individuals with the necessary technical skills, including information retrieval, systematic reviewing, health economics, group facilitation, project management, writing and editing. • Groups should include or have access to content experts. • To work well a group needs an effective leader, capable of guiding the group in terms of the task and process, and capable of facilitating collaboration and balanced contribution from all of the group members. • Because many group members will not be familiar with the methods and processes that are used in developing recommendations, groups should be offered training and support to help ensure understanding and facilitate active participation. What groups should be consulted when a panel is being set up? We did not identify methodological research that addressed this question, but based on logical arguments and the experience of other organisations we recommend that as many relevant stakeholder groups as practical should be consulted to identify suitable candidates with an appropriate mix of perspectives, technical skills and expertise, as well as to obtain a balanced representation with respect to regions and gender. What methods should WHO use to ensure appropriate consultations? We did not find any references that addressed issues related to this question. Based on logical arguments and the experience of other organisations we believe that consultations may be desirable at several stages {{in the process of developing}} guidelines or recommendations, including: • Identifying and setting priorities for guidelines and recommendations • Commenting on the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guidelines</b> or recommendations • Commenting on the evidence that is used to inform guidelines or recommendations • Commenting on drafts of the guidelines or recommendations • Commenting on plans for disseminating and supporting the adaptation and implementation of the guidelines or recommendations. • Key stakeholder organisations should be contacted directly whenever possible. • Consultation processes should be transparent and should encourage feedback from interested parties. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{change in}} the legal {{framework}} brought by the alterations in Law n. 9394 / 1996, the National Education Bases and Guidelines Law, {{as a result of}} Law n. 10. 639 / 2003 and its practical deployment, present in the Curriculum Guidelines for the Education of Race Relations and the Teaching of African and Afro-Brazilian History and Culture, may compose the contemporary collection of multiple, diverse, creative and necessary propositions to re-situate Africa and the African Diaspora in world history. The consequence is the deconstruction of the Hegelian and Enlightenment version produced on the continent that formed the basis for the European imperialist enterprise of global dominance that now has been, at least, challenged in terms of its basics. The so-called guidelines for the "education of the race relations", as they have symptomatically been referred to by the activists of the black movement and scholars, position the need to teach History and Afro-Brazilian and African culture beyond the racial issue. My goal, in this text, is to declare that the emphasis on the "education of the race relations" restricts the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guidelines,</b> as it limits their horizon to the politics of fulfilment that, according to Gilroy (1993), has been practiced by the slave descendants, requiring the bourgeois civil society to fulfill the promises of their own rhetoric. In other words, it creates the means to establish demands for goals such as a non-racialized justice and the organization of production processes. Its maximum expression is the intersection between the recognition policy and the redistributive policy. In contrast, with the politics of fulfilment, Gilroy proposes the transfiguration policy that evokes utopian references, which, in Brazil, are associated with the possibilities opened by the teaching of African history and Afro-Brazilian history, re-situating Africa and the African Diaspora in world history, beyond the widespread racialized reading in Western education. An important tool of the deconstruction is to know the questioning and interventions that black intellectuals (African and Diaspora’s) addressed to the main axes of the global intellectual history that excluded both Africa and themselves. A mudança no marco normativo provocada pela alteração da Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da educação brasileira em decorrência da Lei nº 10. 639 / 2003 e seu desdobramento prático, presente nas Diretrizes Nacionais Curriculares para a Educação das Relações Raciais e para o Ensino de História e Cultura Afro-brasileira e Africana, podem compor o conjunto contemporâneo das várias, diversificadas, criativas e necessárias proposições de ressituar a África e a diáspora africana na história mundial, desconstruindo a versão hegeliana e iluminista produzida sobre o continente que serviu de base para grande empresa imperialista europeia de dominação global que ora encontra-se no mínimo questionada em seus fundamentos básicos. As chamadas diretrizes para a “educação das relações raciais” como sintomaticamente vem sendo chamada pelos ativistas do movimento negro, e acadêmicos, colocam para além da questão racial a necessidade de ensinar história e cultura afro-brasileira e africana. Meu objetivo no presente texto é argumentar que a ênfase na “educação das relações raciais” restringe o escopo das diretrizes ao limitar seu horizonte à política de satisfação de necessidades (politics of fulfilment) que, de acordo com Gilroy (1993), tem sido praticada pelos descendentes de escravos, demandando da sociedade civil burguesa que cumpra as promessas de sua própria retórica. Em outras palavras, ela cria os meios nos quais demanda por objetivos como uma justiça não racializada e uma organização dos processos produtivos. A sua expressão máxima é a política do reconhecimento intersecionada com a política redistributiva. Em contraste, com a política de satisfação de necessidades, Gilroy propõe a política de transfiguração na qual se invocam referências utópicas, as quais, no caso brasileiro, estão associadas às possibilidades abertas pelo ensino de história africana e história afro-brasileira, ressituando África e a diáspora africana na história mundial para além da leitura racializada disseminada na educação ocidental. Um importante instrumento dessa desconstrução é conhecer os questionamentos e intervenções que os intelectuais negros (africanos e da diáspora) dirigiram aos principais eixos da história intelectual global que excluíam a eles próprios e a África...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To assess <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> a wiki as a participatory tool for patients in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a <b>guideline</b> on infertility determined by (1) use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wiki (number <b>of</b> page views and visitors), (2) benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wiki (ie, number, content, and eligibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recommendations to be integrated into <b>the</b> <b>guideline),</b> and (3) patients' facilitators of and barriers to adoption, and the potential challenges to be overcome in improving this wiki. METHODS: To obtain initial content for the wiki, we conducted in-depth interviews (n = 12) with infertile patients. Transcripts from the interviews were translated into 90 draft recommendations. These were presented on a wiki. Over 7 months, infertile patients were invited through advertisements or mailings to formulate new or modify existing recommendations. After modifying the recommendations, we asked patients to select their top 5 or top 3 recommendations for each of 5 sections on fertility care. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> development group assessed <b>the</b> eligibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final set <b>of</b> recommendations within <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guideline.</b> We used a multimethod evaluation strategy to assess <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wiki as a participatory tool for patients in <b>guideline</b> development.

40|$|Introduction : <b>The</b> {{integration}} <b>of</b> {{patient and}} caregiver input into guideline development {{can help to}} ensure that clinical care addresses patient expectations, priorities, and needs. We aimed to identify topics and outcomes salient to patients and caregivers {{for inclusion in the}} Kidney Health Australia Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment (KHA-CARI) clinical practice <b>guideline</b> on <b>the</b> screening and management of infectious microorganisms in hemodialysis units. Methods : A facilitated workshop was conducted with 11 participants (patients [n =  8], caregivers [n =  3]). Participants identified and discussed potential topics for inclusion in <b>the</b> <b>guidelines,</b> which were compared to those developed by <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> working group. <b>The</b> workshop transcript was thematically analyzed to identify and describe the reasons underpinning their priorities. Findings : Patients and caregivers identified a range of topics already covered by <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>guidelines</b> and also suggested additional topics: privacy and confidentiality, psychosocial care during/after disease notification, quality of transportation, psychosocial treatment of patients in isolation, patient/caregiver education and engagement, and patient advocacy. Five themes characterized discussion and underpinned their choices: shock and vulnerability, burden of isolation, fear of infection, respect for privacy and confidentiality, and confusion over procedural inconsistencies. Discussion : Patients and caregivers emphasized <b>the</b> need for <b>guidelines</b> to address patient education and engagement, and <b>the</b> psychosocial implications <b>of</b> communication and provision <b>of</b> care in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> infectious microorganisms in hemodialysis units.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Simulation-based {{research}} (SBR) {{is rapidly}} expanding but <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> reporting needs improvement. For a reader to critically assess a study, <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study {{need to be}} clearly reported. Our objective was to develop reporting guidelines for SBR by creating extensions to <b>the</b> Consolidated Standards <b>of</b> Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Strengthening <b>the</b> Reporting <b>of</b> Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statements. METHODS An iterative multistep consensus-building process was used on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recommended steps for developing reporting <b>guidelines.</b> <b>The</b> consensus process involved the following: (1) developing a steering committee, (2) defining <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reporting <b>guidelines,</b> (3) identifying a consensus panel, (4) generating a list of items for discussion via online premeeting survey, (5) conducting a consensus meeting, and (6) drafting reporting guidelines with an explanation and elaboration document. RESULTS The following 11 extensions were recommended for CONSORT item 1 (title/abstract), item 2 (background), item 5 (interventions), item 6 (outcomes), item 11 (blinding), item 12 (statistical methods), item 15 (baseline data), item 17 (outcomes/estimation), item 20 (limitations), item 21 (generalizability), and item 25 (funding). The following 10 extensions were recommended for STROBE: item 1 (title/abstract), item 2 (background/rationale), item 7 (variables), item 8 (data sources/measurement), item 12 (statistical methods), item 14 (descriptive data), item 16 (main results), item 19 (limitations), item 21 (generalizability), and item 22 (funding).

40|$|Abstract: Guidelines for {{occupational}} physicians are increasing in number. Their quality and content is varied {{and they may}} even provide conflicting recommendations. Earlier studies show that guidelines directed at professionals in occupational health use scientific evidence unsystematically or inadequately. This article assesses <b>the</b> <b>guidelines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Finnish Institute <b>of</b> Occupational Health (FIOH). We selected {{a random sample of}} 29 guidelines from all those published by FIOH, which were assessed by four people individually using the AGREE instrument. The items were scored in six domains: <b>scope</b> and purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guideline,</b> stakeholder involvement, rigour of guideline development, clarity and presentation, application, and editorial independence. Mean domain scores were calculated according to AGREE instructions. <b>The</b> <b>guidelines</b> presented their scope and purpose well; the mean domain score was 62 %. Their clarity and presentation was fairly good, mean domain score 47 %. The stakeholder involvement’s mean domain score was 33 %. The other domains scored low: applicability domain, 15 %, rigour of guideline development, 9 %, and editorial independence, 7 % only. The rigour and reporting of guideline development seems to be the main challenge for future guideline production in FIOH. A common structure for guideline preparation is needed...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> first {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Association <b>of</b> Urology (EAU) guidelines on Pain Management in Urology {{dates back to}} 2003. Since then, these guidelines have been revised several times with the most recent update achieved in 2010. Given <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full text <b>guidelines,</b> condensing <b>the</b> entire document was no option in this context. This paper presents a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> section <b>of</b> pain management in prostate cancer, a topic considered of direct relevance for the practicing urologist. A multidisciplinary expert panel (urologists, anaesthesiologists, radio-oncologists) compiled this document based on a comprehensive consultation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature. Data were identified through a structured search, covering the time frame 2000 through 2010, using Medline and Embase as well as <b>the</b> Cochrane Library <b>of</b> systematic reviews. <b>The</b> scientific papers were weighed by the expert panel and a level of evidence (LE) assigned. Recommendations have been graded {{as a means to}} provide transparency between the underlying evidence and the guidance provided. Pain can occur in each stage of prostate cancer. It could be caused by the cancer itself (77 %), be related to the cancer treatment (19 %) or be unrelated to either (3 %). <b>The</b> incidence <b>of</b> pain rises to 90 % as patients enter <b>the</b> terminal phase <b>of</b> their illness. <b>The</b> physician's task is to discover and treat <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> pain and <b>the</b> pain itself, {{to determine whether or not}} the underlying cause is treatable, to provide pain relief and palliative care. These tasks more often than not require a multidisciplinary team. Pain management involves mainly pharmacotherapy, including direct anticancer therapy such as androgen deprivation and chemotherapy, as well as analgetics, for instance non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids. In case of local impairment due to the cancer or its metastases, primary treatments like surgery, radiotherapy or radionuclides can provide adequate pain relief. In addition, in palliative care, functional, psychosocial and spiritual support are essential components. <b>The</b> EAU <b>guidelines</b> on Pain Management in Urology are available in a number of different formats through the EAU Central Office and the EAU website ([URL]). <b>The</b> mainstay <b>of</b> pain management in prostate cancer is involvement of and collaboration between experts from a number of disciplines to be able to achieve a complete pain evaluation and to offer <b>the</b> full range <b>of</b> treatment options. Prostate cancer-related pain can, in most cases, be managed effectively, but it requires careful monitoring where a balance should be found between pain relief and potential side effects of treatment and quality of life (QoL...|$|R
