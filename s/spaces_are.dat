5|$|The direct {{product of}} vector spaces and the direct sum of vector <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> {{two ways of}} {{combining}} an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.|$|E
5|$|There are 59spaces {{available}} in the stadium to accommodate wheelchair users who have season tickets; a further 33 <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters. These <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> located in the Main Stand, Anfield Road Stand and The Kop. There are 38spaces available for the visually impaired, which are situated in the old paddock area of the Main Stand, with space for one personal assistant each. A headset with full commentary is provided.|$|E
5000|$|A Gδ <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a topological <b>space</b> {{in which}} every closed set is a Gδ set [...] A normal <b>space</b> which <b>is</b> also a Gδ <b>space</b> <b>is</b> {{perfectly}} normal. Every metrizable <b>space</b> <b>is</b> perfectly normal, and every perfectly normal <b>space</b> <b>is</b> completely normal: neither implication is reversible.|$|R
50|$|If {{the first}} arrow can <b>be</b> {{reversed}} the <b>space</b> <b>is</b> R0. If the second arrow can <b>be</b> reversed the <b>space</b> <b>is</b> T0. If the composite arrow can <b>be</b> reversed the <b>space</b> <b>is</b> T1. Clearly, a <b>space</b> <b>is</b> T1 if {{and only if}} it's both R0 and T0.|$|R
50|$|Every real (or complex) affine or {{projective}} <b>space</b> <b>is</b> also a topological space. An affine <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a non-compact manifold; a projective <b>space</b> <b>is</b> {{a compact}} manifold.|$|R
5|$|Vector <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> {{the subject}} of linear algebra and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E
5|$|Car types include coaches, dining cars, lounges, and {{sleeping}} cars. Most passenger <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> {{on the upper}} level, which features a row of windows on both sides. The Sightseer Lounge observation cars have distinctive floor-to-ceiling windows on the upper level. Boarding is on the lower level; passengers climb up a center stairwell to access the upper level.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of nearness, angles or distances. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> introduced; see below.|$|E
5000|$|... (BCT1) Every {{complete}} metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a Baire <b>space.</b> More generally, every topological <b>space</b> which <b>is</b> homeomorphic {{to an open}} {{subset of}} a complete pseudometric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a Baire <b>space.</b> In particular, every completely metrizable <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a Baire <b>space.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Every paracompact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> metacompact. This {{implies that}} every compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> metacompact, and every metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> metacompact. The {{converse}} does not hold: a counter-example is the Dieudonné plank.|$|R
40|$|The {{class of}} θ-compact <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> {{introduced}} which properly contains {{the class of}} almost compact (generalized absolutely closed) <b>spaces</b> and <b>is</b> strictly contained {{in the class of}} quasicompact spaces. In the realm of almost regular spaces, the class of θ-compact spaces coincides with the class of nearly compact spaces. Moreover, an almost regular θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> mildly normal (= K-normal). A θ-closed, θ-embedded subset of a θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> θ-compact and the product of two θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> θ-compact if one of them is compact. A (strongly) θ-continuous image of a θ-compact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> θ-compact (compact). A <b>space</b> <b>is</b> compact if and only if it is θ-compact and θ-point paracompact...|$|R
5|$|Just {{because an}} SSD {{supports}} the TRIM command {{does not necessarily}} mean {{it will be able to}} perform at top speed immediately after a TRIM command. The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD. It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> consolidated to show improved performance.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} other venues for student work at Syracuse University. In the Shaffer Art Building is the Lowe Art Gallery, which {{features}} student work. Gallery <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> also available for reservation {{on the fourth floor}} of the Bird Library.|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
50|$|Every paracompact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> metacompact, {{and every}} metacompact <b>space</b> <b>is</b> orthocompact.|$|R
5000|$|Every metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> Tychonoff; every pseudometric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> {{completely}} regular.|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} a b-metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> very {{important}} as the class of b-metric <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> larger than that of metric spaces, since a b-metric <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a metric <b>space</b> when s= 1.|$|R
5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day. At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the indri (Indri) {{use their}} toothcombs {{to scoop up}} fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus), and galagos (particularly the genera Galago and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is {{specially}} adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.|$|E

5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> {{endowed with}} a suitable inner product. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally {{the structure of a}} Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E
5|$|Roanoke Regional {{features}} a large surface parking lot, which {{is divided into}} long term (996 spaces) and short term (226 spaces) parking. An additional 598 parking <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> available in an overflow lot across Aviation Drive during peak travel times. In service since 1990, a small parking shuttle bus operates every 10 to 15 minutes between 6 a.m. and midnight. Future improvements to the parking areas {{will result in the}} construction of a multi-level parking garage atop the site of the existing long term lot.|$|E
5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> {{frequently used}} {{in the theory of}} stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means that the sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.|$|E

It is of marble, round, with a high back, and is carved in high relief with figures of saints and scenes from the Gospels—the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi, the flight into Egypt and the baptism of Christ. The smaller <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> filled with carvings of animals, birds, flowers and foliated ornament. The Chair of St. Augustine, dating from at least the early thirteenth century is one of the oldest cathedrae is not in use.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E
5|$|Today, vector <b>spaces</b> <b>are</b> applied {{throughout}} mathematics, {{science and}} engineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion {{to deal with}} systems of linear equations; offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is employed in image compression routines; or provide an environment {{that can be used}} for solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.|$|E

First, the Littlewood-Paley characterization of B˙σ-Morrey-Campanato <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> established. As an application, the boundedness of Riesz potential operators is revisted. Also, a characterization of B˙σ-Lipschitz <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> obtained: and, as an application, the boundedness of Riesz potential operators on B˙σ-Lipschitz <b>spaces</b> <b>is</b> discussed...|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, a weak Hausdorff {{space or}} weakly Hausdorff <b>space</b> <b>is</b> a topological <b>space</b> where {{the image of}} every {{continuous}} map from a compact Hausdorff space into the <b>space</b> <b>is</b> closed. In particular, every Hausdorff <b>space</b> <b>is</b> weak Hausdorff.
