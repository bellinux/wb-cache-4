5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} built in Saxon times, as the Port of Bristol first began. In medieval times, St. Mary Redcliffe, sitting on a red cliff above the River Avon, was a sign to seafarers, who would pray in it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return. The church was built and beautified by Bristol's wealthy merchants, who paid to have masses sung for their <b>souls</b> <b>and</b> {{many of whom are}} commemorated there.|$|E
5|$|To {{regain the}} Na'vi's trust, Jake connects {{his mind to}} that of Toruk, a dragon-like {{predator}} feared and honored by the Na'vi.

50|$|The two {{versions}} of <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body are found in two separate poetry collections. The first {{is found in the}} Vercelli manuscript, and is entitled, by modern scholars, <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body I. The other is found in the Exeter manuscript, and is entitled, also by modern scholars, <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body II. <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body I differs from the Exeter version, in that, following the damned souls address is a parallel address from a blessed soul to its body. <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body II ends after The Damned Souls address, which consists of 126 lines of verse. <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body I, however, continues with what remains of The Blessed Souls address, another 40 lines of verse. The Vercelli manuscript seems to be missing several pages and, as a result, The Blessed Souls address breaks off at line 166 with the word þisses.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine Plato’s {{conception}} {{of the relation between}} <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> body in the Timaeus as an antecedent of the modern standard version of the mind-body interactionist dualism. The following points are discussed: 1. 	<b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> body as distinct substances (Tim. 30 a-b; 41 c; 42 e- 43 a); 2. 	<b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> body as necessarily connected in a close interaction to give birth to the individual living being (Tim. 34 c; 36 e; 41 d; 42 a); 3. 	The modalities of interaction between <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> body (Tim. 34 a- 37 c); 4. 	The “place” of the interaction between <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> body (Tim. 73 b-d); 5. 	The nature of the interaction between <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> body as the proper “self” of the individual living being (Tim. 41 a- 44 c; 69 c- 71 d; 73 b-d). These issues are related to some modern accounts of the status of the self...|$|R

5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have <b>souls</b> <b>and</b> that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{enters the}} Desert of Lost <b>Souls,</b> <b>and</b> Athena tells him Pandora's Box is {{hidden in a}} temple chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos—a {{punishment}} by Zeus for Cronos' role in the Great War. Kratos summons Cronos, climbs for three days before reaching the Temple entrance, overcomes an array of deadly traps and an army of monsters, and eventually finds the Box. But Ares, aware of his former servant's success, kills Kratos as the latter is leaving the Temple. While harpies take the Box to Ares, Kratos falls into the Underworld. He battles his way through the fiery realm, and with help from the mysterious gravedigger, who tells him Athena is not the only god watching over him, he escapes and returns to Athens.|$|E

50|$|<b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body {{refers to}} two {{anonymous}} Old English poems: <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body I, which {{is found in}} the Vercelli Book, <b>and</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body II, found in the Exeter Book. It {{is one of the oldest}} poems to have survived in two manuscripts of Old English, each version slightly different from the other. Despite their differences (in structure and length, for example), the <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> Body poems address similar themes. Both versions ask the committed and penitent Christian reader to call to mind his bodily actions on earth in relation to his soul’s afterlife. A sense of exigency {{is found in the}} poems, imploring the body to live according to the <b>soul's</b> fate <b>and</b> not the desires of the flesh.|$|R
5|$|Rakie Olufunmilayo Ayola (born May 1968) is a Welsh actress, {{best known}} for her role as Kyla Tyson in the BBC medical drama Holby City.

Ayola has worked in theatre, film and television, appearing in a number of Shakespearean theatrical performances, Hollywood films The i Inside and Sahara, and British television shows including Soldier Soldier, EastEnders, Sea of <b>Souls</b> <b>and</b> Doctor Who. She appeared in Holby City from its eighth to eleventh series, from 2006 to 2008, and in 2009 starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. In 2017, Ayola took over the role of Hermione Granger in the West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their <b>souls</b> <b>and</b> material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|The Aegean Sea setting {{includes}} {{a mass of}} shipwrecked vessels. Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares, the God of War; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls, a vast and windy desert of ancient ruins. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora’s Temple, which is chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades, respectively. The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of <b>souls</b> <b>and</b> flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens is the scene of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room.|$|E

50|$|Dvaitādvaita was {{proposed}} by Nimbarka, a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra region. According to this philosophy {{there are three}} categories of existence: Brahman, <b>soul,</b> <b>and</b> matter. <b>Soul</b> <b>and</b> matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> matter are dependent. Thus <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopis; of the Vrindavan; and devotion consists in self-surrender.|$|R

5|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their <b>souls),</b> <b>and</b> fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{travels to}} Cairo, where they {{meet up with}} Indy's friend Sallah, a skilled excavator. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with {{a replica of the}} {{headpiece}} (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Indy discovers Marion is alive, bound and gagged in a tent, but does not release her for fear of alerting the Nazis. Indy, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of <b>Souls</b> <b>and</b> acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive, seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer.|$|E
5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their <b>souls</b> <b>and</b> grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E
