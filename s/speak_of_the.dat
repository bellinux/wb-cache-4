5|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} the brick shrine was {{destroyed}} either by a cyclone or a tsunami which took place 2,200 years ago.

50|$|Contrary {{to what is}} {{sometimes}} believed, Jean-Jacques Rousseau never used the phrase noble savage (French bon sauvage).

5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264BC when {{inhabitants}} of Sicily began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay—Rome and Carthage—to resolve internal conflicts. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. Before the First Punic War there was no Roman navy to <b>speak</b> <b>of.</b> <b>The</b> new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.|$|E

5|$|Two {{important}} {{consequences of}} the group axioms are {{the uniqueness of the}} identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity, and the inverse of an element.|$|E
5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|The Western Baltic Kurgans culture, which {{resulted}} from the interaction between groups arriving from {{the east and the}} people living in the Masuria-Sambia region (middle first millennium BC) is discussed in the Bronze and Iron Age Poland article, within its time frame. The process of separation and differentiation of the eastern and western Baltic tribes deepened during the period of Roman influence, when the economy, culture and customs of the Western Balts became increasingly influenced by the more highly developed Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures people. From the beginning of the Common Era we can <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Balt culture, which included several distinct groups of the Western Baltic cultural circle and which definitely can be connected with the Baltic peoples.|$|E

5|$|More than 400 student {{clubs and}} {{organizations}} operate on Duke's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides {{most of the}} funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life.

Performance groups such as Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second-oldest student-run musical theater organization, a cappella groups, student bands, and theater organizations are also prominent on campus.

The Duke University mock trial team won the national championship in 2012. The Duke University Student Dining Advisory Committee provides guidance to the administration on issues regarding student dining, life, and restaurant choices.|$|E
