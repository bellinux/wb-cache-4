5|$|Promoted to {{sergeant}} on 28 July, Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German {{machine gun}} positions and strongholds; {{this information was}} to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part. At one point during the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire, Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick's action were <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.|$|E
5|$|When he was fifteen, Vainio felt <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{become a}} writer. As {{a young man}} he read a book about poetics, and later said that the rules were easy to break once he had learned them. It became {{apparent}} in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer. However, teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column-like text he had written, because the teacher felt {{that it could not}} be graded as an essay. Although essays were his strong point, school was uninteresting for Juha. He considered quitting school, but the principal persuaded him to change his mind. He was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus. In the end, the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled were singing and sports.|$|E
5|$|The studio had wasted $5 {{million and}} a year's worth of time with Abel and Associates, {{although}} Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount's money. Trumbull, meanwhile, had completed Close Encounters but his plan for a full feature had been cancelled by Paramount, a move some considered punishment for passing on Star Trek. With Trumbull now available, primary responsibility for The Motion Pictures optical effects passed on to him. In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche {{if he could get}} the opticals work completed by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was confident that he could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish. The effects budget climbed to $10million.|$|E

25|$|Nelson {{always took}} care in public to define himself first and {{foremost}} as an American, with no conflicted loyalty to his birth country. But in the background he had supported Norway in various ways, and notably in inviting Norwegian officers to observe and learn from American tactics in Cuba. He had been planning a trip to Norway for some time, but made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> visit Sweden and Denmark, emphasizing his Scandinavian-American background.|$|E

I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play very well and do the team much credit. It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.|$|E
25|$|Zelko {{was subject}} to intense g-forces as the {{aircraft}} tumbled and had great difficulty in assuming the correct posture for ejecting. After his parachute deployed, he used his survival radio to issue a mayday call {{and was able to}} contact the KC-135 that had seen him shot down. Zelko used his survival radio while still descending although this was contrary to his training. He reasoned the altitude would give his signal the best possible range and was also <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be quickly taken prisoner by Yugoslavian forces on the ground and wanted to confirm he was unhurt before this happened.|$|E

25|$|Unable {{to ride in}} Canada, Kelly {{rode the}} 1976 Tour of Britain {{and then went to}} Metz, in France, after a London enthusiast, Johnny Morris, had {{arranged}} an invitation. The club offered him £25 a week, free accommodation and four francs a kilometre for every race he won. Kelly won 18 of the 25 races he started in France and won the amateur Giro di Lombardia in Italy. That impressed two French team managers, Jean de Gribaldy and Cyrille Guimard. De Gribaldy went to Ireland unannounced to discuss a contract with the Flandria professional team. He didn't know where Kelly lived and wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> recognise him. He took with him another cyclist, to point out Kelly and translate the conversation. Kelly was out driving a tractor and de Gribaldy set out again in the taxi that had brought him from Dublin, hoping to find Kelly as he drove home. They found him and went to Kelly's stepbrother's house. De Gribaldy offered £4,000 a year plus bonuses. A week later Kelly asked for £6,000 and got it. He signed for de Gribaldy with misgivings about going back on his promise to return to Metz, where the club had offered him better terms than before.|$|E
500|$|For Frank's protection, he {{was taken}} to the Milledgeville State Penitentiary {{in the middle of the}} night before the {{commutation}} was announced. The penitentiary was [...] "strongly garrisoned and newly bristling with arms" [...] and separated from Marietta by [...] of mostly unpaved road. However, on July 17, The New York Times reported that fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat with a [...] butcher knife, severing his jugular vein. The attacker told the authorities he [...] "wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence, Frank's presence was a disgrace to the prison, and he was <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be pardoned if he killed Frank." ...|$|E

He questions whether they can convincingly portray the roles if they are still virgins. Later, his co-director Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) confesses to him that she is attracted to football recruiter Cooter Menkins (Eric Bruskotter), who is at McKinley to scout potential players for Ohio State, though she is <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never consider her. Artie thinks otherwise, and acting on his advice, Cooter arranges a date with her.|$|E

500|$|The British fleet {{was soon}} heavily engaged, passing down the French line and {{engaging}} their ships one by one. Nelson on Vanguard personally engaged Spartiate, also coming {{under fire from}} Aquilon. At about eight o'clock, he was with Berry on the quarter-deck when a piece of French shot struck him in his forehead. He fell to the deck, a flap of torn skin obscuring his good eye. Blinded and half stunned, he felt <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> die and cried out [...] "I am killed. Remember me to my wife." [...] He was taken below {{to be seen by}} the surgeon. After examining Nelson, the surgeon pronounced the wound non-threatening and applied a temporary bandage.|$|E
500|$|Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Affairs, Rashad Mohammed al-Alimi, said Yemeni {{investigators}} believe the suspect traveled in October to Shabwa, where {{he may have}} obtained the explosives and received training. He met with suspected al-Qaida members in a house built by al-Awlaki and used by al-Awlaki to hold religious meetings. [...] "If he went to Shabwa, for <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have met Anwar al-Awlaki," [...] al-Alimi said. Al-Alimi also said he believed al-Awlaki was alive. [...] And Abdul Elah al-Shaya, a Yemeni journalist, said a healthy al-Awlaki called him on December 28 {{and said that the}} Yemeni government's claims as to his death were [...] "lies". Shaya declined to comment as to whether al-Awlaki had told him about any contacts he may have had with Abdulmutallab. [...] According to Gregory Johnsen, a Yemeni expert at Princeton University, Shaya is generally reliable.|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the height}} of Vaughan's {{substance}} abuse, he drank [...] of whiskey and used [...] of cocaine each day.

According to the Associated Press, he [...] "backtracked" [...] from his 1995 term-limit pledge in May 2004, stating that the voters should be the ones making the decision.

They would later confirmed to be reuniting for Paid Dues and an international 20th anniversary tour starting in May 2013. On March 22, 2013, Havoc and Prodigy officially reunited for an interview, and touched base on the turmoil between them.

2500|$|In the best-of-17 final O'Sullivan {{defeated}} McCulloch 9–5 to win {{his second}} consecutive ranking title. It was his 21st ranking final and 16th ranking title, which meant he was now third on the list ahead of Williams and Higgins. The victory earned him £60,000 and meant he had won all the ranking events on the calendar at least once. After the match O'Sullivan said he could still improve: [...] "I have set myself high standards and I don't think I was firing on any cylinders."
