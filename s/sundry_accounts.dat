After <b>sundry</b> <b>accounts</b> of himself, his family, his connections, his friends, his jokes, his business, and his brothers (most talkative men {{have a great deal}} to say about their brothers), Mr. Peter Magnus took a view of Mr. Pickwick through his coloured spectacles for several minutes, and then said, with an air of modesty-- ...|$|E
40|$|In American public imagination, {{courts are}} {{powerful}} but also impotent. They are guardians of citizens' rights but also agents of corporate wealth; simultaneously the least dangerous branch {{and the ultimate}} arbiters of fairness and justice. After recounting the social science literature on the mixed reception of courts in American public culture, this essay explains how the contradictory embrace of courts and law by Americans is not a weakness or flaw, nor a mark of confusion or naïveté. Rather, Americans' paradoxical interpretations of courts and judges sustain rather than undermine our legal institutions. These opposing accounts {{are a source of}} institutional durability and power because they combine the historical and widespread aspirations {{for the rule of law}} with a pragmatic recognition of the limits of institutional practice; these <b>sundry</b> <b>accounts</b> balance an appreciation for the discipline of legal reasoning with desires for responsive, humane judgment...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} fish smoking {{processes}} {{was conducted in}} Ilaje Local Government Area (ILGA) of Ondo State between March and June 2001. Data were collected from fish processors at different fishing communities {{with the aid of}} structured questionnaires Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The predominant processing and preservation techniques employed is smoke-drying (93. 75 %) with <b>sundrying</b> <b>accounting</b> for 6. 25 %. Two types of traditional smoking kiln used were oil drum and raffia palm racks. Firewood and kerosine are the main combustion fuels used during smoke-drying. Commonly use wood that produced good quality smoked fish were Rhizophora racemosa, Nauclea diderrichii, Lophira alata, Nauclea latifolia, and Entadrophragma cylindricum [...] Various fish species and sizes were processed Based on frequency of occurrence the family Clupidae had the highest number of fish processed while shrimp/prawn had the least. Fish smoking procedure starts from collection from the capture site to smoking of fish in the smoking room. Scales of fish are not removed before smoking. Small size fish are smoked singly or in multiples on sticks. Large sized fish are smoked singly or in twos and threes. The same species are always sticked together. Small, medium and large-sized fish were not gutted before smoking while extra large are cut in o chunks before smoking...|$|R

In short, I was glad, at last, to get fifteen dollars for her, and comforted myself with thinking that I had at least gained twenty-five dollars worth of experience in the transaction, {{to say nothing of the}} fine exercise.|$|R

Without even {{waiting to be}} paid, the illustrious craftsman departed this life, and was buried under an ornate tombstone, whose winged cherubs would have afforded singularly little scope for the exercise of his favourite art. There remained, however, the widow Pincini, to whom the six hundred francs were due. And thereupon arose the great crisis {{in the life of}} Henri Deplis, traveller of commerce. The legacy, under the stress of numerous little calls on its substance, had dwindled to very insignificant proportions, and when a pressing wine bill and <b>sundry</b> other current <b>accounts</b> had been paid, there remained little more than 430 francs to offer to the widow. The lady was properly indignant, not wholly, as she volubly explained, on account of the suggested writing-off of 170 francs, but also at the attempt to depreciate the value of her late husband's acknowledged masterpiece. In a week's time Deplis was obliged to reduce his offer to 405 francs, which circumstance fanned the widow's indignation into a fury. She cancelled the sale of the work of art, and a few days later Deplis learned with a sense of consternation that she had presented it to the municipality of Bergamo, which had gratefully accepted it. He left the neighbourhood as unobtrusively as possible, and was genuinely relieved when his business commands took him to Rome, where he hoped his identity and that of the famous picture might be lost sight of.|$|R
40|$|Manuscript copy. Photographs pasted in. The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to present}} a report on an {{electric}} generating station of the size most commonly encountered in electric lighting work. This size station, and others varying in size from a little smaller to a little larger capacity, are the type found {{all over the country}} {{with the exception of the}} cities and in most cases they are in the same condition. Very few of them keep complete reports and some do not keep any records at all except of the customers that have not paid their bills. The writer has been associated with this plant and only in a few instances have figures been used which were not approximately correct. The gathering of material for this report was started early in the school year and it was the object to get the full data for it but the company changed hands, and at the same time policies, and as a result the gathering of material was somewhat checked and information was gathered from various and <b>sundry</b> sources which <b>accounts</b> for the brevity of some parts. A few suggestions are to be made as to a better arrangement of machinery and to the handling of coal. A few changes in the present condition of steam lines will probably cut down the amount of coal used and this will result in a lower cost per kilowatt hour. Proposed changes of the station building will be taken up and while they may not be considered by the owners, they will however, be feasible.

6000|$|Mademoiselle had an {{excellent}} opinion of herself--an opinion not wholly undeserved, for she possessed some good and sterling qualities; but she rather over-estimated the kind and degree of these qualities, and quite {{left out of the}} <b>account</b> <b>sundry</b> little defects which accompanied them. You could never have persuaded her that she was a prejudiced and narrow-minded person, that she was too susceptible on the subject of her own dignity and importance, and too apt to take offence about trifles; yet all this was true. However, where her claims to distinction were not opposed, and where her prejudices were not offended, she could be kind and friendly enough. To her two brothers (for there was another Gérard Moore besides Robert) she was very much attached. As the sole remaining representatives of their decayed family, the persons of both were almost sacred in her eyes. Of Louis, however, she knew less than of Robert. He had been sent to England when a mere boy, and had received his education at an English school. His education not being such as to adapt him for trade, perhaps, too, his natural bent not inclining him to mercantile pursuits, he had, when the blight of hereditary prospects rendered it necessary for him to push his own fortune, adopted the very arduous and very modest career of a teacher. He had been usher in a school, and was said now to be tutor in a private family. Hortense, when she mentioned Louis, described him as having what she called [...] "des moyens," [...] but as being too backward and quiet. Her praise of Robert was in a different strain, less qualified: she was very proud of him; she regarded him as the greatest man in Europe; all he said and did was remarkable in her eyes, and she expected others to behold him from the same point of view; nothing could be more irrational, monstrous, and infamous than opposition from any quarter to Robert, unless it were opposition to herself.|$|R
