25|$|Virtual {{profiles}} {{are created}} automatically, for both reflow or wave <b>solder</b> <b>machines.</b> An initial recipe setup {{is required for}} modeling purposes, but once completed, profiling can be made virtual. As the system is automatic, profiles can be generated periodically or continuously for each and every assembly. SPC charts along with CpK {{can be used as}} an aid when collecting a mountain of process-related data. Automated profiling systems continuously monitor the process and create profiles for each assembly. As barcoding becomes more common with both reflow and wave processes, the two technologies can be combined for profiling traceability, allowing each generated profile to be searchable by barcode. This is useful when an assembly is questioned at some time in the future. As a profile is created for each assembly, a quick search using the PCB’s barcode can pull up the profile in question and provide evidence that the component was processed in spec. Additionally, tighter process control can be achieved when combining automated profiling with barcoding, such as confirming that the correct process has been input by the operator before launching a production run.|$|R

40|$|A {{commercial}} CFD code, FLOW- 3 D, {{is adapted}} to model the flow of solder around {{a printed circuit board}} during the wave soldering process. A method to model the flow of solder through the nozzle of the <b>solder</b> <b>machine</b> and the flow of solder around a component is presented. The movement of the component through the wave is achieved by holding the component stationary and moving the wave past the component. Changes are made in the boundary conditions and a new boundary condition developed to model the movement of the wave. Simulation of the wave soldering of a single component on a coarse grid showed the surface tension model would not allow the formation of a fillet at equilibrium shape. Analysis of the formation of a fillet in three dimensions showed the method could not describe the formation of an equilibrium shape of solder without an exceptionally fine grid. This was due to the strong surface tension forces creating unbalanced accelerations and high velocities in the fluid. A promising method to damp the velocities created by the surface tension forces was utilized to show how the formation of a fillet could be approximated. A technique to model the last stages of the movement of solder past the component is presented. Used in conjunction with the velocity damping model, the technique shows promise as a method of analyzing the interaction of the wave and fillet during the final stages of wave soldering. ...|$|R

40|$|The reflow {{soldering}} process, which has growing {{requirements for the}} purity of electronic components, is applied frequently with nitrogen as a protection gas. The nitrogen reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere and leads to lower use of flux and activators. This common nitrogen technology is connected with high gas consumption, and for this reason, it is also expensive. The newly developed auto-protection gas soldering (APG soldering) works with a low boiling point liquid. This liquid is vaporized in the <b>soldering</b> <b>machine.</b> The resulting vapor displaces the air and {{is used as a}} protective atmosphere. In a convection <b>soldering</b> <b>machine,</b> the vapor is overheated up to the soldering temperature, and is also used as a carrier gas for the convection heating.

Another advantage is the very good heat transition of the vapor in comparison to a dry gas. This allows smaller temperature differences on the boards during the soldering process...|$|E

40|$|Getting {{started on}} a new {{knowledge}} engineering proj-ect is a difficult and challenging task, {{even for those who}} have done it before. For those who haven’t, the task can of-ten prove impossible. One reason is that the requirements-oriented methods and intuitions learned in the develop-ment of other types of software do not carry over well to the knowledge engineering task. Another reason is that methodologies for developing expert systems by extract-ing, representing, and manipulating an expert’s knowledge have been slow in coming. At Tektronix, we have been using a step-by-step ap-proach to prototyping expert systems for over two years now. The primary features of this approach are that it gives software engineers who do not know knowledge en-gineering an easy place to start, and that it proceeds in a step-by-step fashion from initiation to implementation without inducing conceptual bottlenecks into the devel-opment process.

40|$|Cracked SMT {{capacitors}} {{and their}} root causes {{have been discussed}} at length in the literature 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for years. Cracked capacitors can manifest themselves as latent defects such as increased leakage current, intermittent opens or shorts or no problem found when field returned assemblies are analyzed. In some cases those defects can lead to catastrophic failure depending on the application and energy available. Cracks could be introduced at virtually any point in the surface mount assembly process from pick and place, soldering and assembly handling after soldering. Understanding the application, assembly process and final product configuration are necessary to eliminate capacitor cracking. Things have changed to {{change the face of}} capacitor cracking during the past two decades. Improved pick and place equipment have virtually eliminated that source of cracking as the equipment designers took capacitor cracking seriously and eliminated it as a source. Manufacturers and users of wave soldering equipment now better understand sources of thermal shock and most wave <b>solder</b> <b>machines</b> have adequate preheat control and have minimized that source of cracking except on big chips like 1812 (4. 5 x 2. 5 mm) and larger or thick chips (> 0. 050 ” or 1. 25 mm) of any case size.

40|$|Electroluminescent (EL) wire is {{a unique}} kind of wire because it glows when {{attached}} to a power source. EL wire has many applications, both creative and practical. For example: Burning Man enthusiasts like to adorn their clothing with the flexible wire, and emergency responders use it to mark off accidents on the road at night. What makes EL wire glow is the electrical reactions between its copper wires and phosphor coating. The problem with this wire, however, {{is that it is}} very difficult to connect it to a battery. This is due to the wire’s structure. Beneath its protective plastic shielding, EL wire has a core copper wire, double wrapped with a very fine pair of copper wires. These fine copper wires are hard to solder to, and can break without much effort. Standard soldering methods use a basic alligator tooth style double clamp to hold EL wires in place for soldering. This device is very poorly made, as one must tighten and re-tighten every moveable joint for a precision solder. Adjusting these clamps can be maddening, especially when many EL solder joints must be made. There must be a better way to terminate EL wire, therefore various connection methods are considered as possible solutions. They are: improved hand <b>soldering,</b> <b>machine</b> soldering, conducive epoxy, and crimping. Ultimately it was decided that an improved solder technique would prove to be the best solution. And it entailed manufacturing a custom fixture that would hold the EL wire for easy soldering. The design went though many phases and was tested to see if it commanded a faster soldering time over its clamping counterpart. The results suggest the fixture has a mean soldering time that is statistically significantly less than the mean soldering time of the alligator clamps, with ninety-five percent confidence. An economic analysis determined that if even just one electrician were to try to profit off of making EL wire assemblies, working either full-time or part-time, he or she would save money in labor hours by purchasing the fixture. A hobbyist on the other hand, who makes only a few EL wire assemblies a month, might be stretching his or her wallet too far by spend the money for the fixture. The bottom line is that if someone stands to make a profit off EL wire assemblies, or is serious about making all kinds of EL artwork, this fixture will save the user time...|$|E
