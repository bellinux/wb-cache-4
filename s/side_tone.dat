50|$|The first {{reference}} to the instrument in Ireland is provided by John O'Keefe in (1760) {{as an instrument of}} polite society and the emerging 'Pastoral' and prototype Union pipe influenced the folk tradition of the 18th and 19th century in Scotland and Ireland. This {{can be thought of as}} a shared tradition which served a Neo-baroque orchestral and concert fashion but also drew strongly on the ‘native traditions’ of both Scotland and Ireland and the music styles of the times.The pastoral pipes can be played either standing or in a seated position using a set of bellows, and the chanter is similar to the later Union pipes, but it had an added foot joint that extended its range one tone lower. This added foot joint had holes in its sides in addition to the hole at the bottom of the bore. The pastoral pipes are like the Highland pipes in that the sound is continuous; notes are articulated by finger techniques such as gracenotes. The Union pipes, which evolved from the pastoral pipes, enable the player to interrupt the flow of air by stopping the end of the chanter on his knee; this doesn't work for the Pastoral instrument because of the <b>side</b> <b>tone</b> holes. Many later Pastoral sets, though, have a dismountable foot joint; when this is removed they can be played as union pipes. The surviving instruments indicate that the Pastoral pipes had two or three drones and generally one regulator.|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{disclosed}} for position locating, deriving centralized {{air traffic control}} data, and communicating via voice and digital signals between a multiplicity of remote aircraft, including supersonic transports, and a central station. Such communication takes place through a synchronous satellite relay station. <b>Side</b> <b>tone</b> ranging patterns, {{as well as the}} digital and voice signals, are modulated on a carrier transmitted from the central station and received on all of the supersonic transports. Each aircraft communicates with the ground stations via a different frequency multiplexed spectrum. Supersonic transport position is derived from a computer at the central station and supplied to a local air traffic controller. Position is determined in response to variable phase information imposed on the side tones at the aircrafts. Common to all of the <b>side</b> <b>tone</b> techniques is Doppler compensation for the supersonic transport velocity...|$|E

The ground station facilities, balloon platforms and the aircraft were supplied by the European Space Research Organization. One ground simulation and two aircraft flights at low elevation angles were conducted. Even under high interference conditions good performance was obtained for both voice communications and <b>side</b> <b>tone</b> ranging. High bit errors occurred in the data channels resulting in false commands.

50|$|Early in its lifetime, {{electrical}} interference {{problems caused by}} GWEN system operation began to surface. Since the stations were using LF, the chosen frequency was within 1 kHz of the operating frequency of nearby electrical carrier current systems. With GWEN handling constant voice, teletype and other data traffic, it caused interference to the power companies diagnostic two kilohertz <b>side</b> carrier <b>tone.</b> When the <b>side</b> carrier <b>tone</b> disappeared due to interference from GWEN, the power grid would interpret that as a system fault.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A link {{rendezvous}} protocol {{is proposed}} {{in the context of}} first responder applications. These applications require protocols that can withstand the total loss of infrastructure, evolve autonomously, and scale to meet the capacity demands of a crisis. Our protocol does not rely on critical infrastructure. It is designed to be spectrally efficient and it minimizes the risk of interference to ongoing communications. We present an overall process which facilitates establishing and maintaining self-configuring networks based upon a service paradigm. We then present the link rendezvous process in detail. At the heart of this process is an attention signal composed of a carrier with carefully designed <b>side</b> <b>tones.</b> The parameters and performance metrics associated with this attention signal and link rendezvous protocol are discussed. The probabilities of false positives and negatives in the detection of this signal are analyzed numerically. Time to connect factors are also analyzed. I...|$|R
50|$|The {{contrary}} of compelled signalling {{is referred}} to as non-compelled signalling. An example includes DTMF, where the originating <b>side</b> sends <b>tones</b> and silence in the forward direction, without being able to ascertain whether each tone has been correctly received by the terminating side. In order to minimise the risk of signalling errors, minimum durations are imposed, both on the tones and on the intervening periods of silence.|$|R

50|$|After {{processing}} the two negatives, {{the red and}} cyan records were printed separately on a single strip of Eastman or DuPont duplitized stock. Since the red negative was reversed in camera (that is, its emulsion away from the lens), there was no optical printing required to focus the image, and thus contact printing on both emulsions took place. Both <b>sides</b> were <b>toned</b> by floating each side in a tank with the complementary colors (cyan for the side exposed with the red negative and vice versa) using toning chemicals or through dye mordanting.|$|R

30|$|This work {{concentrates}} on the other main category, namely signal-based methods. They predict quality based on evaluation of a test speech signal at {{the output of the}} channel. They can be divided into two further sub-categories, intrusive or non-intrusive. Intrusive signal-based methods use an original reference and a degraded signal, which is the output of the system under test. They identify the audible distortions based on the perceptual domain representation of two signals incorporating human auditory models. Several intrusive models have been developed during recent years. The ITU-T Recommendation P. 861 (PSQM), published in 1996, was a first attempt to objectively model human listeners and predict speech quality from subjective listener tests. It was succeeded in 2001 by P. 862, commonly known as PESQ, a full-reference metric for predicting speech quality. PESQ has been widely used and was enhanced and extended over the next decade. It was originally designed and tested on narrowband signals. It improved on PSQM and the model handles a range of transmission channel problems and variations including varied speech levels, codecs, delays, packet loss, and environmental noise. However, it has a number of acknowledged shortcomings including listening levels, loudness loss, effects of delay in conversational tests, talker echo, and <b>side</b> <b>tones</b> [1]. An extension to PESQ was developed that adapted the input filters and MOS mapping to allow wideband signal quality prediction [3].|$|R

5000|$|Tensions {{have grown}} {{over the past}} few years during Sea Shepherd's {{confrontations}} with Japanese whaling vessels in the whale sanctuary off the coast of Antarctica. In 2008, the documentary-style TV series Whale Wars began filming these confrontations, bringing some light to both sides of the controversy. The same year, two Greenpeace protesters were arrested in Japan for their investigation of whale meat.

50|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1949/50, Fender refined the design. The neck width at the nut was narrowed, and the head {{modified}} to accommodate all six tuners on one <b>side.</b> A <b>tone</b> selector switch was added, and the controls were mounted on a plate parallel to the strings. The scratch plate was enlarged. Around the spring of 1950, Fender had completed a neck pickup design, which was smaller than the lead pickup and was encased in a metal shielding cover. However, this last feature was not to make it onto Fender's first commercially introduced guitar, as Fender's distributor, the Radio & Television Equipment Company (RTEC), had decided {{that it would be}} easier to sell the single pickup version of the guitar.|$|R

Their English counterparts were Lawrence, Lambert, Montagu, and Lisle. The negotiations started where they had left off in 1652: the Dutch reiterated their 36 articles and demanded access to the American colonies; the English replied with a restatement of their demand for reparations and their previously rejected proposal for a political union between the two countries. Cromwell proposed that [...] "while the two countries should retain their municipal laws" [...] the two countries should [...] "be under one supreme power, consisting of representatives of both countries" [...] and [...] "natives of both countries should mutually enjoy their privileges, without any difference or distinction."After Jongestal and Nieupoort had returned to The Hague to receive instructions regarding this startling proposal in mid-August 1653, the English <b>side</b> <b>toned</b> down the proposal {{in favor of a}} less far-reaching proposal for an alliance between the Protestant Powers of Europe and France, against the Catholic Powers, in which the Commonwealth and the Republic would take the lead; a commission, consisting of an equal number of members from each country, to determine differences peacefully; a joint fleet to [...] "secure the sea;" [...] liberty of the inhabitants of both countries to trade in Europe and overseas; the assignment of trade in East Asia solely to the Dutch in exchange for indemnification of the E.I.C.; the assignment of trade in the Americas (except Brazil, that was to be divided in influence spheres between the two countries) exclusively to the Commonwealth; and Dutch naval assistance to English attempts at conquest in Spanish America.
