5|$|There {{has never}} been a <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> at Charing Cross station itself. On 25 October 1913, two trains {{collided}} in thick fog at Waterloo junction, killing three people. On 31 July 1925, there was a minor side-on collision near platform 2.|$|E
5|$|A <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> {{occurred}} on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the bogies {{on the leading}} coach left the rails, causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) to be injured seriously {{enough for them to}} be taken to the Western Infirmary.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{problems}} with the defense budget in 1964 prevented the substantial sums required from being allocated. Continuing financial short-falls prevented the proposed effort from getting off the ground. This, {{as well as a}} <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> in 1969 which caused a partial meltdown in the small Lucens pilot reactor, strengthened opposition against the Swiss nuclear program.|$|E

5|$|When Boycott {{was eight}} years old, he was impaled through his chest by the handle of a mangle after falling off an iron railing near his home. Boycott nearly died, and in the efforts to save his life, his spleen was removed. In March 1950, Boycott's father had a <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> {{while working as a}} coalminer, {{suffering}} severe damage to his spine after he was hit by empty coal carts; He never fully recovered, and died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one <b>serious</b> <b>accident,</b> in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the amount of damage. On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E

His wife and daughter know nothing of what has befallen him and struggle to live in the city. The daughter gets a position in a sweatshop, and her eyesight deteriorates until she is unable to work anymore. Now blind, she resorts to playing the violin for money while her mother becomes a beggar.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} no <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> in the {{immediate}} area around Victoria station.

5|$|A <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> with {{radioactivity}} release {{occurred in}} the 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day. The highest exposure to a person was 1.25R of hard radiation and 4.7roentgen equivalent physical of soft radiation.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more <b>serious,</b> <b>accident</b> occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a <b>serious</b> <b>accident.</b> Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from Cornell, Chamberlin {{was hired by}} the University of Utah, where he worked from 1904 to 1908, as an assistant professor (19041905) then full professor. He soon began improving biology courses, which at the time were only of high school grade, to collegiate standards, and introduced new courses in vertebrate histology and embryology. He was the first dean of University of Utah School of Medicine, serving from 1905 to 1907. During the summer of 1906, his plans to teach a summer course in embryology at the University of Chicago were cancelled when he suffered a <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> in a fall, breaking two leg bones and severing an artery in his leg. In 1907, University officials decided to merge the medical school into an existing department, which made Chamberlin's deanship obsolete. He resigned as dean in May, 1907, although remained a faculty member. The medical students strongly objected, crediting the school's gains {{over the past few years}} largely to his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham had one <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> whilst flying. On 20 November 1975 at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey, a {{flock of}} Snowy plover birds {{collided}} with the British Aerospace BAe 125 aircraft just after takeoff and were ingested by the engines. Cunningham was forced to make an emergency landing. He put the aircraft down at , onto the runway, but it careered through {{the perimeter of the}} airfield and across a public road where it collided with a car carrying four passengers who were killed; no-one died on board the HS-125. Cunningham suffered two crushed vertebra but he remained chief test pilot at Hawker Siddeley after the accident until 1978 when British Aerospace was formed. He was awarded the Segrave Trophy for his services in 1978. In recognition of his wartime exploits and his contribution to civil aviation, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and retired from British aerospace in 1980.|$|E
5|$|HMS Mars {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Laird Brothers {{shipyard}} in Birkenhead on 2 June 1894. She was launched on 30 March 1896. She commissioned on 8 June 1897 for service with the Channel Fleet, where she served in the Portsmouth division. She {{was present at the}} Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria on 26 June 1897. Captain Henry John May was appointed in command on 5 January 1899, and succeeded by Captain Henry Deacon Barry who was appointed in command in September 1900. She suffered a <b>serious</b> <b>accident</b> in April 1902 when one of her forward 12-inch (305-mm) guns was fired before the breech was closed, killing two officers and nine enlisted men, injuring seven, and wrecking the forward main battery turret. She took part in the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902. On 16 August 1904, Mars began a refit at Portsmouth. During her refit, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet in a reorganization on 1 January 1905, and she remained in the renamed unit. Her refit was completed in March 1905. Her Atlantic Fleet service ended on 31 March 1906, when she commissioned into the Reserve at Portsmouth.|$|E
