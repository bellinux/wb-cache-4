25|$|In {{response}} to extensive police appeals, two eyewitnesses came forward on 6 January {{to say they}} had seen the girl at a bus station {{in the company of}} a middle-aged man. One of these individuals was able to identify this man as a former lodger of the Tinsleys. A neighbor of the Tinsley family also informed the police that she had seen this former lodger of the theirs standing alone, loitering on a street corner close to Mona's school, <b>staring</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the entrance to the premises on the afternoon of her abduction. Later that day, a bus conductor named Charles Reville confirmed to police that the previous day, a young girl matching Mona's description had indeed boarded his 4:45 p.m. bus from Newark to Retford {{in the company of a}} middle-aged man, and the pair had alighted his bus at Grove Street, Retford. Reville ominously added that this man had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Reville's claims were independently substantiated by a passenger on the bus named Stanley Betts, who also claimed to have seen a middle-aged man travelling between Newark and Retford with a girl matching Mona's description.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Johansson practiced acting by <b>staring</b> <b>in</b> {{the mirror}} until {{she made herself}} cry, wanting to be Judy Garland in Meet Me in St. Louis. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her {{brothers}} instead of her, but she later decided to become an actress anyway. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and began auditioning for commercials, but soon lost interest: [...] "I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread." [...] She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance in the Off Broadway play Sophistry with Ethan Hawke, {{in which she had}} only two lines. Around this time, she began studying at Professional Children's School (PCS), a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan. At age nine, Johansson made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). She remembers being on the set of the film, knowing instinctively what to do. Johansson later played minor roles including as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's characters in the mystery thriller Just Cause (1995), and an art student in If Lucy Fell (1996).|$|E
2500|$|The Mermaid of Zennor (1900, watercolour), {{also known}} as The Mermaid Discovered, {{features}} a man wearing renaissance garb, standing on a flight of stone stairs leading down to the water, and <b>staring</b> <b>in</b> astonishment at the young woman draped across the stones at the base. [...] Her hair is red, and she is unclad from the waist up; {{from the waist down}} she has pink fins. [...] The picture alludes to the legend of the Mermaid of Zennor who lives at Pendour Cove, near the Cornish village of Zennor.|$|E

2500|$|I'm New Here is a {{departure}} from the rhythmic, jazz-funk and soul style of Scott-Heron's previous work, and embraces an acoustic and electronic minimal sound. Musically, I'm New Here incorporates blues, folk, trip hop, and electronica styles. Music writer Patrick Taylor notes of the album's style, [...] "It's the ragged, warts-and-all approach of the blues versus the more refined jazz soul style he favored in the seventies". It also contains some musical elements of dubstep, electro, and ambient music. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "post-modern" [...] blues album, while Rolling Stone magazine's Will Hermes described it as [...] "a steely blues record at heart â€” the sound of a damaged man <b>staring</b> <b>in</b> the mirror without self-pity but not without hope". City Pages critic Rick Mason deemed the music [...] "hard-edged post-industrial blues".|$|E
