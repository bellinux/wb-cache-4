5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 {{light years away}} from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It spent much of its life as a blue-white (B-type) main sequence star before expanding, cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 {{times that of the}} Sun, with a <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 157 ± 2 light years away, with a magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with a <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of 4677 K. Gamma Apodis is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years away, with a magnitude of 3.87. It is approximately 63 times as luminous the Sun, with a <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of 5279 K. Delta Apodis is a double star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars. Delta1 is a red giant star of spectral type M4III located 760 ± 30 light years away. It is a semiregular variable that varies from magnitude +4.66 to +4.87, with pulsations of multiple periods of 68.0, 94.9 and 101.7 days. Delta2 is an orange giant star of spectral type K3III, located 610 ± 30 light years away, with a magnitude of 5.3. The separate components can be resolved with the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, {{an increase in}} the sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content.

5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Ocean Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea surface temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature)</b> and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature).</b> On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean. Studies {{have shown that the}} Indian Ocean Dipole is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections.|$|E

The average luminance of the Sun is about 1.88gigacandela per square metre, but as viewed through Earth's atmosphere, this is lowered to about 1.44Gcd/m2.

5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well.

5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

40|$|Mid-tropospheric flow {{has a major}} {{influence}} on <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> through the differential advection of air masses into different mid-latitude regions. Because of the importance of mid-tropospheric flow on temperatures, long-range temperature forecasts are largely dependent upon forecasts of mid-tropospheric flow. Monthly variations in the strength of the relationship between mid-tropospheric flow and <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> can have a {{major influence}} on the accuracy of long range temperature forecasts during different months of the year. ^ In this study, the monthly variations in the association between mid-tropospheric flow and mid-latitude <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> are examined by correlating multiple indices of mean monthly 500 -mb flow with mean monthly <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> across the coterminous United States for the period from 1951 to 1980. Specifically, mean monthly 500 -mb pressure height differences across 39 transects are used as indices of the strength and type of mid-tropospheric flow across North America and the eastern north Pacific. Twenty-two north-south transects are used to provide measures of the strength of zonal flow across different areas. Seventeen east-west transects are used to provide information on the strength and direction of meridional flow across different locales. ^ Difference of means tests were used {{to examine the relationship between}} mid-tropospheric flow and <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> during the extreme warmest versus the extreme coldest months for each month of the year. Correlation coefficients were computed to show the monthly variations in the strength and direction of the relationship between mid-tropospheric flow and <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Results indicate that mid-tropospheric flow is most strongly associated with <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> during the transition seasons of spring and autumn and during the month of January. The associations are found to be weakest during the summer and during February. However, overall, although there are major changes in the key areas of flow from one season to the next, the overall strength of the association between the mid-tropospheric circulation and <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> is fairly similar throughout the year. ...|$|R
