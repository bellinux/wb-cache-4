5|$|When the Ionians and Persians {{arrived at}} Naxos, they were faced by a well-fortified and {{supplied}} city. Herodotus does not explicitly <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> this was presumably the eponymous capital of Naxos. He provides few {{details of the}} military actions that ensued, {{although there is a}} suggestion that there was an initial assault on the city, which was repelled. The Ionians and Persians thus settled down to besiege the city. However, after four months, the Persians had run out of money, with Aristagoras also spending a great deal. Thoroughly demoralised, the expedition prepared to return to Asia Minor empty handed. Before leaving, they built a stronghold for the exiled Naxian aristocrats on the island. This was a typical strategy in the Greek world for those exiled by internal strife, giving them a base from which to quickly return, as events permitted.|$|E
5|$|Like so much else, {{this is hard}} to <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E
25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} no designs made for this {{elevation}} (Bedford Avenue), but the aim has been to have a central tower on the same axis as that on Flatbush Avenue, through the archway {{in the base of}} which will be afforded a view of the ‘quad’ with its greensward, trees, shrubs and vines. What the ultimate design of the various buildings going to make up the group may be, it is, of course, impossible to <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> in designing and planning that portion which you now see approaching completion, I have always intended that the whole should be a graphic illustration of the various phases of the so-called Gothic movement, from the Round Arch to the Flamboyant and on through its later transitional stage.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she had always known what she wanted to <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E

Matthías Matthíasson, Director of Samtökin '78, Iceland's gay and lesbian rights group, has commented: [...] "He says things I could never <b>say.</b> <b>But</b> he is an exquisite addition to the gay voice in Iceland." [...] As a gay activist, Paul Oscar helped to organize a Gay Pride Festival in Reykjavík in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Airing after World Wrestling Entertainment's {{flagship}} show WWE Raw, The Ultimate Fighter's debut {{episode was}} able to garner a 57% retention rate in viewers from RAW, which was double the usual rate for Spike TV. It is believed by some that WWE's Vince McMahon had to approve The Ultimate Fighter following RAW, but this is incorrect. According to Hecht, McMahon {{did not have the}} final <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> given his stature and RAW's importance to Spike TV at the time, the network wanted McMahon to [...] "be on board" [...] with the program lineup. At the time Hecht believes the WWE did not see the UFC as a challenge.|$|E

On June 27, 2011, [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was the twelfth song to be made available. In the accompanying quote, Beyoncé said: [...] "I try to write songs that will {{bring out the best}} in all of us and keep us close together.

They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.' It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention.

500|$|Series lead Noah Wyle {{received}} several phone calls {{after the first}} season finale aired. The number one question was [...] "What the hell were you doing getting on that spaceship?" [...] He said that they [...] "wrote themselves into a corner". Moon Bloodgood, who plays Dr. Anne Glass, says she was sort of daunted but impressed by the writing. Aubuchon added that Tom Mason's capture helped the writer's change the character slightly. He stated: [...] "Tom comes away from that experience feeling used and manipulated. It wasn't the experience [...] He {{thought he was going}} to be having a nice conversation with an extraterrestrial being. It turned out to be worse than that. More than that, I won't <b>say.</b> <b>But</b> that's what made it fun." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} style also rates highly; {{writing in}} The Guardian, Mark Lawson called the pilot [...] "glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work". Wry reference {{is made to}} Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed [...] "is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC". Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it [...] "talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had something to <b>say.</b> <b>But</b> it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English". Banks-Smith has also drawn attention to the masculine skew the programme has; [...] "Judge John Deed [...] is catnip to the ladies. These are [...] called Georgie, Charlie, Jo and—when Rita defies abbreviation—Coop".|$|E

500|$|In 1963 on British television, Mona Best, {{with her}} son present, said of his dismissal: [...] "From the point of clash of personalities, well, {{probably}} that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others. [...] I'll leave that for other people to <b>say</b> <b>but</b> {{from my point of}} view we haven't come here to sort of throw sticks and stones at the boys because there is no really hard feeling. There was at first, but it's just the way that it was done that has annoyed us. If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark." [...] Hunter Davies, in his authorised Beatles biography published in 1968, agreed: [...] "There is some justification for a little of Mrs. Best's anger. The sacking of Pete Best is one of the few murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of Super Columbine Massacre {{has been}} {{extremely}} negative amongst the mainstream media and those personally affected by the shootings. Upon revealing Columbine's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said [...] "One of the girls who died [...] {{was a friend of}} mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> I appreciate the fact at least to some degree that something like this was made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E

What sort of statement {{they were trying to}} make I don't know. If it was {{anything to do with the}} relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." [...] Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. [...] "The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid anything the Turner people do," [...] he told NME. [...] "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to <b>say,</b> <b>but</b> how many people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread's trying to say with her art?" ...|$|E
