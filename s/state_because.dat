5|$|As Ezri Tigan was {{the only}} unjoined Trill {{available}} on board, she agreed to be joined to the symbiont {{even though she was}} unprepared and did not previously seek to be joined to one. Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new <b>state.</b> <b>Because</b> of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former <b>state</b> <b>because</b> it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
5|$|Political {{parties had}} {{developed}} in the United States before Kentucky became a <b>state.</b> <b>Because</b> most early Kentuckians were Virginians, they naturally allied with the Democratic-Republicans, the party of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison; the latter was a cousin of George Madison, the state's sixth governor. Political victories were {{few and far between}} for Federalists in Kentucky, and none of Kentucky's governors were members of the Federalist Party. Military service was the most important consideration for voters in Kentucky's early gubernatorial elections. John Breathitt, elected Kentucky's eleventh governor in 1832, was the first Kentucky governor not to have served in the military.|$|E

5|$|The {{most stable}} {{oxidation}} state for manganese is +2, {{which has a}} pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as manganese(II) sulfate (MnSO4) and manganese(II) chloride (MnCl2). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite (manganese(II) carbonate). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground <b>state</b> <b>because</b> of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). However, {{there are a few}} examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II). There are no spin-allowed d–d transitions in manganese(II), explaining why manganese(II) compounds are typically pale to colorless.|$|E
5|$|This {{alliance}} {{was probably}} a weakly centralized state, with a military organization {{similar to the one}} of the Hellenistic Kingdoms. The exact degree of centralization is a matter of debate, with archaeologists, such as archeologist Kris Lockyear, denying the existence of a <b>state,</b> <b>because</b> the archaeological evidence shows regional diversity and only a few region-wide trends. Others, such as historian Alexandru Diaconescu, dispute this and conclude that there was a centralized political structure.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current <b>state</b> <b>because</b> of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred {{over the course of}} billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle {{said it was too}} cowardly for the <b>state</b> <b>because</b> of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the <b>state</b> <b>because</b> it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E
5|$|Emeric's death jeopardized his father's {{achievements}} {{in establishing a}} Christian <b>state,</b> <b>because</b> Stephen's cousin, Vazulwho had the strongest claim to succeed himwas suspected of an inclination towards paganism. According to the Annals of Altaich Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his sister's son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo, as his heir. The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, Levente, Andrew and Béla, were expelled from Hungary. Stephen's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court. According to Kristó, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act. That Vazul's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the Illuminated Chronicle.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass <b>state.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error. It cited several breaches of provincial law regarding {{the operation of}} commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive {{if they have been}} working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log book keeping, and the lack of a contingency plan in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision <b>state</b> <b>because</b> of worn tires and brakes.|$|E
5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided to rescind their promise to nominate him as Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>because</b> {{they want him to}} remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s education reform agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if he will continue to be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his statement to the contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which he shares with his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, the Clean Water Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E

5|$|The {{recording}} finished as the forty-fourth {{album of}} the Billboard 200 of 1995 and finished at number 123 on the Billboard 200 albums of 1996. Two years after Selena's murder, Dreaming of You and Siempre Selena (1996) occupied {{the third and fourth}} slots respectively on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Dreaming of You sold 420,500 copies between 1997 and 1999, and sold 190,000 units in 1997 alone. The biopic Selena (1997) contributed to a 65% increase of sales for Dreaming of You for that year. Dreaming of You sold half a million copies in Texas. Some Texas retailers criticized sale figures for the <b>state</b> <b>because</b> the album had sold poorly at their music stores. By December 1995, Dreaming of You had sold two million copies in the U.S. and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of two million copies. Within ten months of its release, the album was nearing triple-platinum status; it was eventually certified 35×platinum (Latin field) by the RIAA, denoting shipment of 3.5 million units. It remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S. with five million copies sold worldwide as of January 2015. A percentage of the proceeds from the album's sales was donated to the Selena Scholarship Fund.|$|E
