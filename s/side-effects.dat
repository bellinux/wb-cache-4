However, challenges exist in effectively communicating this information to consumers. This study aimed to explore broad consumer profiles relevant to ramipril and clopidogrel <b>side-effect</b> risk information interpretation. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted (n= 18 consumers) exploring consumer perspectives, understanding and treatment decision making in response to ramipril and clopidogrel written medicine information leaflets containing side effects and <b>side-effect</b> risk information. All discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed to explore consumer profiles pertaining to <b>side-effect</b> risk appraisal.

5|$|The {{most common}} <b>side-effects</b> of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and {{decreased}} alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares.

5|$|Treatment in {{the first}} stage aims for an optimal trade off between symptom control and {{treatment}} <b>side-effects.</b> The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use. However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients whose quality of life is impaired by those symptoms. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not really provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.|$|E
5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer <b>side-effects.</b>|$|E

SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative <b>side-effects</b> in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning.

5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or <b>side-effects</b> of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

One aspect of TM that remains unclear is how <b>side-effecting</b> operations – that is, those which cannot be transparently undone by a TM system – should be handled. This uncertainty poses a significant barrier to the general applicability and acceptance of TM. Further, the absence of transactional workloads {{makes it difficult to}} study this aspect In this paper, we characterize the usage of I/O, and in particular system calls, within critical sections in two large applications, exploring both the actions performed and the characteristics of the critical sections in which they are performed. Shared memory programs employing critical sections are the closest approximation available to transactional workloads, so using this characterization, we attempt to reason about how the behavior we observed relates to the previous proposals for handling <b>side-effecting</b> operations within transactions. We find that the large majority of syscalls performed within critical sections can be handled with a range of existing techniques in a way transparent to the application developer. We also find that while <b>side-effecting</b> critical sections are rare, they tend to be quite long-lasting, and that many of these critical sections perform their first syscall (and thus become <b>side-effecting)</b> relatively early in their execution. Finally, we show that while these long-lived, <b>side-effecting</b> critical sections tend to execute concurrently with many critical sections on other threads, we observe little concurrency between <b>side-effecting</b> critical sections. ...|$|R
