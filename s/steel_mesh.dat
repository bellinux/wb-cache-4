As part of this reconstruction, the segment between Haggerty Road and Ozga Road was widened from four to six lanes, and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with I-275, a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time. The Willow Run segment was also resurfaced at this point, as the old road bed did not contain <b>steel</b> <b>mesh.</b> Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive.|$|E

Certain 70 -mesh stainless <b>steel</b> wire <b>meshes</b> {{were placed}} under the cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of}} the experimental platform primary box. Coal granules cannot cross the <b>steel</b> wire <b>meshes,</b> so the cribriform ventilation device under the <b>steel</b> wire <b>meshes</b> would not be blocked by coal granules. With the <b>steel</b> wire <b>meshes</b> in place, a layer of stones (10  cm thick; 20, 10 and 5  mm diameter) was laid to enable even gas to charge. After the stone paving had been laid, several 70 -mesh <b>steel</b> wire <b>meshes</b> were placed on the stone layer. The stable stone pad forms the structure of the gas-charging base. The prepared coal is placed into a primary box and tamped. Pressure, stress and temperature sensors were placed in the coal sample at different layers and locations. The top shell was set in place and sealed. Leak detection was conducted to ensure that the experimental box was airtight.|$|R
40|$|Nanomaterials (CNMs) have {{extraordinary}} mechanical, thermal, {{and electrical}} properties, which provide {{a wide range}} of potential applications. However, the high cost to produce CNMs limits their usage. This work aims to decrease the cost of these materials by reducing the expenses associated with raw materials (using low-cost wastes) and with catalyst (using stainless <b>steel</b> <b>meshes).</b> Samples of sugarcane bagasse, corn residue (DDGS), scrap tires, and post-consumer PET bottles were burned in a controlled atmosphere. The effluent gases were subjected to AISI 304 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>meshes,</b> which worked as catalysts. The stainless steel decomposed the gaseous hydrocarbons into Csolid and H 2, resulting in a precipitation of carbon on the metal surface and leading to the formation of CNMs. The catalyst system decreases the gaseous emissions from the solid wastes burned, as showed by the gas chromatography. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis were used to check structures of the formed materials. Results showed the formation of carbon nanomaterials with lengths of 20 μm to 50 μm and diameters in the range of 20 nm to 200 nm. Value-added products, including carbon nanotubes, were successfully synthesized using solid wastes as carbon donors and AISI 304 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>meshes</b> as catalysts...|$|R

The balloon is removed and the stent remains in place, supporting the inner artery walls in the more open, dilated position. Current stents generally cost around $1,000 to 3,000 each (US 2004 dollars), the drug coated ones being the more expensive.|$|E

On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the tunnel lining and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with {{high pressure water}} jets, damage to the reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead line equipment on 28 January. After test running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009.|$|E

40|$|Parametric {{studies were}} {{performed}} on a lithium-based electrolytic reduction process at bench-scale to investigate the behavior of oxygen ions in the reduction of uranium oxide for various electrochemical cell configurations. Specifically, a series of eight electrolytic reduction runs was performed in a common salt bath of LiCl – 1 wt% Li 2 O. The variable parameters included fuel basket containment material (i. e., stainless <b>steel</b> wire <b>mesh</b> and sintered stainless steel) and applied electrical charge (i. e., 75 – 150 % of the theoretical charge for complete reduction of uranium oxide in a basket to uranium metal). Samples of the molten salt electrolyte were taken at regular intervals throughout each run and analyzed to produce a time plot of Li 2 O concentrations in the bulk salt {{over the course of}} the runs. Following each run, the fuel basket was sectioned and the fuel was removed. Samples of the fuel were analyzed for the extent of uranium oxide reduction to metal and for the concentration of salt constituents, i. e., LiCl and Li 2 O. Extents of uranium oxide reduction ranged from 43 – 70 % in stainless <b>steel</b> wire <b>mesh</b> baskets and 8 – 33 % in sintered stainless steel baskets. The concentrations of Li 2 O in the salt phase of the fuel product from the stainless <b>steel</b> wire <b>mesh</b> baskets ranged from 6. 2 – 9. 2 wt%, while those for the sintered stainless steel baskets ranged from 26 – 46 wt%.
