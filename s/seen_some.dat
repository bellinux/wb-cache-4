The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E

5|$|Europa Barbarorum has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> {{significant}} changes to its campaign {{over the course}} of its development. The Yuezhi faction, included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped. Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of the Seleukid faction, if that collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E
5|$|The Bacon Academy, nicknamed Old Bacon Academy, was the {{original}} Bacon Academy until 1993. The Old Bacon Academy was built in 1803 and is located at 84Main Street, Colchester, Connecticut. The main structure is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. Noted for its plain, utilitarian floor plan consisting of two rooms off a central hall and stairway, the inside has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> renovations throughout its history. The Day Hall, a contributing property purchased by the Bacon Academy trustees in 1929, is a church hall that {{was used for the}} high school until 1962.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> {{success in}} uniting {{disparate}} groups under single individuals called paramount chiefs (Oberhäuptlinge).

This was technically only a temporary appointment; his subjects would have to approve it a year later to make it permanent. They had little alternative; Atangana was already the primary conduit of information {{to and from the}} Germans.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech- The Georgia Tech – Virginia Tech (V.P.I. – Virginia Polytechnic Institute) rivalry {{has grown}} {{considerably}} since Virginia Tech entered the ACC. In previous years, the teams played infrequently. The intra-conference game has often seen both teams ranked {{and the outcome}} has played a key part in determining {{the winner of the}} ACC Coastal Division. Since the ACC switched to Division format in 2005, the winner of this game has gone on to win the Coastal Division all but once, with VT winning six times and GT winning four times. Dubbed the Battle of the Techs, the game has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> very close, very intense match-ups.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} royal castles, from the 12th century onwards, formed an {{essential}} network of royal storehouses in the 13th century {{for a wide}} range of goods including food, drink, weapons, armour and raw materials. Castles such as Southampton, Winchester, Bristol and the Tower of London were used to import, store and distribute royal wines. The English royal castles also became used as gaols – the Assize of Clarendon in 1166 insisted that royal sheriffs establish their own gaols and, in the coming years, county gaols were placed in all the shrieval royal castles. Conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common; Northampton Castle appears to have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> of the worst abuses.|$|E

5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> of the very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important {{he thought it would}} be for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E
5|$|In April 1993, Sega {{announced}} the Sega Channel service, which would utilize cable television services to deliver content. National {{testing in the}} United States for the service began in June, and deployment across the United States began in December, with a complete U.S. release in 1994. By June 1994, Sega Channel had gained a total of 21 cable companies signed up to carry the service. Fees in the United States for the service varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 monthly fee. During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked {{to capitalize on the}} rental market, which had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's offering of games and demos to help sell more cartridges.|$|E
5|$|NY324 crosses {{its last}} major route, Transit Road (NY78), on an {{overpass}} {{just north of}} the once-thriving Eastern Hills Mall, which had been the premier mall in the Buffalo area until it began losing tenants and customers to the larger Walden Galleria in Cheektowaga. Beyond Transit, the road is still four-lane but primarily residential as it enters the Town of Clarence. After Harris Hill Road, the highway bends to the southeast once again for a final mile into its eastern end at Main Street (NY5). This last section was widened from two lanes to four in the mid-1990s, and has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> development but still remains lightly trafficked most of the day.|$|E

5|$|That year, {{the academy}} fielded its first {{competitive}} football team. Although football had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> popularity at the school, {{there had not}} been an organized effort to establish it. Two different teams were assembled in 1879; only first-classmen (final-year students) were allowed to join the teams. Cabaniss joined the second team as a rusher, the equivalent of a modern-day offensive lineman. He played alongside future admiral Hugh Rodman and eventual Governor of Guam William John Maxwell. The academy's team played one game, a scoreless tie with the nearby Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy's rushers forced the Baltimore A.C. backwards into their own end zone for safeties on three separate occasions, and generally outplayed and overpowered their opponents the entire game.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of this}} portion, {{the road}} is divided, with a tree-lined median strip. Businesses, both local and national, line {{both sides of the}} road and traffic is heavy. It crosses some other major strips such as Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route62 or US62), a major {{contributor}} to traffic on Sheridan due to the proximity of the Boulevard Mall, and Millersport Highway (NY263), which feeds the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. In Amherst it meets the Youngmann Expressway (I-290) where NY240 (Harlem Road), reaches its northern end. Past the Youngmann development abates, green returns to the roadside and the median ends, although the road remains four-lane and high-volume. There is another pocket of development around the Wegmans supermarket north of Williamsville, which has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> rapid growth in the last few years.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E

5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.|$|E
5|$|The Greenbackers saw {{the impact}} of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general {{at the head of}} the ticket, faced more opposition. The party's courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters. As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states. Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates. In the September gubernatorial race in Maine, one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. Plaisted, who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party. The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be <b>seen,</b> <b>some</b> one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E
