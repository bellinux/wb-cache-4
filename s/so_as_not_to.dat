5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. Art historian Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> crowd the central devotional image.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament House {{consists}} of two blocks connected together with bridges, one of which houses the chamber of parliament. The two blocks are separate <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> obscure views of Saint James Cavalier from Republic Street. Each block has three floors.|$|E

60|$|From hence may partly be {{gathered}} {{the nature of}} that subjection which we all owe to one another. God Almighty hath been pleased to put us into an imperfect state, where we have perpetual occasion of each other's assistance.

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max had emerged from the battle essentially undamaged, the Italian shells having been unable to penetrate her armor.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising. Reproduction for corporate use was similarly prohibited and such infractions were classified as offenses against public property. The 2003 Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives prohibits the use of state seals or coats of arms in product branding <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mislead the public into thinking that a commercial product has been endorsed by a government organization.|$|E
5|$|Following Life Is Strange is {{the action}} {{role-playing}} game Vampyr, set for release in Q1/Q2 2018. About 80 staff {{were devoted to}} the development of Vampyr, many of whom worked on Life Is Strange. The studio started developing Life Is Strange 2 in early 2016, after its predecessor had proved financially successful. 2016 saw the origin of a new IP, which Dontnod partnered with publisher Bandai Namco to create. A separate team of senior developers was commissioned, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> impede the work on Life Is Strange 2.|$|E

Norman also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley and initiates a hostile takeover of the latter's corporate empire, in retaliation for raiding the Goblin's arsenal and identity.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Polish Eastern Borderlands were annexed into Soviet Ukraine and the family, {{like many}} other Poles, was resettled to Kraków, where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University. He did not take his final {{examinations}} on purpose, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be obliged to become a military doctor. Earlier, he had started working as an assistant in a hospital and writing stories in his spare time.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} bank, {{where the most}} ancient {{parts of the city}} lie, the Old Bazaar was {{restored}} and its surroundings were rebuilt with low-rise buildings, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> spoil views of the Skopje Fortress. Several institutions, including the university and the Macedonian academy, were also relocated on the north bank in order to reduce borders between the ethnic communities. Indeed, the north bank is mostly inhabited by Muslim Albanians, Turks and Roma, whereas Christian ethnic Macedonians predominantly reside on the south bank.|$|E
5|$|Placement of the implant: The implant screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog.

5|$|The Queen, {{influenced}} by the Munshi, continued to write to Lord Lansdowne {{on the issue of}} Tyler's promotion and the administration of India. She expressed reservations on the introduction of elected councils on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority, and urged that Hindu feasts be re-scheduled <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> conflict with Muslim ones. Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially divisive, but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of Prisons in September 1889.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps.

The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
