The plank on bulkhead technique inserts a series of shaped bulkheads along the keel to form a shaped stage which will be covered with planks to form the hull of the model. Plank on frame designs build the model just as the full size wooden ship is constructed. [...] The keel is laid down in a manner which keeps it straight and true.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of reinforced concrete columns strengthened by addition of a self-compacting concrete overlay at the compressed and at the tensioned face of the member, with and without addition of longitudinal steel bars. Eight columns were submit- ted to loading with an initial eccentricity of 60 mm. These columns had 120 mm x 250 mm of rectangular cross section, 2000 mm in length and four longitudinal reinforcement steel bars with 10 mm in diameter. Reference columns P 1 and P 2 were tested to failure without any type of rehabilitation. Columns P 3 to P 8 were loaded to a predefined load (close to the initial yield point of tension reinforce- ment), then unloaded and strengthened for a subsequent test until failure. Results showed that the method of rehabilitation used was effective, increasing the loading capacity of the <b>strengthened</b> <b>pieces</b> by 2 to 5 times the ultimate load of the reference column...|$|R
60|$|The men set cheerfully to work, {{under his}} directions. In his chest was a hatchet, saw, and chisels. With these, young trees of {{flexible}} wood were cut down and split. A keel was laid, 25 feet in length. Cross pieces, 12 feet long, were pegged to this by trenails--nails formed of tough and hard wood. The cross pieces were then bent upwards, and {{fastened to the}} strips which were to form the gunwale. <b>Strengthening</b> <b>pieces</b> were placed along, at distances of 7 or 8 inches apart, and firmly lashed. When the whole was finished, after three days' labor, {{the framework of a}} boat 25 feet long, 3 feet deep, and 7 feet in beam stood upon the beach. A barrel of oil had been thrown ashore and, with this, the mate intended thoroughly to soak the canvas with which the frame was to be covered. The boat would, he calculated, carry the whole of the men, with an ample store of food and water for the voyage.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} involving cases of {{destruction of buildings}} and other structures. The columns can deteriorate for several reasons such as the evolution and changing habits of the loads. The experimental phase of this work {{was based on a}} test involving nine reinforced concrete columns under combined bending and axial compression, at an initial eccentricity of 60 mm. Two columns were used as reference, one having the original dimensions of the column and the other, monolithic, had been cast along the thickness of the <b>strengthened</b> <b>piece.</b> The remaining columns received a 35 mm thick layer of self-compacting concrete on their compressed face. For the preparation of the interface between the two materials, this surface was scarified and furrowed and connectors were inserted onto the columns' shear reinforcement in various positions and amounts. As connectors, 5 mm diameter steel bars were used (the same as for stirrups), bent {{in the shape of a}} "C" with 25 mm coatings. >As a conclusion, not only the quantity, but mainly, the location of the connectors used in the link between substrate and reinforcement is crucial to increase strength and to change failure mode...|$|R
6000|$|In {{one corner}} that most worthy implement, an Abacus, four feet square, a {{specially}} <b>strengthened</b> <b>piece</b> of ironmongery with rounded corners, awaited the young giants' incipient computations. There were few woolly lambs and such-like idols, but instead Cossar, without explanation, had brought {{one day in}} three four-wheelers {{a great number of}} toys (all just too big for the coming children to swallow) that could be piled up, arranged in rows, rolled about, bitten, made to flap and rattle, smacked together, felt over, pulled out, opened, closed, and mauled and experimented with to an interminable extent. There were many bricks of wood in diverse colours, oblong and cuboid, bricks of polished china, bricks of transparent glass and bricks of india-rubber; there were slabs and slates; there were cones, truncated cones, and cylinders; there were oblate and prolate spheroids, balls of varied substances, solid and hollow, many boxes of diverse size and shape, with hinged lids and screw lids and fitting lids, and one or two to catch and lock; there were bands of elastic and leather, and a number of rough and sturdy little objects of a size together that could stand up steadily and suggest the shape of a man.

5000|$|From reading Rudyard Kipling Hemingway {{absorbed the}} {{practice}} of shortening prose {{as much as it}} could take. Of the concept of omission, Hemingway wrote in [...] "The Art of the Short Story": [...] "You could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood." [...] By making invisible the structure of the story, he believed the author <b>strengthened</b> the <b>piece</b> of fiction and that the [...] "quality of a piece could be judged by the quality of the material the author eliminated." [...] His style added to the aesthetic: using [...] "declarative sentences and direct representations of the visible world" [...] with simple and plain language, Hemingway became [...] "the most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century" [...] according to biographer Meyers.|$|R
40|$|Ideas {{related to}} the newly {{introduced}} allostatic framework have caught on in the scientific community, and not without good reason. This short report highlights what we have gained from the framework by discussing the term "allostasis" in comparison to "homeostasis" and "homeostatic mechanisms," and by outlining key ideas behind the phrase "allostatic load. " In terms of how allostatic theory can be <b>strengthened,</b> this <b>piece</b> delves into {{the need for the}} theory to be clearer about what is meant by load that is "cumulative" and the need to incorporate results from research work on hormesis demonstrating the salutary, not damaging, effects of a moderate amount of stress. Lastly, some space in the rejoinder is devoted to how we can better operationalize the allostatic load construct and how new waves of biomarker-containing surveys are poised to collect yet more physiological information and are now more comprehensively measuring, in what is surely a difficult task, stress over the life course.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of horizontal-branch (HB) stars and in precision CCD photometry make it possible to establish a chronology of the formation of the Galaxy from the fossil record. The Lee et al. HB evolutionary models and the inferred age-metallicity relation of the Galactic globular-cluster system are now <b>strengthened</b> by many <b>pieces</b> of supporting evidence. This provides valuable information regarding the formation chronology of the halo and disk. Moreover, there is strong evidence from RR Lyrae stars that the radial variation in HB morphology observed in the halo continues to {{the very center of the}} Galaxy, which suggests that the formation of the bulge and halo was an inside-out process. These two crucial pieces of information are combined to extend the Searle and Zinn picture of halo formation to include the formation of the bulge and disk. The emerging picture is consistent with the idea that galaxies formed as clusters and mergers of many small gas-rich subsystems, rather than by the rapid collapse of single large protogalactic clouds...|$|R
50|$|The {{game is a}} mix of {{stacking}} and capturing. Each player {{plays with}} 3 types of pieces: 6 tzaars, 9 tzarras, and 15 totts. In the initial phase of the game, the players put the pieces on the board one at a time in any order they choose. After this, the players take turns emptying the board. After the placement phase, every player must make 2 moves: first capturing an opponent's piece, and then either capturing another <b>piece</b> or <b>strengthening</b> their own <b>pieces</b> by stacking them. The only exception to this is the very first move of the game (by the white player), in which case only the first capturing move is made. Strengthening by stacking helps, since one is only allowed to capture pieces with a stone which is of equal height or higher. Whenever a player loses all of one type of piece (tzaars, tzarras, or totts), they lose the game. Also, if a player is unable to capture a piece {{in the first part of}} his/her move, that player also loses.|$|R
5000|$|Abdominal flaps The {{abdominal}} flap {{for breast}} reconstruction is the TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) or its technically distinct variants of microvascular [...] "perforator flaps" [...] like the DIEP/SIEA flaps. In a TRAM procedure, {{a portion of}} the abdomen tissue group, including skin, adipose tissues, minor muscles and connective tissues, is taken from the patient's abdomen and transplanted onto the breast site. Both TRAM and DIEP/SIEA use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus and the pubis. The DIEP flap and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts. These procedures are preferred by some breast cancer patients because they result in an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck), and allow the breast to be reconstructed with one's own tissues instead of a foreign implant. TRAM flap procedures may weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but are tolerated well in most patients. To prevent muscle weakness and incisional hernias, the portion of abdominal wall exposed by reflection of the rectus abdominis muscle may be <b>strengthened</b> by a <b>piece</b> of surgical mesh placed over the defect and sutured in place. Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle, and purport the advantage of less weakening of the abdominal wall, though rectus abdominus muscle function may still be compromised. Other total autologous tissue breast reconstruction donor sites include the buttocks (superior or inferior gluteal artery perforator flaps (SGAP or IGAP)). The purpose of perforator flaps (DIEP, SIEA, SGAP, IGAP) is to provide sufficient skin and fat for an aesthetic reconstruction while minimizing morbidity from harvesting the underlying muscles. DIEP reconstruction generally produces the best outcome for most women. [...] See free flap breast reconstruction for more information.|$|R
5000|$|The {{uppermost}} continuous strake {{along the}} topsides {{is called the}} sheer strake. In old vessels, a rubbing strake was built in just below a carvel sheer strake. It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use. In clinker boats, the rubbing strake {{was applied to the}} outside of the sheer strake. The strakes adjacent to the garboard are referred to accordingly as the first broad and second broad. Each strake thereafter has its own special name such as bottom strakes, lowers, bilge strakes, topside strakes, and uppers. Many current pleasure craft reflect this history by providing the boat with a mechanically attached (and therefore replaceable) rub rail at the location formerly occupied by a rubbing strake, often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner.A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape. It is commonly employed in carvel and iron/steel shipbuilding, but there are very few, possibly only one type of, clinker craft that use them."A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape." [...] This statement represents a mis-understanding of what a [...] "stealer" [...] is tasked with accomplishing as a hull is lined-off. After determining the widths of strakes amidships (there are three categories), a quantity can be determined for all these strakes. This quantity is then divided into the height of the stem to determine the width of the average hood-end. This width must be twice the hood-ends thickness or it {{will not be able to}} carry its fasteners. If the hood-ends are not wide enough, the quantity is dropped by one until the resulting revised width is strong enough to carry its fasteners. Stealer is actually a misspelling of the word steeler, the plankers borrowed this word from their peers in the foundry, where forgers would <b>strengthen</b> a <b>piece</b> of metal by steeling a different metal to the original piece. This was analogous to strengthening the hood-end by making it wider, providing more wood mass around each hood-end. Wider meant fewer hood-ends. A device was needed to compensate for the drop in strakes that actually reached the stem. The device was a strake that was stooped short of the stem by burying its forward butt end into a notch chiseled into a through plank. This strake was called a steeler by the plankers and a drop plank by the liners who originated it by counting strakes during the lining off process.|$|R
