5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt Back to the Future {{had similar}} themes to the films of Frank Capra, {{especially}} It's a Wonderful Life. Ebert commented [...] " [...] Steven Spielberg is emulating the great authentic past of Classical Hollywood cinema, {{who specialized in}} matching the right director (Robert Zemeckis) with the right project." [...] He gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times believed the film had a balanced storyline: [...] "It's a cinematic inventing of humor and whimsical tall tales {{for a long time}} to come." [...] Christopher Null, who first saw the film as a teenager, called it [...] "a quintessential 1980s flick that combines science fiction, action, comedy, and romance all into a perfect little package that kids and adults will both devour." [...] Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader felt Gale and Zemeckis wrote a script that perfectly balanced science fiction, seriousness and humor. Variety praised the performances, arguing Fox and Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. BBC News lauded the intricacies of the [...] "outstandingly executed" [...] script, remarking that [...] "nobody <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> that doesn't become important to the plot later." [...] Back to the Future appeared on Gene Siskel's top ten film list of 1985.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{also criticized}} {{scientific}} types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with religious fundamentalists in their fanaticism. In a 1988 interview, {{when asked about}} his newly published book , Wilson commented: I coined the term irrational rationalism because those people claim to be rationalists, but they're governed by such a heavy body of taboos. They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... I wrote this book because I got tired satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them.

The college-age daughters of {{many of my friends}} voted for Obama because they were completely turned off by Neanderthal comments like the suggestion of 'legitimate rape.'" [...] Brad Bannon of US News and World Report wrote, [...] "The [...] insults may also have an ironic backlash. Ryan, Akin, Mourdock, and Koster are poster boys for the need for more women in Congress, so Republican attacks on women may mean the election of more women." [...] The conservative blog Hot Air linked Akin's remarks to a ten percent shift in US public opinion polls toward supporting legalizing abortion in all circumstances. In a column in Salon, Joan Walsh wrote, [...] "suddenly Americans had to try to imagine how doctors or hospital administrators or law enforcement officials would decide what was 'legitimate rape,' as opposed to something else. Rape panels?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Arthur C. Parker, Secretary of the Society of American Indians from 1911 to 1915, {{regarded}} McKenzie as the [...] "father of the movement." [...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> to me tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and believe that is so, even though doubtful as to what extent that confidence involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you may have to do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that over the years, Yang {{displayed}} a serious, magnanimous, and respectful personality. [...] He displayed no displeasure at Xu and Xu's sons' having the actual reins of the state, and Xu did not suspect him of intent to seize power personally. [...] However, it {{was said that}} after the declaration of the independent Wu state, which he himself did not want to see, he became depressed. [...] He drank often and ate little, and thus became ill. [...] As of summer 920, he was near death. [...] Xu Wen arrived from Run Prefecture to oversee the transition. [...] Some of Xu's followers urged that he take over the throne himself, but Xu himself disavowed such an intent, stating, [...] "If I had the intent to do so, I would have done so when I killed Zhang Hao and would not have waited until today. [...] Even if the Yangs were out of males, I would have supported a female to take the throne. [...] Anyone who <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> else will be decapitated!" [...] However, while Yang Longyan's oldest younger brother was Yang Meng the Duke of Lujiang, Xu had often been suspicious at Yang Meng's intent if he took the throne since Yang Meng was known to have complained about the Xus' hold on power, and therefore decided to skip Yang Meng. [...] Instead, he issued an order in Yang Longyan's name summoning his next younger brother, Yang Pu the Duke of Danyang, to Guangling to formally serve as regent, while moving Yang Meng, who had been made the military prefect of Chu Prefecture (楚州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), to be the military prefect of Shu Prefecture (舒州, in modern Anqing, Anhui). [...] Yang Longyan died shortly after, and Yang Pu took the throne.|$|E

In this demonstration, we will present the latest version of the <b>Say</b> <b>Anything</b> application and allow conference participants to author their own original stories using the system.
