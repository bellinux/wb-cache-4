40|$|The goal of {{this study}} {{concerned}} the localization and comparison of variable number tandem repeat sequences (VNTRs) within the diploid genome of Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern gamagrass), a wild relative of modern maize. Genomic DNA was isolated from harvested plant tissue. The sequences of VNTR minisattelite segments were then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified DNA was visualized by neutral agerose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. This process allowed for photographic recording and identification of polymorphisms within a segregating parental, first, and <b>second</b> <b>filial</b> <b>generations</b> of Tripsacum [...] The data obtained revealed that primer FVIIex 8 is appropriate for detecting novel polymorphisms segregating at the PCR amplification level.

Here we introduce MutMap, a method based on whole-genome resequencing of pooled DNA from a segregating population of plants that show a useful phenotype. In MutMap, a mutant is crossed directly to the original wild-type line and then selfed, allowing unequivocal segregation in <b>second</b> <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> (F 2) progeny of subtle phenotypic differences. This approach is particularly amenable to crop species because it minimizes the number of genetic crosses (n = 1 or 0) and mutant F 2 progeny that are required.

Recent work has shown that a PPI-deficit can be selectively bred in Wistar rats and is already stable in the <b>second</b> <b>filial</b> <b>generation.</b> We here report on developmental and parametric characteristics of sensorimotor gating deficits in the 4 th and 6 th filial generation of male rats selectively bred for low PPI (low PPI) compared to rats with normal levels of PPI (high PPI). Low PPI rats showed significantly reduced PPI and variable startle magnitude (in pulse alone trials) along with reduced short-term habituation of startle as adults. Reduced PPI in the low PPI rats was found throughout development (tested on postnatal days 21, 35, 49, 70). PPI-deficits in the low PPI rats were evident at prepulse intensities ranging from 62 - 86 dB and for interstimulus intervals ranging between 30 - 1000 ms. These behavioral data add to {{a growing body of}} knowledge about the genetic basis of sensorimotor gating deficits and suggest that low PPI rats have potential use as an intermediate phenotype in schizophrenia research. The stable phenotype of breeding-induced PPI-deficits and reduced startle habituation indicates that PPI has strong genetic determinants and that selectively bred rats can be used for future neurophysiological, anatomical, pharmacological, and genomic analyses...|$|E

There is variability in the SAS response to stress, although the extent to which this is genetically regulated is unclear. Some rodent models, including the hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (hHTg) rat, are hyperresponsive to stress. We investigated whether quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect sympathoadrenal response to stress could be identified. <b>Second</b> <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> rats (n = 189) derived from a cross of the hHTg rat and the Brown Norway rat had plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) levels, indices of activation of the sympathoneural and adrenal medulla components, respectively, measured in the resting state and in response to an immobilization stress. Responses were assessed early (20 min) and late (120 min) after the application of the stress. A genome scan was conducted using 153 microsatellite markers. Two QTLs (maximum peak LOD scores of 4. 17 and 3. 52, respectively) influencing both the early and late plasma NE response to stress were found on chromosome 10. Together, the QTLs accounted for approximately 20 % of the total variation in both the early and late NE responses in the F(2) rats. Interestingly, the QTLs had no effect on plasma Epi response to stress. These findings provide evidence for a genetic determination of the response of a specific component of the SAS response to stress.

Therefore, we aimed {{to set up a}} relevant animal model. We investigated whether susceptibility to stress induced visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated (MS) Long Evans rats can be transferred across generations without further separation protocols and, if so, whether this depends on maternal care. At adult age, we evaluated pre- vs post water avoidance (WA) changes in visceromotor response to distension in non-handled <b>second</b> <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> offspring (NH-F 2) of previously separated MS-F 1 dams. Furthermore, the role of maternal care was evaluated by cross-fostering F 2 offspring of NH-F 1 and MS-F 1 dams and subsequent sensitivity measurements at adult age. Involvement of mast cells in post stress hypersensitivity of NH-F 2 rats was evaluated by mast cell stabilization. In adult NH-F 2 offspring of MS-F 1 dams, post-WA hypersensitivity to colorectal distension was observed in 80 % of rats compared with 19 % in offspring of NH-F 1 dams. Cross-fostered pups adapted to the phenotype of the foster mother: pups of NH-F 1 dams nursed by MS-F 1 dams showed post-WA hypersensitivity to distension at adult age and vice versa (100 % and 20 % respectively). In NH-F 2 rats, post-WA hypersensitivity was reversed by mast cell stabilizer doxantrazole.

The {{evaluation of a}} potential transmission of environmentally induced epigenetic modifications has been highlighted as a necessary field of research in ecological risk assessment [68].

Evidence of TEI underpinning neurotoxic effects in multiple generations is very rare. A recent study by Knecht et al. reported transgenerational behavioural effects of benzo[a]pyrene on zebrafish exposed during development (hyper locomotor activity, hyper-avoidance behaviour) [70].

Experimental mouse parotid {{hypertrophy}} {{has been}} associated with the expression of a number of isoproterenol-induced salivary proline-rich polypeptides (IISPs). Mouse salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs) have been mapped both to chromosornes 6 and 8. Recently, mice of two inbred strains (A/Snell and A. Swiss) have been found to differ drastically in the IISPs. In this study, mice of both strains were used for cross-breeding experiments addressed to define the pattern of inheritance of the IISP phenotype and to establish whether the IISPs are coded on a single or on several chromosomes. The IISP phenotype of individual mice was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole saliva collected after three daily stimulations by isoproterenol. Parental A/Snell and A. Swiss mice were homogeneous for distinctive strain-associated IISP-patterns. First filial generation (F 1) mice obtained from the cross of A/Snell with A.

No recombinants were observed among F 2 mice or among mice resulting from backcrosses.

40|$|A {{region with}} a major effect on blood {{pressure}} (BP) is located on rat chromosome 1 {{in the vicinity of}} the Sa gene, a candidate gene for BP regulation. Previously, we observed a single linkage peak for BP in this region in <b>second</b> <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> rats derived from a cross of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) with the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY), and we have reported the isolation of the region containing the BP effect in reciprocal congenic strains (WKY.

SHR-Sa (WISA 1 and WISA 2) and SHR. WKY-Sa (SISA 1 and SISA 2) by backcrossing to WKY and SHR, respectively. Although there was some overlap of the introgressed regions retained in the various substrains, the segments in WISA 1 and SISA 1 did not overlap. Furthermore, although the Sa allele in WISA 1, WISA 2, and SISA 2 remained donor in origin, recombination in SISA 1 reverted it back to the recipient (SHR) allele. Surprisingly, all 4 substrains demonstrated a highly significant BP difference compared with that of their respective parental strain, which was of a magnitude similar to those seen in the original congenic strains. The findings strongly indicate that there are at least 2 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting BP in this region of rat chromosome 1. Furthermore, the BP effect seen in SISA 1 indicates that at least a proportion of the BP effect of this region of rat chromosome 1 cannot be due to the Sa gene. SISA 1 contains an introgressed segment of < 3 cM, and this will facilitate the physical mapping of the BP QTL(s) located within it and the identification of the susceptibility-conferring genes.

This pre-empted the investigation of the effects of inbreeding on another cactophagous moth, Mimorista pulchellalis Dyar, an established biological control agent of jointed cactus in South Africa. Initially three populations were set up. A randomly-mating control (OUT 1) population, and a sibmating experimental (IN 1) population, consisted of laboratory-reared stock. A second experimental population (KR 1) comprised a small number of field-collected randomly-mating individuals which recreated the conditions under which the five abovementioned species were lost. The inbreeding depression of fifteen fitness components was assessed. The mean values of each component in each generation of treatments IN 1 and KR 1 were compared with those of OUT 1. In addition the mean values of IN 1 were regressed against the coefficients of inbreeding since inbreeding depression is linear with respect to the probability of two genes at any locus being homozygous through ancestry. The component egg viability was important because a reduction in OUT 1, IN 1 and KR 1 in the F₂ resulted from mated females producing no viable eggs. Duplicate treatments OUT 2, IN 2 and KR 2 were set up to confirm whether this was a general F₂ phenomenon. Assessment of the fitness components prevented a direct evaluation of the numbers of offspring produced. However a hypothetical estimate of population size and growth rate was made using the percentage survival calculated from life-table analysis. Although not statistically demonstrable in the component analysis, life table analysis indicated that egg viability suffered an inbreeding depression and affected population fitness. It was also evident that treatments OUT 1 and 2 were fitter than treatments IN 1 and 2 and KR 1 and 2 with respect to population fitness. Thus, inbreeding, resulting from sibmating and introduction of a small number of individuals to a laboratorYJ caused a decrease in numbers of offspring produced and population growth rate.

It {{is caused by}} mutations in NPHP genes, which encode for ciliary proteins known as nephrocystins. The disorder affects many people across the world and leads to end-stage renal disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if the genetic background of the nonmutant female Piebald-Virol-Glaxo (PVG/Seac-/-) rat influences phenotypic inheritance of NPHP from mutant male Lewis polycystic kidney rats. Methods: Mating experiments were performed between mutant Lewis polycystic kidney male rats with CKD and nonmutant PVG and Wistar Kyoto female rats without cystic kidney disease to raise second filial and backcross 1 progeny, respectively. Rats that developed cystic kidneys were identified. Systolic blood pressure was determined in each rat at 12 weeks of age using the tail and cuff method. After euthanasia, blood samples were collected and chemistry was determined. Histological examination of the kidneys, pancreas, and liver of rats with and without cystic kidney disease was performed. Results: It was established that the genetic background of nonmutant female PVG rats did not influence the phenotypic inheritance of the CKD from mutant male Lewis polycystic kidney rats. The disease arose as a result of a recessive mutation in a single gene (<b>second</b> <b>filial</b> <b>generation,</b> CKD = 13, non-CKD = 39, &Chi; 2 = 0. 00, P &ge; 0. 97; backcross 1 generation, CKD = 67, non-CKD = 72, &Chi; 2 = 0. 18, P &gt; 0. 05) and inherited as NPHP. The rats with CKD developed larger fluid-filled cystic kidneys, higher systolic blood pressure, and anemia, but there were no extrarenal cysts and disease did not lead to early pup mortality. Conclusion: The genetic background of the nonmutant PVG rats does not influence the genetic and phenotypic inheritance of CKD from mutant Lewis polycystic kidney rats. A single recessive mutation incapacitated the gene, which relaxed its functional constraints, and led to formation of multiple cysts in the kidneys of the homozygous mutant rats.

40|$|Linkage {{analyses}} {{in experimental}} crosses of hypertensive and normotensive rats have strongly suggested {{the presence of}} a quantitative trait locus (QTL) influencing blood pressure on rat chromosome 1, at or near the Sa gene. To confirm the presence of such a locus and move toward identification of the causative gene, we have developed, through targeted breeding over 10 generations using an Sa gene polymorphism to select breeders at each generation, 2 congenic strains, 1 containing a segment of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) chromosome 1 in a Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) genetic background (WKY. SHR-Sa), and the other a segment of WKY chromosome 1 in an SHR background (SHR. WKY-Sa). WKY. SHR-Sa contains at least approximately 26 cM of SHR chromosome 1, between markers mD 7 mit 206 and D 1 Mit 2 (and including the SHR allele of the Sa gene), and SHR. WKY-Sa carries at least approximately 15 cM of WKY chromosome 1, between mD 7 mit 206 and D 1 Wox 34 (and including the WKY allele of the Sa gene). Blood pressure of WKY. SHR-Sa rats measured at 16, 20, and 25 weeks of age was significantly higher than that of WKY, whereas blood pressure of SHR. WKY-Sa rats was significantly lower than that of SHR. At 25 weeks, the mean differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between WKY. SHR-Sa and WKY were + 11. 5 mm Hg (P= 0. 001) and + 11. 6 mm Hg mm Hg (P< 0. 001), respectively. The corresponding differences between SHR. WKy-Sa and SHR were - 11. 3 mm Hg (P= 0. 002) and - 9. 1 mm Hg (P= 0. 005), respectively. The differences represent about one fifth of the blood pressure difference between SHR and WKY. Renal Sa mRNA levels in the congenic strains reflected their Sa allele with a high level in WKY. SHR-Sa and a low level in SHR. WKY-Sa, consistent with previous data suggesting that the level of Sa expression is primarily determined by cis-acting elements in or near the Sa gene. Our results show that we have successfully isolated a major rat chromosome 1 blood pressure QTL located {{in the vicinity of the}} Sa gene in reciprocal congenic strains derived from SHR and WKY. The strains can now be used to further define the region containing the QTL and also to characterize intermediary mechanisms through which the QTL influences blood pressure.

RAPD-PCR and MLEE analyses were processed for parental bacteria and last filial genera-tion one. Results: No difference associated with caries activity of the subjects from whom the isolates origi-nated. Virulent properties of a <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> strains was not different in the same generation, but was very different from their parent strains. Conclu-sion: The coexist properties of virulent polyclonal strain of MS may hold in a very general conditional sense in a dental plaque ecosystem in vivo, however, one of the co-culture strains may became dominant and displa- ced the others as the result of continuous ecological succession in vitro...|$|R
50|$|The {{offspring}} of distinctly different parental types produce a new, uniform phenotype {{with a combination}} of characteristics from the parents. In fish breeding, those parents frequently are two closely related fish species, while in plant and animal breeding the parents often are two inbred lines. Mules are F1 hybrids between horse and donkey. Today, certain domestic - wild hybrid breeds, such as the Savannah cat, are classified by their <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> number.|$|R
30|$|Immature {{stages of}} {{mosquito}} {{were collected from}} a drainage canal in Qualyobia Governorate, Egypt. Fourth instar larvae and emerging adults were identified according to Harbach (2012). Species other than Cx. pipiens were discarded. Cx. pipiens larvae were reared in the laboratory under controlled conditions of temperature (27 [*]±[*] 2  °C) and relative humidity (70 – 80 %) and a 12  L: 12 D photoperiod. Third instar larvae of the <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> {{were used in the}} study.|$|R
40|$|Until now, {{there has}} been no record of Liotrophon punctulatus (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) {{presence}} in the anthropogenic environment of mills, bakeries or pasta factories. This is the first report of the species parasitizing Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larvae. The host/parasitoid interaction was validated under laboratory conditions where fourth or fifth instar larvae of Ephestia kuehniella were provided ad libitum to L. punctulatus females. After two <b>filial</b> <b>generations</b> emergence, the validation process was considered to confirm the interaction...|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{the short}} characteristic—which {{disappeared}} from {{sight in the}} first filial generation—resurfaced in the second, suggesting that two factors (genes) determined plant height.  In other words, although the factor which caused short stature ceased to exert its influence in the first <b>filial</b> <b>generation,</b> it was still present.  Note also that the ratio between tall and short plants was 787/277, or 2.84 to 1 (approximately 3 to 1), again suggesting that plant height is determined by two factors.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{necrosis}} in wheat {{was shown}} {{to be based on}} two complementary genes Ne 1 and Ne 2. Variation in degree of necrosis proved to depend on multiple alleles. The existence of weak, moderate and strong alleles of Ne 1 and Ne 2 could be demonstrated. The degree of necrosis {{was shown to}} depend also on environment. Normally lethal plants could even produce seed under artificial environmental conditions. The author studied the sources of the necrosis genes and their distribution. The genotypes of wheat available were determined by test crosses while their origin was found where possible. The frequent use of certain carrier varieties as parents had contributed to the spread of necrotic genes. All wheat varieties, selections and species studied (about 500) were classified into 3 genotype classes (Ne 1 -carriers, Ne 2 -carriers, non-carriers) with indication of the strength of the necrosis gene. In designing a wheat-crossing programme a breeder could thus ascertain whether the first <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> would become necrotic and usually also the allelic combination of the first <b>filial</b> <b>generation.</b> The occurrence of carrier and non-carrier lines in several varieties was shown to provide sometimes the possibility of avoiding necrosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} spinach breeding, {{including}} the author's {{work at the}} Institute of Horticultural Plant Breeding, Wageningen, was reviewed. Certain crossing combinations had a favourable effect on the yield. The possibility of combining resistance to Peronospora spinaciae (Mont.) de Bary and mosaic (Cucumus-virus 1) made the breeding of hybrid varieties still more attractive. The work required {{for the removal of}} all male and intersexual plants from the mother variety was a serious handicap. Experiments on influencing the sex ratio and the recognition of pollen-bearing plants some time before they flower in the mother variety gave no cause for optimism. However, it was possible to breed a practically completely female first <b>filial</b> <b>generation.</b> The combination of this first <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> as a round seeded mother variety with a prickly seeded father could bring the possibility of growing hybrid seed on a commercial scale very much nearer. Research in the field of hybrid varieties was considered to be a most important task of the research institutes. A simple method was worked out for testing young spinach plants for resistance to downy mildew, using sheets of polythene. <p/...|$|R
40|$|In this {{preliminary}} report there are presented {{some of the}} results obtained from crossing mice from tumor strains with males from other sources. The comparison of the tumor incidence in the inbred and backcross daughters, though the numbers given are small, supports {{the theory that the}} tendency to develop neoplasms is hereditary and the frequency with which tumors appear in the first <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> of such crosses, indicates that the character is dominant. Additional experiments involving larger numbers are in progress...|$|R
