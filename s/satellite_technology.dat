5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in <b>satellite</b> <b>technology</b> and operations into Kongsberg Satellite Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg Satellite Services is a continuation of the operating company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll Satellite Station in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Kitsat-3 was a South Korean {{remote sensing}} {{minisatellite}} which carried MEIS (Multispectral Earth Imaging System) and SENSE (Space ENvironment Scientific Experiment) instruments to Low Earth orbit.

Manufactured by KAIST <b>Satellite</b> <b>Technology</b> Research Center (SaTReC), Kitsat-3 was developed with experience from Kitsat-1 and Kitsat-2 (no heritage to the Kitsat-1 and Kitsat-2 bus) {{and was the}} first independently designed South Korean satellite.|$|E
25|$|The National Broadband Network was {{initially}} a fibre {{to the home}} (FTTH) open-access network in planning and trial operation in Australia by the federal government. The national broadband network aimed to provide up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds and to connect to 93% of Australian households and businesses. This has since been revised under a Coalition government to a Mixed-Technology system relying largely on Australia's existing and largely depreciated Copper networks. This revision aims for 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, with consumer reports ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. The Australian government had previously called for proposals to build a Fibre to the Node (FTTN) broadband network providing download speeds up to 100 and upload speeds up to 40Megabits per second. The government also utlilises fixed wireless technology and <b>satellite</b> <b>technology</b> to provide fast broadband connection in rural area and very remote area. Fixed wireless provides speeds up to 50/20 Mbit/s. <b>Satellite</b> <b>technology</b> uses sky muster communication satellite which was launched in October 2015 to provide fast broadband in very remote area. It provides speeds up to 25/5 Mbit/s. The network will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia's history. In February 2017, the Federal Government of Australia funded the project for the NBN in order to build a mixed technology network.|$|E
25|$|Most commonly, the {{location}} is determined using GPS and the transmission mechanism is SMS, GPRS, or a satellite or terrestrial radio from {{the vehicle to}} a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. GSM and EVDO {{are the most common}} services applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low bandwidth requirements also allow for <b>satellite</b> <b>technology</b> to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and into very remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.|$|E

40|$|Three new <b>satellite</b> <b>technologies,</b> i. e., {{electronically}} hopped antenna beams, on-board switching, {{and laser}} intersatellite links, {{will soon be}} tested on experimental <b>satellites.</b> These <b>technologies</b> will enable future satellites to capture significant amounts of data and voice traffic. Fiber cables on the continents will dominate trunking routes, but satellites functioning as switches will be more flexible and reliable, and will cost less than terrestrial-based switches. When satellite switches and laser intersatellite links are combined, the resulting satellite networks will provide cost-effective, independent voice/data networks in the coming global village. They will augment existing terrestrial networks for thin route and low data rate links...|$|R
