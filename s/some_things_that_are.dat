[...] Edmondson attested that Abra {{returned}} in [...] "a fragile state" [...] following a traumatic {{incident in the}} Congo, and had become [...] "genuinely horrible". He said of the transformation: [...] "He's not as humorous {{as he used to}} be. I used to like that, that sardonic wit that he used to have and it's kind of gone out of the window. But you can be quite funny when you're feeling everything's pointless. He does <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> so cruel and cold that they're actually quite funny." [...] While the character had once been known for his brash taste in bright, flamboyant shirts, The Sun noted that Abra's return saw him a [...] "shadow of his former self", wearing far less colourful apparel as a reflection of his more subdued state of mind. [...] Edmondson agreed that Abra's new wardrobe of shirts [...] "aren't quite as bright and dazzling - but that suits his current mood." ...|$|E

[...] He was ruled out of action for two to three weeks following Liverpool's 1–0 victory over Marseille in the Champions League in November, where he picked up a hamstring strain, which was later extended to at least four weeks by specialists. He was named on the shortlist for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in December, and eventually came in third place behind Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Torres returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a substitute with a goal in the 2–0 win over Preston North End, his first in the FA Cup. He scored two late goals for Liverpool to secure a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on 1 February 2009. Despite having spent {{a year and a half}} at the club, Torres was chosen as number 50 in The Timess list of [...] "The 50 greatest Liverpool players", reinforcing the impact he had made at Liverpool in such a short period of time.|$|E

60|$|Fourth. As the mercies {{that are}} with the Lord are tender, great, and rich, {{so there is a}} MULTITUDE of them, and they are called 'manifold,' there is a {{multitude}} of these rich and virtuous mercies (Psa 69:13; Rev 9:19). By multitude, I understand mercies of every sort or kind; mercies for this, and mercies for the other malady; mercies for every sickness, a salve for every sore. <b>Some</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> rich and very full of virtue, have yet their excellency extending itself but to one, or two, or three things for help; and this is their leanness in the midst of their excellencies. But it is not thus with the mercy of God. <b>Some</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> rich and virtuous, are yet so only but at certain seasons; for there are times in which they can do nothing. But it is not so with this tender, great, and rich mercy of God. There are some things, though rich, that are sparingly made use of. But it is not so with this mercy of God. There is a multitude of them; so if one will not another will. There is a multitude of them; so one or other of them is always in their season. There is a multitude of them; and therefore it must not be supposed that God is niggardly as to the communicating of them.|$|E
