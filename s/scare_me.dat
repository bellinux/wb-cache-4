500|$|The film's {{production}} {{began in}} early 2011, with director Sam Qualiana having created the film's title, poster, and a teaser trailer before finalizing its script. Qualiana has stated [...] "I always {{have had a}} fear of sharks. Not {{a lot of things}} <b>scare</b> <b>me,</b> but sharks terrify and fascinate me at the same time". Qualiana viewed the film as a mixture of the 1975 thriller film Jaws and the 1982 science-fiction horror film The Thing. The film began shooting in Buffalo, New York, partially supported by an Indiegogo campaign launched by Qualiana with a fundraising goal of $3,000. Production was met with minor weather-related difficulties, including overcoming cold temperatures and the task of preventing snow from gathering on the lens of the film camera.|$|E

5000|$|Adelson {{questioned}} the Obama administration {{in an interview}} with Forbes: What <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> is the continuation of the socialist-style economy we've been experiencing for almost four years. That <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> because the redistribution of wealth is the path to more socialism, and to more of the government controlling people's lives. What <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> is the lack of accountability that people would prefer to experience, just let the government take care of everything. U.S. domestic politics {{is very important to me}} because I see that the things that made this country great are now being relegated into duplicating that which is making other countries less great. … I’m afraid of the trend where more and more people have the tendency to want to be given instead of wanting to give. People are less willing to share. There are fewer philanthropists being grown and there are greater expectations of the government. I believe that people will come to their senses and not extend the current Administration's quest to socialize this country. It won’t be a socialist democracy because it won’t be a democracy.|$|R
