5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre <b>syndrome,</b> MELAS <b>syndrome</b> and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre <b>syndrome,</b> Pearson <b>syndrome,</b> and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS <b>syndrome,</b> Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{characteristics}} and variation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) <b>syndromes</b> in acute ischemic stroke patients of Xinjiang Uygur and Han nationalities, and {{to investigate the}} polymorphism of adiponectin (APN) of loci rs 182052, rs 6444175, rs 1501296 and its correlation with TCM <b>syndromes.</b>   Methods A total of 210 patients with acute ischemic stroke (89 cases of Uygur nationality and 121 cases of Han nationality) were collected for information of TCM <b>syndromes</b> according to the "Diagnostic Scale for TCM <b>Syndromes</b> of Ischemic Stroke", and the APN single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of patients was detected by SNaPshot technology. The TCM <b>syndromes</b> between patients of Uygur and Han nationalities were compared and the correlation between TCM <b>syndromes</b> and APN SNP or allele frequency was analyzed.   Results 1) There were different TCM <b>syndromes</b> during acute ischemic stroke between patients of Uygur and Han nationalities. The TCM <b>syndromes</b> in Uygur patients were based on phlegm, while the <b>syndromes</b> in Han patients were based on Qi deficiency. Most of Uygur patients had 2 accumulated TCM <b>syndromes</b> {{in the middle and}} late phase of acute ischemic stroke, which was significantly different from Han patients, who mainly had 3 accumulated TCM <b>syndromes.</b> 2) The genotypes of APN were not correlated with TCM <b>syndromes</b> accumulation in Uygur patients, while the genotypes of APN rs 6444175 G/A and rs 1501296 G/A were correlated with TCM <b>syndromes</b> accumulation in Han patients. The allele frequency of all three APN genotypes were not correlated with TCM <b>syndromes</b> accumulation in both Uygur and Han patients.   Conclusions There are different distributions of TCM <b>syndromes</b> and its accumulation between Uygur and Han patients, and the accumulations of TCM <b>syndromes</b> of acute ischemic stroke in Uygur and Han patients are correlated with different APN genotypes.   doi: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2014. 07. 012 </p...|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch <b>syndrome,</b> an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch <b>syndrome</b> have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch <b>syndrome</b> comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch <b>syndrome</b> include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch <b>syndrome</b> represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch <b>syndrome</b> have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E

As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the <b>syndrome.</b> Although fully penetrant, since the <b>syndrome</b> has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the <b>syndrome,</b> while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{reviews the}} {{historical}} evolution and progress of nosological concepts from exotic psychiatric disorders and culture-bound <b>syndromes</b> to culture-related specific <b>syndromes.</b> Approaches to classifi-cation and subgrouping these disorders are disccused and an argument offered for {{finding a place}} for culturally unique <b>syndromes</b> in the existing classification system. The characteristics of various <b>syndromes</b> are elabor-ated and suggestions are made for future research.

Key words culture-bound <b>syndromes</b> • diagnostic classification • history of psychiatry • nosology Culture-bound <b>syndromes</b> are mental conditions or psychiatric <b>syndromes</b> whose occurrence or manifestation are closely related to cultural factors and which thus warrant understanding and management from a cultural perspective.
