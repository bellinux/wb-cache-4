5|$|Even before that, the Navy {{had been}} losing {{interest}} (problems with supersonic fighters on carrier decks having been overcome) and the crash relegated the Sea Dart program to experimental status. All production aircraft were cancelled, though {{the remaining three}} <b>service</b> <b>test</b> examples were completed. The two final prototypes never flew.|$|E
5|$|Official {{approval}} of the XF-104 design led to a contract for 17 YF-104A <b>service</b> <b>test</b> aircraft and a production run of over 2,500 aircraft built both in the United States and under license worldwide.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this diploma thesis is web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The main {{objective}} {{is to create a}} methodology for web <b>services</b> <b>testing.</b> The next objective (which {{is a part of the}} methodology) is to create a guidance for web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> using SoapUI. The guidance serves as a manual to web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The theoretical part of the thesis explains basic terms: <b>testing,</b> web <b>service</b> and methodology. This part is also devoted to the introduction of the SoapUI and Eclipse Process Framework Composer. The practical part of the thesis is focused on the methodology for web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> itself. The methodology is created in Eclipse Process Framework Composer and each element of the methodology is described here. Some of the methodology elements (the guidance, concepts, tools and some templates) are listed as an appendix...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI tool, {{particularly}} on verification methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The main objective of this thesis is to verify the methodology. Specific goals include introduction to basic concepts and principles related to web services, {{a description of the}} testing process including types of the tests and specifics of <b>testing</b> web <b>services,</b> introduction of methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI, practical verification of the methodology on the real information system and a suggestion of how to adapt the methodology {{on the basis of the}} verification. The theoretical part summarizes basic knowledge of the web services technology and web <b>services</b> <b>testing.</b> Especially it is devoted to description of the methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI and to the introduction of the SoapUI tool. The practical part consists of the introduction of the test system in Česká pojišťovna, a. s. and Generali pojišťovna, a. s., where the methodology is verified. Next the methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI is verified. Based on this verification, there are suggestions of how to adapt or extend the methodology...|$|R

5|$|The {{prototype}} {{was fitted}} with an experimental single ski, which proved {{more successful than}} the twin-ski design of the second <b>service</b> <b>test</b> aircraft. Testing with several other experimental ski configurations continued with the prototype through 1957, after which it was placed into storage.|$|E
5|$|Convair's {{proposal}} {{gained an}} order for two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve production aircraft were ordered before a prototype had even flown. No armament was ever fitted to any Sea Dart built, but {{the plan was to}} arm the production aircraft with four 20mm Colt Mk12 cannon and a battery of folding-fin unguided rockets. Four of this order were redesignated as <b>service</b> <b>test</b> vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1944, Republic {{received}} {{an order for}} three prototypes of the new XP-84—Model AP-23. Since the design promised superior performance to the Lockheed-built P-80 Shooting Star and Republic had extensive experience in building single-seat fighters, no competition was held for the contract. The name Thunderjet was chosen to continue the Republic Aviation tradition started with the P-47 Thunderbolt while emphasizing the new method of propulsion. On 4 January 1945, even before the aircraft took to the air, the USAAF expanded its order to 25 <b>service</b> <b>test</b> YP-84As and 75 production P-84Bs (later modified to 15 YP-84A and 85 P-84B).|$|E

5|$|The second {{prototype}} was canceled, so {{the first}} <b>service</b> <b>test</b> aircraft was built and flown. This was fitted with the J46 engines, which performed below specification. However, speeds in excess of Mach1 were attained in a shallow dive with this aircraft, making it the only supersonic seaplane to date. On 4 November 1954, Sea Dart BuNo 135762 disintegrated in midair over San Diego Bay during a demonstration for naval officials and the press, killing Convair test pilot Charles E. Richbourg when he inadvertently exceeded the airframe's limitations. Richbourg was a 31-year-old Navy veteran of the Second World War. He was quickly pulled from the water but did not survive the airframe breakage. He was buried in St. Augustine National Cemetery in Florida.|$|E
25|$|Testing {{continued}} with the Bomarc B model. Designated the IM-99B, this missile underwent its inaugural <b>service</b> <b>test</b> on 13 April 1960.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} four aircraft were production P-3As, but primarily used to <b>service</b> <b>test</b> the Pratt & Whitney Wasp engine. In {{addition to}} the significant increase in drag, the radial engine also interfered with the pilot's view. Addition of a Townend ring cowling worsened the visibility problem, and had only a limited effect on speed. It was also tested with various types of deep-chord NACA cowls.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1954, a pilot {{attached}} to Gloster from RAE Farnborough was killed while flying Javelin XA546 after having entered {{what appeared to}} be an intentional spin. On 8 December 1955, a <b>service</b> <b>test</b> pilot S/L Dick was testing XA561 for the A when the aircraft entered a flat spin during manoeuvres, which the anti-spin parachute could not stop, and he ejected. Following this, a stall-warning device was developed for the Javelin.|$|E
25|$|Powered by a {{prototype}} Lycoming YT53-L-1 (LTC1B-1) engine producing 700 shp (520kW), the XH-40 first flew on 20 October 1956 at Fort Worth, Texas, with Bell's chief test pilot, Floyd Carlson, at the controls. Two more prototypes {{were built in}} 1957, and the Army had previously ordered six YH-40 <b>service</b> <b>test</b> aircraft, even before the first prototype had flown. In March 1960, the Army awarded Bell a production contract for 100 aircraft, which was designated as the HU-1A and officially named Iroquois after the Native American nations.|$|E

25|$|On 1 March 1935 the Squadron {{moved by}} train with the Group to Barksdale Field, Shreveport, Louisiana {{at which time}} it {{became a part of}} the General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ AF) and became a <b>Service</b> <b>Test</b> Organization. The Squadron went {{immediately}} into a strenuous and successful training period which included formation flying, attack and aerial gunnery, bombing night flying and many navigation missions. The squadron continued in this capacity until October 1940 and during this period participated in all the major field exercises and tactical maneuvers throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{submitted}} its Model 345 on 11 May 1940, {{in competition}} with designs from Consolidated Aircraft (the Model 33, later to become the B-32), Lockheed (the Lockheed XB-30), and Douglas (the Douglas XB-31). Douglas and Lockheed soon abandoned work on their projects, but Boeing received an order for two flying prototypes, given the designation XB-29, and an airframe for static testing on 24 August 1940, with the order being revised to add a third flying aircraft on 14 December. Consolidated continued to work on its Model 33 as it was seen by the Air Corps as a backup in case of problems with Boeing's design. Boeing received an initial production order for 14 <b>service</b> <b>test</b> aircraft and 250 production bombers in May 1941, this being increased to 500 aircraft in January 1942. The B-29 featured a fuselage design with circular cross-section for strength. The need for pressurization in the cockpit area also led to the B-29 being one of very few American combat aircraft of World War II to have a stepless cockpit design, without a separate windscreen for the pilots.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Giles {{spent the}} next year as {{assistant}} engineering officer and instructor in the Flying Department at March Field in California and in July 1929 became the post engineering officer at the same field. He served as chief engineering officer at Rockwell Air Depot in San Diego from October 1930 until July 1934, becoming captain in January 1932. Giles attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field in Alabama with his twin brother; The two Giles men graduated in June 1935 and both advanced {{to the rank of}} major. Other officers in the graduating class included strategic bombing advocates Haywood S. Hansell, Muir S. Fairchild, Laurence S. Kuter and Hoyt S. Vandenberg. Major Barney Giles commanded the 20th Bomb Squadron at Langley Field in Virginia for a year and moved up to operations officer of the 2d Bomb Group there in July 1936. He flew the first YB-17 Flying Fortress <b>service</b> <b>test</b> bomber to Langley on March 4, 1937. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for leading the rescue of seven men stranded on an ice floe near Cape Cod Bay. After graduation from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in June 1938, he went to Washington, D.C. as chief of the Inspection Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps.|$|E
