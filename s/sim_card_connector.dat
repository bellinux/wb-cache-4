50|$|Subscriber Identity Module (<b>SIM)</b> <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> {{includes}} a connector body, the connector body defines a receptacle channel that extends inwardly {{from the front}} and the receptacle channel further defines a first hole and a second hole. Pluralities of terminals mount {{in the middle of}} the connector body; a switch terminal mounts in the connector body. The switch terminal has a fixing portion received in the first hole and a contacting portion received in the second hole, the contacting portion forms an arced surface, the top of the arced surface is inserted into the second hole and protrudes above the top surface of the housing base in the receiving cavity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> {{comprises}} a body {{having an}} accommodating space for disposing a SIM card and multiple connected-through receptacles for receiving conducting terminals. Through the conducting terminals, an electrical signaling {{contact with the}} SIM card can be made. The connector further includes a guide arm having a first salient block and a second salient block, the first salient block and the second salient block are disposed on the respective sides of the guide arm and a cover {{is connected to the}} body for covering the accommodating space. Furthermore, the cover may connect with the guide arm through a pivot; the cover further comprises a groove. When the second salient block is moved, the first salient block shifts inside the groove and pushes the SIM card out from the accommodating space.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is {{designed}} {{not to allow}} the Ki to be obtained using the smart-card interface. Instead, the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> provides a function, Run GSM Algorithm, that allows the phone to pass data to the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> to be signed with the Ki. This, by design, makes usage of the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> mandatory unless the Ki can be extracted from the <b>SIM</b> <b>card,</b> or the carrier is willing to reveal the Ki. In practice, the GSM cryptographic algorithm for computing SRES_2 (see step 4, below) from the Ki has certain vulnerabilities that can allow the extraction of the Ki from a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> {{and the making of}} a duplicate <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Today, <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> are ubiquitous, {{allowing}} over 7 billion {{devices to}} connect to cellular networks around the world. According to the International Card Manufacturers Association (ICMA), there were 5.4 billion <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> manufactured globally in 2016 creating over $6.5 billion in revenue for traditional <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> vendors. The rise of cellular IoT and 5G networks is predicted to drive {{the growth of the}} addressable market for <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> manufacturers to over 20 billion cellular devices by 2020.

40|$|Background: Population {{movements}} following disasters {{can cause}} important increases in morbidity and mortality. Without {{knowledge of the}} locations of affected people, relief assistance is compromised. No rapid and accurate method exists to track population movements after disasters. We used position data of subscriber identity module (<b>SIM)</b> <b>cards</b> from the largest mobile phone company in Haiti (Digicel) to estimate the magnitude and trends of population movements following the Haiti 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak. Methods and Findings: Geographic positions of <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> were determined by {{the location of the}} mobile phone tower through which each <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> connects when calling. We followed daily positions of <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> 42 days before the earthquake and 158 days after. To exclude inactivated <b>SIM</b> <b>cards,</b> we included only the 1. 9 million <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> that made at least one call both pre-earthquake and during the last month of study. In Port-au-Prince there were 3. 2 persons per included <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b> We used this ratio to extrapolate from the number of moving <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> to the number of moving persons. Cholera outbreak analyses covered 8 days and tracked 138, 560 <b>SIM</b> <b>cards.</b> An estimated 630, 000 persons (197, 484 Digicel <b>SIM</b> <b>cards),</b> present in Port-au-Prince {{on the day of the}} earthquake, had left 19 days post-earthquake. Estimated net outflow of people (outflow minus inflow) corresponded to 20 % of the Port-au-Prince pre-earthquake population.

50|$|Due to the {{requirement}} to have a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> to access the service, users would therefore need an additional mobile phone or Dual SIM phone.

The ultra-slim <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> are placed {{at the back of}} normal <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> therefore tackling this challenge effectively. This ultra-slim <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> would also come with Near Field Communication (NFC) capability that enables them to be swiped on the point of sale devices or ATM thus converting a mobile phone into a credit or debit card.|$|R
40|$|Current {{capabilities}} of smart cards, Smartphones, and cellular network provoke companies to provide {{vast amount of}} services to the mobile users. Some of those services require end-to-end encryption between a Service Provider and a <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b> Keyed <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> already contain the required structure for secure key generation and upload, whereas un-keyed <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> {{do not have the}} required capability for this.

As the mobile technologies have advanced, Service Providers (SP) have offered services via Smartphones {{and some of them}} required secure data communication between the Subscriber Identity Module (<b>SIM)</b> <b>cards</b> on Smartphones and the servers of SP. The latest <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> comply with recent specifications including secure domain generation, mobile signatures, pre-installed encryption keys, and other useful security services. Nevertheless, un-keyed <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> do not satisfy such requirements, thus end-to-end encryption between the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> and SP cannot be provided.
