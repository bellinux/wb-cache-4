40|$|Introduction. Dialysis {{associated}} <b>steal</b> syndrome (DASS) {{constitutes a}} serious risk for patients undergoing vascular access operations. We aim {{to assess the}} measured volume flow using ultrasound in patients with clinically suspected <b>steal</b> syndrome and determine differences in flow among types of arteriovenous (AV) access. Methods. Patients with permanent hemodialysis access with and without ischemic <b>steal</b> underwent duplex ultrasound (US) exams {{for the assessment of}} volume flow and quantitative evidence of hemodynamic <b>steal.</b> Volume flow was measured in the proximal feeding artery. Results. 118 patients underwent US of which 82 (69. 5 %) had clinical evidence of <b>steal.</b> Women were more likely to develop <b>steal</b> compared to men (chi-squared test). Mean volume flow in patients with <b>steal</b> was 1542 [*]mL/min compared to 1087 [*]mL/min () in patients without evidence of <b>steal.</b> A significant difference in flow volumes in patients with and without <b>steal</b> was only seen in patients with a brachial-cephalic upper arm AV fistula (AVF) (). When comparing different types of access with <b>steal,</b> brachial-cephalic upper arm AVFs had higher volume flows than the upper extremity AV graft (AVG) group (). Conclusion. In patients with DASS, women were more likely to develop <b>steal</b> syndrome. Significantly higher volume flows were seen with brachial-cephalic upper arm AVF in patients with <b>steal</b> compared to those without. A physiologic basis of this US finding may be present, which warrants further study into the dynamics of flow and its relationship to the underlying peripheral arterial pathology in the development of ischemic <b>steal...</b>|$|R
