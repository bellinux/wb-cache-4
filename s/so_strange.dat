5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) began naming {{features}} on Saturn's moon Enceladus after characters and places in Burton's translation because “its surface is <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> and mysterious {{that it was}} given the Arabian Nights as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy”.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the five}} living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the platypus and the short-beaked echidna. The {{monotremes}} differ from other mammals in their methods of reproduction; in particular, they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The platypusa venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed amphibious mammalis considered {{to be one of}} the strangest creatures in the animal kingdom. When it was first presented by Joseph Banks to English naturalists it was thought to be <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> that it was a cleverly created hoax. The short-beaked echidna is similarly strange, covered in hairy spikes with a tubular snout in the place of a mouth, and a tongue that can move in and out of the snout about 100 times a minute to capture termites.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

500|$|While {{as far as}} {{is known}} Fischer was never {{formally}} diagnosed, there has been widespread comment and speculation concerning his psychological condition based on his extreme views and unusual behavior. Reuben Fine, psychologist and chess player, who met Fischer many times, said that [...] "Some of Bobby's behavior is <b>so</b> <b>strange,</b> unpredictable, odd and bizarre that even his most ardent apologists have {{had a hard time}} explaining what makes him tick" [...] and described him as [...] "a troubled human being" [...] with [...] "obvious personal problems".|$|E

Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: “It sounded <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> when people called me Joanne.

500|$|By {{the end of}} September 1541, Charles was in Majorca, {{preparing}} {{an attack}} on Algiers; Francis, considering it impolitic to attack a fellow Christian who was fighting the Muslims, promised not to declare war {{for as long as}} the Emperor was campaigning. [...] The Imperial expedition, however, was entirely unsuccessful; storms scattered the invasion fleet soon after the initial landing, and Charles had returned to Spain with the remainder of his troops by November. [...] On 8 March 1542, the new French ambassador, Antoine Escalin des Eymars, returned from Constantinople with promises of Ottoman aid in a war against Charles. [...] Francis declared war on 12 July, naming various injuries as the causes; among them was Rincon's murder, which he proclaimed [...] "an injury so great, so detestable and <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> to those who bear the title and quality of prince that it cannot be in any way forgiven, suffered or endured".|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Bellman {{writes that}} modern concert {{performance}} style—set in the [...] "conservatory" [...] tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against {{what is known}} of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that [...] "concerts are never real music, {{you have to give}} up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art." [...] Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as [...] "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. [...] Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin [...] "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery... whose effect is <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> and piquant as to be impossible to describe... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn". Hiller wrote that [...] "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers." ...|$|E
500|$|Opabinia looked <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> {{that the}} {{audience}} at the first presentation of Whittington's analysis laughed. The length of Opabinia regalis from head to tail ranged between [...] and [...] The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was {{about one-third of the}} body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was [...] like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close {{to the middle of the}} head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is [...] "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of the film was mixed in the United States. In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre [...] "comes off as exhausted and uninspired". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times criticised the film as having [...] "nothing surprising" [...] and sacrificing its originality {{for the sake of}} box office returns. Forbes Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as [...] "the worst 007 movie in 30 years". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as [...] "an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment", aspiring [...] "to be a serialized sequel" [...] and proving [...] "itself as a Saga". While noting that [...] "othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny", he had [...] "come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is <b>so</b> <b>strange,</b> so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention." [...] Christopher Orr, writing in The Atlantic, also criticised the film, saying that Spectre [...] "backslides on virtually every [...] ". Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer called Craig's performance [...] "Bored, James Bored." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg, writing for The Washington Post, stated that the film turned into [...] "a disappointingly conventional Bond film." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Fallows, in {{his article}} on [...] "spoof articles" [...] in the 2001 New Grove, cites Gnocchi's unusual career, {{singularly}} titled and voluminous works, and [...] "lugubrious" [...] portrait (in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart) {{as an example of}} why spoof articles do not need to exist in music encyclopedias: there are already musicians <b>so</b> <b>strange</b> that spoofs would be superfluous.|$|E
