40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The lack of {{information}} regarding the inheritance of the duration and rate of grain filling, and the possible relationship between grain fill and grain protein content in wheat prompted this study. Early maturing Chinese cultivars, 'AI Feng 2 ' and 'CB 83 - 52 ', and late maturing cultivars adapted to Oregon, 'Stephens' and 'Yamhill Dwarf', were examined for vernalization and photoperiod responses. Progeny from a diallel cross of the genotypes was evaluated for grain filling parameters, grain protein content and other agronomic traits for two years. 'Yamhill Dwarf' required six weeks of vernalization, while other cultivars needed only four weeks. The two Oregon developed genotypes were more sensitive to photoperiod than Chinese genotypes. Variation in developmental patterns among genotypes was related to differences in leaf number, spikelet number, rate of spikelet initiation, and rate of grain fill. Compared to <b>solid</b> <b>planting,</b> space-planting reduced the grain filling period. Significant genotypic variation for grain filling rate, duration, and kernel weight was observed in both seasons. Genotype X year interaction was not significant {{for any of the}} grain filling traits. General combining ability effects for grain filling rate, duration, and kernel weight were much larger than specific combining ability effects. Additive gene action made the major contribution to the inheritance of the grain filling traits. However, dominance effects appeared also {{to be involved in the}} genetic control of grain filling duration and kernel weight. Narrow sense heritability estimates were high for all three grain filling traits. Results indicated that early generation selection for both duration and rate of grain fill should be effective in these populations. Rate, but not duration of grain fill was closely associated with kernel weight. There was an inverse relationship between duration and rate of grain filling. Kernel protein percentage was positively associated with duration, but negatively related to rate of the grain filling. Results suggest that starch and protein accumulations in the kernel are two highly independent processes and may not necessarily compete for assimilates or energy. It may be necessary under the environments of this study to increase the duration of the grain fill to obtain high protein content with acceptable grain yield...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Six wheat hybrids {{from two}} sets of parents and their {{respective}} parents were grown at Hyslop Agronomy Farm near Corvallis, Oregon in the year 1965 - 66. The object of the experiment was to evaluate the influence of population densities and different planting patterns on grain yield and factors which determine grain yield. Factors studied included the leaf area index, percent light interception, plant height, and the components of grain yield which are tillers per unit area, kernel per spike {{and the weight of}} 1, 000 kernels. The design of the experiment was first order factorial randomized split plit with 12 phenotypes X two population densities X five patterns of planting. Leaf area was measured without detaching leaves from the plant at three stages of growth. These included the jointing stage, prior to flag leaf and the heading stage. Light interception in the plant canopy was obtained by exposing ozalid paper which was placed two inches above the soil surface between the plants for nine hours during the day, At maturity, data were collected on total dry matter production, kernels per spike, 1, 000 kernel weight and grain yield. Leaf area index and tillers per unit area in hybrids and parents were not significantly different at the jointing stage. However, significant differences were observed for both the characteristics in the later stages of growth due to the reduction in tiller number per unit area. The lethal effect on tillers was due to shading of upper leaves on the same plant and from surrounding plants. Significant differences among parents and hybrids for tolerance to the influence of shading was observed. Two hybrids derived from the cross Druchamp X Redmond and Druchamp X Travero were found to be more tolerant and produced significantly higher grain yield than their respective parents. Leaf area index was found to be influenced by plant density, patterns of planting, tillers per unit area and plant height. Significantly higher grain yield was produced with a 12 " <b>solid</b> <b>planting</b> than any other patterns of planting as a result of more tillers per unit area being present at harvest time. The percentage light intercepted by the plant canopy was directly associated with plant height at the jointing stage while in the latter stages of growth the leaf area index was more important in determining the amount of light intercepted. Increased population density per unit area and closer row spacing increased the percentage of light intercepted. Dry matter production was proportionately higher with increased light interception. The percentage of light intercepted at the heading stage was found to have a greater influence on grain yield than at any other stage of growth. The cross Druchamp X Travero which produced 33 percent higher grain yield than the better parent was found to exhibit hybrid vigor for all characteristics in the later stages of growth...|$|E

Grain yield in skip row treatments was equal to or greater than that of <b>solid</b> <b>plant</b> treatments at yield levels below about 2. 5 t/ha. Soil water measurements confirmed that this effect was due to the conservation of soil water in the centre of the skip areas for use by the crop after anthesis. A root front velocity of 2 cm/day was observed in all directions from the base of the sorghum plant. Light interception in skip row configurations was shown to be the same as in <b>solid</b> <b>plant</b> configurations between pairs of rows and up to 50 cm into the skip area. Further into the skip area, light interception was effectively nil. These results provide the basis to refine the APSIM Sorghum model to allow simulation of the effect of various row configurations over a range of climatic and soil conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The F₂ progeny from a diallel cross {{involving}} seven {{winter wheat}} parents {{along with the}} parents were grown at the Hyslop Agronomy Farm near Corvallis, Oregon to {{determine the influence of}} three plant densities on gene action estimates for yield and its primary components. The plant densities were designed to provide different levels of competitions involving solid, six and 12 inch spacing within the rows with one foot spacing between the rows. Gene action estimates were obtained by the combining ability analysis as well as narrow sense heritability estimates. In addition, path-coefficient analysis was utilized to investigate the direct and indirect associations of the primary components of yield under different stresses of competition resulting from the changes in population densities. The morphological characters measured were 1) total yield per plant, 2) kernel weight 3) number of kernels per spikelet, 4) number of spikelets per spike, 5) tiller number and 6) plant height. A small additive gene action for yield was noted in the six inch spacing while additive gene action effects could not be detected in the 12 inch and solid plantings. Yield being a complex trait seems to be affected by the environmental changes resulting from different plant densities. Consistent general combining ability estimates were observed for kernel weight and plant height in all the plant densities, indicating a small genotype-environment interaction. In the spaced plantings additive gene action estimates were obtained for tiller number and spikelets per spike while {{there was no evidence of}} additive gene effects in the <b>solid</b> <b>planting.</b> No additive gene action was noted for kernels per spikelet in the 12 inch planting while six inch and solid plantings revealed considerable genetic variability. These results would suggest that the genotypes are susceptible to environmental fluctuations for the traits tiller number, spikelets per spike and kernels per spikelet. The correlation coefficients reveal that in spaced plantings tiller number, spikelets per spike and kernels per spikelet are significantly and positively related to yield. In the solid seeding only spikelets per spike was significantly associated to yield. When the four variables were considered in terms of their associations with yield it was observed in the F₂ that in spaced plantings all the four components of yield have direct positive influence on yield. In the solid seedings however, spikelets per spike and kernels per spikelet had high positive direct effects on yield while tiller number and kernel weight showed a negative direct influence on yield. The data revealed that spikelets per spike and kernels per spikelet are the most important traits contributing towards yield. However, the results obtained with correlation coefficients indicate that a negative association existed between these two traits as well as between kernels per spikelet and tiller number suggesting the possible existence of a biological limitation between these components of yield. The results indicate that a breeding program with emphasis on the selection of plants in competitive conditions in the early generations may make the selection work more efficient. Moreover, increases in yield which considers each of the components separately or in combination of two or more would offer the most promise. By this procedure the breeder would take advantage of the large amount of additive genetic variances associated with each of the components and at the same time take into consideration any biological limitations which may exist...|$|E

While the ecological significance of gaps may be large, we know little about {{their impact on the}} hydrodynamics within the canopy. We used laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of longitudinal gaps within canopies exposed to a wave field. In rigid submerged and emergent vegetation, wave velocities were reduced compared to the case without vegetation. Flexible canopies also attenuated waves, but this attenuation was lower than for rigid canopies. The presence of the gap modified the mean current associated with the waves in both the gap and the lateral vegetation. A gap within a canopy of 5 % <b>solid</b> <b>plant</b> fraction did not show differences in the wave attenuation between the gap and the lateral vegetation. In contrast, gaps within canopies of 10 % <b>solid</b> <b>plant</b> fraction resulted in large differences between the gap and the lateral vegetation.

40|$|Solids {{processing}} is prevalent {{throughout the}} chemical manufacturing industry and includes any process which produces solid products or uses solids processing steps such as crushing, crystallization, dissolution, or filtration. One unique feature of a solids process {{is that each}} solids stream is characterized by its particle size distribution (PSD), shape, habit, internal porosity and mechanical strength {{as well as other}} attributes such as composition and temperature. Because of these added complexities, there is an absence of adequate tools for the design of solids processes. Recent surveys indicate that <b>solids</b> <b>plants</b> perform poorly compared to vapor-liquid plants and the need for improvements in solids processing technologies is now widely recognized. ^ The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive design framework for the simulation of <b>solids</b> <b>plants.</b> Emphasis is placed on accounting for the evolution of the PSD as a material stream is processed by each equipment unit. A key component is a new set of discretized population balance equations (PBEs) which account for such changes due to the basic mechanisms of nucleation, growth, dissolution, agglomeration, and breakage. This new approach is compatible with the data structure of large-scale simulation codes, correctly predicts changes in both the total mass and the total number of particles simultaneously, allows modeling of an equipment unit by combining the basic mechanisms appropriate for that unit, and is flexible in that it allows the user to choose equal or geometric size intervals for discretization. With this framework, models for various units of solids processing equipment are formulated and linked together to simulate a solids process. ^ Specific industrial examples, such as the production of alumina, are used to demonstrate the effects of the PSD on an entire process as well as on process subsystems. This new tool provides more accurate predictions of plant performance and significantly better estimates of equipment size than models which ignore the PSD. Based on these simulation results, insights for plant retrofit are identified. ...|$|R

In 60 -sec trials in which stimuli were presented on cotton swabs, the lizards detected all three stimuli, exhibiting more tongue-flicks, licks, or bites, or a greater tongue-flick attack score (TFAS; overall measure of response strength to prey stimuli) than to deionized water. The initial response to all stimuli was tongue-flicking, but the lizards discriminated among the types of chemical stimuli.
