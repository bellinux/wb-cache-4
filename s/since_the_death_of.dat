5|$|A grand state funeral—not seen <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> PedroII's sister Paula in 1833—was {{held for}} the Prince Imperial at 7p.m. three days after his death. He {{was buried in the}} Convento da Ajuda (Convent of Aid) in Rio de Janeiro. When the convent was {{demolished}} in 1911 his remains were moved to the mausoleum of the Convento de Santo Antônio (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio de Janeiro, where other members of the Brazilian House of Braganza (including his younger brother Pedro, his uncle João and his aunt Paula) are also located.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Weizsäcker {{gave the}} eulogy {{at the state}} funeral of former Chancellor Willy Brandt at the Reichstag, the first state funeral for a former {{chancellor}} {{to take place in}} Berlin <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Gustav Stresemann in 1929. The funeral was attended by an array of leading European political figures, including French President François Mitterrand, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.|$|E

5|$|In the flash-sideways scenes which {{depict the}} survivors' afterlife, Rousseau {{is still the}} mother of Alex and lives with her. Alex {{introduces}} her mother to Dr. Linus because he's been hurt after being battered by Desmond. Danielle and Alex bring him home for dinner. While Alex is doing her homework, Danielle and Dr. Linus talk about her. She tells him that <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> her father when she was two, he's {{the closest thing to}} a father figure that she has. Dr. Linus is visibly touched.|$|E
5|$|Julia Martha Thomas was {{a former}} schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> her second husband in 1873, she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a garden at the front and back. The area was not heavily {{populated}} at the time, although her house was close to a public house called The Hole in the Wall.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 South African general {{election}} {{was held on}} 7 May 2014, to elect a new National Assembly and new provincial legislatures in each province. It was the fifth election held in South Africa under conditions of universal adult suffrage {{since the end of}} the apartheid era in 1994, and also the first held <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Nelson Mandela. It was also the first time that South African expatriates were allowed to vote in a South African national election.|$|E

50|$|Arguably, {{the best-known}} living Canadian writer internationally (especially <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a {{prolific}} novelist, poet, and literary critic. Some great 20th-century Canadian authors include Margaret Laurence, and Gabrielle Roy.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> James Mayne in 1939, and Mary Mayne in 1940, Brisbane Arcade {{has been}} {{operated}} by a board of trustees {{acting on behalf of}} their estates, with operating proceeds benefiting the University of Queensland School of Medicine (now known as the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School in honour of the bequest). McGees Property manages the arcade on behalf of the board of trustees.|$|R
5|$|The {{office of}} Prelate {{was held by}} the Lord Archbishop of Armagh, the most senior clergyman in the Church of Ireland. The Prelate was not {{mentioned}} in the original statutes, but created by a warrant shortly afterwards, apparently because the Archbishop at the time had asked to be appointed to the post. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the last holder in 1885, the office of Prelate has remained vacant.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised {{by the size of}} the crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Wujek-Śląsk mine blast {{occurred}} at the Wujek-Śląsk bituminous coal mine in Ruda Śląska, Poland on 18 September 2009. At least 20 miners were killed (12 died in coal mine, 8 in hospitals) and at least 37 more were hospitalised. It is the country's deadliest mining accident <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> 23 miners from methane at the Silesia's Halemba mine in November 2006. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> toll is expected to increase.|$|R
50|$|The IRA units {{next major}} target was the RUC police station at Loughgall. This {{operation}} {{was a disaster}} for the IRA as the operation ended with the IRA unit being ambushed by the SAS and the whole IRA unit (eight Volunteers) along with a civilian were killed.The funerals of the IRA Volunteers killed at Loughgall were some of the biggest IRA funeral <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunger Strikers in 1981.|$|R

And more {{specifically}} {{known as the}} Serbian Brotherhood encompassing territory from Sweden to Denmark. The Serbian mafia or Serbian Brotherhood in Sweden {{was said to be}} the top criminal organisation, but its influence has declined <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> several leading figures. A war was fought over the control of the trade of narcotics and cigarettes between Serbian Organized Crime leaders which resulted in <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> Joksa and Ratko Đokić.|$|R
5|$|He {{administered}} for {{the king}} {{a large proportion of}} the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099, being consecrated on 5 June 1099. He had been the custodian of the see <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration, he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York, just as his predecessor had done. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, accused Ranulf of paying 1,000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria, because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne, but he only exercised this for a short time, as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|Later, new officer Ruth Evershed, {{transferred}} from Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), informs {{the team that}} Metropolitan Police have arrested Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun, an Algerian secret service agent. After his release Khaldun reveals that <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> his family, he desired to leave Algeria to work for British intelligence, so he fooled his agency into believing he was killed while stopping a jihadist group in France, before smuggling himself into England via a Channel Tunnel freight train. The team allow him to work undercover in Parkmount, posing as a labourer at the local university, where he quickly gains Rachid's trust. Beforehand however, Khaldun removes all the surveillance equipment on him. Furthermore, news of Khaldun's arrival also gains {{the interest of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who also wish to use him.|$|E
50|$|On 19 January, Gratian {{declared}} Theodosius, magister militum per Illyricum, {{to be his}} new colleague in the Eastern Roman Empire. Theodosius {{seems to}} have been the senior officer of Roman origins available for promotion at the time. Merobaudes and Frigeridus, the two magistri militum in praesenti were probably not considered due to their Germanic origins. Several other equivalent positions remained vacant <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> their last holders in Adrianople. At this point Flaccilla became the Empress consort.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic editor John Bush {{wrote in}} a {{retrospective}} review, [...] "Though the productions are just a bit flashier and more commercial than on his debut, Jay-Z remained the tough street rapper, and even improved a bit on his flow". According to Bush, he [...] "struts the line between project poet and up-and-coming player" [...] while balancing [...] "both personas with the best rapping heard in <b>the</b> rap game <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> 2Pac and Notorious B.I.G.".|$|R

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> {{his young}} {{daughter}} from leukaemia in 1992, Gunn {{has been extensively}} involved in fundraising to combat the disease and its effects. As of 2011 he {{has raised more than}} £1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects {{to improve the lives of}} children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him Sheriff for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography, includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Still {{opposed to}} the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the {{government}} of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine's third son, Prince Paul, who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state. Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated in a general election. On 17 November, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, regent <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Alexander, retired and the new prime minister, Dimitrios Rallis, asked Olga to assume the regency. She served as regent {{for about a month}} until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after a referendum in his favor.|$|E
5|$|The {{people were}} allowed to enter to the Congress on April 1, 10:00. Initially, it was {{intended}} to keep the Congress open until 20:00, but the number of people attending it forced to delay it for the morning of April 2. The event was attended by the former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando de la Rúa, Eduardo Duhalde and Néstor Kirchner, {{all the members of the}} Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez and several other politicians. The Congress was visited by almost 40,000 people. It was the largest state funeral in Argentina <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Juan Perón in 1974.|$|E
50|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed, Mohamed Al-Fayed's son, two {{memorials}} {{commissioned by}} Al-Fayed have been erected inside Harrods to the couple. The first, {{located at the}} base of the Egyptian Escalator, was unveiled on 12 April 1998, consisting of photographs of the two behind a pyramid-shaped display that holds a wine glass smudged with lipstick from Diana's last dinner as well as what is described as an engagement ring Dodi purchased the day before they died.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book, it is told that Ethelberta was raised in humble circumstances but, through her work as a governess, married well at the age of eighteen. Her husband died two weeks after the wedding and, now twenty-one, Ethelberta lives with her mother-in-law, Lady Petherwin. In the three years that have elapsed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> both her husband and father-in-law, Ethelberta has been treated to foreign travel and further privilege by her benefactress, but restricted from seeing her poor family.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} NASCAR Cup Series race held <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. at this track. NASCAR used {{restrictor}} plates for this race as a result, {{in an effort to}} slow the top speed of the cars. However, cautions were so frequent and passing was so slowed that outside polesitter Jeff Burton led all 300 laps. This is the only race to date on a short track that had used restrictor plates. They were not used again after this race.|$|R
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the decade, major changes were made to the conductorship of the orchestra. In 2006 Daniel Harding joined Michael Tilson Thomas as {{principal}} guest, and the following year Davis retired as chief conductor and was appointed president of the orchestra, its first <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Bernstein in 1990. Davis was succeeded as chief conductor by Valery Gergiev. In Gergiev's first season in charge, a complete cycle of Mahler Symphonies was given, with the Barbican Hall sold out for every concert. In 2009 Davis and the LSO celebrated 50 years of working together. In the same year the LSO took over from the Berlin Philharmonic as the resident orchestra at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, adding to a roster of international residences at venues including the Lincoln Center in New York, the Salle Pleyel in Paris and the Daytona Beach International Festival in Florida. In 2010 the LSO visited Poland and Abu Dhabi for the first time and made its first return to India since the 1964 world tour. The orchestra played at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{was elected}} to the see of Hereford in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174 at Canterbury by Archbishop Richard of Dover. Hereford had been vacant <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Robert of Melun in 1167, due to the Becket's exile and then death. Foliot was either elected by the cathedral chapter without {{guidance}} from the king, or was nominated to the cathedral chapter by King Henry at the urging of his relative Gilbert Foliot. Robert Foliot later attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. While bishop, he became involved in a disupte with Hugh Parvus, a local baron, over the power of appointment to two churches. He also served as a judge-delegate for the papacy, serving with Roger, the Bishop of Worcester on cases including one between a Norman monastery and an English priory. He judged a number of other cases for the papacy during his time as bishop. He received over 40 surviving papal commissions and communications, some of which dealt with the problems of married clergy in his diocese. From his ecclesiastical documents, almost 40 survive.|$|E
5|$|Henry had {{reserved}} {{the episcopal}} see of Exeter for Warelwast <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Osbern FitzOsbern in 1103, but {{the controversy over}} investiture meant that his election and consecration were not possible before a settlement was reached. Instead the king gave Warelwast the office of Archdeacon of Exeter after Osbern's death. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury records that Warelwast had earlier tried to remove Osbern from office, but this story probably originates with Eadmer and is of dubious veracity. While archdeacon, Warelwast is recorded as being present at the transfer of a Devon church to Bath Cathedral. He was elected Bishop of Exeter, and was consecrated on 11August 1107, by Anselm at the royal palace of Westminster. Other bishops consecrated {{at the same time}} included William Giffard to Winchester, Roger of Salisbury to Salisbury, Reynelm to Hereford, and Urban to Llandaff. Warelwast's elevation was a reward for his diplomatic efforts in the investiture crisis. The mass consecration signalled the end of the investiture crisis in England.|$|E
5|$|Robert Morse (Danny Webb) is loud, argumentative, {{cynical and}} Golic's only friend. Golic, {{who has been}} {{restrained}} in <b>the</b> infirmary <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> Boggs and Rains, convinces Morse to free him; he subdues Morse, and releases the creature. After Dillon's death, Morse helps Ripley reach {{the top of the}} furnace so she can kill the Alien Queen and then herself by deliberately falling into the vat of molten lead. At {{the end of the film}} he is led away by Weyland-Yutani personnel, the only surviving resident of Fury 161.|$|R
50|$|Alice Bag {{went on to}} join to the deathrock band Castration Squad, which {{included}} Phranc and Dinah Cancer among its many members. In the 1990s she would form Cholita! with punk rock drag queen Vaginal Davis and the band released several videos. After this she performed with Las Tres and then formed Stay At Home Bomb, her most recent musical project. According to her official website, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> Lee and Ritter and her estrangement from Morrison, she considers the Bags to be permanently disbanded, and has refused to perform Bags songs in public.|$|R
5000|$|The only history {{available}} {{about the}} founding of Pátzcuaro comes from a book called Relación written by Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza. It states that two chiefs by the names of Páracume and Vápeani arrived in the area, then called Tarimichundiro, with their tribe, the Chichimecas. Here they began to build their temples, called [...] "cues" [...] by placing four large rocks close together. No date is given for this event, but <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two original chiefs occurred in 1360, it is widely supposed that the founding occurred around 1324.|$|R
