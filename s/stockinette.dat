25|$|Standard crochet {{stitches}} like sc and dc {{also produce}} a thicker fabric, more like knit garter stitch. This {{is part of}} why they use more yarn. Slip stitch can produce a fabric much like <b>stockinette</b> that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of <b>stockinette</b> fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated <b>stockinette,</b> membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E
40|$|No {{significant}} differences were found in surface microflora of county-cured hams covered with <b>stockinettes,</b> barrier bags, or a coating of paraffin wax during aging, except for a reduction in mold growth on waxed hams. The incidence of Clostridium spp. was lost in all treatments. Micrococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were the most common contaminants, but caused no apparent spoilage problem in any treatment...|$|R
25|$|The Siebe-Heinke Frogman {{dry suit}} for {{professional}} and recreational use {{was introduced in}} 1963. It was available in <b>stockinette</b> proofed with black rubber, or proofed fawn twill. The suit consisted {{of a set of}} booted trousers with reinforced soles or optional ankle seals, and a jacket with cuff seals and an option between a neck seal or integral hood. The two parts were connected by a rolled waist seal held in place by a rubber cummerbund. Sizes available were small, medium, large short and large.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1950s, C.E. Heinke & Co. Ltd., an {{established}} manufacturer of Standard diving equipment, had diversified into recreational underwater swimming equipment, including the Delta dry suit, made from natural rubber on a <b>stockinette</b> base. The basic Delta was a two piece suit {{made up of}} a jacket with neck seal and trousers with ankle seals which could be worn over woolen undergarments. The full suit included integral hood and feet. The overlapped and rolled waist seal was held in place by a cummerbund.|$|E
500|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74 {{consisted}} of a glass sphere in which was contained approximately [...] of semi-liquid nitroglycerin devised by ICI. The sphere was covered in <b>stockinette</b> which was coated with a liberal amount of birdlime, an extremely adhesive substance from which the nickname 'sticky bomb' was derived. A casing made out of thin sheet-metal, and formed of two halves, was then placed around the sphere and {{held in place by}} a wooden handle, inside which was a five-second fuse. The handle also contained two pins and a lever; the first pin was pulled out to make the casing fall away, and the second to activate the firing mechanism in the grenade. This primed the grenade, with the lever being held down to ensure the fuse was not triggered; then the user would run up to the tank and stick the grenade to its hull, using as much force as possible to break the sphere and spread the nitroglycerin onto the hull in a thick paste. Another alternative was for the user to throw it at the tank from a distance. Either way, the lever would be released and the fuse activated, and the grenade would then detonate.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{knitted fabric}} (as in the diagram, and usually called a {{stocking}} or <b>stockinette</b> pattern) has a definite [...] "right side" [...] and [...] "wrong side". [...] On the right side, the visible {{portions of the}} loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of V shapes. [...] On the wrong side, {{the ends of the}} loops are visible, both the tops and bottoms, creating a much more bumpy texture sometimes called reverse <b>stockinette.</b> (Despite being the [...] "wrong side," [...] reverse <b>stockinette</b> is frequently used as a pattern in its own right.) [...] Because the yarn holding rows together is all on the front, and the yarn holding side-by-side stitches together is all on the back, <b>stockinette</b> fabric has a strong tendency to curl toward the front on the top and bottom, and toward the back on the left and right side.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{perception}} that crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, tends to have less [...] "give" [...] than knitted fabric, and uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items. Though this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a <b>stockinette</b> swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, {{it is not necessarily}} true for crochet in general. Most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn. Tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces. According to sources claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than <b>stockinette</b> stitch. Any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric. Cluster stitches, which are in fact multiple stitches worked together, will use the most length.|$|E
2500|$|In a séance on 6 January 1933 in Edinburgh, {{a little}} girl called Peggy emerged in the séance room. A sitter named Esson Maule grabbed her and the lights were turned on and the spirit was {{revealed}} to be made from a <b>stockinette</b> undervest. [...] The police were called and Duncan was prosecuted and fined £10. The undervest was used as evidence which led to Duncan's conviction of fraudulent mediumship at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court trial on 11 May 1933.|$|E
2500|$|The fabric {{produced}} using a {{knitting machine}} is {{of a more}} even texture than hand-knitted fabric, which is particularly noticeable on large areas of plain <b>stockinette</b> stitch, and can be an advantage. [...] Some stitch patterns (e.g., tuck stitches) are much easier to produce with a knitting machine. [...] Others (e.g. garter stitch) can also be produced with machine knitting but can take a little longer but still much faster than hand knitting. [...] The standard gauge 200-needle machine can knit the finest yarns up to a good sport-weight, while the heavier yarns knit better on a mid-gauge or bulky knitting machine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} texture for a knitted garment is that {{generated}} by the flat <b>stockinette</b> stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and T-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl. [...] Other simple textures {{can be made with}} nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter stitch, ribbing, and moss and seed stitches. [...] Adding a [...] "slip stitch" [...] (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows {{for a wide range of}} textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{simplest}} of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric. Alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a <b>stockinette</b> pattern/stocking stitch. Vertical stripes (ribbing) are possible by having alternating wales of knit and purl stitches. [...] For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of knit stitches are followed by two wales of purl stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.|$|E
2500|$|Jelly can be {{made from}} sweet, savory or hot ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the {{additional}} step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or <b>stockinette</b> [...] "jelly bag" [...] is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can {{come in a variety of}} flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lack of a}} purl row in <b>stockinette</b> stitch, {{since in}} the round (commonly {{referred}} to as ITR) knitting is all done using the knit stitch, is often perceived {{to be one of}} the greatest benefits of ITR. [...] Knitting ITR with circulars is done in a spiral, the same way as using double-pointed needles (usually called DPNs). Additionally, circulars eliminate the need to continually switch from one needle to the next, and there is no possibility of stitches falling off the back end of the needles, as may happen when using DPNs. [...] Much larger tubes may be knit ITR, too, helping items to be completed more quickly. [...] Construction of garments such as sweaters may be greatly simplified when knitting ITR, since the finishing steps of sewing a back, two fronts, and two sleeves of a sweater together may be almost entirely eliminated in neck down ITR knitting.|$|E
2500|$|British frogmen of World War II and {{for some}} time {{afterwards}} used a similar one or two piece rubberized knit fabric suit by Siebe Gorman. They produced the one-piece front-entry Sladen suit with integral rubber helmet, developed by the British Admiralty for use with manned torpedoes, and in the late 1950s also the Essjee two-piece swim suit, based on the Sladen suit. The Essjee suit consisted of a jacket with rubber hood and lightweight wrist cuffs, and trousers shod with moulded rubber soles. The two parts were sealed by rolling the overlapped rubber skirts of the jacket and trousers together and these were {{held in place by}} a separate rubber cummerbund. Soft sponge-rubber pads inside the hood covered the ears and allowed them to be equalised. There was space under the suit for plenty of [...] woollen underclothes. The suit was available in proofed gabardine or rubberised <b>stockinette,</b> with the cloth on the outside and the rubber inside, to protect the rubber from sunlight while in use.|$|E
60|$|The long {{stocking}} caps {{they wear}} {{as a sort}} of crest, as a lizard wears his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then he shifts it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points, like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black <b>stockinette</b> stuff.|$|E

50|$|In knitting, ribbing is {{a pattern}} in which {{vertical}} stripes of <b>stockinette</b> stitch alternate with vertical s of reverse <b>stockinette</b> stitch. These two types of stripes may be separated by other stripes in which knit and purl stitches alternate vertically; such plissé stripes add width and depth to ribbing but not more elasticity.|$|E

50|$|Basic {{knitted fabrics}} are so {{fundamental}} that some types {{have been adopted}} {{as part of the}} language of knitting, similar to techniques such as yarn over or decrease. Examples include <b>stockinette</b> stitch, reverse <b>stockinette</b> stitch, garter stitch, seed stitch, faggoting, and tricot. In some cases, these fabrics appear differently on the right side (as seen when making the stitch) than on the wrong side (as seen from the other side, when the work is turned).|$|E

5000|$|For example, ribbing {{and cable}} {{patterns}} tend to [...] "pull in," [...] giving more stitches over an identical width than <b>stockinette,</b> garter, or seed stitch. Even the same stitch produced {{in two different}} ways may produce a different gauge.|$|E
