5|$|The Northern Epirote {{representatives in}} the {{following}} Panepirotic Assembly of Delvino {{had to take the}} final decision on whether to accept the Protocol. The Protocol was eventually accepted after the intervention of Venizelos; however the representatives of Himara found the terms too humiliating, arguing that the only viable <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> union with Greece and not autonomy inside the Albanian state.|$|E
5|$|The company Sotrasambandet AS {{has been}} {{established}} to lobby for and potentially debt-finance the construction, which potentially could include other parts of National Roads 555 and 561. In 2008, the company estimated {{that it might be}} possible to start construction in 2013, and complete the project by 2016. On 21 April 2009, State Secretary Geir Pollestad stated that the government would support a bridge, but did not indicate if a two-lane or four-lane <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> chosen. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended a four-lane bridge, while the Institute of Transport Economics has recommended the two-lane bridge. It is largely up to the city councils of Bergen and Fjell to determine which of the bridge alternatives will be chosen.|$|E

25|$|The {{scale of}} traffic growth envisaged would soon {{overtake}} any benefits that small-scale road improvement would offer, which would anyway {{divert attention from}} the large-scale <b>solutions</b> that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed. These <b>solutions</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very expensive and could only be justified if they were comprehensively planned, including social as well as traffic needs. However, the report saw no turning back from people's new-found dependence on the car, and thought that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> limits to how much traffic could be transferred to railways and buses.|$|R
50|$|The {{book has}} been criticized for not {{providing}} adequate solutions to the problems it identifies in education. Readers looking to hear the author's proposed <b>solutions</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> advised to read his other work, most notably The Educated Mind: How Cognitive Tools Shape Our Understanding.|$|R
25|$|The {{most direct}} <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to try all {{permutations}} (ordered combinations) and see {{which one is}} cheapest (using brute force search). The running time for this approach lies within a polynomial factor of , the factorial {{of the number of}} cities, so this solution becomes impractical even for only 20 cities.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{long term}} <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to increase {{access to health}} facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful {{in countries such as}} Peru and Ghana.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{a simpler}} <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to consult an almanac giving {{the time of}} sunrise and sundown, {{calculate}} the middle point of that time-span, corresponding to the maximum elevation of the sun. This gives the official time at which the sun reaches it maximum elevation, and therefore the time the sun disk crosses the Saint-Sulpice meridian.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we obtain {{sufficient}} {{conditions for}} the oscillation of all solutions of Eq. (1.1). Due to the form of our equation, we only need to give proofs for the case of eventually positive nonoscillatory solutions since the proofs for negative nonoscillatory <b>solutions</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> similar.|$|R
25|$|Evaluations {{of various}} types of foreign {{aircraft}} were conducted to find a replacement; however, it was determined in 1965 that the most economical <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to re-engineer the existing aircraft with a modern turboprop engine. Accordingly, work began {{under the direction of}} Jean-Pierre Weibel to convert the 102nd C-3603 into the prototype C-3605.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{difference}} equations - in particular, linear {{constant coefficient}} difference equations - {{can be solved}} using z-transforms. The z-transforms are a class of integral transforms that lead to more convenient algebraic manipulations and more straightforward solutions. There are cases in which obtaining a direct <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> all but impossible, yet solving the problem via a thoughtfully chosen integral transform is straightforward.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the results}} {{presented}} by Mast et al. {{strongly suggest that}} Banksia is paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. Although they did not propose a new taxonomic arrangement, they did consider various options for adjusting the current accepted arrangement to remove the paraphyly. They conclude that the simplest and least disruptive <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to merge Dryandra into Banksia. This solution was put into effect in a subsequent paper by Mast & Thiele.|$|E

25|$|During a {{demonstration}} of the E.28/39 to Winston Churchill in April 1943, Whittle proposed to Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation {{was the only way to}} repay those debts and ensure a fair deal for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets to make this happen. In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided a better <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to nationalise Power Jets only.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to use {{a single}} screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored {{phosphors}} instead of an even coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate electron gun, aimed at its colored phosphor. Although obvious, this solution was not practical. The electron guns used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would {{have to focus on}} individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond {{the state of the art}} at the time.|$|E
25|$|The Libyan Civil War {{began in}} 2011, {{the last year}} of Ban's first term, and {{dominated}} his attention and public statements that year. Throughout the conflict, he lobbied for peaceful solutions to the crisis. He frequently spoke out against military action in Libya, believing that a diplomatic <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible and preferable. However, he conceded that if then-leader Muammar Gaddafi refused to abide by a cease fire agreement, the international coalition of military forces would {{have no choice but to}} intervene to protect the human rights of Libyans. The Gaddafi government was eventually overthrown and Gaddafi killed in the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Simple {{heuristics}} like hill climbing, which move {{by finding}} better neighbour after better neighbour and stop {{when they have}} reached a solution which has no neighbours that are better solutions, cannot guarantee to lead {{to any of the}} existing better solutions – their outcome may easily be just a local optimum, while the actual best <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a global optimum. Metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solutions space, and although they prefer better neighbours, they also accept worse neighbours in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time.|$|E
25|$|A bank {{might be}} {{interested}} in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.|$|E

50|$|The report {{signified}} {{some fundamental}} shifts in attitudes to roads, by recognising {{that there were}} environmental disbenefits from traffic, and that large increases in capacity can exacerbate congestion problems, not solve them.

25|$|In 2013, a Pakistani firm {{invented a}} new formula to make {{fertilizers}} that cannot {{be converted into}} bomb-making materials. The firm, Fatima Fertilizer, had succeeded in making non-lethal alternatives to ammonium nitrate, a key ingredient in the fertilizers it makes. Fertilizers with ammonium nitrate, however, can easily be converted into bomb-making ingredients. This invention was praised by the Pentagon. “Such a long-term <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a true scientific breakthrough,” US Army Lieutenant General Michael Barbero, {{the head of the}} Pentagon’s Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, said in a statement. After this invention, CNN reported that the United States and Pakistan reached an agreement to jointly make fertilizers with non-explosive materials. But diplomatic sources told Dawn that an agreement could only be reached after the new material is tested. The sources said that US experts would soon visit Pakistan for testing the new material with experts from the Fatima Group, Pakistan’s major fertilizer manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the future}} storyline where the Sentinels exterminated most mutants {{and went on}} to kill regular humans as well, the elderly Magneto allies with the X-Men's {{remnants}} in a monastery in China. He and Professor Xavier decide that the best <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to prevent the Sentinels' creation by stopping Mystique's assassination of Bolivar Trask in 1973. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by Kitty Pryde, and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the Blackbird at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to succumb to his wound as he tells Charles he regrets that both friends spent too many years fighting among themselves rather than seeing eye-to-eye. He remains there until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future.|$|E
25|$|Up to this point, the Emu {{had been}} the only serial {{publication}} produced by the RAOU for all members, and was by far the biggest financial cost to the organisation. For a majority of members the receipt of the journal was the only direct contact they had with the RAOU. Yet the content of Emu was being assailed from both the 'scientists' who wanted more rigour and less in-house material, and from the 'amateurs' who disliked the scientific language of many papers. The long-term <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to cater separately for both groups. The start of this process came with the decision by the RAOU Council in 1968 to allow for a type of membership without a subscription to Emu. The next step was when Jack Hyett resigned as editor of Emu in 1968, the ACT Branch nominated Stephen Marchant for the editorship, and he was elected unopposed. Marchant was editor for the next twelve years and he transformed Emu into the lean and rigorous journal the 'scientists' wanted.|$|E
