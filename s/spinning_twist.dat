40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{analysis of the}} mechanical governing equations applying to the torsional behaviour of multi-ply yarns under tension has been carried out. This analysis clearly shows {{that there are two}} components, a geometric component that determines the slope or gradient of the torque due to tension and a component that determines the yarn torque at zero applied tension (intrinsic torque) that depends on the fibre number, fibre moduli and diameter as well as the strand structural geometry. The effect of the ratio of the ply twist to the <b>spinning</b> <b>twist</b> on the two components of yarn torque has been numerically analysed for two-, three- and four-ply yarns prepared from singles 31 yarns spun with different spinning twists and for two different fibre diameters. Other comparisons are made for two-ply yarns prepared from 40 and 80 tex singles yarn. The model allows the effects of the various yarn and fibre parameters to be assessed and compared with experimental data. Experimental torque data for a range of two-ply yarns plied at different percentages of the singles <b>spinning</b> <b>twist</b> and also with different yarn histories and test environments are consistent with the trends identified by the model...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} progress report we {{indicated that the}} distribution of fibers within the yarn structure strongly influences the mechanical behavior of the resulting yarns. In this report period we are reporting {{the analysis of the}} twist distribution in the spinning zone of an air-jet spinning system, and the effect of the use of an MIY device in Jet <b>Spinning.</b> <b>TWIST</b> DISTRIBUTION IN SPINNING ZONE OF AIR-JET SPINNING In t roduct ion Air-jet spinning method is akin to false-twisting of a yarn. The main bundle of fibers is under the false-twisting action of an air vortex. It is, therefore, important to know the twist distribution in the main bundle along the traveling direction of the yarn in the spinning zone. It was earlier thought that the twist in the core bundle along the yarn threadline prior to the twister remains constant as assumed by Krause et a 1 [l]. However, Grosberg et a 1 [2) have published their experimental evidence claiming {{that this is not the}} case. Lunenschloss and Bergmann [3] have reported the photographic evidence that the false-twist of the core decays gradually after the second twisting jet, as cited by Schwabe et a 1 [4]. The experimental evidence reported in the literature indicates that core twist must vary along the threadline in air-jet spinning. However, the published results are not in general agreement with each other, and there appears to be a need to re-analyze {{the previous}} work. The notation of symbols in the following analysis are as follows: I: Moment of inertial per unit length of yarn; K: Yarn torsional rigidity; k: A positive constant; 1 : Distance between the front-roller nip and delivery-roller nip...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of <b>spin</b> <b>twists</b> in the {{formation}} of domain walls, often called stripes, by focusing on the spin textures found in the cluster spin glass phases of LaSrCuO and YCaBaCuO. To this end, we derive an analytic expression for the spin distortions produced by a frustrating bond, both near the core region of the bond and in the far field, and then derive an expression for interaction energies between such bonds. We critique our analytical theory by comparison to numerical solutions of this problem and find excellent agreement. By looking at collections of small numbers of such bonds localized in some region of a lattice, we demonstrate the stability of small ``clusters'' of spins, each cluster having its own orientation of its antiferromagnetic order parameter. Then, we display a domain wall corresponding to <b>spin</b> <b>twists</b> between clusters of locally ordered spins showing how <b>spin</b> <b>twists</b> can serve as a mechanism for stripe formation. Since the charges are localized in this model, we emphasize that these domain walls are produced in a situation for which no kinetic energy is present in the problem.

It {{is based on}} the transfer of electrons through weak links formed by suspended nanowires, on which the charge carriers experience a strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction that <b>twists</b> their <b>spins.</b> It is demonstrated that when the weak link bridges two magnetically-polarised electrodes, a significant spintro-voltaic effect takes place. Then, by monitoring the generated voltage one is able to measure electronic spins accumulated in the electrodes, induced e. g., by circularly-polarised light, or alternatively, the amount of <b>spin</b> <b>twisting.</b> Mechanically-tuning the device by bending the nanowire allows one to achieve full control over the spin orientations of the charge carriers...|$|R

40|$|A {{particular}} analytic {{continuation of}} classical string solutions having a single AdS_ 5 spin is considered. These solutions describe strings tunnelling from the boundary to {{the boundary of}} AdS_ 5. We use the Legendre transform of the dimensionally regularised action of these solutions to evaluate the 2 -point functions of the dual operators, holographically. Subsequently, we evaluate the structure coefficient of correlators involving two operators with spin S and a BPS state, at strong coupling. Our expressions are valid for any value of the AdS spin S/√(λ) and can be applied both at the case of long and short strings. For long strings and at leading order, the structure coefficient is independent of the <b>spin</b> S for <b>twist</b> J operators, while it scales as 1 /^lS/√(λ) for the case of operators with two equal angular momenta in S^ 5.
