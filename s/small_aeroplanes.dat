2500|$|One of the {{significant}} innovations of the Akron-class was the presence within the airship's hull of a hangar capable of accommodating up to five <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> with a [...] "trapeze" [...] apparatus used for launching and recovering them; the aircraft were fitted with a [...] "skyhook" [...] apparatus that {{hooked up to a}} horizontal spar – for launch, the aircraft were hooked on within the hangar and lowered into the airstream, where the hook would be disconnected and the aircraft released, with the process working in reverse for recovery. In order that the ship had a stable equilibrium, rather than having the aircraft aboard on its departure, normal practice would have it setting off, before rendezvousing with the air group while airborne, and bringing them aboard using the trapeze. The Akron-class also employed a [...] "spy basket", a small aerodynamic gondola suspended from the ship by a line, which allowed observation of any enemy formation while the ship remained hidden within cloud cover.|$|E

50|$|It must be remembered, however {{that what}} was called an aerodrome in those days would by no means meet {{requirements}} for {{even some of the}} <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> of' modern times. In the early days it was considered necessary to construct several runways oriented in varying directions to avoid cross wind landings and take-offs, as the older type of tail wheel aircraft was more prone to swing than the modern nose wheel types.|$|E
50|$|The airport handles {{an average}} {{of more than two}} million {{passengers}} a year, and millions of pounds of cargo. The airport's main runway can handle airliners as large as the Boeing 747, although most passengers arrive on <b>smaller</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> such as ATR-42s, Boeing 737s and Boeing 757s. Boeing 747 activity at this airport is almost exclusively limited to cargo flights.|$|R

50|$|On {{the advice}} of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its {{conventional}} forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then to take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.|$|E

They were immediately put {{to work on a}} variety of development of the Blenheim, including the Type 152 Beaufort and Type 156 Beaufighter. More than 5,500 Beaufighter's were built before the war ended. A final development, the Type 164 [...] "Brigand", was produced only in small numbers before being replaced by the English Electric Canberra.|$|R

He then claimed that the object had moved directly in front of his plane; the airport personnel then heard a metallic [...] "scraping" [...] sound, followed by silence. Valentich and his plane subsequently vanished and neither Valentich nor his plane were ever seen again.|$|R

Wolfram von Richthofen become an exponent of air power providing ground support to other services. The difficulty of accurately hitting targets prompted Ernst Udet to require that all new bombers had to be dive bombers, {{and led to the}} development of the Knickebein system for night time navigation. Priority was given to producing large numbers of <b>smaller</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> and plans for a long range four engined strategic bomber were delayed.|$|R

50|$|During World War I and {{for some}} time after, the only {{successful}} transportable hangar design was the Bessonneau hangar. This could be very quickly erected and secured to provide adequate shelter for a few <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b> But with post-war increases in the number and size of aeroplanes, the need for larger transportable accommodation soon became apparent. The Air Ministry therefore issued a specification in 1936 covering the dimensions and requirements for a light transportable shed for use in war. It had to be end-opening with doors at both ends, be capable of mass production and have interchangeable parts to permit rapid erection and dismantling with minimal permanent foundations. This specification was submitted to various designers and eventually two different designs were presented - the Bellman and the Callender Hangar.|$|E

40|$|The final master´s thesis {{targets to}} create concept study of VFR airport. This airport should be {{build up in}} {{southeast}} part of Czech republic, {{in the vicinity of}} the town Valašské Klobouky. In this work there are explained essential terms and definitions refered to basic rules and law. There are explained also civil aviation law and requirements of L 14 regulations. Aeroclub is submitter of this work. It establishes basic conditions for airport area searching. The length of the runway is influenced mainly by performance of used aircrafts. It was impossible to find any acceptable field in searched area. There is a posibility how to solve this problem. There can be build up a runway for take-off and landings of <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b> In the second part of this thesis there are defined basic requirements on these fields. These requirements are applicated on chosen field. At the end of this thesis there is propounded an option how to dislocate runway, taxiways, aprons, hangars and other buildings...|$|E
40|$|Current {{safety reports}} {{indicate}} {{a rise in}} the number of reported incidents involving both medium and <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> and helicopters. The purpose of this study is to identify specific threats, errors and Undesirable Aircraft States (UAS), present in safety-related occurrences reported to the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAANZ). Threat and Error Management (TEM) is used to improve safety margins in aviation operations through the practical integration of human factors knowledge. The TEM framework is used to guide the investigation of reported safety-related occurrences in a way that systematically identifies specific threats, errors and UAS. This research employs the predictive safety method by investigating reported historical events, followed by analysing each event to list threats, errors and UAS. If a threat, error or UAS is identified in an occurrence, it is then marked ‘present’ under the corresponding column of the TEM taxonomic. After the completion of the classifications, solutions can be developed to prevent similar occurrences in the future. To test for accuracy and consistency of threat, error and UAS classifications, ten randomly chosen occurrences were provided to ten aviation professionals. These tests included Cohen’s Kappa test and a percentage of agreement test. Cohen’s Kappa results reached significant agreement with half of the respondents and an overall percentage of agreement of 68 per cent compared with the researcher’s classifications. Results from the TEM classifications show the majority of threats had environmental influences and procedural errors. The most common UAS resulted mainly from Ground Navigation and Aircraft Handling operational conditions. The TEM technique enabled a focus on the events that contributed to an incident rather than an accident. By applying the results from this TEM taxonomic, it is hoped that pilots will benefit from a better understanding of the importance of TEM and how frequently threat and errors contribute to incidents. This research would then help flight operators and pilots better prepare themselves to react to the likelihood of specific threats or errors, if and when they occur...|$|E
