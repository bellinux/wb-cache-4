5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven <b>stones</b> {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the <b>stones</b> perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded <b>stones</b> had been removed but that three additional <b>stones</b> had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine <b>stones</b> in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty <b>stones,</b> of which three had fallen and twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred <b>stones,</b> spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stones</b> Brewery (William <b>Stones</b> Ltd) was a {{regional}} brewery founded in 1868 by William <b>Stones</b> in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and purchased by Bass Brewery in 1968. After its closure in 1999, its major brand, <b>Stones</b> Bitter, {{has continued to}} be produced by the Molson Coors Brewing Company.|$|E
5|$|The brewing giant Bass {{acquired}} William <b>Stones</b> in the 1960s, {{and began}} to heavily promote the keg variant of <b>Stones</b> Bitter, which eventually became the highest selling bitter in the country. However the keg version was promoted {{at the expense of}} the traditional unpasteurised and unfiltered cask conditioned version. In the 1990s, the ABV of <b>Stones</b> was gradually reduced, and, as ale sales declined, <b>Stones</b> reverted from a national into a regional brand. Following the closure of the Cannon Brewery, <b>Stones</b> has been brewed at a number of different breweries. When Bass exited its brewing business, <b>Stones</b> became a Coors brand (later Molson Coors).|$|E

5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer {{survey in}} July 2009 investigated standing <b>stones</b> {{in the garden}} of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, which showed that the <b>stones</b> date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles.

5|$|A {{number of}} stone circles {{were built in}} the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Hampton Down ring was erected on an open downland ridge overlooking the coast. It originally contained either eight or nine sarsen <b>stones</b> and had a diameter of 20 feet (6.5 metres) across with a track leading to it from the north. By 1908 the circle had been shifted east of its original position, with a hedge built across the site, and the number of <b>stones</b> increased to sixteen. By 1964 the number of <b>stones</b> had further increased to twenty-eight. In 1965, Geoffrey J. Wainwright oversaw an archaeological excavation which revealed the circle's original location and dimensions, after which it was reconstructed in its original location with the extraneous <b>stones</b> removed.|$|E
5|$|About 250 Pictish <b>stones</b> {{survive and}} have been {{assigned}} by scholars to three classes. Class I <b>stones</b> are those thought to date to the period up to the 7th century and are the most numerous group. The <b>stones</b> are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals including fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno <b>stones</b> (Angus). Class II <b>stones</b> are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I <b>stones,</b> they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III <b>stones</b> are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II <b>stones.</b> Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E

5|$|Although the Rolling <b>Stones</b> {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations.

5|$|American {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst bought {{parts of}} the monastery in 1931 {{with the intention of}} using its <b>stones</b> in the construction of a grand and fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 <b>stones</b> were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades. These <b>stones</b> are now in various locations around California: the old church portal was erected at the University of San Francisco, and the chapter house was reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, California. Other <b>stones</b> are serving as simple decorative elements in Golden Gate Park's botanical garden. To support the chapter house project, a line of Belgian-style beers was produced by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company under the Ovila Abbey brand.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} breweries, {{occasional}} special brews were commissioned upon commemorative dates and retirement of long-serving employees. In 1991 a special bottled beer was produced when Sheffield Wednesday reached the finals of the Football League Cup. Two thousand bottles of <b>Stones</b> Centenary Ale were produced in 1995, celebrating 100 years of rugby league. This {{was followed by}} the 1996 cask conditioned <b>Stones</b> Super League Bitter (4.8 per cent ABV) celebrating Stones' sponsorship of the League, and the 1998 bottled <b>Stones</b> Commemorative Ale which marked the scheduled closure of the brewery. In summer 2007, Everards brewed a one-off cask conditioned <b>Stones</b> Pure Gold (4.1 per cent ABV) golden ale, and in 2011 four cask conditioned sports themed <b>Stones</b> branded ales were made available throughout {{the first half of the}} year, brewed at William Worthington's Brewery in Burton upon Trent.|$|E

5|$|Bass moved {{production}} of <b>Stones</b> to its Burton upon Trent and Tadcaster breweries. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing interests, including their breweries and the <b>Stones</b> brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew contracted the {{production of}} cask conditioned <b>Stones</b> to Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew to sell off certain brands in December 2001, including <b>Stones</b> Bitter, which was bought by the American Coors Brewing Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg <b>Stones</b> Bitter at their brewery in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton brewery. The cask product was initially contract brewed at the Highgate Brewery in Walsall, West Midlands, before moving to Everards of Leicester in 2005. The cask product ceased production in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} <b>Stones.</b> Bass closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline in sales of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the brewery produced. The brewer realised ¬£1 million in efficiency savings by closing the brewery. The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as <b>Stones</b> Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining <b>Stones</b> volumes left the brewery with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as <b>Stones</b> Mild and <b>Stones</b> Dark Mild respectively.|$|E

5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879‚Äì84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848‚Äì54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the <b>stones</b> because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} <b>stones</b> used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss <b>stones</b> that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner <b>stones</b> within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss <b>stones</b> laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged <b>stones,</b> form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite <b>stones</b> used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive <b>stones</b> used within the walls. Most of the gneiss <b>stones</b> used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble <b>stones</b> of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E
