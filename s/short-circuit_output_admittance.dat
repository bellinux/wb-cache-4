In two of these designs, depending on the way the MAJ- 3 function is implemented, defects translate into increased power, and suggest a (simple) way of detecting them. A detection circuit can trigger reconfiguration at a higher level, leading to a seamless transition from a fault/defect-tolerant circuit to a defect-tolerant system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel neutral point clamped full-bridge topology for transformerless photovoltaic grid-tied inverters. Transformerless grid-connected inverters {{have been used}} widely in recent years since they offer higher efficiency and lower costs. Ground leakage current suppression is the main issue which should be considered carefully in transformerless photovoltaic grid-connected inverters. Among different methods used to decline ground leakage current, neutral point clamped (NPC) topologies are considered more useful and effective. In NPC topologies, the <b>short-circuited</b> <b>output</b> voltage at the freewheeling period is clamped {{to the middle of}} the DC bus voltage. Therefore, the common-mode voltage (CM) will be constant at the whole switching period. Various NPC topologies such as H 6 [1], HB-ZVR [2], oH 5 [3], and PN-NPC [4] have been proposed. In this paper, a novel NPC topology is proposed which has lower power losses and higher efficiency over previous topologies. Furthermore, the proposed NPC topology exhibits a similar ground leakage current with the PN-NPC topology. The proposed NPC topology is analyzed theoretically using simulation studies and an experimental prototype is provided to verify theoretical analysis and simulation studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method to design an even-order {{symmetric}} bandpass filter with Chebyshev response. The alternative J inverters and λ/ 4 short-ended resonators {{are used in the}} filter design. It is well known that a conventional even-order Chebyshev bandpass filter prototype can be designed by using Jinverters. However, to achieve the Chebyshev response, a problem is that the <b>output</b> <b>admittance</b> YL is unequal to the input admittance Y 0 since normalized gn+ 1 is not equal to the g 0. Thus, for the symmetrical structure, an additional impedance transform can be installed at the output port to solve this problem, thus the network of even-order symmetric bandpass filter with a Chebyshev response should be modified with new J-inverters. In this work, all J-inverters of the symmetric bandpass filter with Chebyshev response are extracted and described as curves to determine the circuit dimensions of the proposed structure. Two even-order Chebyshev bandpass filters with the second- and fourth-order are designed with the proposed method as its application examples. Finally, the fourth-order filter is fabricated and measured at center frequency of 2. 5 GHz with the fractional bandwidth 25 %. The measured result is in good agreement with the simulated one...|$|R

First, our strategies on mechanical and controller designs to produce compliant motions are described, and the basic structure and impedance control of the RDJ-DA with internal serial structure explained. The standard form of the basic structure is introduced using a set of parameters which can be used to express the inertia property of RDJ-DA. Second, a problem statement for the design of RDJ-DAs is described after pointing out that required torques of the second actuator of the RDJ-DA could be large.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{some of the}} key {{aspects of}} reducing both static and dynamic power consumption in digital circuits, by operating the circuits in the subthreshold region, {{and at the same time}} retaining acceptable levels of both yield and defect-tolerance. Through evaluation of six different Full Adder structures, it is shown that static-based implementations are most promising for subthreshold operation, providing the best tradeoff between speed and power, reaching operating speeds of 2 MHz and average power dissipation in the area of 1 nW for VDD = 200 mV. Furthermore, both static and dynamic regulation techniques are addressed, coping with variation in temperature and process parameters, intra-die mismatch and device defects. A novel technique for static regulation improving gate symmetry is presented, where regulators structurally similar to the logic gate in question is utilized for controlling the logic gate's bulk/back-gate.
