500|$|Although in {{more recent}} seasons Flanders has become a {{caricature}} of the Christian right, {{he is still a}} favorite of many Christian viewers. Dr. Rowan Williams, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, is a confessed Simpsons fan, and likes Flanders. Ned's [...] "unbearable piousness" [...] has been described as [...] "The Simpsons sharpest critique of organized religion. The show's implicit argument seems to be that humorless obsessives like Ned have hijacked religious institutions, removing them from the center of society to a place where only those who know their brides of Beth Chedruharazzeb from their wells of Zohassadar can seek solace." [...] Steve Goddard of the website Ship of Fools said, [...] "Ned is an innocent abroad in a world of cynicism and compromise. We love him because we know what it's like to be classed as a nerd— and to come out <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{sentencing}} inside the courtroom, news channel Tv2 recorded Kristiansen reaction {{while he had}} a {{grin on his face}} while chewing chewing-gum. They later aired the video-tape during the evening news, after Kristiansens lawyer told the media that Kristiansen had been [...] "absolutely devastated" [...] by the verdict. In a 2008 interview, Kristiansen explained his reaction, saying that he was <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mere [...] "absurdity of the situation", he also accused the media of using the clip to portray him as a [...] "cold-blooded monster without emotions". This incident sparked a long legal conflict between Tv2 and the court, due to a law, banning recording of defendants inside court-rooms. Tv2 was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|This band dynamic {{has played}} a role in their public image as well. Early in their career, the duo were {{frequently}} accused of lacking stage presence, said to be a deliberate reaction to the hyper-cheerful music of the time, demonstrated by bands such as Wham!. A typical early performance featured Lowe in the background playing the bassline on a Fairlight synthesiser keyboard and Tennant singing, but otherwise passive, in the foreground. Tennant and Lowe both became well known for standing still throughout performances. In a 2016 interview, Chris Lowe said the duo's live performances was a response to the music scene in the 1980s: [...] "Everyone was so active. It was a big party where everyone was having a great time and <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera. Thumbs aloft! We just didn’t want to do that. So we ignored the cameras and the jollity of the situations. Let’s face it, it’s easier to stand stock-still isn’t it?".|$|E
