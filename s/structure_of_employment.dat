50|$|He {{collected}} and analyzed statistical indicators of economic performance of 14 countries in Europe, the U.S. and Japan for 60 years. Analysis {{of the materials}} led {{to the advancement of}} a number of hypotheses relating to various aspects of the mechanism of economic growth, concerning the level and variability of growth, structure of the GNP and distribution of labor, the distribution of income between households, the structure of foreign trade. Kuznets founded the historically grounded theory of economic growth. The central theme of these empirical studies is that the growth of the aggregated product of the country necessarily implies a profound transformation of the whole of its economic structure. This transformation affects many aspects of economic life - the structure of production, sectoral and occupational <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> the division of occupations among family and market activities, the income structure, size, age structure and spatial distribution of the population, cross-country flows of goods, capital, labor and knowledge, the organization of industry and governmental regulation. Such changes, in his opinion, are essential for overall growth and, once started, shape, constrain or support the subsequent economic development of the country. Kuznets made a profound analysis of the impact on economic growth by demographic processes and characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for the UK, the US and France that {{the pace of}} change in the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> by occupation has not been accelerating. Changes in the occupational <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> are taken to proxy changes in the net demand for labour by skill level. Efforts are made to make the data for these three countries comparable, reflecting the problem that data published by the ILO on the distribution of employment by occupation are not readily comparable. The direction of employment change across countries seems very similar, with manual jobs being replaced primarily by managerial, professional and technical jobs which tend to require higher qualifications. However, in themselves the changes in employment which have occurred require only modest improvements each decade in the qualifications of the workforce. In the UK, skilled manual employment has declined {{at the same rate as}} unskilled manual employment. Changes in the qualifications structure of the workforce occur gradually across generations, as the children of people with few formal qualifications attain higher qualifications and their parents leave the labour force. Sharp changes in the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> over a relatively short space of time can throw the labour market into a position of structural imbalance. But over time as the changes in the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> moderate and the new generation attains higher qualifications, these imbalances can work their way out.

40|$|In recent {{publications}} it {{has been}} argued that the change <b>of</b> the skill <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>employment</b> is caused by biased technical progress rather than by increasing international trade with low wage countries. However, in linking prices for final goods with prices of primary factors, most empirical studies have only dealt with international trade in final goods and have thereby neglected the impact of international outsourcing. In this paper it is argued that outsourcing can be understood as a substitution of imported intermediate inputs for domestic value added, and that such substitution may have an impact on the skill <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>employment</b> in favor <b>of</b> skilled labor.

40|$|This paper explores recent {{arguments}} about the marketization of female labour, {{in the context of}} a wider analysis of the role of concepts like 'the market' and 'individualization' in sociological accounts <b>of</b> change in <b>employment</b> relations. It will be argued that within sociology there has been a tendency for rapid, large-scale changes in employment relations to be characterized as the breakdown of social influences or structures and as the emergence of atomized, individuated market forces. In the most recent models, change in the nature of gendered positions within employment are presented in terms of a decline <b>of</b> social <b>structuring</b> and social constraint. These emergent accounts hold similarities to classical economics, and to Marx's and Weber's accounts <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> which also characterized new forms <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> relations in terms of the emptying of their social content and their replacement by market forms. We offer an alternative, moral economy, perspective which foregrounds the continued significance of social relations in the <b>structuring</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and employment change.

Looking at total employment figures and the overall employment rate one can see a major increase since the mid- 2000 s. The German employment rate increased significantly since the middle of the last decade, reaching more than 73 [*]% in 2013. This rate is substantially higher than the long-standing average of around 65 [*]%, which was characteristic for the 1990 s and early 2000 s (see Fig.  1), making Germany now above the UK and in line with countries such as Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria.|$|R

40|$|A fast-growing {{literature}} {{shows that}} technological change is biased towards routine tasks, changing the <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and wages in developed economies. This paper {{is the first}} to estimate the absolute rather than relative <b>employment</b> effects <b>of</b> routine-biased technological change (RBTC) for Europe as a whole and at the level of 238 European regions. We develop and estimate a task model of regional labor demand in tradable and non-tradable industries, building on Goos et al. (2014), and distinguish the main channels through which technological change affects labor demand. These channels include the direct substitution of capital for labor in task production, but also the compensating effects operating through product demand and local demand spillovers. We empirically estimate the contributions of the channels in our model to analyze how RBTC affects both aggregate and regional employment. Our results indicate that RBTC has on net created more than 11 million jobs across 27 European countries over 1999 - 2010, comprising half <b>of</b> total <b>employment</b> growth, and can account for some 40 percent of the observed European regional variation in employment growth over this period...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{developed}} upon inquires on urban spatial structure of Southeast Asian extended metropolitan region (EMR) and its impacts on travel. Literature suggests that while efforts in promoting transport sustainability {{in the developed}} world have included policy measures involving urban spatial structure and its physical features {{as a consequence of the}} understanding on strong link between land use and transport, there has been lack of understandings on the spatial structure in major cities in Southeast Asia. Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) is adopted for identification of important components of the spatial <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA). The approach has been specifically designed in order to extract clusters as suggested in the Southeast Asian EMR concept. It is found that the spatial <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the JMA consists of the following major components: the urban core of Jakarta; the single dominant and expanded regional CBD within the urban core of Jakarta; manufacturing corridors that are largely follow toll roads radiating out of the urban core; local government regions that in general have not been developed into substantial sub-centres; desakota areas overlapping the manufacturing corridors and the agricultural areas; and portions of agricultural areas in the outer parts of Bekasi, Bogor and Tangerang regencies. The result shows that spatial structure of JMA conforms to the Southeast Asian EMR concept rather than the monocentric, polycentric or sprawl patterns debated for the case of developed cities. Commuting impacts of the identified spatial <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and its physical features are investigated using the desireline analysis, home-to-work trip pattern comparisons (ANOVA) by the employment clusters, and ordinary linear regression and logistic regression models. It is found that the spatial structure identified and its physical features have significant associations to variations in the pattern of commuting across the region. The physical features of the employment spatial structure identified include important policy sensitive variables such as job density, job to household ratio, land use diversity and job accessibility. Policy implications of the findings are developed and centred on recommending both the spatial <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and its physical characteristics that promote more sustainable transport in the JMA...|$|E

The traditional German model of skill formation comprised two strictly separate sectors: the higher education (sub-)system and the system of dual vocational education and training. During the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} both systems formed their own institutional orders based on completely different construction principles (cp. stylised description in Table  1). The different institutional orders of both sectors were reflected in different educational paths leading to one of these (sub)systems and in the <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and work associated with either vocational training or higher education. There has been a relatively clear distinction between professional activities requiring either an academic or a VET degree, with a limited area of intersection.
