5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel {{being the}} savior of the people. He and his family travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When Your Time Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how she found a music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule and gives the people of the town three days to deliver their savior to him or he will destroy the town ("Three Days"). Arhys hides his brother and refuses to give him up ("Brother, Can You Hear Me?").|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Roark {{is unable}} to find a client willing to build {{according}} to his vision. He walks away from opportunities that involve any compromise of his standards. Broke, he takes a job as a laborer in a quarry. The quarry belongs to Francon's father and is near their summer home. The vacationing Francon visits the quarry on a whim. As Roark drills into the stone, Francon spots him and watches him work. When he sees her they openly and repeatedly <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gus {{leaves the}} room {{to get a drink}} of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's {{speaking}} tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefullyâ€”we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and {{is on his way to}} the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> before the curtain comes down.|$|E
60|$|Then {{through a}} pause they both <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> listening.|$|R
60|$|Another tiny mew {{proved that}} he wasn't. The two girls <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Penny finally does admit {{her love}} to Leonard, in [...] "The 43 Peculiarity". Penny and Leonard awkwardly <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> before running off in {{opposite}} directions. Leonard, though, is buoyed by optimism over Penny's admission. Alex Jensen asks Leonard {{out to dinner}} in [...] "The Egg Salad Equivalency", which boosts Leonard's ego because two beautiful women are interested in him, however, Alex's interest makes Penny insecure. After another dispute with Sheldon, Leonard tries {{to move in with}} Penny in [...] "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation", however she is not ready. During their Valentine's Day dinner in [...] "The Tangible Affection Proof", Leonard again tries to propose to Penny and she cuts him off quickly. She admits that she is very happy with him, but she also admits to commitment issues and the thought of being married forever really [...] "freaks" [...] her out. Leonard then tells her that when she is ready to get married, she can propose to him. In the season finale, Leonard leaves for an overseas job for four months and Penny is confident enough in their relationship to wait for him. [...] In [...] "The Gorilla Dissolution", Leonard and Penny become engaged. Throughout season 8, a running gag is their reluctance to decide upon a wedding date. In the season 8 finale, Penny asks Leonard to marry her that night in Las Vegas. Leonard happily accepts, but during the journey, after Penny expresses happiness that they will get married while knowing everything about each other, Leonard confesses to having shared a drunken kiss with another woman while on the boat in Europe, though he adds that the woman started it and he rejected her. Penny becomes hurt by the revelation, and even though she claims to forgive Leonard, there is clearly tension between them, leaving the season ending in a cliffhanger {{as to whether or not}} they will go through with the wedding.|$|E
60|$|But at {{that moment}} the sound of a voice {{speaking}} as it might be from a cavern, caused him and Joe Petty to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as if petrified.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing, Diomedes," [...] says Mr. Carvel. [...] "Master Philip will fetch what I need.". Master Philip's papa and mamma <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in a {{surprise}} mingled with no little alarm, Master Philip being to all appearances intent upon his book.|$|E
60|$|Now {{they knew}} all the awful truth, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> like dumb men.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} we stood and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and strange {{spectacles}} we were.|$|R
60|$|They <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{through a}} pause, and both faces were flushed and obstinate.|$|R
60|$|We did not <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{longer than}} a moment. Keeping tight hold of our prizes, we ran for the woods. Once in the {{security}} of a tall tree, we held up the puppies and laughed again. You see, we had to have our laugh out, no matter what happened.|$|E
60|$|We were {{so utterly}} shocked and stupefied at the {{degradation}} of this sudden and unexpected outburst from a man usually so honorable, gentle, self-sacrificing, and forgiving, that we forgot the cause of it and could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> What was this cheap stranger, with his shallow swindling tricks, to the ignoble change he had worked upon the man before us. Rowley and Walker, both fearless fighters and quick to resent an insult, only averted their saddened faces and turned aside without a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two {{hundred yards}} away," [...] he said, [...] "are all your fashionable acquaintances with nothing {{on earth to}} do but to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and at us. We are {{standing}} upon an elevation under the open sky, a peak as it were of fantasy, a Sinai of humour. We are in a great pulpit or platform, lit up with sunlight, and half London can see us. Be careful how you suggest things to me. For there is in me a madness which goes beyond martyrdom, the madness of an utterly idle man." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{mention of}} the discoverer's name the {{partners}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> disgustedly. Then they winked with great solemnity.|$|R
60|$|For {{the space}} of perhaps two seconds they <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> eye to eye. Then she {{vanished}} into the room.|$|R
60|$|The two <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Their hearts {{were full}} of feeling, but they could give it no expression--Forsytes that they were.|$|R
60|$|When we grew to {{know each}} other well, Gobind would tell me tales in a voice most like the {{rumbling}} of heavy guns over a wooden bridge. His tales were true, but not one in twenty could be printed in an English book, because the English do not think as natives do. They brood over matters that a native would dismiss till a fitting occasion; and what they would not think twice about a native will brood over till a fitting occasion: then native and English <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> hopelessly across great gulfs of miscomprehension.|$|E
60|$|It is a dull street {{under the}} best conditions, where the two long rows of houses <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with that {{severity}} that half-a-dozen of its greatest mansions {{seem to have been}} slowly stared into stone rather than originally built in that material. It is a street of such dismal grandeur, so determined not to condescend to liveliness, that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their own in black paint and dust, and the echoing mews behind have a dry and massive appearance, as if they were reserved to stable the stone chargers of noble statues. Complicated garnish of iron-work entwines itself over the flights of steps in this awful street, and from these petrified bowers, extinguishers for obsolete flambeaux gasp at the upstart gas. Here and there a weak little iron hoop, through which bold boys aspire to throw their friends' caps (its only present use), retains its place among the rusty foliage, sacred to the memory of departed oil. Nay, even oil itself, yet lingering at long intervals in a little absurd glass pot, with a knob in the bottom like an oyster, blinks and sulks at newer lights every night, like its high and dry master in the House of Lords.|$|E
6000|$|... "Another? There {{are about}} thirty!" [...] I exclaimed, turning away and feeling Mrs. Saltram's little eyes in my back. A {{few days after}} this I heard that Gravener's {{marriage}} was near at hand--was settled for Whitsuntide; but as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently {{came to me in}} fact the report of a postponement. Something was the matter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now critically ill. I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent's Park, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy. I forget to-day the exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and the particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my breath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the world that of fine drama. This was probably rather late in the day, and the exact order doesn't signify. What had already occurred was some accident determining a more patient wait. George Gravener, whom I met again, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation. Lady Coxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons as well. Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the occasion of a second attempt in the Regent's Park I equally failed to obtain a sight of her niece. I judged it discreet in all the conditions not to make a third; but this didn't matter, for it was through Adelaide Mulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first unwitting, began to reach me. I went to Wimbledon at times because Saltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn't. The Pudneys, who had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a horrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the smoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed heath. His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the crackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and bruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic. If he wasn't barefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod. These were the things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in silence, talked about when we didn't speak. When we spoke it was only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom he had brought out the other Sunday. I could see that this presentation had been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion of showing confidence in a new relation. [...] "She likes me--she likes me": her native humility exulted in that measure of success. We all knew for ourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy she was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.|$|E
60|$|A huge hand {{jerked the}} window open and caught Carl by the hair. Two wild faces <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> six inches apart.|$|R

6000|$|For a {{while we}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> thus, {{discovering}} <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> souls. [...] "Sign," [...] he said, shrugging his shoulders, [...] "the light dies." ...|$|R

The two women <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> frozen {{in the middle of the}} street. Mariâ€™s mother walks off, leaving the family to walk the other way.|$|E
