The challenge of doing this becomes obvious: the number of neurons comprising the brain easily ranges into the billions in more highly evolved organisms. The human cerebral cortex alone contains {{on the order of}} 1010 neurons linked by 1014 synaptic connections. By comparison, the number of base-pairs in a human genome is 3×109. A few of the main challenges of {{building a}} human connectome at the microscale today include: (1) data collection would take years given current technology; (2) machine vision tools to annotate the data remain in their infancy, and are inadequate; and (3) neither theory nor algorithms are readily available for the analysis of the resulting brain-graphs. To address the data collection issues, several groups are building high-throughput serial electron microscopes (Kasthuri et al., 2009; Bock et al. 2011). To address the machine-vision and image-processing issues, the Open Connectome Project is alg-sourcing (algorithm outsourcing) this hurdle.

40|$|In VLSI circuit design, graph {{algorithms}} {{are widely}} used and graph structure can model many problems. As technology continues to scale into nanometer design, the effects of process variation become more crucial and design parameters also change. Hence, taking stochastic variations into account, probability distributions are used as edge weights to form <b>statistical</b> <b>graph</b> structures. General applications in VLSI circuit design, such as timing analysis, buffer insertion, and maze routing, can be formulated as shortest path problems using a <b>statistical</b> <b>graph</b> model. The solution of any such graph problem will surely have a statistical distribution for its cost function value. The mean and variance, square of standard deviation, values are used {{as a pair of}} weight values on a graph to represent the stochastic distribution on each edge. For the stochastic shortest path problem, we observe that the objective functions can be formulated using mean and standard deviation values of the resulting probability distribution and general cost functions are nonlinear. To solve for the nonlinear cost function, we intentionally insert a constraint on the variance. Several candidate paths will be achieved by varying the bound value on the constraint. With fixed bound value, the Lagrangian relaxation method is applied to find the feasible solution to the constrained shortest path problem. During Lagrangian relaxation, a feasible solution close to the optimal is achieved through subgradient optimization. Among the candidate paths obtained, the best solution becomes the ultimate solution of our algorithm for the original cost function under parameter variation. The algorithm presented in this work can handle any graph structures, arbitrary edge weight distributions and general cost functions...|$|E

30|$|While {{empirical}} Neuroscience (section Neuroscience) {{deals with}} measuring and functionally interpreting connectivity on many scales, {{the aspects of}} Computational Neuroscience, which we address here, deal with structure-function relationships on a more abstract, aggregated level. Generic models of network topology, as well as simple abstract models of the dynamical units, play an important role. In Computational Neuroscience the idea of relating network architecture with dynamics and, consequently, function has long been explored (e.g., Bullmore and Sporns 2009, 2012; Damicelli et al., 2017; Deco et al., 2011). On the level of network architecture, a particularly fruitful approach has been to compare empirically observed networks with random graphs. The field of <b>statistical</b> <b>graph</b> theory where properties of random graphs are explored, is fundamentally linked to the Erdös-Rényi model of the late 1950 s (Erdös and Rényi, 1959). The field was revolutionized in the late 1990 s by the publication of two further models of random graphs: a model of small-world graphs (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) (uniting high local clustering with short average distances between nodes) and a model of random graphs with a broad (power-law shaped) degree distribution (Barabasi and Albert, 1999).|$|E

40|$|One {{approach}} to studying the system-wide organization of biochemistry {{is to use}} <b>statistical</b> <b>graph</b> theory.

Different definitions encode different information about the reaction system. In this paper we evaluate four different graph representations of metabolism, applied to data from different organisms and databases. The graph representations are evaluated by comparing the overlap between clusters (network modules) and annotated functions, and also by comparing the set of identified currency metabolites with those that other authors have identified using qualitative biological arguments. We find that a "substance network," where all metabolites participating in a reaction are connected, is relatively better than others, evaluated both with respect to the functional overlap between modules and functions and to the number and identity of identified currency metabolites...|$|E

Vertices may represent either chemical substances, or reactions, or both. A common practice in the analysis of metabolic networks is to preprocess the network by deleting so called currency metabolites — abundant molecular species that react with a large number of metabolites. One of several reasons to do this is that they do not put any constraint on the reactions, and thus do not give much information of the higher order functionality of the system. In this paper we evaluate different network representations of metabolism and describe their structure with respect to both modularity and currency metabolites. We find that a “substance network, ” where all metabolites participating in a reaction are connected, is a good trade-off between high functional overlap (between network modules and observed functions) and a reasonable number of currency metabolites.
