6000|$|... 'And why {{all this}} concealment?' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> her voice rising, as she vainly endeavoured {{to control her}} feelings, {{whatever}} they were.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose you}} heard the other news that arrived in town to-day, m'm?' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again.</b> 'Lord Mountclere {{is going to be}} married to-morrow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But there's one thing," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> after pausing a few minutes. [...] "I can't {{keep any}} accounts. I {{can not even}} write my name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Which room {{shall we}} do first?' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> turning <b>again</b> to Birkin, with the same gaiety, now {{she was going to}} DO {{something}} with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course, I saw {{you were}} a cowboy," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{dimpling}} <b>again.</b> [...] "Those enormous spurs you wear! I wondered how you could walk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is dreadful, indeed," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{bursting}} <b>again</b> into tears. [...] "To {{think of}} the great emperor being dead! What horrors and misfortunes have befallen us! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, when I came down," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> in that precise demure tone, [...] "when I came down--into {{the garden}} Captain Anthony misunderstood--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stupendous!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> for she {{was fond}} of repeating {{favourite}} words. [...] "What a wondrous race must have been those Egyptian kings of old!" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a little}} while <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> 'Ah, now I must part with you. Here comes Death. Now I must close your eyes.' And she did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't say I'm sorry!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{laughing}} <b>again.</b> [...] "But I am {{very glad}} to have seen you. I always wondered about you. You are a curiosity." ...|$|R
60|$|Anne's tender bosom heaved, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nothing, and <b>again</b> became {{absorbed in}} contemplation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{struggling}} <b>again</b> {{to speak}} firmly; [...] "and {{that is the}} very thing. You kept your allegiance to the bright, tall, walking, active girl, {{and it would be}} a shame in the scorched cripple to claim it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Charley," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "it needn't go on {{any longer}} than you wish. I don't want it to. I only want you to love me now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give it up, papa," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{jumping from}} {{his knees and}} {{standing}} on her feet before him, looking boldly into his face; [...] "give it up, papa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "will {{you give}} me ten days, that is, until Christmas Day? If nothing happens between this and then I will marry Mr. Edward Cossey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Not for {{the world}} would I venture where a shark might be,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and shuddered <b>again.</b> 'They are horrible! Horrible!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must excuse me," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{blushing}} <b>again.</b> [...] "I did {{not mean}} to wound your feelings as a Catholic. I have been very bold and intrusive. I ought to have remembered that people of your church have different ideas--that the saints"-- ...|$|R
60|$|Gudruda smiled, and, taking great Whitefire in her hand, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> {{the words}} <b>again,</b> and, in pledge of them, kissed the bright blade.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you foolish Alice!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "how can {{you learn}} lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for you, and no room {{at all for}} any lesson-books!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, we must trust ter luck,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> 'p'raps somethin' 'll 'appen soon, an' everythin' 'll {{come right}} in the end--when we gets four balls of worsted for a penny.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have pity upon me, traveler," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "I am {{dying of}} hunger, as you see, {{and three days}} have I been here {{and no one has}} given me anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't git the hoffer twice," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{sitting down}} <b>again.</b> [...] "Now, Liz, let's 'ave another cup, an' don't spare the sugar." ...|$|R
6000|$|The nurse hesitated. [...] "Not {{a pretty}} name, like yours," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and hesitated <b>again.</b> [...] "Call me 'Mercy Merrick,'" [...] she added, after a moment's consideration.|$|R
60|$|Peveril made {{no farther}} {{opposition}} to an arrangement, which in truth the moderate {{state of his}} own finances rendered almost indispensable, unless with his father's assistance; and the Countess put into his hand bills of exchange {{to the amount of}} two hundred pounds, upon a merchant in the city. She then dismissed Julian for the space of an hour; after which, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> must <b>again</b> require his presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's impossible," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{after her}} first flash hope. [...] "I haven't a fit dress to wear--I've nothing at all but my black {{cashmere}} and it is three years old." ...|$|E
6000|$|The strained, {{resigned}} look {{returned to}} Sue's {{face when she}} was alone. [...] "I must do it--I must! I must drink to the dregs!" [...] she whispered. [...] "Richard!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> more coldly this time. She {{was quite}} unable to {{understand}} this attitude of his. She was the injured party. It was she, not he who had trusted and been betrayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} want the {{carriage}} to-night," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and when <b>again</b> alone, she sat down and, burying {{her face in her}} alabaster arms, for a long time remained motionless.|$|R
50|$|Revolt. <b>She</b> <b>Said.</b> Revolt <b>Again</b> is a play by Alice Birch. It {{deals with}} the topics of rape culture, {{sometimes}} allegorically discussed as trespassing, and body shaming. Societal expectations towards women are displayed and broken, while the gender bias of language is being explored. Most characters do not have names and it is completely up to the reader to imagine the characters behind the written words. It {{is not clear whether}} certain characters reoccur during the play or not. Revolt. <b>She</b> <b>Said.</b> Revolt <b>Again.</b> has been staged independently from the other Midsummer Mischief-plays at the Latitude Festival 2014 and the Soho Repertory Theatre, New York, during the spring of 2016 and has in that context been reviewed by newspapers like The New York Times, The New Yorker, or The Village Voice, but also by magazines and websites like Time Out New York or Slate.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{reflected}} a little; after which, with a smile, [...] "You don't {{wash your hands}} then!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> After which <b>again</b> <b>she</b> added in another tone: [...] "You can't--you're too much interested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fear nothing," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{but next}} second I was never more full {{of fear in}} my life, for we were {{whirling}} downwards at a speed {{that would have made}} an American elevator attendant turn pale.|$|E
6000|$|Bertha resented this tone. [...] "No, we've got to go. Glad to {{have met}} you." [...] She nodded towards {{the men who had}} risen. [...] "Much obliged," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> to Moss. [...] "I'll send for them things to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis done, Wycherly," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>again</b> {{looking over}} the cliff; [...] "shall I throw you down {{one end of the}} rope?--but, alas! I have not {{strength}} to raise you; and Sir Wycherly and father seem unable to assist me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> at once <b>again.</b> [...] "I am {{not really}} afraid of love," [...] {{she whispered to}} him. [...] "You have made me so happy that I am afraid of nothing." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{want you}} to do {{something}} for me", <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and unexpectedly laughed. [...] "I want," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and laughed <b>again.</b> <b>She</b> put her hand over her mouth and said with a straight face, [...] "I {{want you to}} take me to your leader." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Except {{the news}} of his death," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> sitting down <b>again,</b> with the mockery of a smile just {{hovering}} on her cruel lips, and the furtive light of hatred lurking deep in her steady eyes.|$|R
