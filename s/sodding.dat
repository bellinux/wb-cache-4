2500|$|In 1971, {{the natural}} grass field was removed, and AstroTurf was installed, {{compliments}} of a donation by Lou Fisher in dedication to fellow football player Joseph Campanella. A plaque {{was placed on}} the southeast corner in memory of Campanella. In 1979, the surface was replaced with Superturf. In 1990, natural grass made its return to the Horseshoe, a special grass called [...] "Prescription Athletic Turf." [...] New field designs were put in place for the 1992 season and existed through the 2006 season. During that last season problems with the natural grass began to arise. After serious damage to the field during use in the spring of 2006, the field never recovered and had to be resodded. That grass never took root because of bad weather, and the university was forced to resod the field again only three weeks after the old sod was laid. The university spent approximately $150,000 to perform both <b>soddings.</b> OSU replaced the natural grass with FieldTurf for the 2007 season. This new artificial turf looks and feels like real grass but requires minimal upkeep.|$|R

One of Pauline's most notable feuds is with her youngest son Martin's wife, Sonia. Animosity between the characters begins in 2000, when Sonia gives birth to Pauline's grandchild and decides to give the baby Chloe (later renamed Rebecca) up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort [...] "YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!" [...] The feuding over Chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline {{is shown to}} visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin's wishes, and then, following Sonia's affair with Naomi Julien, Pauline refuses to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regains custody. Critic for The Guardian, Grace Dent, commented [...] "At one point, you couldn't move around Walford for hitmen and gangsters, but now they've all been written out... leaving Pauline Fowler to reign the square like <b>sodding</b> Pablo Escobar in a sky-blue tabard and ski-pants, decreeing who can see their own kids, who can drink where and what everyone's eating in the cafe so as they won't spoil their teas.

An industrial building opened in 1914, allowing for more jobs for patients than just manual labor jobs in farming or groundworks. It is a widely popular belief during this time that putting the insane to work in certain circumstances is beneficial both to the patient and the institution. Those who are chronically ill, restless in the day and night are thought to be aided in their general well-being by working out some of the over supply of blood to the brain.

By 1843 a report declared that 'the chief part of the draining, forming and <b>sodding</b> of the road from Glenamoy to Portacloy has been executed'(Ballina Advertiser, 10 March 1843) but by 1845 the road was still far from completed. Eventually in 1846, it was declared completed. There were no bridges on the road. At Muingnabo, the river bed was paved at a ford and remained that way until 1886 when the Annie Brady Bridge was erected. During the Irish Famine and its aftermath, emigration {{was a way of}} life from this area. The emigrant and their family parted at this river ford, most never to meet again - 'here indeed were witnessed, scenes of lamentation almost as bad as death, for in most cases in those days it meant separation forever, a living death. Friends and exiles alike carried the painful remembrance of the sad parting' (Corduff, I.F.C. Ms.1242 p. 438). Annie Brady was the wife of the Inspector of Fisheries for the area who witnessed these sad partings and the difficulty in crossing the ford. She raised money to build a bridge at the site, so that the poor of Erris could travel further with their loved ones. In 1933, a flood carried away the Annie Brady Bridge but it was replaced and is still there today.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is an emerging field that offers novel and unmatched potential medical therapies and treatments. While the vast aim of tissue engineering endeavors {{is to provide}} clinically implantable constructs, secondary applications {{have been developed to}} utilize tissue-engineered constructs for in-vitro evaluation of devices and therapies. Specifically, in-vitro blood vessel mimics (BVM) have been developed to create a bench-top blood vessel model using human cells {{that can be used to}} test and evaluate vascular disease treatments and intravascular devices. Previous BVM work has used fat derived human microvascular endothelial cells (EC) sodded on an ePTFE scaffold. To create a more physiologically accurate model, a dual layer of large vessel endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMC) on an ePTFE tube is investigated throughout this thesis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMC) were chosen as the large vessel cell types and cultivated according to standard procedures. Before dual <b>sodding,</b> <b>sodding</b> density experiments with HUVSMC were performed to determine the number of cells required to create a confluent cell layer. HUVSMC sodded by trans-luminal pressure at densities ranging from 3. 5 x 10 ^ 5 cells/cm^ 2 to 1. 0 x 10 ^ 6 cells/cm^ 2 were run for one day to observe luminal coverage. After determining the desirable range for HUVSMC <b>sodding,</b> HUVSMC experiments with 5. 0 x 10 ^ 5 cells/cm^ 2 and 7. 5 x 10 ^ 5 cells/cm^ 2 were run over seven days to evaluate progression of the graft over time. Histology and SEM methods were used for analysis. A HUVEC study was next conducted over 7 days to confirm that the large vessel endothelial cell could be sodded and sustained on ePTFE in-vitro. Next, dual <b>sodding</b> was performed by pressure <b>sodding</b> HUVSMC at 7. 5 x 10 ^ 5 cells/cm^ 2 followed by trans-luminal flow for 30 minutes. HUVECs were subsequently trans-luminally pressure sodded at 5. 0 x 10 ^ 5 cells/cm^ 2 followed by an additional 30 minutes of trans-luminal flow; perfusion flow began following the final 30 minutes of trans-luminal flow. Experiments for the dual layered grafts were run for both one and seven days to evaluate and develop the dual <b>sodding</b> protocol as well as observe the co-culture over time. Analysis of the dual layered grafts was performed by SEM, histology, and fluorescence microscopy. HUVECs were incubated with Cell Tracker™ prior to dual <b>sodding</b> and both cell types with bisbenzimide after graft harvest to attempt to distinguish between cell types. Results from the thesis illustrate that large vessel smooth muscle and endothelial cells can be sodded onto ePTFE scaffolds and sustained within the in-vitro BVM system for up to 7 days. Furthermore, cost analysis demonstrates that the addition of a smooth muscle cell layer adds minimal costs to the BVM system. In conclusion, the studies contained within this thesis culminate in a protocol for the dual <b>sodding</b> of smooth muscle and endothelial cells with the aim of creating a physiologically representative co-culture blood vessel mimic...|$|E
