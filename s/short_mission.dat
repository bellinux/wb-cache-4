500|$|Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer {{highlighted}} positively {{the first}} part of the mission. He remarked the game [...] " [...] a decent job of allowing you to feel like you're being stealthy as you negotiate your way past guards, usually by looking around for not-very-hidden alternate routes." [...] However, he criticized the final two thirds for being very linear and repetitive, and also reacted negatively to the game's insistence on having to fight solo almost the entire time. He explained that Mass Effect 2 is a squad game, where players [...] " [...] fluid team strategy to cope with different situations", but fighting solo means that players [...] "have to deal with every encounter in the exact same way." [...] Brad Gallaway, reviewer of GameCritics, concluded that the relatively <b>short</b> <b>mission</b> and included extras were not enough to justify the pack's price tag. [...] "Mass Effect 2: Arrival" [...] was nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content) at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to [...]|$|E

500|$|When Sørli came to Stockholm in January 1944 he {{took over}} for Gjems-Onstad, while Gjems-Onstad was {{to take over the}} {{leadership}} of Lark as well as to reorganise Milorg. Gjems-Onstad also founded the propaganda organisation Durham when he came back to Trondheim in March 1944. Lark and Durham were to be kept completely separate, with Gjems-Onstad as their only mutual connection. Durham's mission was to influence the moral of the enemy, mainly through distributing brochures (an estimated 115,000 copies in total) and posters (an estimated 257,000), while also to cause irritation by minor sabotage. The brochures were chiefly distributed in the enemy's quarters, and the posters were put up throughout Trondheim. Members of the group also tore down Nazi posters, sabotaged German vehicles, threw stink bombs into restaurants and cinemas, and applied itching powder—notably in condoms for sale to German soldiers. Sabotage on a bigger scale had to be authorised from London, and was largely discouraged as it would risk unnecessary German reprisals. Gjems-Onstad reported back in Stockholm at the end of June. Eager to bring supplies to Trondheim, he and Sørli soon decided to transport propaganda material, handguns and explosives to the Norwegian border. After finding a lost resistance member in the mountains, Gjems-Onstad joined a course in Alby near Stockholm where he worked as instructor in [...] "silent killing" [...] for a month. He went for a <b>short</b> <b>mission</b> to Trondheim in July in order to insert Egil Løkse as Lark's new radio operator there.|$|E

Promoted Brigadier-General in 1803, he commanded Grande Armée troops during the Battle of Ulm. After leading a successful attack on Günzburg, [...] Sébastiani followed the Austrians into Moravia (1805), having been promoted Général de division after the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, where he was wounded.|$|E

[...] In January, 1923, Anderson developed appendicitis and died on January 6 after an operation for the malady when he developed peritonitis. [...] Speakers at his funeral included Heber J.

50|$|Due to {{the much}} higher {{temperatures}} achievable by the gaseous core design, it can deliver higher specific impulse and thrust {{than most other}} conventional nuclear designs.
