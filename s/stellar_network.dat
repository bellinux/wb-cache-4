40|$|The <b>STELLAR</b> <b>Network</b> of Excellence brings {{together}} European researchers from different professional backgrounds to promote {{research in the}} field of technology enhanced learning (TEL). A central objective of the <b>STELLAR</b> <b>Network</b> is to identify grand research challenges to be addressed by TEL in the near future. The STELLAR Delphi Study, which is conducted as part of Work Package 1, serves as an instrument to achieve this objective. By conducting several rounds of expert surveys, the STELLAR Delphi study consolidates the expertise of researchers and stakeholders from both within STELLAR and external to STELLAR and thus enables us to identify important research themes and trends within TEL. The insights gained through the Delphi study will enable STELLAR to formulate recommendations for future research programs and to assist in reducing the fragmentation in the multidisciplinary field of TEL. For the 1 st Delphi round, we conducted a STELLAR‐internal online expert survey with a total of 41 participants. The survey aimed at getting a first overview of emerging trends in TEL that could be further evaluated in the 2 nd Delphi round. The survey consisted of open‐ended questions regarding important research topics and developments in the past few years, recommendations for future research programs, the experts' personal opinions on standards for TEL research and visionary statements about future learning scenarios.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Stellar</b> Oscillations <b>Network</b> Group (SONG) {{seeks to}} study p-mode (acoustic) {{oscillations}} in solar type stars. These are difficult phenomena to detect {{due to the}} limited amplitude of the oscillations in integrated light. Success will require continuous observing sessions over many pulsation cycles, preferably with multiple telescopes staggered in longitude, similar to the GONG project. Such oscillations are best detected as a beat frequency relative to some very regular inertial observing cadence. The phase of the cadence must be maintained, both between widely separated telescopes and between observing sessions that may be separated by months. We discuss techniques to improve the observing efficiency {{and the likelihood of}} detection. Precisely identical data handling and reduction steps for tens or hundreds of thousands of spectra are critical to success. 1...|$|R
