40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the National Center for Engineering and Technology Education in 2004, educators and researchers have struggled to identify the necessary components of a “good” <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> challenge for high school students. In reading and analyzing the position papers on <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> many themes emerged that may begin to form a narrative for <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> in a high school setting. Before educators can provide a framework for <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> in STEM courses, four questions need to be answered: (a) To what degree should <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> challenges be open-ended or well-structured? (b) What are the relationships between <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> experiences and standards –based instruction in STEM courses? (c) What is an effective sequencing of age-appropriate <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> challenges? and (d) To what extent should engineering habits of thought and action be employed in resolving the challenges? (Householder, 2011) Collectively, the six position papers (Carr 2 ̆ 6 Strobel, 2011; Eisenkraft, 2011; Hynes et al, 2011; Jonassen, 2011, Schunn, 2011; Sneider, 2011) provide an intriguing foundation for answering these questions and forming a framework for <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> in high school STEM courses. This synthesis paper discusses the most pervasive themes of the papers and provides a narrative for answering the question, “What are the requirements for a good <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> challenge?” The following emergent themes provide some guidance to finding answers for that question: <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> in the science curriculum; assessing the <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> experience; sequencing the <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> experiences; and choosing <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> challenges. By addressing these areas of contention, the education community can begin to lay the curricular and pedagogical groundwork needed to provide successful engineering experiences for high school students...|$|R

40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{study examined the}} current status of technology education teacher practices with respect to <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> Participants were drawn from the current International Technology Education Association (ITEA) high school teacher membership database. A survey instrument gathered data {{about the extent to which}} <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> concepts are incorporated into the curriculum content, and assessment practices employed by secondary technology educators. Moreover, the survey identified challenges faced by technology educators when seeking to implement <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> Current curriculum content that addresses <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> concepts consisted of the following seven subsets: (a) <b>engineering</b> <b>design,</b> (b) <b>engineering</b> analysis, (c) application of <b>engineering</b> <b>design,</b> (d) <b>engineering</b> communication, (e) <b>design</b> thinking, (f) <b>engineering</b> and human values, and (g) engineering science.

30|$|The {{method that}} {{engineers}} use {{to solve problems}} {{is often referred to}} as <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> and relies upon the use of heuristics (Koen 2003). <b>Engineering</b> <b>design</b> indeed is the common denominator across all engineered products and is what can be used to identify the presence of engineering activity (Koen 1985). Like the diversity among engineered artifacts, the <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> process is complexly varied in the ways it is performed. As Bucciarelli (1994) pointed out, the <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> process does not take one singular form. Pahl et al. (2007) also show that the <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> process is a complex landscape of approaches, stages, principles, purposes, and traditions. Design is not stagnate, absolute, guaranteed, or deterministic. Rather, it is a dynamic, complex process that is a part of a greater feedback loop used by the engineer to know engineering and construct new engineering knowledge. However, across any variation of the <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> process, the characterization remains the same. <b>Engineering</b> <b>design</b> is systematic, iterative, purposeful, creative, and social (ABET 2014; Bucciarelli 2003; Cross 2008).|$|R

40|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>design</b> {{research}} manifests as {{a platform}} for exploration, description, arrangement, rationalization, and application of design knowledge. What we can see when {{we are looking at}} the research into <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> is an almost chaotically fragmented picture. Is it possible to have a holistic view on the contents and internal relationships of <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> research? This paper considers teleology, a reflection of a branch of philosophical speculations, as the doctrine of ordering knowledge of <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> and structuring <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> research accordingly. Teleology explains that the ultimate reason behind design is to sustain human existence and well being by virtual creation of artifacts and services for society. To this end, knowledge of engineering research is supposed to be transferred from the platform of scientific/theoretical exploration and comprehension to the platform of technical/pragmatic application. This implies a natural streaming of knowledge of <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> In order to make the teleological explanation operational, a framework of reasoning has been constructed by adopting the analogy of the source, channel and sink of a stream. To represent the source, channel and sink categories of <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> knowledge, the author inaugurated nine categories in the framework. It has been hypothesized that the introduced categories are equally valid for research in <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> {{as well as for the}} knowledge of <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> Within each category, research domains and trajectories have been defined. The proposed teleology-based framework lends itself to a better understanding of the disciplinary articulation and intrinsic relationships of <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> research. It is hoped, among other things, to form a basis for a shared understanding, to make the influence of decisions on research programs more transparent, as well as to facilitate organizing subject materials for various design courses...|$|R

However, minimal studies have documented students 2 ̆ 7 conceptions within the context of <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> Thus, the first chapter of this thesis outlines the steps taken to develop a draw-and-explain item that elicited students 2 ̆ 7 mental models regarding the cause of the four seasons after finishing an <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> task.
