25|$|In 969 the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz sent against Egypt {{his best}} general Jawhar al-Rumi, {{who led a}} Kotama Berber army. Egypt then was {{nominally}} under the Abbasid Caliphate, yet since 856 Egypt had been ruled by Turks, now by the Turkish Ikhshidid dynasty; however, actual control had passed into the <b>strong</b> <b>hands</b> of the Ethiopian eunuch Abu-l-Misk Kafur for 22 years. At Kafur's death in 968, Egypt's leadership became weak and confused. The Fatimids in Ifriqiya, carefully observing these conditions in Misr (Egypt), ceased the opportunity to conquer.|$|E
25|$|The newborn {{marsupial}} {{uses its}} forelimbs (with relatively <b>strong</b> <b>hands)</b> {{to climb to}} a nipple, which is usually in a pouch on the mother's belly. The mother feeds the baby by contracting muscles over her mammary glands, as the baby is too weak to suck. The newborn marsupial's need to use its forelimbs in climbing to the nipple was historically thought to have restricted metatherian evolution, as {{it was assumed that}} the forelimb couldn't become specialised intro structures like wings, hooves or flippers. However, several bandicoots, most notably the pig-footed bandicoot, have true hooves similar to those of placental ungulates, and several marsupial gliders have evolved.|$|E
500|$|Standing 188cm, Johnston had {{a smooth}} ten-pace {{approach}} to the wicket, with an idiosyncratic dip of his head before the instant of delivery. He had success on moist English pitches, with deliveries from over the wicket because of the increased chances of leg before wicket decisions and to induce edges from balls angling across the batsmen. His stock ball swung into the right-hander, but he mixed this with an away swinger. The late swing in flight which generated the batsman's uncertainty over {{the direction in which}} the ball would move was responsible for the majority of Johnston's wickets in England. Although his pace was lower than that generated by Lindwall or Miller, he was noted for his accuracy and ability to revert to spin bowling on sticky wickets. Nevertheless, his casual run-up belied a deceptive pace. He possessed <b>strong</b> <b>hands,</b> attributed to his milking of the family's cattle herd. Johnston was an economical bowler, conceding only 2.07 runs per over. He was known for his elbow movement and flailing arms during his delivery action, with one commentator noting [...] "one of these days an umpire will get a poke in the eye". Johnston also had a reputation of visibly enjoying himself on field, putting his hand on his hips and grinning, regardless of the result of his delivery. According to teammate Alan Walker, Johnston bowled at least as many bouncers as his colleagues, but because of his happy nature, observers thought that he eschewed the short ball.|$|E

He was bound in teasing Lennie since he was young. He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as [...] "small and quick," [...] every part of him being [...] "defined," [...] with small <b>strong</b> <b>hands</b> on slender arms.

2500|$|As a player, Cumming won the Canadian Open in 1905 (score 148) and was runner-up four times. He was ninth at the U.S. Open at Myopia Hunt Club in 1905 and {{the next}} week won a 36-hole event at The Country Club, near Boston. He had great success in four-ball matches with George Lyon. In 1913 he partnered with Percy Barrett in a well-publicized match versus Harry Vardon and Ted Ray. He was {{described}} as a shorter hitter with a pleasant-looking swing. [...] He had <b>strong</b> <b>hands</b> and was a solid performer in all aspects of the game.|$|E

[...] Crane also described McGuire's hands:"His big, brawny, <b>strong</b> <b>hands,</b> now grotesquely disfigured by the continuous battering {{they have received}} from the viciously wicked inshoots, curves, slants and benders of the speediest pitchers known in {{the long history of}} the game, have acted as an unflinchable barrier to the accumulation of momentum that if concentrated would have an irresistible force capable of crushing a battleship or of pulverizing a backstop construction of Harveyized steel armor plate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ablett {{continued}} his dominance {{as a full}} forward in 1994 and 1995 by winning the Coleman medal in each year. Ablett is the only player in VFL/AFL history to kick 100 goals and win the Coleman Medal in three successive seasons. [...] In addition to his explosive pace and skills, Ablett was also an accomplished aerialist with <b>strong</b> <b>hands.</b> A highlight was the 1994 Mark of the Year over Collingwood's Gary Pert on Mothers' Day at the MCG, a mark which is captured in Jamie Cooper's painting the Game That Made Australia, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport. There is still debate over whether he had enough control of the ball to be paid a mark.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tale of the}} rex Nemorensis {{appears in}} a number of ancient sources. [...] Ovid gives a poetic account of the priesthood of Nemi in his Fasti, Book 3 (on the month of March), noting that the lake of Nemi was [...] "sacred to antique religion", and that the priest who dwelt there [...] "holds his reign by <b>strong</b> <b>hands</b> and fleet feet, and dies {{according}} to the example he set himself." [...] The Latin name of the priesthood is given by Suetonius: [...] "He [...] caused the rex Nemorensis, who had held his priesthood for many years, to be supplanted by a stronger adversary." [...] That same passage indicates that {{by the time of the}} early Principate, the custom of succession in the office by combat had become subject to outside control.|$|E
