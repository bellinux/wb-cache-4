40|$|Thesis (MSc (Physics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. External cavity diode lasers {{are used}} {{increasingly}} {{as sources of}} light in applications ranging from industrial photonic systems to basic laboratory research on the interaction of light and atoms. External cavity diode lasers offer more stable output frequency and narrow spectral bandwidth than the typical free-running diode lasers. These characteristics are achieved by exploiting the sensitivity of diode lasers to external optical feedback. In this study the design and development of an external cavity diode laser system for future applications in spectroscopy and laser cooling of rubidium atoms is presented. The external cavity diode laser including mechanical components and control electronics {{of the system is}} developed from basic components. The system uses frequency selective optical feedback from a diffraction grating in a Littrow configuration to provide collimated, narrow-band, frequency tunable light near 780 nm. The external cavity diode laser is designed to increase the mode-hop-free frequency tuning range, and allow accurate frequency tuning and stabilisation. A low-noise current source and a temperature controller for thermal stability were developed as part of the system since the output frequency changes with temperature and current. The temperature controller is optimised experimentally for the thermal characteristics of the external cavity. An electronic sidelock <b>servo</b> <b>circuit</b> for frequency locking of the external cavity diode laser to an external reference for long term frequency stabilisation is proposed and discussed. The <b>servo</b> <b>circuit</b> electrically controls the grating tilt and the current through the diode laser in order to lock the frequency of the diode laser. The external cavity diode laser is optimised and characterised near 780 nm. Results obtained in this study indicate that the external cavity diode laser is suitable for future applications in spectroscopy and laser cooling of neutral rubidium atoms...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} bearing consists of levitating a shaft {{so that it}} is free to rotate about its axis. The {{magnetic bearing}} has the advantages of being very quiet work and very cleanliness because there is no mechanical friction or lubricants. The shaft has two permanent magnets attached to it. These two magnets determine a straight line rotation axis of the rotor shaft. The magnets are radially levitated and centered within a cavity by a passive permanent magnetic field in the adding stator housing assembly. The levitation and centering of the shaft axially is stabilized by a closed loop electronic <b>servo</b> <b>circuit</b> that regulates an electromagnetic field in the stator housing that pushes and pulls on the shaft magnets. The rotor weight can be between one gram and forty five thousand, four hundred grams. In 1985, the first magnetic bearing was developed that it had used to applications of gas turbines and other compressors.

In the {{presented}} study a {{diode laser}} was characterised {{and used for}} spec- troscopy, measuring the resonance lines of atomic rubidium. The characteristics of diode lasers and external cavity diode lasers (ECDL) {{for the purposes of}} ab- sorption spectroscopy were investigated and an experimental setup for tunable diode laser spectroscopy using an ECDL was developed. In external cavity diode lasers, the advantages of low cost, small size and e ciency of a diode laser is combined with tunability and a narrow frequency bandwidth.

This {{can be done by}} replaying a sound waveform at a different speed than it was recorded. It could be accomplished on an early reel-to-reel tape recorder by changing the diameter of the capstan drive shaft, or using a different motor. As technologies improved later designs of motor speeds could be controlled by electronic <b>servo</b> system <b>circuits.</b> This arrangement using “vari-speed” capstan motors allowed the speed change to be achieved more simply. As for vinyl records, the same thing can be done;placing a finger on the turnable to give friction will retard it, while giving it a 'spin' can advance it.|$|R

40|$|To {{solve the}} {{problems}} of carrier leakage and DC offset in direct-conversion receiver (DCR) system, the paper proposed two kinds of improved technology to overcome the problems in DCR system. One is the RF carrier cancellation technology; the traditional cancellation technology based on lumped parameter filter can be easily influenced by distribution parameters, the improved circuits use a 3 [*]db bridge to realize a 180 -degree phase shifter, and the method can adapt to a wider range of RF frequency. Another is DC offset cancellation technique; a novel DC <b>servo</b> loop <b>circuit</b> is proposed to replace the traditional AC-coupled amplifier circuit.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 We have {{developed}} simple and inexpensive laser systems using grating-feedback diode lasers with electronic {{feedback to the}} injection current. These grating-feedback lasers can be continuously scanned up to 10 GHz and have a linewidth of 150 kHz. The three electronic frequency-stabilization systems we developed use polarization spectroscopy, etalon transmission and modified heterodyne signals as the frequency discriminators to drive an integrating <b>servo</b> control <b>circuit.</b> These laser systems are used for laser cooling and trapping of rubidium and atomic beam diagnostics. The rubidium D₂ line at 780 nm is a strong, cycling transition {{that can be used}} for laser cooling and trapping. We use chirped cooling and Zeeman-tuned cooling to slow atoms from a thermal atomic beam. These atoms are loaded into a two-dimensional magneto-optic trap, or funnel. Using a frequency offset of the trapping lasers, the atoms are ejected from the funnel at a controllable velocity. The diode laser systems we {{have developed}} are a central component of this rubidium atomic funnel. We will use the funnel's bright, cold atomic beam as a source for matter-wave interferometry.

The objective is to learn various types of control methods for the pick and place robotic arm for educational purpose uses. The 6 -DOF robot arm is controlled by a serial <b>servo</b> controller <b>circuit</b> board. The controller board utilizes a Atmega 328 microcontroller (Boot loaded with Arduino Diecimila Bootloader) from Atmel Corporation as the control system to control all the activities. The input sensors like potentiometers will send a the input signals to the microcontroller, then microcontroller will analyze the data accordingly and will send control signals to the output devices. This output signal basically turns ON or OFF the output devices such as servo motors. The servo controller board {{is connected to the}} serial port on a PC running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The ATMega 328 will be programmed to run robot arm sequences independently by help of a FT 232 RL breakout board. Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) is used to develop the arduino sketch. Various types of control methods have been implemented.

5000|$|Galvanometers (also called [...] "scanners" [...] or [...] "galvos")are {{computer-controlled}} electromagnetic {{devices that}} move mirrors {{mounted on the}} end of rotary shafts. The mirror reflects the laser beam to [...] "draw" [...] images. Galvanometers are typically identified by their speed of operation, measured in Kpps (kilo points per second). Available speeds include 8k, 12k, 20k, 30k, 35k, 50k, and 60k. The faster the galvanometers, the smoother and more flicker-free the projected image. Each galvanometer moves the beam in one plane, either X axis or Y axis. Placing the galvanometers close together at 90 degrees to each other allows full movement of the laser beam within a defined square area. The most useful specifications of a galvanometer pair for laser show use are the speed at which they can draw points, and the angle at which they achieve this speed. Galvanometers come in two main groups: open loop and closed loop. Closed loop, which is most common, means the galvanometer is controlled by a <b>servo</b> system—the control <b>circuit</b> uses a feedback signal generated by the mirror's motion to correct motion commands. An amplifier similar to an audio power amplifier drives the mirror.|$|R
40|$|A {{laser diode}} emits {{a narrow range}} of frequencies. However, drifts in {{frequency}} occur over time due to many factors like changes in laser temperature, current, mechanical vibrations in the apparatus, etc. These frequency drifts make the laser unsuitable for experiments that require high frequency stability. We have used an atomic transition in rubidium as a frequency reference and used Doppler free saturated spectroscopy to observe the reference peak. We have designed an electronic locking circuit that operates the diode laser at a specific frequency. It keeps the laser at that frequency {{for a long period}} of time with very few or no drifts.

It is much more compact with performance comparable to that of a commercial unit. It can be used in undergraduate and graduate optics laboratories where commercial units are cost prohibitive. The various components of the set-up are discussed, and the basic principles behind the function and operation of this versatile device are explained. We designed a <b>servo</b> loop filter <b>circuit,</b> which is used to stabilize the frequency of the laser to an atomic reference frequency.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of implementing field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in communication, military, space and high radiation environment applications, {{coupled with the}} increased accessibility of private individuals and researchers to launch satellites, {{has led to an}} increased interest in commercial off the shelf components. The metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) structures of FPGAs however, are sensitive to radiation effects which can lead to decreased reliability of the device. In order to successfully implement a FPGA based system in a radiation environment, such as on-board a satellite, the single event upset (SEU) and total ionizing dose (TID) characteristics of the device must first be established. This research experimentally determines a research procedure which could accurately determine the SEU cross sections and TID characteristics of various mitigation techniques as well as control circuits implemented in a ProASIC 3 A 3 P 1000 FPGA. To gain an understanding of the SEU effects of the implemented circuits, the test FPGA was irradiated by a 66 MeV proton beam at the iTemba LABS facility. Through means of irradiation, the SEU cross section of various communication, motor control and mitigation schemes circuits, induced by high energy proton strikes was investigated. The implementation of a full global triple modular redundancy (TMR) and a combination of TMR and a AND-OR multiplexer filter was found to most effectively mitigate SEUs in comparison to the other techniques. When comparing the communication and motor control circuits, the high frequency I 2 C and SPI circuits experienced a higher number of upsets when compared to a low frequency <b>servo</b> motor control <b>circuit.</b> To {{gain a better understanding of}} the absorbed dose effects, experimental TID testing was conducted by irradiating the test FPGA with a cobalt- 60 (Co- 60) source.
