50|$|<b>Screen</b> <b>scraping</b> is {{normally}} {{associated with the}} programmatic collection of visual data from a source, instead of parsing data as in Web scraping. Originally, <b>screen</b> <b>scraping</b> referred {{to the practice of}} reading text data from a computer display terminal's screen. This was generally done by reading the terminal's memory through its auxiliary port, or by connecting the terminal output port of one computer system to an input port on another. The term <b>screen</b> <b>scraping</b> is also commonly used to refer to the bidirectional exchange of data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to detect and {{genotype}} 16 different human papilloma virus (HPV) types simultaneously using a short fragment polymerase chain reaction (SPF) hybridization line probe assay (LiPA). 152 women who were referred to the gynecologist because of abnormal cervical smear underwent colposcopic examination and repeat cervical smear. In addition, the cervical scrapes were analyzed for the presence of HPV by a novel general HPV polymerase chain reaction assay followed by a single reaction genotyping assay allowing for a simultaneous detection and identification of 16 different HPV types. HPV DNA was detected in 38 % of normal follow-up cervical scrapes, 51 % of scrapes with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 78 % of scrapes with mild dysplasia (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), 86 % of scrapes with moderate dysplasia (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), and in 88 % of scrapes with severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. One case of invasive squamous cell carcinoma was positive for HPV 16. Overall, a single HPV type was detected in 56 % of HPV positive scrapes, with HPV 16 being the most common and accounting for 45 % of all single infections. Forty-four percent of the positive scrapes contained multiple HPV types, of which double infections prevailed. Follow-up results proved the reproducibility and reliability of SPF HPV LiPA. In conclusion, we have used and evaluated the SPF-HPV-LiPA system for the detection and genotyping of HPV infections. The combined detection-typing method proved to be sensitive, specific, simple, and fast, making mass <b>screening</b> of cervical <b>scrapes</b> accessible for routine practice and facilitating individual patient management...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} for the <b>screening</b> of cervical <b>scrapes</b> for human papillomavirus (HPV) were investigated by using filter in situ hybridization. Since integrated and episomal HPV can be found, cell lines containing viral DNA in an integrated form (HPV in CaSki) or in an episomal state (BK virus-induced hamster tumor cells) were used for optimization experiments. An increase in sensitivity was achieved by alkaline denaturation and neutralization before the specimens were spotted onto the membrane. This increase was 5 -fold for the episomal virus and 16 -fold for the integrated virus in the model system, as compared with other methods. To evaluate this method on clinical material, 1, 963 cervical <b>scrapes</b> were <b>screened</b> {{for the presence of}} HPV 6 / 11 and HPV 16. Nineteen scrapes were positive for HPV 6 / 11 or HPV 16; and in 1, 810 scrapes, no HPV 6 / 11 or HPV 16 could be detected by the modified filter in situ hybridization technique. Scrapes from which the interpretation of the modified filter in situ hybridization results were equivocal (n = 71, 3. 6 %) or in which positivity was detected for both HPV 6 / 11 and HPV 16 (n = 63, 3. 2 %) were further analyzed by the DNA dot spot technique. Eight scrapes with an equivocal result and only one scrape showing a double positivity by the modified filter in situ hybridization technique could be confirmed in the dot spot assay. In the total group 12 scrapes were positive for HPV 6 / 11 DNA, 15 were positive for HPV 16 DNA, and 1 was positive for both HPV 6 / 11 and HPV 16 DNA.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2000. Internationally, {{there is}} an {{increase}} in the need for safer environmental processes that can be applied to mining operations, especially on a small scale, where mercury amalgamation is the main process used for the recovery of free gold. An alternative, more environmentally acceptable, process called the Coal Gold Agglomeration (CGA) process has been investigated at the Cape Technikon. This paper explains the application of flotation as a means of separation for the CGA process. The CGA process is based on the recovery of hydrophobic gold particles from ore slurries into agglomerates formed from coal and oil. The agglomerates are separated from the slurry through <b>scraping,</b> <b>screening,</b> flotation or a combination of the aforementioned. They are then ashed to release the gold particles, after which it is smelted to form gold bullion. All components were contacted for fifty minutes after which a frother was added and after three minutes of conditioning, air, at a rate of one I/min per cell volume was introduced into the system. The addition of a collector (Potassium Amyl Xanthate) at the start of each run significantly improved gold recoveries. Preliminary experiments indicated that the use of baffles decreased the gold recoveries, which was concluded to be due to agglomerate breakage. The system was also found to be frother-selective and hence only DOW- 200 was used in subsequent experiments. A significant increase or decrease in the air addition rate both had a negative effect on the recoveries; therefore, the air addition rate was not altered during further tests. The use of tap water as opposed to distilled water decreased the attainable recoveries by less than five per cent. This was a very encouraging result, in terms of the practical implementation of the CGA process...|$|R

In many developing countries cervical cancer is still a major problem. Rwanda {{is one of the worst}} affected countries with an incidence of 49 / 100 000 women. In 2011 the Rwandan government made an ambitious effort to start fighting the disease by mass vaccinating all girls, and start a screening programme like those present in the developed world. The vaccinations seem to have been a success, but little information is available on the progress of the screening programme, and of Rwandan womensâ€™ attitudes to cervical cancer and <b>screening.</b> This study <b>scrapes</b> the surface of these questions. Purpose: To investigate the attitudes of Rwandan women to cervical cancer screening. Method: Using uestionnaires from an ongoing cohort study, the attitudes of two cohorts of HIV positive and negative Rwandan women were investigated regarding previous screening and reasons for having or not having participated in screening, comparing the two cohorts. Each cohort included 200 women. Result: 28. 5 % of the women in the HIV cohort and 6. 5 % of the women in the HIV negative cohort had been screened before, giving a 17. 5 % screening rate in the whole study population. The most frequent reason for previous screening was recommendation from a doctor, which was more common in the HIV cohort. The most common reason to never have screened was unawareness of screening possibility. Conclusion: Few women had been screened before, and the main reason for this was unawareness of the availability of screening. The most common reason for having been screened before was recommendation from a doctor. This points to continuous contact with healthcare being a beneficial factor in likeliness to screen.

50|$|The {{potential}} of the Internet to consolidate and manipulate information has a new application in data aggregation, also known as <b>screen</b> <b>scraping.</b> The Internet gives users the opportunity to consolidate their usernames and passwords, or PINs. Such consolidation enables consumers to access {{a wide variety of}} PIN-protected websites containing personal information by using one master PIN on a single website. Online account providers include financial institutions, stockbrokers, airline and frequent flyer and other reward programs, and e-mail accounts. Data aggregators can gather account or other information from designated websites by using account holders' PINs, and then making the users' account information available to them at a single website operated by the aggregator at an account holder's request. Aggregation services may be offered on a standalone basis or in conjunction with other financial services, such as portfolio tracking and bill payment provided by a specialized website, or as an additional service to augment the online presence of an enterprise established beyond the virtual world. Many established companies with an Internet presence appear to recognize the value of offering an aggregation service to enhance other web-based services and attract visitors. Offering a data aggregation service to a website may be attractive because of the potential that it will frequently draw users of the service to the hosting website.|$|E
