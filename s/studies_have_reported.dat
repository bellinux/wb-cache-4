5|$|Past <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> {{other social}} {{organizations}} in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been}} due to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> an age-related decline in {{dopamine}} synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., {{the number of}} receptors) in the brain.

The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
