25|$|The most {{apparent}} distinguishing factor between alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (ASH) and nonalcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (NASH) {{is a history}} of alcohol use or abuse. Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.|$|E
25|$|High-sensitivity C-reactive protein {{has been}} {{developed}} and used as a marker to predict coronary vascular diseases in metabolic syndrome, and it was recently used as a predictor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (<b>steatohepatitis)</b> in correlation with serum markers that indicated lipid and glucose metabolism. Fatty liver disease and <b>steatohepatitis</b> {{can be considered as}} manifestations of metabolic syndrome, indicative of abnormal energy storage as fat in ectopic distribution.|$|E
25|$|Non-alcoholic {{hepatitis}} {{is within}} the spectrum of non-alcoholic liver disease (NALD), which ranges in severity and reversibility from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (NASH) to cirrhosis to liver cancer, similar to the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
25|$|Non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (NASH). In NASH, fat {{builds up}} in the liver and {{eventually}} causes scar tissue. This type of hepatitis appears {{to be associated with}} obesity (40% of NASH patients) diabetes, protein malnutrition, coronary artery disease, and treatment with steroid medications. This disorder is similar in it signs to alcoholic liver disease, but the patient does not have an alcohol history. A biopsy is needed for diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause {{worldwide}} is viruses. Other causes include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (NASH). There are five main types of viral hepatitis: type A, B, C, D, and E. Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C are commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. Hepatitis D can only infect people already infected with hepatitis B.|$|E
25|$|Human 15-LOX-1 prefers {{linoleic}} acid over arachidonic acid as its primary substrate, oxygenating it at carbon 13 to form 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecaenoic acid (13-HpODE or 13(S)-HpODE) which may then be reduce to the corresponding hydroxy derivative, 13(S)-HODE or 13-HODE (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid). In addition to 13(S)-HpODE, non-human 15-LOX1 orthologs such as mouse 12/15-LOX and soybean 15-LOX metabolize {{linoleic acid}} to 9-hydroperoxy-10E, 12Z-octadecaenoic acid (9-HpODE or 9(S)-HpODE), which is rapidly converted to 9(S)-HODE (9-HODE) (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid)). 13(S)-HODE acts through Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the TRPV1 and human GPR132 receptors to stimulate {{a variety of}} responses related to monocyte maturation, lipid metabolism, and neuron activation (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid##Activities of 13-HODEs; 9(S)-HODE is a marker for diseases involving oxidative stress and may contribute to this disease {{as well as to}} pain perception and atherosclerosis (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid##Biological and clinical relevancy of 9-HODEs). The two HODEs can be further metabolized to their ketones, 13-oxo-9Z,11E-octadecaenoic acid and 9-oxo-10E, 12Z-octadecaenoic acid; these ketones have been implicated as biomarkers for and possible contributors to the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, <b>Steatohepatitis,</b> and other pathological conditions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Steatohepatitis</b> {{is seen in}} both {{alcoholic}} and non-alcoholic liver disease and {{is the culmination of}} a cascade of events that began with injury. [...] In the case of non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis,</b> this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit. [...] Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products [...] in the liver cells in a process called steatosis. This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect [...] as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response. [...] Overtime, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death. [...] These events mark the transition to <b>steatohepatitis</b> and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.|$|E
2500|$|However, since {{methionine}} is {{an essential}} amino acid, it cannot be entirely removed from animals' diets without disease or death occurring over time [...] For example, rats fed a diet without methionine developed <b>steatohepatitis</b> (fatty liver), anemia and lost two thirds of their body weight over 5 weeks. Administration of methionine ameliorated the pathological consequences of methionine deprivation.|$|E
2500|$|Non-alcoholic {{liver disease}} occurs {{in people with}} little or no history of alcohol use, and is instead {{strongly}} associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Over time, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis,</b> which additionally involves liver cell death, liver inflammation and possible fibrosis. Factors accelerating progression from NAFLD to NASH are obesity, older age, non-African American ethnicity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, higher ALT or AST level, higher AST/ALT ratio, low platelet count, and an [...]|$|E
2500|$|Non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (NASH) is {{projected}} to become the top reason for liver transplantation in the United States by the year 2020, supplanting chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C. [...] About 20–45% of the U.S. population have NAFLD and 6% have NASH. The estimated prevalence of NASH {{in the world is}} 3–5%. [...] Of NASH patients who develop cirrhosis, about 2% per year will likely progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. [...] Worldwide, the estimated prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma related to NAFLD is 15–30%. NASH is thought to be the primary cause of cirrhosis in approximately 25% of patients in the United States, representing 1–2% of the general population.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{find that}} 1) 9(S)-HODE (and 13(S)-HODE) levels are {{elevated}} in the plasma of older patients with early-stage cataracts compared to non-cataract subjects; 2) 9-HODE (and 13-HODE) are {{increased in the}} low density lipoproteins of patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy subjects {{as well as in}} the destructive but not normal bone tissue of the rheumatoid arthritic patients; 3) total HODEs (includes 9-HODE and 13-HODE stereoisomers) are higher in the plasma and liver of patients with hepatitis C and hepatitis B chronic viral infections {{as well as in the}} plasma and red blood cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy subjects; 4) 9-HODE and 9-oxoODE (as well as 13-HODE and 13-oxo-ODE) levels were elevated in the serum and/or pancreatic secretions of patients with pancreatitis compared to control subjects; 5) levels of the hydroperoxy precursors to 9-HODE and 13-HODE are elevated in the plasma and/or red blood cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephritis, non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis,</b> and alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> compared to healthy subjects. [...] These studies suggest that high levels of the HODEs may be useful to indicate the presence and progression of the cited diseases. [...] Since, however, the absolute values of HODEs found in different studies vary greatly, since HODE levels vary with dietary linoleic acid intake, since HODEs may form during the processing of tissues, and since abnormal HODE levels are not linked to a specific disease, the use of these metabolites as markers has not attained clinical usefulness. [...] HODE markers may find usefulness as markers of specific disease, type of disease, and/or progression of disease when combined with other disease markers.|$|E
2500|$|Oxidative {{stress in}} cells and tissues {{produces}} Free radical-induced and singlet oxygen-induced oxidations of linoleic acid {{to generate the}} various racemic mixtures of 9-HpODE and 9-HODE in non-enzymatic reactions that produce, or are suspected but not proven to produce, approximately equal amounts of their S and R stereoisomers. [...] These oxidations are credited with being the major contributors to 9-HODE and 13-HODE isomer production in tissues undergoing oxidative stress such as occurs in any tissue suffering inadequate blood flow, inflammation, or other serious insult, in liver <b>steatohepatitis,</b> in the atheroma plaques of cardiovascular disease, in nerve tissues of neurodegenerative diseases, and in the various tissues compromised by diabetes (see oxidative stress). [...] Free radical oxidation of linoleic acid produces racemic mixtures of 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE; singlet oxygen attack on linoleic acid produces (presumably) racemic mixtures of 9-HODE, 10-hydroxy-8E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-9Z-13-E-octadecadienoic acid. [...] Since free radical-induced and singlet oxygen-induced oxidations of linoleic acid produce a similar set of 13-HODE metabolites (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid), since both free radicals and singlet oxygen attack not only free linoleic acid but also linoleic acid bound to phospholipids, glycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids, and since free radical and singlet oxygen reactions may occur together, oxygen-stressed tissues often contain an array of free and lipid-bound 9-HODE and 13-HODE products. [...] For example, laboratory studies find that 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE (along with their 13-HODE counterparts) {{are found in the}} phospholipid and cholesterol components of low density lipoproteins that have been oxidized by human monocytes; the reaction appears due to the in situ free radical- and/or superoxide-induced oxidation of the lipoproteins.|$|E
50|$|Severe {{fatty liver}} is {{sometimes}} accompanied by inflammation, a situation {{referred to as}} <b>steatohepatitis.</b> Progression to alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (ASH) or non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (NASH) depends on the persistence or severity of the inciting cause. Pathological lesions in both conditions are similar. However, the extent of inflammatory response varies widely and does not always correlate with degree of fat accumulation. Steatosis (retention of lipid) and onset of <b>steatohepatitis</b> may represent successive stages in FLD progression.|$|E
50|$|Accumulation of fat {{may also}} be {{accompanied}} by a progressive inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), called <b>steatohepatitis.</b> By considering the contribution by alcohol, fatty liver may be termed alcoholic steatosis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the more severe forms as alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (part of alcoholic liver disease) and non-alcoholic <b>steatohepatitis</b> (NASH).|$|E
