Prediction results showed that, MLR model {{was easy to}} set up, but could not accurately describe steelmaking process and its results were unsatisfactory, while BPNN model got more accurate prediction results for end manganese content in converter based on proper selection of model structure, adequate training using sample data and then correct determination of the weights. According to the spot tests, prediction relative error hit rate of 90. 38 % within ± 10 % or 96. 15 % within ± 15 %. At present, end-point control of converter are mainly aimed at the carbon content and the temperature of molten steel, not considering the manganese content. But higher market requirements for steel performance and further improving the {{iron and steel production}} benefit are gradually making the control of manganese component in steel concerned. Since the chemical reactions in blowing process in converter are very complicated, it is difficult to establish accurate mathematical prediction model. Recently along with converter <b>sub-lance</b> put into use more than ever, it is becoming an important task how end-point manganes...|$|E
