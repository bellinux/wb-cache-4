5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned <b>stock</b> <b>to</b> sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept <b>stock</b> <b>to</b> sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E

40|$|Few {{empirical}} basis {{studies have}} examined the basis in multiple regions and few have concentrated on cotton. This paper addresses this topic, examining consumption market factors that affect the cotton basis in five U. S. cotton production regions. The seemingly unrelated regression results indicate that the following factors are significant in explaining the basis: total U. S. cotton stocks and the ratio of foreign cotton <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> foreign mill use in the Southeast and North Delta regions; regional stocks, the opportunity cost of storage and the foreign <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> use ratio in the West Texas region; and regional stocks, total U. S. stocks, the opportunity cost of storage, and the foreign <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> use ratio in the Desert Southwest and San Joaquin Valley regions. All significant coefficients have the hypothesized signs except the coefficient for the opportunity cost of storage and the coefficient for the ratio of foreign <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> foreign mill use in two regions. The results indicate that the cotton basis in different regions is typically affected by different factors. cotton basis, futures markets, Marketing,...|$|R

Here, they were given the designation Class E. No. 163 was in too bad condition to be used on the line, and was retired. In October 1949, no. 184 caught fire and was taken out of service. On 2 August 1958, five people perished and 17 were injured in the Strømsveien tram fire, the worst disaster in the tramway's history.|$|E

5|$|As the new decade began, KKR began {{restructuring}} RJR. In January 1990, it {{completed the}} sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt. Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of <b>stock</b> <b>to</b> provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution {{as part of the}} original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion. In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.|$|E

Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{selecting}} the right <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> invest in is of immense interest for investors on both emerging and developed capital markets. Moreover, an investor should {{take into account}} all available data regarding stocks on the particular market. This includes fundamental and stock market indicators. The decision making process includes several <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> invest in {{and more than one}} criterion. Therefore, the task of selecting the <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> invest in {{can be viewed as a}} multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Using several MCDM methods often leads to divergent rankings. The goal of this paper is to resolve these possible divergent results obtained from different MCDM methods using a hybrid MCDM approach based on Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Five MCDM methods are selected: COPRAS, linear assignment, PROMETHEE, SAW and TOPSIS. The weights for all criteria are obtained by using the AHP method. Data for this study includes information on stock returns and traded volumes from March 2012 to March 2014 for 19 stocks on the Croatian capital market. It also includes the most important fundamental and stock market indicators for selected stocks. Rankings using five selected MCDM methods in the stock selection problem yield divergent results. However, after applying the proposed approach the final hybrid rankings are obtained. The results show that the worse <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> invest in happen to be the same when the industry is taken into consideration or when not. However, when the industry is taken into account, the best <b>stocks</b> <b>to</b> invest in are slightly different, because some industries are more profitable than the others...|$|R
