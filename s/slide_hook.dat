[...] Alan Paul, author of One Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band (2014), wrote that [...] "the <b>slide</b> <b>hook</b> and guitar harmonies" [...] established that [...] "Warren Haynes and Betts were resurrecting the classic ABB sound and approach." ...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{retraction}} {{was done}} for 19 patients. Movement, Tipping and rotation of canine and molar movements  was done by two approaches of <b>sliding</b> <b>hook</b> and <b>sliding</b> mechanics using 16 % wire and 18 % twin edgewise brackets and were compared. 350 g force via elastic chin was applied and measurements were done both intra- and extraorally. There was not any significant statistical difference between canine and molar movements in both approaches. Canine Tipping and rotation in two approaches showed significant difference. In fact, both were lower in <b>sliding</b> <b>hook</b> approach than <b>sliding</b> mechanics. As lower tipping results were obtained in <b>sliding</b> <b>hook</b> approach, it is suggested to apply this method to bodily retract canine...|$|R
50|$|Rings, <b>slides</b> and <b>hooks</b> are the {{accessories}} used in intimate apparel/lingerie {{used for}} adjustment and decorative functions. Rings, <b>slides</b> and <b>hooks</b> are commonly {{made of plastic}} and nylon coated metal and stainless steel.|$|R

50|$|Common {{size range}} for rings, <b>slides</b> and <b>hooks</b> is from 6 mm to 30 mm. The range may vary, {{depending}} on different manufacturer's collection. For full-figured women bras, wider straps and elastics in used for good support of breast weight. The bigger rings and slides required (12 mm or 15 mm). On the other hand, smaller rings, <b>slides</b> and <b>hooks</b> (8 mm or 10 mm) are found on normal bras sizes (A cup and B cup). The most common size of ring, <b>slide</b> and <b>hook</b> are 10 mm, 12 mm and 15 mm.There are extremely large rings and hooks {{can be found}} on the swimwear items work as the underband fastener and decoration.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{commonly}} seen <b>slide</b> and <b>hook</b> are in rectangular shapes which {{look like}} [...] "8" [...] and [...] "9" [...] respectively. The shape of slide usually varies {{in the size}} of two holes, which allows different sliding way.

50|$|After the {{preparation}} process, {{both of them}} will be sent to undergo the colouring treatment. There are two common methods used on rings, <b>slides</b> and <b>hooks.</b> One is done by nylon coating and another by electroplating. The thickness of the items depends on that of metal coiled strip / molded alloy pieces; and of nylon coating / electroplating layer. The process enhances the abrasion / wear resistance, corrosion protection and aesthetic qualities e.g. luster and colour. Nylon coating can provide a lot of colour selections on the finished items while electroplating is mainly in gold or silver.|$|R
500|$|The single {{was heavily}} {{compared}} to My Bloody Valentine; in their {{review of the}} track, Sputnikmusic stated that it [...] "comes off like a My Bloody Valentine song with intelligible vocals, with a <b>sliding,</b> reverb heavy <b>hook</b> and pummeling drums", while AllMusic writer Jack Rabid drew similar comparisons. Patrick Carmosino of West Net stated that with [...] "You Don't Know Anything", Ivy [...] "have an indie-ethic rock side that compliments their pop sensibilities to the tee".|$|R
2500|$|His baserunning was legendary {{in other}} ways as well. His arguably most {{frequent}} brilliant play was always legitimate—a feetfirst <b>hook</b> <b>slide</b> to avoid being tagged. In 1889, Tim Murnane of the Boston Globe said {{nine times out of}} ten, Kelly will [...] "throw himself {{out of the reach of}} the baseman, and catch the bag from the outside." [...] Also, [...] "Kelly is not a sprinter, but can get a great start, and this counts more than a fine slide, as a catcher is likely to be hurried when he sees the runner well on his way to a base." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{concluding}} {{where to}} truly give Kelly credit as an innovator, a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball—and which {{came close to}} exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects—placed stress on the following: [...] "Kelly's <b>hook</b> <b>slide</b> does sound special, and players probably tried to copy it. [...] Also, {{he seems to have}} been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base (when the usually lone umpire wasn't looking), at least according to the newspaper record." [...] And, [...] "Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose. [...] Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s. [...] At the turn of the century, that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes." ...|$|R
2500|$|Michael Joseph [...] "King" [...] Kelly (December 31, 1857 – November 8, 1894), also {{commonly}} known as [...] "$10,000 Kelly," [...] was an American outfielder, catcher, and manager in various professional American baseball leagues including the National League, International Association, Players' League, and the American Association. He spent {{the majority of his}} 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters. Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career – in 1887 for the Beaneaters, in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players' League's existence, and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers – before his retirement in 1893. He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run, the <b>hook</b> <b>slide,</b> and the catcher's practice of backing up first base.|$|R
60|$|They hauled it down; but the Tyee, being loaded deep {{with heavy}} machinery, was not appreciably drier afterward, {{and by the}} time the angry, saffron sunset faded off the foam-crested sea, she put her bows in {{somewhat}} frequently. Then there was a thud as she charged a big comber, and the frothy cataract that seethed in over her weather rail swirled aft a foot deep, while the spray blew all over her. Jimmy, buttoned to the throat in oilskins, stood at her wheel dripping, through four hours of darkness; and then, crawling down into the little cabin, which was intolerably foul, flung himself into his bunk and incontinently fell asleep, with the thud and swish of falling water going on above him. When he awakened, his first proceeding was to grope for the button that would summon a steward boy to bring him his morning coffee, but as he could not find it he looked around and saw his wet oilskins, which had shaken off the <b>hook,</b> <b>sliding</b> amidst the water up and down the Tyee's cabin floor. Then he remembered suddenly, and, dropping from his bunk, put on the oilskins and went up on deck.|$|R
5000|$|Hook {{revels in}} his success ("Hook's Waltz"). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the {{crocodile}} and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, {{the animals and}} Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order {{to go in and}} jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the [...] "doodle-doo" [...] (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after <b>Hook</b> <b>slides</b> down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is either blown to smithereens or is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises ("I've Gotta Crow" [...] reprise). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow ("I Gotta Crow" [...] reprise).|$|R
