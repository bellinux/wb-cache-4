500|$|At 09:27 a shell hitting Bismarck {{penetrated}} the hydraulic machinery in turret 'Anton' and disabled it, causing the guns {{to run down}} to maximum depression. Her topsides were wrecked, and a large fire burned amidships. After firing steadily for over 30 minutes, without any problems, King George V , by 09:27, began having trouble with her main battery, and from that point onward every salvo missed at least one gun due to failures in the <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> for antiflash protection and from ammunition feed jams. At [...] 10:21, with Bismarck silenced and obviously sinking, Admiral Tovey detailed the cruiser [...] to finish her off with torpedoes. King George V fired 339 14 in (354 mm) and over 700 5.25 in (133 mm) shells during the action. As both Rodney and [...] King George V were low on fuel they returned to port at , escorted by eleven destroyers to guard against German air or submarine attack. The next day, after the escort was reduced to three destroyers, four German aircraft did attack but scored no hits. Both King George V and Rodney returned to port safely, but the destroyer , sent ahead to refuel, was bombed and sunk.|$|E
500|$|The tight {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty raised many challenges and required difficult compromises {{if they were to}} be met. To avoid the class being outgunned by the new ships of foreign navies, especially as by the mid-1930s the Treaty had been renounced by Japan and Italy, Churchill wrote to the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1936, voicing strong objections to the proposed armament of 10 14-inch guns. His proposal was for nine 16-inch guns. However, when completed King George V mounted ten [...] guns. They were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. They could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: [...] "A" [...] turret, 286 degrees; [...] "B" [...] turret, 270 degrees and [...] "Y" [...] turret, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was achieved through a hydraulic drive, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed 15,950 pounds; a salvo could be fired every 30 seconds. The quadruple turrets weighed 1,582 tons, the twin turret 915 tons. The turrets were designed by the Vickers Armstrong's Elswick Works, but sets of each type of equipment were manufactured by Vickers Armstrongs in Barrow. A considerable amount of design effort was expended to make the turrets as flashtight as possible. This complicated the mechanical design of the turrets, particularly the quadruple mountings. Due to insufficient clearances and slightly distorted link mechanisms, failures in the intricate <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> in the loading sequence for antiflash precautions caused jams during drills and practice firing. During the summer of 1941 the King George V-class battleships, had their main armament turrets and turret linkages modified to correct the operational faults revealed during the hunt and destruction of Bismarck. HMS King George V used an Admiralty Fire Control Table Mark IX to control her main armament.|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{microwave}} {{exposure is}} not generally possible, as microwaves emitted by the source {{in a microwave}} oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed.

This safety mechanism is required by United States federal regulations. Tests have shown confinement of the microwaves in commercially available ovens to be so nearly universal as to make routine testing unnecessary. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a U.S. Federal Standard limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately [...] (2 in) {{from the surface of}} the oven.

2500|$|During {{the battle}} of the Denmark Strait against the German {{battleship}} Bismarck, the main battery of the newly commissioned [...] had mechanical problems: it started to fire three-round salvos instead of five-round salvoes, and there were problems in all except for the twin [...] "B" [...] turret. The main battery output was reduced to 74 percent (Bismarck and Prinz Eugen achieved 89% and 85% output, respectively) during the engagement, as out of seventy-four rounds ordered fired, only fifty-five were possible. 'A' turret was taking in water leading to discomfort for its crew and [...] "Y" [...] turret jammed at salvo 20. The number of known defects in the main armament that was hampering 14-inch fire, the damage sustained and the worsening tactical situation forced Captain Leach to disengage from combat. With the range down to 14,500 yards and with five of his 14-inch guns out of action, Leach decided to break off his engagement with a superior enemy. Roskill in the War at Sea (the official British history of the Second World War at sea), Volume 1, describes the decision to turn away: [...] "In addition to the defective gun in her forward turret another 4 gun turret was temporarily incapacitated by mechanical breakdowns. In these circumstances Leach decided to break off the action and, at 0613, turned away under cover of smoke." [...] During the later action with Bismarck, [...] was also having trouble with her main battery, and by 0927 every gun missed at least one salvo due to failures in the <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> for antiflash protection.

40|$|The {{radiation}} <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> {{systems of}} the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) have been operated {{for more than a}} decade. Some modification actions have been implemented in the past to perfect the safe operation. The overall performance of this interlock system is reliable and satisfactory. The machine and its interlock system were originally designed to operate at decay mode. During decay mode injection, the safety shutters of beamlines are closed and the radiation loss is contained inside accelerator tunnel. Recently, some modification programs to change operation mode from original decay mode to top-up mode at NSRRC have initiated. For users at experimental area, the radiation dose resulted from top-up refilled injections when safety shutters of beamlines are opened will dominate. To ensure personnel radiation safety for top-up operation, the <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> upgrade and other action plans will be implemented.

50|$|The {{elevator}} motor {{was located}} {{at the top of}} the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft. Pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise; backwards would make it sink. The harder the pressure, the faster the elevator would move. The handle also served as a dead man switch: if the operator let go of the handle, it would return to its upright position, causing the elevator cab to stop. In time, <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> are {{sometimes}} used {{to ensure the}} presence of an ignition source before the main valves open; however reliability of the interlocks can in some cases be lower than the ignition system. Thus it depends on whether the system must fail safe, or whether overall mission success is more important. Interlocks are rarely used for upper, unmanned stages where failure of the interlock would cause loss of mission, but are present on the SSME, to shut the engines down prior to liftoff of the Space Shuttle. In addition, detection of successful ignition of the igniter is surprisingly difficult, some systems use thin wires that are cut by the flames, pressure sensors have also seen some use.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, Pete Planchon {{conducted}} {{a demonstration of}} the inherent safety of the Integral Fast Reactor. <b>Safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> were turned off. Coolant circulation was turned off. Core temperature rose from the usual 1000 degrees Fahrenheit to 1430 degrees within 20 seconds. The boiling temperature of the sodium coolant is 1621 degrees. Within seven minutes the reactor had shut itself down without action from the operators, without valves, pumps, computers, auxiliary power, or any moving parts. The temperature was below the operating temperature. The reactor was not damaged. The operators were not injured. There was no release of radioactive material. The reactor was restarted with coolant circulation but the steam generator disconnected. The same scenario recurred. Three weeks later, the operators at Chernobyl repeated the latter experiment, ironically in a rush to complete a safety test, using a very different reactor, with tragic consequences. Safety of the Integral Fast Reactor depends on the composition and geometry of the core, not efforts by operators or computer algorithms.|$|E

The weapons' multiple <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> prevented both a nuclear explosion and release of radioactive material.
