40|$|ABSTRACTThe neural {{foundations}} of arithmetic learning {{are not well}} understood. While behavioral studies have revealed relationships between <b>symbolic</b> number <b>processing</b> and individual differences in children's arithmetic performance, the neurocognitive mechanisms that bind <b>symbolic</b> number <b>processing</b> and arithmetic are unknown. The current fMRI study investigated the relationship between children's brain activation during symbolic number comparison (Arabic digits) and individual differences in arithmetic fluency. A significant correlation {{was found between the}} numerical ratio effect on reaction times and accuracy and children's arithmetic scores. Furthermore, children with a stronger neural ratio effect in the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) during <b>symbolic</b> number <b>processing</b> exhibited higher arithmetic scores. Previous research has demonstrated that activation of the IPS during numerical magnitude processing increases over the course of development, and that the left IPS {{plays an important role in}} <b>symbolic</b> number <b>processing.</b> The present findings extend this knowledge to show that children with more mature response modulation of the IPS during <b>symbolic</b> number <b>processing</b> exhibit higher arithmetic competence. These results suggest that the left IPS is a key neural substrate for the relationship between the relative of precision of the representation of numerical magnitude and school-level arithmetic competence...|$|R

Therefore, we delineated {{during the first}} 3 years of primary education (5 – 8 years of age) groups with distinguishable developmental trajectories of <b>symbolic</b> numerical magnitude <b>processing</b> skills using a model-based clustering approach. Three clusters were identified and were labeled as inaccurate, accurate but slow, and accurate and fast. The clusters {{did not differ in}} age, sex, socioeconomic status, or IQ.

We observed minor differences between clusters in these cognitive competencies except for verbal working memory for which no differences were observed.

Participants were 24 girls with Turner syndrome, 25 children with 22 q 11 DS and 48 well-matched typically developing control children.
