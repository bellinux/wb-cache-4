The materials in cement clinker are alite, belite, tri-calcium aluminate, and tetra-calcium alumino ferrite.

For special cements, such as Low Heat (LH) and Sulfate Resistant (SR) types, {{it is necessary to}} limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate (3CaO·Al2O3) formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone (CaCO3) mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or SiO2 is used. The CaCO3 content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Secondary raw materials (materials in the raw mix other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the materials used are clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite, fly ash, and slag.

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, {{the sector}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> {{as well as a}} major part of other sectors of economy, has been hit by a global {{economical}} recession. In comparison with usual incidences as sales, employment or payment problems, the recession had here, nevertheless, one specificity [...] impact upon environment. The <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> are used to be employed by the manufacturers to the production of goods provided their price is lower than this of primary commodities. However, in the said period, consumer demand and production decreased, and in this consequence also prices of primary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> diminished heavily. Thereby the market of <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> practically stopped. But {{it was not possible to}} stop also their production, because recycling, process of <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> manufacture, is compulsory in the EU countries. Due to this situation, fears on the collapse of the whole system of waste separation occurred, but also different proposals for solutions of this problem appeared. Although the situation on the market for <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> in the latest months starts to be stabilized, this problem is always actual and that's why it became also theme of this dissertation. Thus, this diploma paper's objective is to make an attempt to characterize the current situation in the market for <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> with the exploitation of the institutional analysis and, subsequently, to examine its changes evoked by the introduction of the "anti-crisis" measures.

The leaching behaviour of some primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> used in pilot- scale roadbases (TNO). Development and use of the leaching data base (ECN). The results of the characterization of the leaching properties of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> generally show a good reproducibility of the chemical composition {{as well as of the}} leaching parameters. The studies have also shown that it is technically feasible to replace primary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> partially by <b>secondary</b> materials. In most cases, the technical requirements of the products were met. From the results of the standard leaching tests of granular materials and products it was found that the availibility test can be used as a first screening method for the determination of the leaching behaviour of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and products. The leaching of elements from <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and products (primary and secondary) depends strongly on the pH value present in the leaching system. Comparison of the results of the standard leaching test (small scale laboratory test) and the same test carried out in lysimeters (pilot-scale) shows the standard leaching test on laboratory scale to be a reliable test procedure in order to estimate the leaching behaviour in at least the first 100 years. The leaching database, which was developed as part of this project, has demonstrated its usefulness in evaluating and interpreting the results of this study. In addition, it will be a useful tool in the future for mutual comparison of materials as well as for certification of materials...|$|R
