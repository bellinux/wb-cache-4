30|$|Table 8 {{also shows}} that for AT&T, the {{percentage}} of <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links for the best online approach, Online-MO, is around 97.7 % {{of the percentage of}} <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links observed for Offline-R. Online-MO selects paths that require the fewest number of new links, which decreases the overall percentage of active links. On the other hand, Online-R-LSP randomly selects paths without considering energy consumption. This results in Online-R-LSP exhibiting the smallest percentage of <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links among the studied approaches, with only 12.2 % of the recorded percentage of Offline-R. For Abilene, Table 9 indicates that Online-R and Online-R-LSP exhibit the best and worst performance, respectively. Specifically, Online-R is able to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> 24.9 % of the links <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> by Offline-R, whereas, Online-R-LSP only <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> 1.4 % of the links <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> by Offline-R.|$|R
