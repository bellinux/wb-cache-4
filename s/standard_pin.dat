When choosing a roll pin punch, select one that is no larger than the compressed diameter of the pin. If a punch is used that is larger than the pin,the surrounding metal in which the pin is seated can be damaged. Also, a roll pin punch should not be used which is smaller than the compressed diameter of the pin.

40|$|Background: External {{fixation}} is {{a well-known}} procedure {{for the management of}} intertrochanteric fractures in very elderly high-risk patients. A new compression pin that can be adapted to all fixators was designed to provide inter fragmentary compression. In the present study, its effects on the fracture stability and healing were evaluated. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one patients treated using compression pin and thirty-six patients treated using standard pins were evaluated retrospectively between January 2009 and July 2014. Patients were evaluated according to age, gender, duration of preoperative period, duration of operation time, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, and immediate postoperative and final femoral neck angle measurements. The stability of the fixation was evaluated by calculating the secondary varus angulation after weight bearing. Results: Thirty one patients (82. 1 ± 6. 1 years old) comprised the compression pin group, and 36 patients (83. 33 ± 6. 24 years old) comprised the <b>standard</b> <b>pin</b> group. From the time of weight bearing to healing time, 1. 0 ± 1. 25 ° (0 – 4) and 2. 5 ± 1. 8 ° (0 – 9) of secondary varus angulation in the compression pin and <b>standard</b> <b>pin</b> groups were measured, respectively (P = 0. 000). With weight bearing, 2 of 31 (6 %) and 9 of 36 (25 %) patients in the compression and <b>standard</b> <b>pin</b> groups, respectively, had > 4 ° of secondary varus angulation. In the compression pin group, 13 fractures were unstable, but only 2 (15 %) of them had > 4 ° of secondary varus angulation. In the <b>standard</b> <b>pin</b> group, 19 fractures were unstable, and 7 (37 %) of them had > 4 ° of secondary varus angulation. Conclusions: Treatment of very elderly, high risk patients' with intertrochanteric fractures with external fixation is effective.

We compared pin fixation in HCO {{using a new}} self-drilling XCaliber pin (Orthofix) with optimized thread and tip design, with the commonly used <b>standard</b> <b>pin</b> (Orthofix). Patients and methods 50 patients, mean age 51 (35 - 66) years, to be treated by HCO were randomized to standard pins or XCaliber pins. In the metaphyseal bone, hydroxyapatite-coated (HA-coated) pins were used in both types of pins. In the diaphyseal bone, non-coated pins were used. The torque forces for insertion and extraction (in Nm) were measured. Results The insertion torque was higher for both the proximal and distal standard pins (2. 1 Nm (SD 0. 9) and 7. 0 Nm (1. 3), respectively) than for the XCaliber pins (1. 3 Nm (0. 8) and 3. 6 Nm (1. 4)). The extraction torque force was higher for the proximal standard pins (4. 3 Nm (3. 1)) than for the proximal XCaliber pins (1. 5 Nm (1. 7)) (p < 0. 001). The extraction torque for the distal standard pins was 1. 9 Nm (2. 0) and for the distal XCaliber pins it was 1. 4 Nm (1. 1).

It couples the ERANOS based EQL 3 D procedure developed at PSI for FR equilibrium fuel cycle analysis with a dedicated MATLAB script that evaluates the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of the reactor core. It is conceived to investigate reactors with both <b>standard</b> <b>pins</b> and annular pins. The procedure accepts as input the physical properties of the system, {{as well as a}} set of target core parameters presently consisting of core power, maximum fuel burnup, multiplication factor, inner pin diameter (for annular pins) or maximum pressure losses (for <b>standard</b> <b>pins),</b> and core height. It gives as a result a core design fulfilling these design objectives and meeting the constraints on maximum fuel and clad temperatures. In case of annular pins, it also equalizes the temperature rise inside and outside of the core average pin. The procedure considers the possibility of two-zone cores and adjusts the fuel composition in the two zones to achieve an optimal radial power distribution. Finally, it can evaluate safety parameters and fuel cycle characteristics both at beginning-of-life and at equilibrium. As a test case, the procedure has been used for the pre-conceptual design of a sub-critical Gas Fast Reactor core employing inert-matrix sphere-pac fuel and annular pins with SiC cladding...|$|R

The purpose of {{present study was to}} evaluate pin-site infection, pain, and the use of medications using the XCaliber pin (Orthofix) with optimized thread and tip design, and the commonly used <b>standard</b> <b>pin</b> (Orthofix) during the procedure of hemicallotasis osteotomy (HCO). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients of mean age 51 (35 - 66) years treated with HCO were randomized to standard pins (Orthofix) or XCaliber pins (Orthofix). Hydroxyapatite-coated pins were used in the metaphyseal bone and non-coated pins in the diaphyseal bone in both groups. Pin sites, pain, and the use of medications were evaluated weekly during the HCO. RESULTS: At week 7 the patients in the XCaliber group had more pain at rest [19 (22) vs. 5 (5) mm, P = 0. 01] and during activity [32 (32) vs. 12 (13) mm, P = 0. 02] and used more paracetamol (2, 100 vs. 925 mg, P = 0. 04) than those in the standard group, with similar differences, until the extraction of the pins. There was no difference in the use of antibiotics [10. 5 (14. 5) days (XCaliber) vs. 7 (7. 5) days (standard) (P = 0. 16) ].
