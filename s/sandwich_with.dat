25|$|The Angus Steakhouse Burger was {{introduced}} in April 2008 as the replacement to the Angus burger. The new burger featured a large, square shaped Angus beef patty with two permanent variants of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>with</b> an LTO version later that year. The burger was thinner than the Angus Burger {{because many of the}} Burger King locations still used an older model broiler to cook their burgers. The older model relied solely on a single chain with uniform cooking speed and temperature which restricted the thickness of meat patties. As a result, thicker patties such as the one utilized with the previous iteration of the sandwich needed to be precooked.|$|E
