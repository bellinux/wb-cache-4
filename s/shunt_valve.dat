40|$|Background. The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the value of {{electromagnetic}} programmable <b>shunt</b> <b>valves</b> for the treatment of subdural collections. Methods. Adult patients with hydrocephalus of various causes that were treated with programmable <b>shunt</b> <b>valves</b> during the last ten years were retrospectively studied. In 127 patients, 139 electromagnetic programmable <b>shunt</b> <b>valves</b> were implanted. Results. A nontraumatic subdural fluid collection was detected in 12 patients. The treatment of these patients consisted of reprogramming of the valve’s opening pressure. In 5 patients small subdural hematomas were detected; 4 of these patients were treated by raising the opening pressure alone and one patient required surgical drainage and change of the pressure setting. Traumatic chronic subdural hematomas were detected in 6 patients. These patients were treated by surgical drainage and readjustment of the valve’s opening pressure. Conclusion. The ability to treat a shunt-related complication, such as a subdural fluid collection, by reprogramming the valve’s opening pressure to a higher setting is an advantage over nonprogrammable valves, and it enables the opening pressure to be slowly lowered once the fluid collection is reabsorbed. Based on our results, we believe that programmable <b>shunt</b> <b>valves</b> should be preferred...|$|R

Therefore, a new set of parameters is defined and applied to pressure-airflow curves of airflow-regulating devices. Pressure drop over TSVs and HME filters appears to have a squared relationship with flow. In SVs, it has a linear relationship. The new set of parameters describes the pressure-airflow relationship properly for all considered devices.

40|$|Advanced {{laryngeal}} cancer sometimes necessitates {{the removal}} of the complete larynx. This procedure involves suturing the trachea to an opening in the neck, the most disturbing consequence of which is the loss of voice. Since 1859, several devices have been developed for voice restoration, based mainly on a vibrating reed element. However, the resulting sound is very monotonous and thus unpleasant. Presently the most successful way of voice restoration is the placement of a one-way <b>shunt</b> <b>valve</b> in the tracheoesophageal wall, thus preventing aspiration and allowing air to flow from the lungs to the esophagus, where soft tissues start to vibrate for substitute voicing. However, the quality of this voice is often poor.

40|$|Background: Sophisticated <b>shunt</b> <b>valves</b> {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and antisiphon control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential pressure valve. Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential pressure valve would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential pressure or flow-regulated valves for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential pressure valves, 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential pressure valves assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential pressure valve or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For voice {{rehabilitation}} after total laryngectomy a <b>shunt</b> <b>valve</b> is usually {{placed in the}} tracheo-esophageal (TE) wall, thereby enabling {{the production of a}} TE voice. Some patients, however, are unable to produce a voice of sufficient quality. Furthermore, the TE voice is low pitched, which presents a problem especially for female laryngectomized patients. The voice quality after laryngectomy might be improved by introducing a voice-producing element (VPE) into the TE <b>shunt</b> <b>valve.</b> In this study a sound generator was developed that is suitable for application in such a VPE. This sound generator consists of two elastic membranes placed parallel inside a circular housing. A substitute voice source is created when the membranes start to vibrate via a constant flow of air passing between them. To determine the optimal membrane configuration for proper functioning under phys-iological conditions, up-scaled physical VPE models with different membrane geometries were evaluated using in vitro experimental tests. For certain membrane geometries the tests showed that a basic sound, containing multiple har-monics, could be successfully produced under physiological air pressure and airflow conditions. The fundamental fre-quency (60 – 95 Hz) and sound pressure level (57 – 78 dB, at 15 cm microphone distance) were regulated via changes in the driving pressure, thereby enabling the possibility of intonation in laryngectomized patients ’ speech. The obtained frequency range is considered appropriate for producing a substitute voice source for female patients. The geometry considerations in this study can be used {{for the development of a}} true scale VPE that can be evaluated clinically, to eventually replace the voice after laryngectomy.

At a regional level, both patient groups showed significant alteration in one or more regional connectivity measures in a series of brain regions in the left hemisphere (8 and 10 regions in the 3 -month post-surgery and the 12 -month post-surgery group, respectively, all p <  0. 05, corrected).
