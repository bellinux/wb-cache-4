5|$|Both the Bengal <b>slow</b> loris and pygmy <b>slow</b> loris {{are found}} in more than 20 {{protected}} areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded. The pygmy <b>slow</b> loris is protected in most of its range states: in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. This makes hunting and capture illegal, and in China and Vietnam, possession and storage are also illegal. Under Vietnamese law it has had {{the highest level of}} wildlife protection since 1992, all exploitation and use of the pygmy <b>slow</b> loris is illegal. However, enforcement is poor while minor penalties have little deterring effect. In terms of international protection, the species was elevated to Appendix I of CITES in 2007. In addition, since October 2001, the European Union prohibits imports for all wild specimens of pygmy <b>slow</b> loris from Laos and Cambodia for conservation reasons.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of <b>slow</b> loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, <b>slow</b> lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, <b>slow</b> lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the <b>slow</b> loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild <b>slow</b> lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. <b>Slow</b> lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain <b>slow</b> lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement {{is involved in the}} trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of <b>slow</b> lorises for medicinal purposes.

40|$|A {{transverse}} Zeeman <b>slower</b> {{composed of}} {{an array of}} compact discrete neodymium magnets is considered.

The theory of a general Zeeman <b>slower</b> is modified to include spatial nonuniformity of the <b>slowing</b> laser beam intensity due to its convergence and absorption by <b>slowed</b> atoms. The <b>slower</b> needs no high currents or water cooling and the spatial distribution of its magnetic field can be adjusted. In addition the <b>slower</b> provides a possibility to cool the <b>slowed</b> atoms transversally along the whole length of the <b>slower.</b> Such a <b>slower</b> would be ideal for transportable optical atomic clocks and their future applications in space physics.

The Sunda <b>slow</b> loris is found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra as well as Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The other two species are found entirely on the mainland, with the Bengal <b>slow</b> loris (N.bengalensis) native to Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China, Northeast India, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam and the pygmy <b>slow</b> loris (N.pygmaeus) found in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southern China.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{primatologist}} James Thorn used environmental niche modelling in Indonesia {{to supplement}} the poor population data gathered to date to predict the remaining available habitat for <b>slow</b> lorises on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These estimates indicated that the Javan <b>slow</b> loris was the most threatened by habitat loss, followed by the Sunda <b>slow</b> loris from Sumatra. The Bornean <b>slow</b> loris was in a better situation since much of its range consists of low-risk areas. Both the Bengal <b>slow</b> loris and pygmy <b>slow</b> loris are found in more than 20protected areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded.|$|E
5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy <b>slow</b> lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy <b>slow</b> loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.

Both cognitive <b>slowing</b> and motor <b>slowing</b> have been suggested as causes of this effect. The lateralized readiness potential (LRP) of the electroencephalogram {{can be used to}} separate perceptual and decision processes from motor programming and execution as causes of RT differences. We used the LRP to discern the origin of <b>slowing</b> in RT to motion onset that occurs in elderly individuals. After {{the onset of}} motion in a visual display, we asked participants to identify the direction of that motion (up or down) by pressing a button.

We discuss the differences found in amplitude and onset latency of the LRP in the context of theories of motion processing and inhibition in the aging brain.

5|$|<b>Slow</b> lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda <b>slow</b> loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey.

5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of <b>slow</b> loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in <b>slow</b> lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, <b>slow</b> lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that <b>slow</b> lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda <b>slow</b> loris, Bengal <b>slow</b> loris, and pygmy <b>slow</b> loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveParkinson’s {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by motor and cognitive problems that are accompanied by <b>slowing</b> of neural activity. This study {{examined the relationship between}} neural <b>slowing</b> and disease severity during rest and motor performance. MethodsPrimary motor activity was assessed by means of magnetoencephalography during rest and rhythmic movements. Motor output and event-related cortical power in the alpha and beta frequency bands were determined. UPDRS total and subscores were used to pinpoint correlates of neural <b>slowing</b> (change of power towards lower frequencies) during both resting state and the production of rhythmic movements. ResultsBy design, motor performance was similar for both the patients and the controls. PD patients showed <b>slowing</b> of neural activity which increased with disease severity. <b>Slowing</b> during rest showed the clearest correlation with cognitive UPDRS subscores, whereas <b>slowing</b> during movement correlated best with the motor UPDRS subscore. ConclusionsThese results suggest that <b>slowing</b> is functionally modulated and that different mechanisms are responsible for neural <b>slowing</b> during rest versus movement. SignificanceNeural <b>slowing</b> must be viewed in a broader context than previously thought because it is not solely related to impaired motor performance but also to impaired cognition...|$|R

Both melancholic and non-melancholic patients showed a generalised <b>slowing</b> relative to controls, perhaps re¯ecting bradykinesia and akinesia.
