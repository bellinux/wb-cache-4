5|$|A {{new kind}} of {{pollution}} entered the lower <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> in 2003 when a Yonkers sugar refinery spilled hydrochloric acid into the river. Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro brought criminal environmental charges against American Sugar Refining, the plant owner, which was forced to pay a $20,000 fine; make a $100,000 donation to Riverkeeper, a regional environmental organization {{that focuses on the}} Hudson and its tributaries; and give one ton (800kg) of sugar to Westchester Food-PATCH, a local nonprofit that supplies food to other nonprofits. Riverkeeper passed the money it received along to the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Coalition for local projects in Yonkers.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Groundwork Hudson Valley, the {{coordinator}} of the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Coalition, received a three-year, $889,183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant. One of 15 recipients from a nationwide pool of more than 100 applicants, the group cleans up garbage, removes invasive species, and plants native trees along the river. The group also marks storm drains that drain to the river. On September 25–26, 2009, the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Coalition organized a BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life, animal life, insects, fungi, and bacteria in the river and its watershed. The Coalition is also looking to restore the wetlands along the river {{in order to reduce}} flooding.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to exit39 of the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
50|$|Steam powered <b>saw</b> <b>mills</b> were {{introduced}} in Sweden in 1849 at Tunadal. Twenty more steam powered <b>saw</b> <b>mills</b> were started in the decade. These sawmills were usually placed near ports and the former water powered <b>saw</b> <b>mills</b> were closed.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River, {{then known}} as the Nepperhan River, acted as a {{boundary}} between the Manhattan Indians and the Weckquaesgeeks, members of the Algonquian family who fished the region's streams and lakes with rods and nets. The Manhattans occupied present-day New York City north to the river, while the Weckquaesgeeks occupied the land from the river north to the Pocantico River. The Manhattans' principal village, Nepperamack, was {{on the site of}} present-day Yonkers where the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River discharges into the Hudson River. The Weckquaesgeeks settled the site of today's Dobbs Ferry, and on the river's banks west of White Plains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> {{was also}} known as the closest trout fishing river to New York City. In the early 2000s, it was stocked with a few hundred trout each year. The lower river {{specifically}} is a good trout river.|$|E
5|$|The river then {{runs along}} the west of V. Everit Macy Park. As part of the park facilities, the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River is impounded into Woodlands Lake, the largest {{impoundment}} on the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River, used as a water supply by the local communities of Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry, whose northern village line is just to the south. The river runs close to {{the boundary between the}} two, as the Thruway gradually veers away to the southeast just past the Ashford Avenue bridge.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} small {{portable}} sawmills {{consisting of a}} shop-size bandsaw mounted on a guiding table, which are called bandsaw <b>mills</b> (band <b>saw</b> <b>mills,</b> band sawmills). Like chain <b>saw</b> <b>mills</b> (a chainsaw on a guiding table), {{they can be used}} inexpensively by one or two people out in the field.|$|R

5|$|Westchester's postwar {{development}} {{led to more}} stormwater runoff, {{which often}} flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program.|$|E
5|$|At the New York City–Yonkers border, I-87 {{changes to}} the New York State Thruway as the {{mainline}} proceeds northward through Yonkers and southern Westchester County. It connects with Central Park Avenue (NY100) at exit1, the first of 12 exits within the county. The first few exits serve various local streets, with exit2 providing access to Yonkers Raceway and exit3 serving the Cross County Shopping Center. At exit4, I-87 connects to the Cross County Parkway, an east–west parkway providing access to the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River, Bronx River, and Hutchinson River parkways. The north-south parkways and I-95 run parallel to the Thruway through Southern Westchester. The Bronx River parkway leaves to the northeast midway through Yonkers, while the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> and Sprain Brook parkways follow the Thruway out of the city.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{along the}} <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> played minor {{parts in the}} Revolutionary War, {{especially}} after the Battle of White Plains in October 1776. The defeated Continentals retreated to the vicinity of Peekskill while the victorious British withdrew to Kingsbridge {{in what is now}} the Bronx. Neither side wanted to cede control of the Hudson Valley, which divided New England from the other colonies. This left most of Westchester unoccupied neutral ground. However, Westchester was not demilitarized. Local militias and raiding parties affiliated with both sides fought each other and terrorized the other's sympathizers and supporters. Many residents of southern Westchester abandoned their farms and drove their herds up the valley to Buttermilk Hill to protect them from Loyalist raids. The Continentals built forts near Hawthorne, where a minor tributary named Flykill Creek drained into the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> (roughly at the junction of today's <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> and Taconic parkways), and built Yankee Dam to create a lake wide enough to slow any British progress up the river. At Chappaqua, the pacifist Quakers opened their meetinghouse as a hospital for injured Continental Army soldiers. Storm's tavern was a gathering place for Continental officers and, later, their French colleagues.|$|E

5|$|Continuing south-southwest, {{the river}} {{along with the}} parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) {{to the south of}} where the river entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook. <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Road continues to parallel its namesake.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E
5|$|On the north, the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> {{watershed}} is {{bordered by}} the watersheds of Gedney Brook and the Kisco River, {{both of which}} drain into New Croton Reservoir on the Croton River, one of several large reservoirs in that watershed {{that are part of}} New York City's water supply system. On the northeast, the adjacent watersheds drain into Kensico Reservoir, another that supplies the city. Moving south, the next watersheds are tributaries of the Bronx River, then Yonkers' Grassy Sprain Reservoir and finally Tibbetts Brook. To its west in the narrow strip between the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> and the Hudson are the Pocantico River and Sheldon Brook watersheds {{at the north end of}} the watershed, and those of unnamed shorter streams at the south.|$|E
50|$|By the 1830s, Jackson Township had two gristmills {{and three}} <b>saw</b> <b>mills.</b>|$|R
50|$|By the 1830s, Monroe Township {{contained}} three <b>saw</b> <b>mills</b> {{and three}} gristmills.|$|R
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Parma {{contained}} two <b>saw</b> <b>mills.</b>|$|R
5|$|Outside of Chappaqua, NY117 loosely {{parallels}} the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway as it winds its way northeastward across residential parts of New Castle. The two parallel roads connect again {{by way of}} Roaring Brook Road, a four-lane arterial located midway between Chappaqua and the next community along NY117, the village of Mount Kisco. Roaring Brook Road also connects NY117 and the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway to the global headquarters of Reader's Digest, which comprises a large complex bounded by NY117 {{to the east and}} the Metro-North tracks to the west. From here, NY117 takes on a more pronounced northeasterly alignment that takes the route past Mount Kisco Country Club and into the village of Mount Kisco.|$|E
5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River {{itself was}} useless {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between a bend in the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|From {{its opening}} in 1961 until 1979, the parkway was {{maintained}} by the East Hudson Parkway Authority, a commission created to maintain tolls on the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway and to provide general maintenance for the Taconic State Parkway. The authority was abolished in 1979, at which time, all maintenance of the Sprain Brook Parkway {{was turned over to}} NYSDOT.|$|E
50|$|In 1883, {{there were}} several <b>saw</b> <b>mills</b> and a grist mills in Irasburg.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River from Putnam County to central Yonkers, and thence to Tibbets Creek and the Harlem River. Various {{parts of the}} line {{operated}} until the 1940s and the 1980s. The main line of the railroad is now devoted to bicycle and pedestrian paths. They are the South County Trailway on the parts south of Route 119, and the North County Trailway north of 119.|$|E
5|$|North of Kingsbridge, I-87 {{generally}} {{follows a}} northeastern alignment, {{passing through the}} center of Van Cortlandt Park as it connects to Mosholu Parkway and Jerome Avenue. Mosholu Parkway also links I-87 to the Henry Hudson and <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River parkways, which run parallel to the Major Deegan Expressway through the western Bronx and Manhattan. Past Jerome Avenue, the freeway gains a pair of service roads and heads north to the New York City–Yonkers border.|$|E
5|$|Some 110,000 {{people live}} in the <b>Saw</b> <b>Mill</b> River's watershed, in {{communities}} varying from small villages to Yonkers, New York's fourth-largest city. This is 12% of the county's total, on 6% of its area. The watershed's population density varies from 1,000 per square mile around the headwaters at Chappaqua to 10,000 around the mouth. It averages to 4,151 per square mile, twice that of the county and ten times the density for the state.|$|E
