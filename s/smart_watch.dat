25|$|The Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth {{low energy}} {{wearable}} device, developed by Nintendo's Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain {{actions in the}} game without looking at their smart device. When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates. The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until {{the next time they}} sign into the app on their mobile device. The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin. The decision to create the device rather than create a <b>smart</b> <b>watch</b> app was to increase uptake among players for whom a <b>smart</b> <b>watch</b> is prohibitively expensive. It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.|$|E

The Pebble <b>smart</b> <b>watch</b> (2013) uses a low-power memory LCD manufactured by Sharp for its e-paper display.|$|E
25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in blister packaging. It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an electronic module. The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC smart phone or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable data network is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, handheld device, tablet or <b>smart</b> <b>watch</b> via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver. It avoids the huge effort required to equip every single blister with a SIM module and expensive monthly data subscription.|$|E
40|$|The new {{generation}} of <b>watches</b> is <b>smart.</b> <b>Smart</b> <b>watches</b> {{are connected to the}} internet and provide sensor functionality that allows an enhanced human-computer-interaction. <b>Smart</b> <b>watches</b> provide a gesture interaction and a permanent monitoring of physical activities. In comparison to other electronic home consumer devices with integrated sensors, <b>Smart</b> <b>watches</b> provide monitoring data for 24 h per day, many watches are water resistant and can be worn constantly. The integrated sensors are varying in performance and are not intended to distinguish between different states of activity and inactivity. This paper reports on identified requirements on sensors of <b>smart</b> <b>watches</b> for detection of activity, inactivity as well as sleep detection. Hereby a new measurement quantity is introduced and applications of heart beat detection or wearing situation are presented...|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} type of {{wearables}} tracks physical activities. There are various types including <b>smart</b> <b>watches,</b> <b>smart</b> bands, patches, and garments. Wearable trackers for physical activities can quantify an individual’s daily activity and have the benefit of being a cost-effective solution to motivate the individual to exercise (Michaelis et al. 2016). These wearables can track the user’s location through a Global Positioning System (GPS); track vital signals such as heart rate (HR), burned calories, steps, speed, and time; monitor sport activities, sleep patterns, or even diet behaviors using accelerometers, gyroscopes, heart-rate sensors, galvanic skin response sensors; and can notify users when they achieve activity goals (Michaelis et al. 2016; Shelgikar et al. 2016). <b>Smart</b> <b>watches</b> are a representative type of fitness tracking wearables (Chittenden 2017). <b>Smart</b> <b>watches</b> can track multiple aspects of activities and have various other functions such as allowing users to manage calls and texts and set alarms to manage their schedule (Lamkin 2015; Sawh 2017 a, b). Similar to <b>smart</b> <b>watches,</b> <b>smart</b> bands track multiple aspects of activity. However, smart bands are smaller and more simply designed than <b>smart</b> <b>watches</b> and have more limited screen interfaces (Charara 2017; Winchester 2015).|$|R

In 2014 the worldwide revenue that was generated with <b>smart</b> <b>watches</b> was almost $ 1. 3 billion [1] and is expected to reach $ 33 billion in 2020 [2]. As <b>smart</b> <b>watches</b> are at the very beginning of their product lifecycle they are right now purchased by the early adopters. These early adopters are furthermore expected to be rather ready to pay for apps as the majority of smart watch-users at a more mature phase of the lifecycle.

He talked to two of his acquaintances who he already worked together with on earlier projects and who he knows he can rely on. This project plan is supposed to bring have as result a company that is legally and physically established and has all the requirements to start operating right away after the project is terminated. Since this should happen as fast as possible to be quick at the market, the project plan needs to include every single element that the founding of a company in Oregon needs. The business owner realized furthermore that it requires more people to accomplish that goal within the shortest possible time. Therefore he hires five more people besides the two acquaintances who already are involved in the project and he will be part of the project team as well.
