2500|$|Bigger {{breasts are}} easier to push {{together}} to accent the hollow between them. Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking breast augmentation. Plastic surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, [...] "you can't have cleavage with an A cup. You {{have to be at}} least a B or a C." [...] The average breast size has grown from a 34B to a 36C since the 1970s and clothing styles are smaller and <b>snugger.</b> A similar statement was made for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie manufacturers Frederick's of Hollywood promises [...] "high-rise cleavage to small busts" [...] and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a B cup an [...] "exciting C cup cleavage").|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, the {{disposable}} diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, {{such as the use}} of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, “The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this <b>snugger</b> fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.” Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the [...] "hourglass shape" [...] so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.|$|E

50|$|Some days later, <b>Snug</b> {{offers to}} buy two mules, named Crowder and Moonbeam, from his boss, {{to add to}} his income. Roarer agrees but warns <b>Snug</b> that {{ownership}} of the mules will revert to him if <b>Snug</b> misses even one payment. <b>Snug</b> then takes Crowder and Moonbeam to Tony (Walter Brennan)'s farm, and Tony, who was once a dedicated mule driver before falling down on his luck and becoming an alcoholic. While learning about the mules, <b>Snug</b> also deals with Judith and Stretch, {{who are trying to}} take over the Dominy farm.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>Snug</b> {{learns that}} his father has died, leaving him the Dominy farm, and Tony {{promises}} to consult Judge Stillwell about evicting Stretch and Judith. Soon after, Stretch places a wire snare in Crowder and Moonbeam's stall {{in an attempt to}} cripple them. <b>Snug</b> and Rad, who are out on a date, return to Tony's house and there catch Stretch as Crowder is crushing him against the barn wall. <b>Snug</b> rescues Stretch from Crowder then throws him off Tony's property. Later, Judge Stillwell and Sheriff Bursom evict Stretch and his mother from the Dominy farm. As <b>Snug,</b> Rad and Tony are riding back to Tony's, they pass Roarer, whose tractor is stuck in the mud. <b>Snug</b> bets Roarer that if Moonbeam and Crowder can pull the tractor free, Roarer will forget <b>Snug's</b> debt, but if they fail, Roarer will reassume possession of them. <b>Snug</b> also asks for Roarer's blessing of his marriage to Rad if he succeeds, and Roarer reluctantly agrees. <b>Snug</b> expertly drives the animals and soon the tractor is free. Finally, as a happy Rad joins <b>Snug,</b> Roarer concedes that at least the mules will still be in the family.|$|R

[...] "Everything is <b>snugger</b> than on the brig.

50|$|On January 30, 1863 at 9 A.M the {{chaplain}} of <b>Snug</b> Harbor, Reverend Robert Quinn {{was shot by}} a sailor resident named Herman Ingalls with a double barrel pistol outside the <b>snug</b> harbor chapel.

50|$|One day, <b>Snug's</b> {{deliberate}} insolence prompts Roarer to fire him, and <b>Snug</b> {{goes to work}} at {{the lumber}} camp. <b>Snug</b> intends to use his first week's pay for another installment on the mules and is devastated when Tony, who was holding the money, returns home drunk and broke. <b>Snug</b> begs Roarer to accept a double payment in a few days, but Roarer refuses and asks Sheriff Tod Bursom to enforce his right to reclaim the mules. Seeing this, Roarer's wife Lucy finally stands up to her overbearing husband and loans the money.|$|R

You know, I know, Miss Ruby knows all about John Crumb. John Crumb didn't come to Bungay yesterday nor yet the day before. There's been a talk of five hundred pounds, Mr Ruggles.' Mr Ruggles made a slight gesture of assent with his head. 'Five hundred pounds is very comfortable; and added to what John has will make things that snug that things never was <b>snugger.</b> But John Crumb isn't after Miss Ruby along of her fortune.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even to me," [...] Harry went on, after {{refilling}} {{and lighting}} his pipe, [...] "it {{did not seem}} long before the chief was back. He brought a heavy load, for besides the rifles and bear's flesh he carried on his back a big faggot of brushwood. After laying that down he searched among the rocks, and presently set to work to dig out the snow and earth between two big blocks, and {{was not long before}} he scooped out with his tomahawk a hole big enough {{for the two of us}} to lie in comfortably. He laid the bear's-skin down in this, then he carried me to it and helped me in and then put the robes over me; and a <b>snugger</b> place you would not want to lie in.|$|E
60|$|When {{the weather}} {{began to grow}} cool, Grandfather's chair {{had been removed from}} the summer parlor into a smaller and <b>snugger</b> room. It now stood by the side of a bright, blazing wood-fire. Grandfather loved a wood-fire far better than a grate of glowing anthracite, or than the dull heat of an {{invisible}} furnace, which seems to think that it has done its duty in merely warming the house. But the wood-fire is a kindly, cheerful, sociable spirit, sympathizing with mankind, and knowing that to create warmth is but one of the good offices which are expected from it. Therefore it dances on the hearth, and laughs broadly throughout the room, and plays a thousand antics, and throws a joyous glow over all the faces that encircle it.|$|E

We have got to make this place a sight <b>snugger</b> than it is now, for, I tell you, when the winter sets in in earnest, it will be cold enough here to freeze a buffalo solid in an hour. We have got to set to work to make a roof all over this place, and we have got to hunt to lay in a big stock of meat. We have got to get a big store of food for the horses, for we must be mighty careful with our flour now. We can wait a {{fortnight}} to see how things go, but if it is clear then that we have got to fight it out here through the winter, we must shoot the pack-ponies at once, and I reckon the others will all have to go later. However, we will give them a chance as long as we can." ...|$|E
60|$|Importance of Comfort.--To {{conclude}} these general hints, let the traveller, when out {{in trying}} weather, {{work hard at}} making his sleeping-place perfectly dry and comfortable; he should not cease until he is convinced that it will withstand {{the chill of the}} early morning, when the heat of the yesterday's sun is exhausted, and that of the coming sun has not begun to be felt. It is wretched beyond expression for a man to lie shivering beneath a scanty covering and to feel the night air become hourly more raw, while his life-blood has less power to withstand it; and to think, self-reproachfully, how different would have been his situation if he had simply had forethought and energy enough to cut and draw twice the quantity of firewood, and to spend an extra half-hour in labouring to make himself a <b>snugger</b> berth. The omission once made becomes irreparable; for in the cold of a pitiless night he has hardly sufficient stamina to rise and face the weather, and the darkness makes him unable to cope with his difficulties.|$|E
60|$|The Assault-and-Battery business, {{into which}} I was now forced to {{adventure}} for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the delicate nature of my constitution; but I {{went to work}} in it with a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nurse--I would indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will. By observing, as I say, the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very decently in the profession. The truth is, that few individuals, in any line, did a <b>snugger</b> little business than I. I will just copy a page or so out of my Day-Book; and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpet--a contemptible practice of which no high-minded man will be guilty. Now, the Day-Book is a thing that don't lie.|$|E

60|$|The {{bar of the}} Six Jolly Fellowship Porters was a bar {{to soften}} the human breast. The {{available}} space in it was not much larger than a hackney-coach; {{but no one could}} have wished the bar bigger, that space was so girt in by corpulent little casks, and by cordial-bottles radiant with fictitious grapes in bunches, and by lemons in nets, and by biscuits in baskets, and by the polite beer-pulls that made low bows when customers were served with beer, and by the cheese in a snug corner, and by the landlady's own small table in a <b>snugger</b> corner near the fire, with the cloth everlastingly laid. This haven was divided from the rough world by a glass partition and a half-door, with a leaden sill upon it for the convenience of resting your liquor; but, over this half-door the bar's snugness so gushed forth that, albeit customers drank there standing, in a dark and draughty passage where they were shouldered by other customers passing in and out, they always appeared to drink under an enchanting delusion that they were in the bar itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought as}} much, by instinct! Her {{commander}} need not, however, be any the more sure of keeping {{her off the}} rocks, on that account. The prettiest young woman in our parish was wrecked, as one might say, on the shoals of her own good looks, having cruised once too often {{in the company of}} the squire's son. A comely wench she was, though she luffed athwart all her old companions, when the young lord of the manor fell into her wake. Well, she did bravely enough, Sir, {{as long as she could}} carry her flying kites, and make a fair wind of it; but when the squall of which I spoke, overtook her, what could she do but keep away before it?--and as others, who are <b>snugger</b> in their morals hove-to as it were, under the storm-sails of religion and such matters as they had picked up in the catechism, she drifted to leeward of all honest society! A neatly-built and clean-heeled hussy was that girl; and I am not certain, by any means, that Mrs. Trysail would this day call herself the lady of a Queen's officer, had the other known how to carry sail in the company of her betters." ...|$|E

She laughed archly, and responded with some Slavic words, and then delivered her train of sight-seers over to the custodian who was to show them through the halls and chambers of the Burg. These were undergoing the repairs which the monuments of the past are perpetually suffering in the present, {{and there was some}} special painting and varnishing for the reception of the Kaiser, who was coming to Nuremberg for the military manoeuvres then at hand. But if they had been in the unmolested discomfort of their unlivable magnificence, their splendor was such as might well reconcile the witness to the superior comfort of a private station in our <b>snugger</b> day. The Marches came out owning that the youth which might once have found the romantic glories of the place enough was gone from them. But so much of it was left to her that she wished to make him stop and look at the flirtation which had blossomed out between that pretty young girl and the Russian, whom they had scarcely missed from their party in the Burg. He had apparently never parted from the girl, and now as they sat together on the threshold of the gloomy tower, he most have been teaching her more Slavic words, for they were both laughing as if they understood each other perfectly.|$|E
