5|$|Elizabeth's pregnancies with Princes Andrew and Edward, in 1959 and 1963, {{mark the}} only times <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{performed}} the State Opening of the British parliament during her reign. In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary {{members of the}} public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.|$|E
5|$|If 30 {{days have}} passed after a Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill has been {{presented}} to the President for assent and her or <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> signified the withholding of assent, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the expiration of the 30-day period.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Maddy {{receives}} {{a visit from}} Dan Clifford, who <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> seen for over 18 months since he took his job abroad. After hearing about Maddy's attack he has arrived {{to see how she}} is doing and to offer her a research position with him at his new hospital. Maddy decides to try for the position at Holby before making any decisions.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Crayford put {{her arms}} round Clara and held her up. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> made a movement: <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> spoken a word. The sight of Wardour's face had petrified her.|$|R
60|$|But {{our present}} story {{will have more}} to do with his {{daughter}} than with him. A pretty girl, I have said, was Patience Woolsworthy; and one, too, in many ways remarkable. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> taken her outlook into life, weighing the things which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> and those which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> in a manner very unusual, and, as a rule, not always desirable for a young lady. The things which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> were very many. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> society; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> a fortune; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> any assurance of future means of livelihood; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> high hope of procuring for herself a position in life by marriage; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> that excitement and pleasure in life which she read of in such books as found their way down to Oxney Colne Parsonage. It would be easy to add to the list of the things which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not; and this list against herself she made out with the utmost vigour. The things which <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> or those rather which she assured herself of having, were much more easily counted. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> the birth and education of a lady, the strength of a healthy woman, and a will of her own. Such was the list as she made it out for herself, and I protest that I assert no more than the truth in saying that she never added to it either beauty, wit, or talent.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{heard the}} {{step on the}} stair. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen the door open. She {{did not know that}} any one wage in the room until she heard his voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.|$|R
5|$|Arya Stark {{continues}} to train blind with The Waif, but still performs poorly in her duels. After one particular defeat, Arya is surprised when Jaqen H'ghar who <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> encountered for a while, appears {{and attempts to}} tempt her with food, bedding, {{and the return of}} her vision. Arya refuses all of Jaqen's offers, and Jaqen tells Arya to follow him, telling her she no longer needs to live as a beggar on the streets.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the Terran Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats to Char, despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been seen or heard from by any of the other characters.|$|E
5|$|Bondfield {{remained}} {{active in}} NUGMW affairs until 1938, {{and during the}} Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She died in 1953; despite her years of service to party and union, and her successes in breaking through gender boundaries, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been greatly honoured within the Labour movement. According to a later female cabinet minister, Barbara Castle, Bondfield's actions in office had brought her close to betrayal of the movement.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{actually}} came. Romantic as {{all this}} may appear, I really {{received a letter}} from Madame Lalande--the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande. Her eyes--her magnificent eyes, <b>had</b> <b>not</b> belied her noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as <b>she</b> was <b>she</b> <b>had</b> obeyed the frank dictates of her reason--the generous impulses of her nature--despising the conventional pruderies of the world. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> scorned my proposals. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> sheltered herself in silence. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> returned my letter unopened. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite fingers. It ran thus: ...|$|R

5|$|Edea is one {{of three}} {{character}} concepts, along with Fujin and Raijin, to have been created before Final Fantasy VIII. Tetsuya Nomura had designed Edea even before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano, who was the character illustrator of Final Fantasy VI and previous games. In Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Edea's design is used as an alternate costume of Ultimecia's. Although <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> appeared in Final Fantasy spin off games like Dissidia, her namesake has been carried into the Bravely Default series with Edea Lee.|$|E
5|$|Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) informs Black that, {{before his}} escape, Fabricant {{had married a}} {{correspondent}} he met through a prison pen-pal service. Watts and Black interview the woman, Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), at her home. Butler is adamant <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> seen or heard from Fabricant since his escape. However, Black finds information on Butler's computer which he believes is linked to his own home address; and photographs of a judge who he recognizes as having been murdered.|$|E
5|$|Harris later volunteers {{herself to}} have an {{appendectomy}} to help the interns learn that surgical procedure, {{on the condition that}} she gets a chance to perform one afterwards. The interns make a mistake in the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the residents. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been fired is because of his personal friendship with her father.|$|E
6000|$|She met {{his eyes}} with all the {{tenderness}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet uttered, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> known till this moment how great was the accumulation.

5000|$|Emmet sued Spelling {{a second}} time, in 1996, after Spelling {{published}} his memoirs. She claimed that Spelling had defamed {{her in his}} book, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been credited with conceiving the original idea for Family. She lost on appeal in 2001, with the court sayng <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> met the standard for showing damages due to the alleged defamation and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> explained how the defamation legally constituted a second theft of the same intellectual property. The litigation finally concluded with Allen retaining her [...] "Created by" [...] credit for the series.|$|R
5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. The Court did not discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the oath, the monarch may take {{what is known as}} the Accession Declaration if he or <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to be taken at either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch's accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation. The monarch additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation.|$|E

5|$|Karlsruhe sank at 15:50; {{the rights}} to {{salvaging}} the ship were sold in 1962. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been raised for scrapping, however. Emden was boarded by British sailors who beached her before she could be completely sunk. After being refloated, she was ceded to France and used as a test ship for explosives before being broken up in 1926. Nürnberg was also beached by British sailors. She was eventually sunk off the Isle of Wight as a gunnery target. Königsberg was meanwhile stricken from the naval register on 20 July 1920 and ceded to France. She was renamed Metz and served with the French Navy until 1933. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} Berquist's motives, noting {{that she was}} the reason Mulder decided to look into this investigation. Mulder, however, begins to suspect Detweiler after learning that he had been at the vet's office; Mulder believes that he is the dhole and is tranquilizing himself in an attempt to stop murdering. Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the Dhole and placed in the hospital. Mulder then visits Berquist and says he thinks <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler when she saw him. She also says that he will try to finish off Cahn. Mulder worriedly tells Scully, who remains skeptical.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{mentioned}} his name for years. I thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{forgotten all about}} him.|$|R
60|$|And {{still he}} wondered. Often he napped there to her playing, and always, when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> finished, <b>she</b> kissed him awake {{and sent him}} to bed. But this night <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not.</b> Perhaps, after all, she was coming back. He lay and drowsed and waited. The next time {{he looked at his}} watch, it was two o'clock. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> come back.|$|R
60|$|But Clara was not satisfied. Something great was there, she knew; {{something}} great enveloped her. But {{it did not}} keep her. In the morning {{it was not the}} same. They <b>had</b> KNOWN, but <b>she</b> could not keep the moment. She wanted it again; she wanted something permanent. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> realised fully. <b>She</b> thought it was he whom she wanted. He was not safe to her. This that had been between them might never be again; he might leave her. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> got him; <b>she</b> was <b>not</b> satisfied. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> been there, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> gripped the--the something--she knew not what--which she was mad to have.|$|R
5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who {{has been}} nursing Mark (Paul Schneider) at the {{hospital}} since he fell into the pit, says he has acted much nicer since the incident. Ann also reveals she has broken up with Andy (Chris Pratt). Mark and Leslie kissed before he fell, but both insist they are just friends. Mark tries to ask Ann out, but she declines {{out of respect for}} Leslie's friendship. Meanwhile, the Bulge holds a party in Leslie's honor, which she attends along with Tom (Aziz Ansari) to announce <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> taken a political stand. However, she accepts the free drinks they offer her and ends up getting drunk and having a great time. The next day, she is invited to go on the Pawnee Today talk show to discuss her supposed stance on same-sex marriage with Marcia Langman and television host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins).|$|E
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
5|$|Christine (Smith) arrives home to {{her flat}} with Adam (Riley), whom she has just met at a New Year's party. Thirteen months later, it is Valentine's Day and Christine chats with her flatmate Fung (Liu) at home. Christine is dating Adam, but {{receives}} a card from her first boyfriend, whom <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> seen since childhood. On Mother's Day, Christine's mother Marion (Dotrice) visits. Marion reveals that Christine's first boyfriend died as a teenager, which Christine had forgotten. Marion urges Christine to marry Adam; Christine's father Ernie (Copley) has Alzheimer's disease and is deteriorating. The following year, Adam moves in with Christine at Easter. Christine begins to prepare a surprise for him, but is disturbed when an egg smashes on a nearby wall. In her kitchen, she is approached by an unknown man, the Stranger (Shearsmith).|$|E
