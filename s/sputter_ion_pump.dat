50|$|An ion pump (also {{referred}} to as a <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump)</b> is a type of vacuum pump capable of reaching pressures as low as 10−11 mbar under ideal conditions. An ion pump ionizes gas within the vessel it is attached to and employs a strong electrical potential, typically 3-7 kV, which allows the ions to accelerate into and be captured by a solid electrode and its residue.|$|E
5000|$|The first ion pump {{was invented}} by Varian Associates, now Agilent. The {{original}} activity of Varian, co-founded in 1948 by Russell Varian, {{the inventor of the}} Klystron, and his brother Sigurd, was in the field of microwave electron tubes. Robert Jepsen joined the company in 1951 and soon became director of the Klystron research group. His investigation about electronic vacuum pumping led in 1957 to the realization of the first <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> (SIP), later named VacIon pump, of which he was co-inventor.The pump was developed as an appendage pump for maintaining Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) in microwave power tubes after processing, but soon after honeycomb-shaped anodes and commercial VacIon pumps with speeds of thousands of liters per second were produced. Lewis Hall and John Helmer were members of the research team, involved in the choice of the most suitable cathode material and in the optimization of the ion pump design. Sherm Rutherford joined Varian in February 1959 in the Central Research Department (which, soon after, spun off the Vacuum Division). His activity, working for Robert Jepsen, was to study the behavior of the <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> (in terms of pumping speed and discharge intensity I/P) over a wide range of parameters, such as magnetic field, voltage, anode cell diameter, anode cell length and pressure. Renn Zaphiropoulos joined the Vacuum Division in 1959 and was engaged in scaling up the ion pump from the original appendage pump to a full range of large pumps up to 5000 l/s [...] His group worked on high voltage feedthroughs, magnets, control units, systems, flanges, valves, sorption pumps and Titanium Sublimation Pumps (TSP). In 1960 the “slotted” titanium cathode, named “Super VacIon Pump”, was introduced on the basis of observations about noble gas pumping mechanism and unstable Argon pumping phenomena. In the same years triode pumps were invented by W.M. Brubaker (Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation) and Varian, now Agilent, began to sell them in the late ‘60s under the name “Noble Ion Pumps”, then changed the name to “Triode Ion Pumps” in the early ‘70s.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the work {{developed during the}} master internship at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The described work resulted from two initial objectives: improvement of the control system of vacuum sectors {{and the development of}} a new Pro bus-DP intelligent slave interface board for <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> controllers. Since the objectives were distinct, the work was split into two di erent projects. In the rst project, the control system for vacuum sectors of Large Hadron Collider, Super Proton Synchrotron and Complex Proton Synchrotron was improved. A new control rmware based in VHDL was developed, tested and upgraded for the control cards. The second project presented in this report involved the development of an electronic card for <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> controllers. Currently, the communication between the Pro bus network and the ion pump controllers is performed by a remote input-output station based on the ET 200 module from Siemens. The operation and status information of the ion pumps and their controllers provided to the network are limited since the remote input-output station does not acquire all the available signals. Moreover, the physical connections between the remote input-output station and each ion pump controller is done with a dedicated cable, which is prone to connection malfunctions. In order to reduce the complexity, improve the signal integrity and upgrade the monitoring and control of the ion pumps system, a new Pro bus-DP intelligent slave interface was developed. It aims to provide direct Pro bus connection to the ion pump controller and to give to the Pro bus master access to all its control signals, improving the controllers usability and exibility. In this report, the card topology, its internal modules, the rmware, the LabVIEW application and assessment tests are presented and described...|$|E

The main {{goal of the}} vacuum system is to maintain a mean pressure of 1 • 10 - 9 Torr, after condi-tioning, with a stored current of 5. 3 A per beam. The vacuum chamber is almost entirely made of aluminum. The inner surface of the chamber has a roughness of about 0. 1 - 0. 2 m Ra. The vacuum system is completely oil free and all the vacuum components are all metal type. Special RF shielded bellows were designed avoiding any sliding contact. The synchrotron radiation produced by bending magnets and wigglers is intercepted by water cooled cop-per synchrotron light absorbers.

Other workers have shown the use of conductance-voltage measurements also. This thesis describes equipment designed and built to meet the above requirements. A stainless steel ultra-high vacuum system, with an electron beam evaporator and provision for an electron bombardment substrate heater is described for use in the fabrication of thin film display devices.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the Venusian atmosphere was studied using a mass spectrometer on the Pioneer Venus sounder probe. The single-focusing magnetic-sector spectrometer scanned the mass range from hydrogen through mercury with a dynamic range of six decades. Data taken by the mass spectrometer were {{compared with those of}} a gas chromatograph, resulting in slight discrepancies due to the use of a <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> acting as a sink for entry of rare gases through the inlet leak. A surprisingly large concentration of primordial Ar- 36 and Ar- 38 was discovered in a ratio of 5 to 1. It was concluded that the large excess of primordial argon was a valid result and that the mixing of HCl in the lower Venusian atmosphere was less than a few parts per million. Arguments against the sun as the source for excess primordial gases on Venus were presented. Concentrations of other elements such as Ne, Kr, He, S, and O were discussed. Although the mass peaks in the spectrum were real, it was not clear whether all of the chemical reactions (i. e., COS production) actually occurred in the atmosphere. Until further analysis can be made, it will be uncertain how the inlet system, which is at atmospheric temperature, affected the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{vacuum system}} of the SOLEIL storage ring makes use of {{standard}} <b>pumps,</b> like <b>Sputter</b> <b>Ion</b> <b>Pumps</b> (SIP) and Titanium Sublimation Pumps (TSP) combined with Non Evaporable Getter (NEG) coated vacuum vessels. Following the ESRF results on low gap insertion device (ID) chambers, {{it was decided to}} use, in addition to the traditional pumps, NEG coating deposited by magnetron sputtering on extruded aluminium vessels. This has been applied in an extensive way to all the straight vessels of the storage ring that means quadrupole/sextupole vessels and ID vessels, which represent about 56 % of the ring circumference. The starting configuration of the SOLEIL vacuum system included all the NEG coated low gap ID chambers among which a 10. 5 m long chamber. Conditioning of the vacuum system over an integrated beam dose of 900 A. h will be presented. The periodical re-activations of the TSP performed since the beginning of 2007 improved significantly the conditioning rate. A comparison of the vacuum behaviour of two similar cells one with NEG coating and traditional pumping versus one with only NEG coating demonstrates the ability of the NEG coating to keep alone the pressure at low level...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the SIS 18 upgrade an intense {{research}} activity started in 2005 for the production and characterisation of Ti-Zr-V coated vacuum chambers. Three new dedicated magnetron sputtering facilities were designed and commissioned to perform the coating on dipole, quadrupole and short straight chambers [1, 2]. The surface chemical composition and the activation behaviour of the produced thin films were studied at Cern by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The H 2 and CO pumping speed were investigated at GSI by transmission measurement and by means of a Fischer-Mommsen dome [3]. Before proceeding to the installation of the NEG coated chambers in the accelerator, an additional study was performed to analyse the pressure evolution during bakeout and activation. For this purpose an experimental system equivalent to a SIS 18 vacuum sector was built in the vacuum laboratory. The set-up (see Fig. 1) consists of two pumping units, both equipped with two <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> (IP) and two Ti sublimation pumps (TSP), a residual gas analyser and two gauges, mounted at the extremities of a coated SIS dipole chamber. A turbo molecular pump (TMP) is connected through a gate-valve to the system, and is valved-off {{at the end of the}} heating cycle, which follows the one typically used for the SIS 18. After the bakeout of the uncoated parts of the system at 220 °C for 157 hours, the temperature of the dipole chamber is raised from 120 °C to 210 °C, and kept at that temperature for 24 hours to perform the NEG activation. The pressures recorded before and after the heating cycle were respectively 6. 1 x 10 - 8 mbar and 5. 3 x 10 - 12 mbar in the first pumping unit and 1. 4 x 10 - 7 and 6. 3 x 10 - 12 mbar in the second pumping unit...|$|R
40|$|For {{sensors and}} {{actuators}} that use microdischarges, microfabrication technology provides both portability {{and ease of}} integration into microsystems. This thesis investigates two types of microfabricated devices: <b>sputter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> (SIP) to control on-chip vacuum, and miniature radiation detectors for sensing beta particles, gamma rays or neutrons. The SIP utilizes lithographically micromachined Penning cell array to ignite a plasma at pressures as low as 1. 5 µTorr. The system pressure is reduced from 1 Torr to 2000 V for commercial devices. The resulting power consumption is 100 - 250 mW. The overall pump volume is 0. 2 cm 3. A microfabricated neutron detector, operating in the Geiger Muller regime, utilizes electrodes that are lithographically micromachined from 50 -µm thick stainless steel # 304 foil. The cathode is coated with 2. 9 -µm thick layer of Gd on one side to convert thermal neutrons into fast electrons and gamma rays, which are then detected by ionization of the fill gas (Ar). Three electrodes are stacked in a cathode-anode-cathode arrangement, separated by 70 -µm thick polyamide spacers, and assembled within a commercial TO- 5 package. For a 90 µCi 252 Cf neutron source, {{placed at a distance}} of 10 cm from the detector, the total neutron count rate with an applied voltage of 285 V is typically 8. 7 counts per minute (cpm). Detector dead time is measured as 5. 3 ms. The device is operated at lower voltages with a reduced volume and can detect beta particles, gamma rays and neutrons, when compared to commercial devices which operate at > 900 V, have a higher detector volume (> 100 mm 3) and can only detect a subset of the listed radiation. Finally, this thesis describes a new architecture for microdischarge based radiation detectors intended to enhance stability, improve sensitivity and reduce dead time. The device stability can be improved through use of an asymmetric electric field between the anode and cathode. Detector sensitivity can be improved through use of stacked cathodes as it increases radiation interaction probability. The device dead time can be improved by having multiple detectors operate in parallel...|$|R

There are 124 <b>Sputter</b> <b>ion</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> at the storage ring. It {{was a very important}} problem to solve the problem how to control such a large number of vacuum pumps distributed around the ring. The cost of interfaces is also a large problem. After discussions, we decided to develop a serial to Ethernet interface device sever that will be mounted in the control System Rack. It has a 32 -bits microprocessor; Embedded Linux, 16 ports RS 485 (or RS 232) Slave interface, one channel 10 / 100 BaseT Ethernet Host port, one channel UART Host port, and 8 Mbytes large Memory buffer. Evacuation of gases in the storage ring is done by control the current in the titanium filaments in the vacuum pump. These vacuum pumps are connected to Ion-Pump Serial Controllers, which chop the AC current so as to control the current in the pumps. The EMSDS connect either 100 BaseTx or 10 BaseT Ethernet networks to asynchronous serial ports for communication with serial device. It can simultaneously control up to 12 Ion-Pump serial controllers. 12 EMSDS are connected to a personal computer (PC) through the network. The PC can automatically control the EMSDS by sending a set of commands through the TCP/IP network. Upon receiving a command from a PC running under Windows 2000 through the network, the EMSDS communicate through the slave serial interface ports to Ion-Pump Controller.

However, the mechanism of action is not completely understood in most cases, and even remains largely unknown in other cases. In the present review we discuss the most recent insights into the interaction between mono- and polyoxometalate <b>ions</b> with <b>ion</b> <b>pumps,</b> with a particular focus on the interaction of decavanadate with Ca 2 +- ATPase. We also compare the proposed mode of action with those of established <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitors which are currently in therapeutic use. Of the 18 classes of compounds which are known to act as <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitors, the complete mechanism of inhibition is only known for a handful. It has, however, been established that most <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitors bind mainly to the E 2 <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> conformation within the membrane domain from the extracellular side and block the cation release. Polyoxometalates such as decavanadate, in contrast, interact with Ca 2 +- ATPase near the nucleotide binding site domain or at a pocket involving several cytoplasmic domains, and therefore needs to cross through the membrane bilayer. In contrast to monomeric vanadate, which only binds to the E 2 conformation, decavanadate binds to all protein conformations, i. e. E 1, E 1 P, E 2 and E 2 P. Moreover, the specific interaction of decavanadate with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +- ATPase has been shown to be non-competitive with respect to ATP and induces protein cysteine oxidation with concomitant vanadium reduction which might explain the high inhibitory capacity of V 10, (IC 50 = 15 µM) which is quite similar to the majority of the established therapeutic drugs...|$|R
