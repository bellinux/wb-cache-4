40|$|Educational {{institutions}} {{are an important}} part of the formal social support system. Students with visual impairments are in need of special social support to meet their educational needs and efficient functioning of the professional and everyday life. By the indirect interview, conducted with 32 blind adolescents, their parents and with the same number of adolescents and their parents of the control group, we collected data on the level and content of the observed and expected (concrete, informational and emotional) social support of educational institutions for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> their families. Statistical analysis revealed a number of significant differences between experimental and control groups and within the experimental group. A glance at the results shows that all differences between observed and expected levels of social support of educational institutions, according to rates of blind adolescents and their parents are significant, as well as all differences between the experimental and control groups in the perception of the expected level of social support of educational institutions.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the way general teachers teach <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms {{and the challenges}} facing them. The intention was specifically {{to find out the}} ways general teachers adapt their teaching to make sure that inclusion of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> is appreciated and realized. Furthermore, it intended to uncover the challenges these general teachers face when teaching <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms. This study was conducted at one of the secondary school located in southern part of the country. It employed qualitative case study design using four (4) general teachers teaching in classes having <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Data collection was done using semi-structured interviews and participant- observation methods. The findings revealed that general teachers have little knowledge about inclusive education and how it should be practiced not only for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> but for all <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs. The knowledge about inclusion and teaching in inclusive classrooms is highly needed among general teachers to practice inclusive teaching for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in a professional manner. Preparation of teaching resources,like audio and tactile materials, reading braille writings, and instructing <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> the proper ways of using their visual devices, {{is said to be the}} role of a special needs teacher. However, it is also advisable for a general teacher to have some of this knowledge in order to counteract the challenges associated <b>with</b> teaching <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms. Furthermore, findings showed that, general teachers were not using the little knowledge of teaching in inclusive classrooms they have, due to many challenges surrounding the whole inclusive teaching in secondary schools like scarcity of both general and special needs teachers and lack of commitment among them, scarcity of resource and rigid curriculum. Building from the findings, it is recommended that, the Government should improve the situation of inclusive teaching, such as training teachers in the area of special education to help them conduct their teaching properly. The government should also allocate enough funds to inclusive schools to ensure availability of teaching and learning facilities that will help facilitate teaching <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms. Finally, due to the fact that, there are few studies conducted on the area the current study has ventured on, it is recommended that, further studies should be carried out...|$|R

Willing emotional expression influences people from the environment according to our expectations if they recognize our emotions. Studies on expressing emotions in persons with visual impairments indicate the existence of the same type of spontaneous emotional expressions as in typically developing population. Also, these studies point to difficulties in presenting willing emotional expressions. The aim of this research was to determine the difference in emotional expression between high school <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> their typically developing peers. The sample consisted of 33 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> the same number of students with no developmental disabilities. Emotional states simulation scenario by Friedman et al. was used in this research. Emotional expression was assessed with regard to the level of success in simulating seven emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, fear, and neutral state). The participants' task was to simulate the given emotional states in three structured situations (uttering two sentences and a series of vowels). The simulation of emotions was recorded. On the basis of video recordings, three independent assessors measured the success in simulating emotions on a nine-point scale. By analyzing the obtained results, a statistically significant difference in emotional expression was determined between the participants with visual impairments and their peers with no developmental disabilities (F(1) = 3. 692; p= 0. 05). Arithmetic mean differences are statistically significant for simulating disgust (p= 0. 002) and surprise (p= 0. 01).

It is necessary to attract approximately 5, 000 new teachers to the field to meet the needs of the ever-increasing population of students with visual impairments requiring specialized training. This study investigated the personality and background experiences of individuals who are attracted to work as educators with students with visual impairments. A sample of 132 teachers who had been trained at either the undergraduate or graduate level and were employed within their first five years as teachers with this specialization completed the Holland Self-Directed Search (Form CP) and a Participant Profile form to ascertain the personality types and experiences of those new to the field. The study considered three variables: (1) gender, (2) race/ethnicity, (3) teacher training level and their association with Holland personality type (RIASEC). All three variables were weak predictors of the personality type of teachers of the visually impaired as indicated by Goodman and Kruskal's tau. Results of the Holland Self-Directed Search was a stronger measure of the personality type associated with becoming a teacher of students with visual impairments. The data related to the sample revealed that 65. 2 % of those responding identified themselves as Social type.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{reports on}} a study of {{self-esteem}} and empathy among 71 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> 88 sighted students. No {{significant difference was found}} between the two groups of students in their levels of self-esteem, empathy toward others, and bonding with pets. Special acknowledgments are extended to Rachelle Jones, Effie Laman, and Dwayne Matlock, doctoral students in the College of Education at Texas Tech University, and to the College of Education for funding this project. Self-esteem and empathy are important components of any child's development. As children develop a sense of self and interact with and gain experience in the world, their self-esteem is affected. Self-esteem has been defined as the value that an individual places on his or her own characteristics, qualities, abilities, and actions (Woolfolk, 2001). Baumrind (1991) suggested that the development of self-esteem (including self-regulation and competence) in children and adolescents requires an environment that provides both the freedom to explore and experiment and protection from danger.

Further it is the intention that {{the findings of this study}} will increase the understanding of the university community of the needs of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> This study was exploratory in design as the purpose was to collect as much data as possible in this area of study. A qualitative method using the non probability sampling method was used. This method allowed for the use of the researcher's judgement in identifying and selecting the respondents for the sample group. The sample consisted of 16 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> registered at the Westville Campus during the period 2003 - 2004. To ensure that the respondents understood the procedure of the investigation, the contents of the consent form was made available in alternate format.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{issues surrounding}} {{the validity of}} Pennsylvania's Alternate System of Assessment (PASA) for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> The PASA is a performance-based assessment that assesses a sub-set of math and reading skills delineated by the State's alternate standards. Data from 286 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> who took the 2005 Level A PASA at grades 3 / 4 or 7 / 8 were analyzed. Descriptive and statistical analyses compared achievement on the PASA between three groups of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> {{at different levels of}} functional vision as well as to a matched group of peers without <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> The latter comparison investigated differential item functioning (DIF) on each individual test item using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. In addition, types of accommodations made for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> to provide access to the assessment and potential factors contributing to test bias were documented. Overall, the study confirmed expected patterns of accommodation selection by functional vision level with layout/set-up accommodations being the most frequently used. It also revealed a set of test items flagged for DIF statistically that did not always coincide with the test items judgmental reviewers would expect to be problematic or different for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Among the three functional levels and the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> as a whole, 29 instances of DIF in which a test item may have been potentially harder were found.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} devoted to the education of children and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> other concurrent disabilities in the mainstream education. It is essential to note that I have not included the pupils with mental disabilities into the target group of this thesis, mainly because of the reason, that in case of the mental disability, the way of the education is being changed. The theoretical part is divided into three chapters. The first chapter focuses on the presentation of individual types of disabilities. The second chapter deals with the integration and its legislation, other ways of the education of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> concurrent disabilities and information about teacher assistants. The third chapter contains specifics of the education in particular types of disabilities (visual, auditory and physical disabilities and attention deficit disorders) and specifics of the education in the combination of the visual and other concurrent disabilities. Those impairments were chosen in connection with the practical part of the bachelor thesis. The practical part of the thesis has been defined by research objectives. The main objective is to analyse the education process at the pupils with the visual impairments and other concurrent disabilities in the mainstream education. To achieve this main objective, I chose three sub-goals. The first sub-goal is focused on the organization of lessons for the children with visual impairments and other concurrent disabilities in the mainstream education. With the help of the second research goal, I tried to find out the method of the teacher assistants´ preparation for the educational process and the third sub-goal deals with the motivation, experience and education of the teacher assistants. To meet the objectives of the practical part I chose qualitative methods of the data collection, i. e. structured interviews with open-ended questions, observations and document analysis. Most questions were posed to the teacher assistants in the interviews, then there were interviewed the teachers, especially classroom teachers and teacher of selected subjects. Those subjects were: Czech language, a foreign language, Mathematics and some of the subjects like Geography or History and some of the educational activities. Further there were made observations of the pupils with visual impairments and concurrent disabilities in their classes; they were held in preliminary specified lessons. The last used method was an analysis of the documents, specifically of the individual educational plans for four selected pupils with visual and concurrent disabilities, who are educated at the elementary or secondary mainstream schools. The target group of the bachelor thesis consists of four chosen pupils with visual impairment and other concurrent disabilities, their teachers and the teacher assistants. The research results show that the education of pupils with the visual impairment and other concurrent disabilities is possible at the adaptation of material, labour, pro-social conditions, in respect to a psycho-motoric pace of the pupils and with set rules for their stay in the classroom and in the resting place of the pupils with visual and other concurrent disabilities. As the adapted conditions there are meant modified materials enlarged texts, textbooks or overwriting of original texts and textbooks in the Braille writing. Furthermore, it is also a modification of the working environment of the pupils with visual impairments by using suitably positioned folding benches or benches with folding boards, lamps to illuminate the text and for the pupils with severe visual impairments, placing guide-lines, if they need them for their movement. Conditions must be adapted as well as to other concurrent disabilities that limit the individual even more. These include for example an orthopaedic chair, an adequate height of the working surface, a barrier-free access to school...|$|E

The lack of physical activity and issues of weight can compromise the ability of the individual who is blind or visually impaired to maneuver through the environment safely and efficiently. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the perceptions of itinerant teachers of students with visual impairments about the importance of physical activity for their <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> its effect on academic success and social relationship. Data was gathered from 175 teachers of students with visual impairments concerning their perceptions regarding the importance of physical activity and obesity and their relationship with academic success and social relationships. The teachers indicated that physical activity for their students is very important. They described a multitude of barriers that account for a lack of involvement in the general physical education classes in which they were enrolled. Teachers reported on their own personal physical activity levels in relationship to the importance they placed on their students' need to be active. The teachers did not indicate that being overweight was a particular issue with their visually impaired students, but they acknowledged that being overweight and a lack of physical activity create additional barriers for academic success and appropriate social relationships. The teachers also reported that the same barriers in physical education classes and access to recreation activities in the community that have been listed in past research studies were still in existence, and these barriers were also part of their dilemma in creating positive physical activity experiences for their students who are visually impaired.

40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo geral compreender o processo de inclusão escolar do aluno com deficiência visual a partir da percepção de professores de matemática, professores do atendimento educacional especializado e gestores educacionais. Para isso buscou-se identificar como os professores de matemática e do atendimento educacional especializado estão desenvolvendo suas funções; identificar os apoios oferecidos pelo atendimento educacional especializado aos alunos com deficiência visual e aos professores de matemática; identificar as relações estabelecidas entre professores do atendimento educacional especializado, professores de matemática e alunos com deficiência visual; analisar como professores de matemática, professores do atendimento educacional especializado e gestores educacionais percebem a inclusão escolar dos alunos com deficiência visual. Foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas com treze sujeitos, sendo três professores de matemática, quatro professores do atendimento educacional especializado, dois alunos com deficiência visual do ensino médio, duas gestoras educacionais que atuam em setores relacionados à inclusão escolar, e ainda, duas profissionais que trabalham com capacitação de professores para atuar no atendimento educacional especializado com Tecnologia Assistiva aplicada ao contexto educacional. A pesquisa foi de cunho qualitativo, do tipo estudo de caso, e teve seus dados analisados pela Análise Textual Discursiva. Desta análise emergiram três categorias sendo elas denominadas como, “Os diferentes papéis dos sujeitos envolvidos no cenário da inclusão escolar”, “O papel das instituições” e ainda “O processo de inclusão escolar dos alunos com deficiência visual”. Na primeira categoria discute-se o papel atribuído aos professores de matemática e do atendimento educacional especializado e, também, o que se espera do aluno com deficiência visual e de sua família na visão dos sujeitos da pesquisa. Na segunda categoria evidenciam-se como os entrevistados percebem as atribuições da escola e do Estado para que a inclusão do aluno com deficiência visual ocorra de fato. Na terceira categoria discute-se como está ocorrendo o processo de inclusão escolar dos alunos com deficiência visual, como as relações entre os sujeitos estão estabelecidas e quais os recursos que favorecem a inclusão. Entre outros resultados, a análise evidenciou que os alunos com deficiência visual estão sendo bem contemplados com recursos didáticos, mas que ainda falta parceria e articulação entre os professores de matemática e do atendimento educacional especializado, pois estão trabalhando de forma isolada. This {{paper had}} as main objective {{to understand the}} school inclusion process {{of students with visual}} impairments from the perception of mathematics teachers, teachers of specialized educational services and educational managers. With this, we attempted to identify how mathematics teachers and specialized educational services teachers are developing their roles, to identify the supports offered by specialized educational services to visually impaired students and to mathematics teachers, identifying the relationships established between specialized educational services teachers, mathematics teachers and students with visual impairment, to analyze how mathematics teachers, specialized educational services teachers and educational managers perceive school inclusion {{of students with visual impairments}}. Thirteen subjects were interviewed: three mathematics teachers, four specialized educational services teachers, two students with visual impairments from high school, two educational managers who work in sectors related to school inclusion and also, two professionals who work to qualify teachers to operate at specialized educational services with Technology assistive applied to the educational context. The research was a qualitative nature, one type of case study, and had their data analyzed by Textual Discourse Analysis. In this analysis, three categories emerged and they termed as, "The different roles of those involved in scenario of school inclusion", "The role of institutions" and also "The school inclusion process of students with visual impairments" In the first category discusses the role assigned to mathematics teachers and to specialized educational services teachers, also, what is expected from <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> from their families in the view of the research subjects. In the second category are evident as interviewees perceive the school and the State assignments so the inclusion of students with visual impairment indeed occurred. In the third category discusses how the process is going to school inclusion of students with visual impairments, as relationships are established between the subject and the resources that encouraged inclusiveness. Among other results, the analysis showed that students with visual impairments are being well covered with teaching resources, but still lack coordination and partnership among mathematics teachers and the specialized educational services teachers because they are working in isolation from others...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{two aspects of}} the use of paraprofessionals <b>with</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments: 1) the effect of paraprofessional proximity on the students' interactions with peers and teachers in the regular education classroom, and 2) factors that may influence a paraprofessional's decision to interact or not interact <b>with</b> a <b>student</b> <b>with</b> a <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The four student/paraprofessional case studies included data collected by means of classroom observations, demographic forms, and semi-structured interviews. The classroom observation data were analyzed using the chi-square statistics to determine relationships between paraprofessional proximity and classroom activity setting, interaction participants, interaction initiators, and type of interaction that occurred. The data collected through the interviews were coded to determine themes. The data from all the case studies were cross analyzed to determine relationships and themes across cases. Proximity of paraprofessionals to <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in the regular education classroom appears to {{have an effect on the}} interactions that occur between <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments,</b> peers, and teachers. More interactions occurred between students and peers and between students and teachers when paraprofessionals were at a distance. Also, when paraprofessionals were at a distance, peers and teachers were more likely to initiate interactions <b>with</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> The decision making process for paraprofessionals is complicated. Factors that may influence how paraprofessionals make decisions concerning <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> were professional experience, personal experience, education level and type, and how roles and responsibilities were defined. All the paraprofessionals in the study indicated at some point during data collection the need to promote independence in their students...|$|R
40|$|<b>With</b> {{inclusion}} of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in mainstream schools, we guarantee {{them the right}} to equally participate in all activities – including sports. However research and practice reports show, that students often do not receive the necessary sports experiences, which consequently disclose a lower level of physical fitness, lower extent of motor skills and slower motor development. On the other hand, we meet with teachers – physical education teachers, who are introduced to a very heterogenic population, with which they do not have enough knowledge, competencies and experiences to work. In the empirical part of this master’s thesis we examined to what extent the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> were included in sports activities and with what challenges the physical education teachers are facing. For this we designed a semi-structured interview, based on theoretical findings. The results show that physical education teachers consider that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> are included in sports activities, {{but at the same time}} they show lack of knowledge in areas of adapting the school environment, equipment, aids and usage of different teaching methods. Inclusion is also mostly dependent on whether or not the activity, which is carried out, is that of an individual or group form. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> tend to be excluded from activities that are in a group and ball games. The majority of the focus is on the <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> rather than on a constructive and team way of solving the existing challenges. In the last part of the master’s thesis we have written the basic recommendations and guidelines that enable physical education teachers to plan, execute and evaluate the educational process easier and of better quality. At the same time we were able to emphasize the importance of cooperating with other experts, primarily teachers of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments,</b> <b>with</b> the purpose of increasing the level of inclusion among <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in sports activities. With this we can also achieve a long-term enabling of these <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the development of their potential on all the developmental areas and ensure a more independent and autonomic life of a much better quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{instructional}} experiences of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in an guided inquiry-based science classroom. Drawing from social constructive perspectives about teaching and learning, I focused on the initial attempts of students to participate fully in an inquiry-based astronomy unit. The astronomy unit incorporated features of project-based science inquiry and aligned with national standards. This study described the opportunities provided to and challenges faced by <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> as they participated in the guided inquiry-based learning environment. Additionally, discursive practices of students including student-generated questions, student discussions, and students' science notebook writing were examined. Also, students' alternative conceptions about scientific phenomena and changes in students' thinking during the course of instruction, if any, were described. Methods of data collection included classroom observations, video records, pre- and post- curriculum assessments, attitudes toward science measurement, student interviews, and student artifacts (i. e., science notebook entries, student-constructed models). Findings showed that student learning was enhanced when the instructor-researcher guided students in accomplishing inquiry tasks and in making sense of their inquiry experiences. Additionally, the use of appropriate reflective prompts assisted <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> to fully participate in the writing tasks of the inquiry-based learning environment. Results suggested that the quantity and quality of student-generated questions increased with extended inquiry instruction. Also, students used questions to not only establish verbal communication, but to elaborate on their own thinking and expand or explain the thinking of others. Findings suggested also that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have similar alternative frameworks about scientific phenomena (i. e, causes of lunar phases, reason for the seasons) as do their peers with sight. This study contributes to the literature about inquiry-based instructional strategies for all students and initiates the conversation about best practice for science instruction <b>with</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment...</b>|$|R

A convenient sample of 100 students was taken from these schools. A three point rating scale was used as research instrument. Researchers personally collected data from the respondents. Data was analyzed through SPSS. Major findings showed that students were more interested in Braille system than computer software. Braille system and required material was resent in all the schools while computer teachers with required experience were not available in these institutions. Teachers were found expert in Braille literacy as compare to the computer software- It was recommended that proper awareness about most recent technologies were necessary for teachers in special education institutions. Students as well as teachers should be provided chances of hands on practice to create interest in computer software use in special education...|$|R

The first teacher taught seasonal change concepts to middle school <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> using traditional instruction methodologies. The second teacher taught the same concepts using inquiry-based methodologies. Both classroom teachers were interviewed in order to probe their thinking about their classroom practices and the strategies they used. Upon completion of the inquiry-based lessons, the inquiry-based teacher stated that she will continue to utilize these lessons {{in the future and}} will not change any lessons. The traditional group teacher stated he would not make any changes but would add only a few units before teaching seasons. Both felt that students learned the reasons for seasons.

40|$|Regular {{education}} teachers are sometimes {{at a disadvantage}} when required to instruct learners <b>with</b> a <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> or other special needs in the classroom. A problem exists with reduced support and training for regular {{education teachers}} responsible for meeting literacy needs of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The purpose of this qualitative interpretive case {{study was to explore}} regular education instructors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their self-efficacy and ability to modify literature for learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The research questions targeted this purpose, specifically in the areas of training opportunities and technology use. The social cognitive theory, a model emphasizing learning occurring through social contexts and observations, was used as the conceptual framework for this study. Data were collected from 1 -on- 1 interviews with 10 volunteer regular education teachers teaching students at the elementary level. The resulting data were analyzed via color-coding transcripts, NVivo running word-frequency queries, and manual review of each transcript. The results revealed the participants did not have training, awareness for the literacy needs of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> or knowledge of the different types of technology used to access and create literacy materials.
