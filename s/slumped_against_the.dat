25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, dropped to his knees, and threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> car, then fell on the curb, dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E
2500|$|While {{an unarmed}} Kennaway {{physically}} restrained the driver, Glennon, {{armed with the}} Derringer, gave cover beside the van as [...] McWilliams opened the side door on the left at the rear, and shouted the words: [...] "Armed INLA volunteers". With {{a smile on his}} face, he then took up a firing stance and aimed his PA63 pistol inside the van at Wright, who was sitting sideways facing the side door beside Norman Green, with Prison Officer Stephen Sterritt seated behind the driver. Wright had been {{in the middle of a}} conversation, discussing the [...] "cost of Christmas", with both men. After McWilliams ordered Sterritt to [...] "fuck up and sit in his seat" [...] and Green to get out of the way, the two men instantly dropped to the floor to protect themselves; however, Wright stood up and kicked out at his assailant who began firing at point blank range. Green pleaded with Wright to [...] "get down", but McWilliams climbed into the van and continued shooting at Wright, hitting him a total of seven times. Wright, despite being shot, continued to defend himself by moving forward, kicking and lashing out at McWilliams. Wright was fatally wounded by the last shot, the bullet having lacerated his aorta. He <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> legs of Green. After screaming [...] "they shot Billy", Green made an attempt to resuscitate Wright, but to no avail; he was brought to the prison hospital, where a doctor pronounced him dead at 10.53 a.m. None of the others inside the van were hurt. Immediately following the shooting attack, the three gunmen returned the way they had come and surrendered to prison guards. They handed over a statement:Billy Wright was executed for one reason and one reason only, and that was for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell in Long Kesh [...]|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 31, 1901, while off Cavite in Manila Bay, a fire started aboard the Petrel {{originating}} in the sail room. The sail room was a small compartment {{in the bottom of}} the ship, adjacent to the magazine and was accessible only by a hatchway from the berth deck above. Several members of the ship's crew, led by the ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper took turns entering the compartment and fighting the blaze. The fire produced no visible flames but thick, acrid smoke and fumes filled the area. The sail room was also pitch black; the ship's electric generator had been turned off at dawn, and no other lamps would work in the harsh atmosphere of the compartment. A number of men, including Roper, were overcome by the bad air and were pulled out of the sail room semi-conscious. As the fumes grew thicker and more noxious, Roper ordered everyone out of the compartment, but one sailor, Seaman Patrick Toner, did not emerge from the room. When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him, including Roper (not fully recovered from his first trip below). When the four men did not return, Seaman Alphonse Girandy tied a rope around his waist and climbed down the ladder, finding Kessler and Flaherty, both semi-conscious, and passing them up to be hauled through the hatchway. He found Toner at the bottom of the ladder and, although losing consciousness himself, held on to him as the sailors above pulled both men out of the compartment. Lieutenant J.S. McKean, with a rope around his waist, was next into the sail room, followed by Private Louis F. Thies (Pfiefer) and Seaman Thomas Cahey. As McKean searched in the darkness for the two men still missing, Lieutenant Commander Roper and Cadet Lewis, the ship's generator finally came back online. With the help of a lamp lowered through the hatchway, McKean could see Roper and Lewis <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> walls of the compartment. McKean dragged Roper to the ladder to be hauled out and then, with the help of Theis and Cahey, rescued Lewis, just before losing consciousness himself. The fire was extinguished later that day; Roper was killed by the fumes, but the other men all eventually recovered. For their actions during the incident, Cahey, Girandy, and Thies were each awarded the Medal of Honor. Pfeifer received his medal on March 22, 1902, while still going by the name of Louis Fred Theis.

50|$|In 1998, Towson’s 30th {{season of}} football, the Tigers {{showed signs of}} improvement. The Tigers {{got off to a}} 2-0 start, beating rival Morgan State in the opener. They also claimed their first Patriot League win, beating Fordham in overtime. After a midseason <b>slump</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> league’s heavyweights, the Tigers beat St. Mary’s and Drake. Garrett was a first team All-Patriot League pick at {{defensive}} back for a second straight year. Jason Corle led the league in rushing, scoring and all-purpose yards, earning second team all-league honors.|$|R
25|$|Spurrier next had an {{opportunity}} to start in the fifth game of the 1973 season, when he replaced a <b>slumping</b> Brodie <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota Vikings. He set team records with 31 completions and 320 passing yards, but he also tossed two interceptions, and the 49ers lost 17-14. With Spurrier suffering from a lingering knee injury, 49ers Coach Nolan decided to start fellow backup Joe Reed the following week, and Spurrier's playing time was again limited.|$|R

With storm clouds approaching, the pair head for home. However, the dragon is shot in the wing by the hunters and crashes outside the railway tunnel, knocking Emily unconscious. Putting her out of harm's way, the Dragon scares off the hunters and their dogs before <b>slumping</b> down <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tunnel wall and seemingly disappearing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{woman in}} the lower right panel taps the Hero on the hat with her parasol. He pulls her close and kisses her. She draws a knife but, mesmerized by his kiss, turns away and <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> side of the frame. He tips his hat and walks away {{with his back to}} the camera. There were two {{versions}} of this vignette; this one appears during the first season. When the show switched to color, the Hero knocked the woman down with a right cross to the jaw. This variant also appears in the original pilot episode (included on the DVD release) when the series was titled The Wild West. Despite this, James West never hit a woman in any episode, although he grappled with many. The closest he came was when he slammed a door <b>against</b> <b>the</b> shotgun holding evil Countess Zorana in [...] "The Night of the Iron Fist". In [...] "The Night of the Running Death" [...] he slugged a woman named Miss Tyler, but [...] "she" [...] was a man in drag (actor T. C. Jones). The original animation, with the Hero winning the woman over with a kiss, was a more accurate representation of West's methods than the right cross. Ironically, it is another example of the emphasis on violence of the show.|$|R

Frazier then {{retreated to the}} corner where Tyson {{continue}} to use his left jab before unleashing two consecutive uppercuts, the second of which knocked Frazier unconscious. Tyson then landed several more blows before Frazier fell to the canvas, <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ropes. Referee Joe Cortez began to count to ten, but as Frazier was clearly unresponsive, stopped the count at five and ended the fight. The fight would last only 30 seconds, becoming the quickest victory of Tyson's professional career.|$|E
50|$|Morrison {{got off to}} a great start, outboxing a {{sluggish}} Mercer through the first three rounds en route to taking all three rounds on all three of the judge's scorecards. Morrison was able to limit Mercer's offense, landed several combinations and opened up a cut on Mercer's lower lip. However, Mercer rebounded with a strong round four, landing several hard rights to Morrison's head. Mercer would end the fight only 28 seconds into the fifth round. With Morrison backed up into the corner, Mercer was able to land a 15-punch combination. Clearly hurt from the exchange, Morrison <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ropes, but the referee allowed Mercer to land several more punishing blows to a now defenseless Morrison before finally ending the fight.|$|E

50|$|A C.I.A. Agent (001) {{is walking}} up to an embassy of the USSR {{carrying}} a briefcase, while a nearby C.I.A. Agent (002) keeps a lookout with binoculars in a nearby van. Behind C.I.A. 001, a Russian K.G.B. Agent (001) shadows him as they walk into the Embassy. Inside, C.I.A. 001 is making a business transaction with K.G.B. 002, a double agent who sells off a roll of camera film for the briefcase full of U.S. currency. With their business done, C.I.A. 001 offers K.G.B. 002 a cigar to which he happily obliges. C.I.A. 001 smirks as K.G.B. 002 takes his last puff and the cigar explodes, blowing off K.G.B. 002's face. C.I.A. 001 slips the film into his vest pocket, grabs the briefcase and leaves the office. In {{the lobby of the}} embassy, two K.G.B. Agents (003 and 004) are shooting a film with a camera, while a nearby C.I.A. Agent (003) sits around listlessly with his briefcase. K.G.B. 003 turns to face C.I.A. 001 with the camera and shoots him at point-blank range. Seeing this, C.I.A. 003 immediately stands up and shoots K.G.B. 003 with his briefcase. As K.G.B. 003 falls down dead, K.G.B. 004 pulls out her silenced Skorpion sub-machine gun and fires at C.I.A. 003, shooting him in the back and killing him as he dives behind cover. K.G.B. 004 kneels down to the deceased C.I.A. 001 and steals the camera film as C.I.A. Agents 004 and 005 storm the lobby with silenced MAC 10 submachine guns. K.G.B. 004 gets to an elevator and fires out from cover, impeding the C.I.A. agents' pursuit as the elevator doors close. Inside the elevator, K.G.B. 004 inspects the film and puts it into a Dead Drop Spike. The elevator doors open and K.G.B. 004 comes face-to-face with K.G.B. 001 with both their guns raised at each other. Recognizing each other, the agents lower their weapons and leave as K.G.B. 004 gives 001 the Dead Drop Spike. Outside the embassy, K.G.B. Agent 005 awaits his fellow agents, unaware that he is being watched by C.I.A. 002 from across the street. Back inside the embassy, K.G.B. 001 and 004 are making their way through a kitchen when C.I.A. 004 and 005 catch up to them. The C.I.A. agents open fire, wounding K.G.B. 001 as K.G.B. 004 fires back, shoving the wounded K.G.B. 001 out of the crossfire. C.I.A. 004 and 005 dive for cover behind the counter and move their way up with C.I.A. 005 pushing a serving dolly in front of her. As C.I.A. 005 nears the end of the counter, K.G.B. 004 runs up and gets behind {{the other side of the}} dolly, pushing objects down on C.I.A. 005. Both agents stand up and struggle to shoot each other, but K.G.B. 004 gets the upper hand and kills the female C.I.A. agent. While she is still standing, C.I.A. 004 pops out and quickly dispatches the femme fatale with a short burst of machine gun fire. Meanwhile, the wounded K.G.B. 001 agent makes his way upstairs, while C.I.A. 004 pursues closely, following his bloody trail to a nearby restroom. As C.I.A. 004 prepares to inspect a stall, K.G.B. 001 jumps out and engages the agent, clicking his heels together and unsheathing a shoe knife. The K.G.B. agent kicks and manhandles the C.I.A. agent, but C.I.A. 004 manages to retaliate by plunging the MAC into his stomach and firing, killing K.G.B. 001. As K.G.B. 001 <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, C.I.A. 004 reaches into his pockets and takes the Dead Drop Spike. He attempts to open it, but fails to open it the correct way and is blown up. Outside, K.G.B. 005 hears the explosion and gets out of his car, stuffing his Skorpion into his coat as he enters the embassy. Across the street, C.I.A. 002 sees the careless agent exiting his car and leaves the safety of his van. Inside the embassy, K.G.B. 005 sees the carnage caused by the now deceased C.I.A. and K.G.B. agents. With the film roll destroyed and the C.I.A. killed in action, the K.G.B. agent returns to his car, unaware that C.I.A. 002 is lying in wait. As K.G.B. 005 attempts to start his car, C.I.A. 002 pops out from the back seat with a garrote wire and strangles the K.G.B. agent. The agent struggles helplessly as the wire cuts into his neck, then relaxes into death and <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> seat. His job finished, the C.I.A. agent exits the car, wiping his bloodied hands with a towel and adjusting his scarf as he walks away.|$|R

They handed over a statement:Billy Wright was executed for one reason and one reason only, and that was for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell in Long Kesh Maze.|$|E
50|$|In the wrap-around, Kevin, {{an amateur}} videographer {{constantly}} shoots footage of his girlfriend Iris, which she claims to enjoy. As we watch these initial images it becomes apparent that Kevin's mother is abusive, {{at one point}} bloodying his nose off-screen. Later in the evening a high speed pursuit near his neighborhood is broadcast on television, he sees the opportunity to create a viral video. But, he {{is too late to}} shoot footage as the truck speeds past his house, though he sees Iris wander outside in a daze, after receiving a mysterious video call, and get abducted. Kevin chases after the truck, egged on by images of Iris broadcast to his cell phone. The truck circles the neighborhood repeatedly, and people receive strange images on their cell phones that cause them to become violently insane. When Kevin finally catches up to the truck he sees body parts strewn on the ground around it. He examines the driver's seat only to find it empty but with a pair of disembodied hands duct taped to the wheel. Upon examining {{the back of the truck}} he finds a number of televisions stacked atop each other as in the first two movies. Iris appears on one of the tv screens and demands that Kevin upload the footage to broadcasters and presumably the internet as well. At first he refuses but does as she says when Iris begins to brutally mutilate herself. The deed done, he exits the truck as the image of Iris on the screen continues to taunt him. Outside he discovers Iris' dead body <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> truck with her cellphone stuck in her mouth. Kevin realizes that he has been manipulated into uploading the videos and that Iris had been dead for some time. He pulls the phone out of her mouth and sees that it's in selfie-mode. He stares in shock at himself on the screen. The closing shot shows a view of the Los Angeles skyline, smoke billowing up, lights flickering on and off and a helicopter circling overhead, implying the uploaded videos have gone viral and have begun to affect thousands, thus fulfilling the grander threat introduced in the first two films.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of March 31, 1901, while off Cavite in Manila Bay, a fire started aboard the Petrel {{originating}} in the sail room. The sail room was a small compartment {{in the bottom of}} the ship, adjacent to the magazine and was accessible only by a hatchway from the berth deck above. Several members of the ship's crew, led by the ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper took turns entering the compartment and fighting the blaze. The fire produced no visible flames but thick, acrid smoke and fumes filled the area. The sail room was also pitch black; the ship's electric generator had been turned off at dawn, and no other lamps would work in the harsh atmosphere of the compartment. A number of men, including Roper, were overcome by the bad air and were pulled out of the sail room semi-conscious. As the fumes grew thicker and more noxious, Roper ordered everyone out of the compartment, but one sailor, Seaman Patrick Toner, did not emerge from the room. When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him, including Roper (not fully recovered from his first trip below). When the four men did not return, Seaman Alphonse Girandy tied a rope around his waist and climbed down the ladder, finding Kessler and Flaherty, both semi-conscious, and passing them up to be hauled through the hatchway. He found Toner at the bottom of the ladder and, although losing consciousness himself, held on to him as the sailors above pulled both men out of the compartment. Lieutenant J.S. McKean, with a rope around his waist, was next into the sail room, followed by Private Louis F. Thies (Pfiefer) and Seaman Thomas Cahey. As McKean searched in the darkness for the two men still missing, Lieutenant Commander Roper and Cadet Lewis, the ship's generator finally came back online. With the help of a lamp lowered through the hatchway, McKean could see Roper and Lewis <b>slumped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> walls of the compartment. McKean dragged Roper to the ladder to be hauled out and then, with the help of Theis and Cahey, rescued Lewis, just before losing consciousness himself. The fire was extinguished later that day; Roper was killed by the fumes, but the other men all eventually recovered. For their actions during the incident, Cahey, Girandy, and Thies were each awarded the Medal of Honor. Pfeifer received his medal on March 22, 1902, while still going by the name of Louis Fred Theis. His complete citation states: ...|$|E
5000|$|Lindsey {{destroys the}} Sahrvin demon clan with Lorne's {{assistance}} as planned. However, Angel knows Lindsey {{can never be}} trusted. Consequently, Angel secretly instructs Lorne to assassinate Lindsey once the Sahrvin are eliminated. Lindsey insists to Lorne he has changed. But Lorne, no longer Lindsey's friend, remarks that he can't change, shooting Lindsey twice in the chest with a silenced pistol. A stunned Lindsey <b>slumps</b> <b>against</b> a wall, both outraged and humiliated {{he was killed by}} one of Angel's [...] "flunkies" [...] instead of the vampire himself.|$|R
50|$|On April 24, 1980, two {{teenagers}} stumbled across a body, early in <b>the</b> morning. <b>Slumped</b> <b>against</b> a trash can, and carrying no identification, the body bore no clear indicators of foul play. Cause {{of death was}} determined to be asphyxiation, as a large chunk of flesh was extracted from the victim's throat. Every potential clue leads to small revelations, but bigger mysteries. Though the investigation is lightly bungled, everything seems inexplicable, from how the fish-dinner stomach contents could line up with his ferry boat crossing, to the single Russian coin in his pocket.|$|R
5000|$|Constable Krempkau {{went to a}} saloon {{next door}} to {{retrieve}} his rifle and pistol. A confrontation erupted with ex-City Marshal George Campbell over comments allegedly made by Campbell about Krempkau’s interpretations and his friendship with the Mexicans. John Hale, who was allegedly unarmed, was heavily intoxicated and upset with Constable Krempkau’s involvement in the investigation. Hale pulled one of Campbell's two pistols and yelled, [...] "George, I've got you covered!". He shot Krempkau, who then reeled backward. <b>Slumping</b> <b>against</b> a saloon door, Krempkau pulled out his own pistol.|$|R
