50|$|The tallest {{building}} in George is the airport radar tower. The concrete tower stands at 45m and 8 storeys (including the <b>spherical</b> <b>radome,</b> it stands at 55m). The George Medi-Clinic building (previously Lamprecht Clinic) stands at 40m and 8 storeys.|$|E
50|$|Each {{receiver}} comprised a large <b>spherical</b> <b>radome</b> {{mounted on}} the top of a 25 m fixed mast. This radome, made of identical segments of polyurethane foam, contained the radio antennas and the microwave components, intermediate frequency preamplifiers and the two-way communications equipment for communicating between central and side sites. At first glance the system bore a striking resemblance to typical Eastern European water towers.|$|E
25|$|Each {{platform}} {{was equipped}} with one AN/FPS-3 (later upgraded to AN/FPS-20) search radar and two AN/FPS-6 height finder radars, each housed in a separate <b>spherical</b> neoprene <b>radome</b> 55 feet in diameter. Originally the towers were {{to be linked to}} shore by submarine cable, but this was eventually rejected as too costly; the AN/FRC-56 tropospheric scatter microwave link was installed instead, with an array of three parabolic antennas attached to one edge of the platform. UHF and VHF equipment allowed communication with ships and aircraft as well as providing a backup to the microwave link.|$|R
40|$|The exact {{mathematical}} model of an aperture antenna {{and the image}} theory are used to develop exact and PO integral representations of the fields radiated by radome-enclosed aperture antenna. The desired problem is reduced to finding fields of a plane wave diffracted on the "symmetrized" radome. The passage of the wave through {{the wall of the}} radome is analysed by means of geometrical optics. Caustic influence is taken into account, and the contribution of stationary phase points of reflected field to the far-side radiation is discussed.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the application of}} the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to <b>spherical</b> and <b>radome</b> geometries. The boundary of the solution domain was discretized by using both linear and quadratic elements and the validity of the results were compared against other analytical and numerical methods. Several improvements to the BEM have been presented. These include the efficient evaluation of the singular integrals where new methods have been implemented and compared with other schemes. Improvement is also shown by the implementation of the semi-continuous elements to solve the well known limitation of the Corner Problems present in the BEM. Exhaustive numerical experimentation is carried out to establish the optimum collocation point for the semi-continuous elements and to link this to the quadrature rule used for the integration of that element. The present study also includes the limitations of the BEM in applications involving geometries of long and thin sections. The study shows in detail the circumstances under which accurate results can be expected in the BEM. In this case, the emphasis is placed on the element size and the section thickness. A relationship linking these two parameters in the control of the accuracy of the BEM results is also established. For the surface stresses and strains of the domain, a detailed implementation of a natural cubic spline is illustrated which greatly improved these surface results...|$|R
50|$|The tower's height {{has some}} {{functional}} purpose, since its roof supports meteorological instruments and radio communications equipment, plus a white <b>spherical</b> <b>radome</b> enclosing long-distance weather radar apparatus. This technical equipment all requires a line-of-sight vantage point for optimum range and accuracy, {{and would have}} required construction {{of some kind of}} tower to function as intended. To minimize interference with radio signals, other buildings on MIT's central campus are less than half the height of the Green Building, and the dormitory towers of Eastgate, Westgate, and MacGregor House are at least 1500 feet (450 m) away.|$|E

5000|$|Peace Walker is {{the name}} given to an {{autonomous}} nuclear weapons platform in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. Developed in secret by disavowed CIA agent Coldman and deployed to Costa Rica in 1974, Peace Walker was designed to prove that nuclear deterrence is a myth by objectively and logically assessing {{the threat of a}} nuclear exchange and retaliating in kind. Peace Walker is quadrupedal in form, with a <b>spherical</b> <b>radome</b> [...] "head" [...] and a cylindrical AI core functioning as its brain.

The electric far field radiation pattern is determined for a uniformly illuminated, linearly polarized circular aperture transmitting through a dielectric radome {{located in the}} near field of the aperture. A modified electric field integral equation is solved using the method of moments procedure and the thin shell approximation for dielectrics. The resulting solution was computer coded for ogive and <b>spherical</b> <b>radome</b> shapes.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the principle of}} two types of conformable and controllable <b>spherical</b> <b>radome</b> based on Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) materials operating at around 10 GHz. The EBG structure is composed of a grid of metallic wires conformed on a hollow spherical object. Two switching control configurations are considered: (1) between an EBG structure made of electrically continuous wires and another one made of discontinuous wires, and (2) between two EBG structures made of discontinuous wires where each has a different period of discontinuities. Both switching configurations are simulated and experimentally characterized on passive prototypes. An excellent agreement is observed between simulations and measurements. The radiation patterns of two types of antennas, a horn antenna and a meteorological antenna, are also measured {{in the presence of}} the radome...|$|E
40|$|The paper sets a task {{to design}} {{protection}} covers (PC) of large aperature antennas {{to be used}} in difficult climatic conditions of operation, wide range of temperatures or under specified requirements for the operation mode of equipment. Methods to analyse the influence of antenna covers and radomes on characteristics of antennas radiation vary depending on the electrical size and complexity of the PC structure. Both strict methods of the electrodynamic analysis, and quasioptical approximations can be applied. The aim of research was to define the influence of thickness of a single-layer radome {{in the form of a}} cylindrical or spherical cover on radiation characteristics of the aperture antenna with antenna mouth of about several tens wavelengths in free space (λ). The second task was to establish the interrelation between the change of the directional pattern and shift of the antenna mouth with respect to the center of PC generatrix. Influence of radome thickness was assessed according to several parameters such as amplitude of the field radiated in the axial direction, reduced to results of modeling antenna without PC; level of power radiated in the conic sector with angular half-aperture of 6 °; width of the main maximum at half power with regard to the case with no radome. It is found that with increasing PC thickness there is growth of the principle pattern width at half power. Thus, it is defined that, qualitively, a difference in influence of the <b>spherical</b> <b>radome</b> and cylindrical one consists in reduction of radiation power in the axial direction, more distorted principle pattern shape, change of minor-lobe angle, and reduction of minor-lobe level. With increasing PC thickness the minor-lobe level for both cases becomes almost even, and the ratio of radiation level along the axis remains unchanged. It is shown that difference in the pattern shape gives fractions of percent for power with a shift along a system axis. Proceeding from initial simplifications, this fact can be easily explained that for the parallel output beams of an aperture, refraction conditions at the air-PC boundary with a shift of antenna mouth along the axis remain unchaged except for the beam cross section area of a display tube. </p...|$|E
