5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} {{at the edge of}} their territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
25|$|Among the European settlers, hoop-rolling was a {{seasonal}} sport, seeing the greatest {{activity in the}} winter. Children, besides rolling the hoops, also tossed them back and forth, catching them on their sticks. In the 1830s, hoop trundling {{was seen as an}} activity so characteristic of the young that it was adopted by a fanatic sect in Kentucky whose members mimicked children's activities in order to gain access to heaven. Hoop driving was also seen as a remedy for the sedentary and overprotected lives led by many American girls of the mid-19th century. The game was popular with both girls and boys: in an 1898 survey of 1000 boys and 1000 girls in Massachusetts, both the girls and the boys named hoop and <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> favorite toy. In Ohio, the wood of the American elm (Ulmus americana) was particularly valued for making hoop-poles.|$|E

25|$|The band {{projected}} {{an enigmatic}} presence to the public. While supporting Diary, the band allowed only one publicity photo and granted {{just a single}} interview (though, strangely, the band posed for an advertisement for department-store chain Nordstrom). In a 1998 interview with Norm Arenas of Texas Is the Reason, Hoerner explained that the band made up a fake band name and brought in a fake lead singer for the ad shoot, {{only to have the}} store <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> real band name on the ad. For most of its early days, the band also refused to play a show in California, for reasons that were never fully explained. When the band was asked to perform at the 1994 Almost Acoustic Christmas in Los Angeles for radio station KROQ, Hoerner refused to join them, leaving Enigk, Mendel, and Goldsmith to perform the show as a trio.|$|E
25|$|Floo powder can be {{used with}} any {{fireplace}} connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them emerald green, then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel {{in front of the fireplace}} and <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the Prisoner of Azkaban by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.|$|E

2500|$|ANSWER's {{position}} {{on the left side}} of this issue led to criticism; Jaime Contreras, president of the National Capital Immigrant Coalition and chairman of the local Service Employees International Union in Washington, D.C., told the Washington Post regarding ANSWER that, [...] "Groups... that have done nothing on immigration have no reason to <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> nose where it doesn't belong... They have no business saying, 'Let's do a strike' when it will create a humongous burden on immigrant groups. They need to stay in their box." [...] Brian Becker, ANSWER's national coordinator, responded that ANSWER has in fact been involved in immigration in the long term, and that [...] "We are just part of the coalition; we are not spearheading it at all... Whatever the immigrant rights community calls for is what we support." ...|$|E

[...] In a subsequent editorial the newspaper applauded U.Va's decision to resist the demand and highlighted the potential cost of the precedent being set by Cuccinelli, noting that [...] "if researchers at state institutions are unwilling to <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> necks out in case a state official dislikes their findings, scientific progress at the commonwealth's universities will screech to a halt, talented faculty will leave, and the best and brightest students will go elsewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arklöv {{was arrested}} {{a short time}} after the {{fighting}} ceased and was accused of war crimes, including torturing pregnant Bosniak prisoners in concentration camps in Gabela camp, Dretelj camp and Grabovina. The crimes were severe and he had, among other things, forced a woman to say [...] "Allah akbar" [...] before shoving his rifle into her mouth, whipped prisoners with a Waffen-SS belt, abused and tortured pregnant girls, as well as having beaten young men and broken their arms and legs. Prisoners in the camps called Arklöv [...] "the black devil" [...] because of his black fascist uniform and skin-colour. When civilians were forced under torture to humiliate themselves by Arklöv but didn't obey him, other guards would step in and tell the victims to [...] "do as he says, or he'll kill you, he is totally insane" [...] and laugh. Arklöv was seen talking to camp commander Bosko Previsic (known as [...] "Boko") before and after tortures.

2500|$|Former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his 1990 book By Way of Deception, {{has accused}} the Mossad of knowing the {{specific}} time {{and location of}} the bombing, but only gave general information to the Americans of the attack, information which was worthless. According to Ostrovsky, then Mossad head Nahum Admoni decided against giving the specific details to the Americans {{on the grounds that}} the Mossad's responsibility was to protect Israel's interests, not Americans. Admoni denied having any prior knowledge of the attack. Ostrovsky further claimed that among the high level officers of the Mossad there was a view that if the Americans [...] "wanted to <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> nose into this Lebanon thing, let them pay the price." [...] Benny Morris, in his review of Ostrovsky's book, wrote that Ostrovsky was [...] "barely a case officer before he was fired; most of his (brief) time in the agency was spent as a trainee" [...] adding that due to compartmentalization [...] "he did not and could not have had much knowledge of then current Mossad operations, let alone operational history." [...] Benny Morris wrote that the claim regarding the barracks was [...] "odd" [...] and an example of one of Ostrovsky's [...] "wet" [...] stories which were [...] "mostly fabricated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite an {{agreement}} between the National Union of Mineworkers and the mine, {{a majority of the}} 3,000 striking members from the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union continued to stay away from work. NUM's General-Secretary Frans Baleni said there had been a [...] "high level of intimidation" [...] had stopped other miners from returning to work. [...] "The workers are still scared. There have been threats that those who have reported for duty would have their homes torched. Some of the workers also feel threatened by their managers. Peace has not really prevailed at this stage, which is the main reason why workers would stay away." [...] On 11 September, as another deadline to return to work passed, workers continued to <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> ground amid mounting solidarity protests. Following President Jacob Zuma's vow to clamp down on protests at the mine on 14 September, military convoys and other armoured vehicles were seen in the area. The next day, demonstrations turned violent after the representatives of the striking miners refused to hand in their machetes, sticks and pistols. Police then fired tear gas on the protesters in a shantytown. On 17 September, another march was stopped by police. At the same time COSATU was holding its annual congress with the issue on the top of its agenda.|$|E
2500|$|Ginia Bellefante of The New York Times {{criticized the}} show's lack of {{insight into the}} {{consequences}} of teenage pregnancy. [...] "In {{the wake of the}} discussion surrounding Juno and the horror over Jamie Lynn Spears, the show displays an almost aggressive aversion to moralizing about teenage pregnancy", she said. [...] "Refusing to lay out the grim consequences of premature motherhood, it seems as if it wants to make fans on either end of the political spectrum <b>stick</b> <b>their</b> heads in fiery hampers." [...] Author Emily B. Anzicek said that pregnancy seems to be the only possible physical consequence for the residents of One Tree Hill and that discussion of STDs is non-existent, criticizing the [...] "potential threat" [...] due to the amount of promiscuity, such as several characters having sex with people they hardly know. [...] "Of all the episodes in the first three seasons, there are two mentions of condoms. One happens when Deb catches Brooke and Lucas at the drug store buying condoms and whipped cream", said Anzicek. [...] "The second happens in season two when Brooke throws a wedding reception for Nathan and Haley and decorates the room with condoms blown up like balloons." [...] Anzicek said the teenagers, who are only supposed to be sixteen and seventeen at this time, are presented as very sexually-experienced, especially Brooke, and that the one exception is Haley.|$|E
