5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and ratify the Environmental Modification Convention. Many <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.|$|E
5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E
25|$|Typically, most <b>states</b> <b>do</b> {{not require}} that {{physicians}} administer the drugs for lethal injection, but many <b>states</b> <b>do</b> require that physicians be present to pronounce or certify death.|$|E

25|$|Delaware has six {{different}} income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The <b>state</b> <b>does</b> not assess {{sales tax on}} consumers. The <b>state</b> <b>does,</b> however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.|$|R

25|$|A profile HMM {{takes this}} {{modelling}} of sequence alignments further by modelling insertions and deletions, using I and D states, respectively. D <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not emit a residue, while I <b>states</b> <b>do</b> emit a residue. Multiple I states can occur consecutively, corresponding to multiple residues between consensus columns in an alignment. M, I and D states are connected by state transition probabilities, which also vary by {{position in the}} sequence alignment, to reflect the different frequencies of insertions and deletions across sequence alignments.|$|E
25|$|Relations are {{generally}} tense {{and the two}} <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not have diplomatic relations. Like other Arab states, Bahrain does not recognize Israel. A brief period of warming in relations occurred in the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|The non-recognition of {{particular}} acts of a <b>state</b> <b>does</b> not normally effect {{the recognition of}} the state itself. For example, the international rejection of the occupation {{of particular}} territory by a recognised <b>state</b> <b>does</b> not imply non-recognition of the state itself, nor a rejection of a change of government by illegal means.|$|R

25|$|Nonetheless, the Many-minds Interpretation {{does not}} solve the mindless hulks problem as a problem of supervenience. Mental <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not supervene on brain states as a given brain state is {{compatible}} with different configurations of mental states.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2012, {{only six}} <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not have {{existing}} legislation {{to regulate the}} professional practice of TCM. These six states are Alabama, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. In 1976, California established an Acupuncture Board {{and became the first}} state licensing professional acupuncturists.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland {{represents}} United States {{interests in}} Iran, as Iran and the United <b>States</b> <b>do</b> not presently have diplomatic relations. US State Department spokesman Robert Wood {{raised questions about}} the transparency of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Court judicial system, commenting that a Swiss representative was not allowed in the courtroom during Saberi's trial.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the other}} New England <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not have {{legislation}} regulating {{the color of}} lights on emergency vehicles. They only generalize red and blue lights as being restricted to emergency vehicles. However, most police, fire, and ambulance services in these other New England states voluntarily follow the same scheme as Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Banks in the United <b>States</b> <b>do</b> not use IBAN as account {{numbers for}} U.S. accounts. Any {{adoption}} of the IBAN standard by U.S. banks would likely be initiated by ANSI ASC X9, the U.S. financial services standards development organization: a working group (WGAB20) was established as an X9 subcommittee to generate an IBAN construction for U.S. bank accounts.|$|E
25|$|Intergovernmental organisations do not {{themselves}} diplomatically recognise any state; their member <b>states</b> <b>do</b> so individually. However, {{depending on the}} intergovernmental organisation's rules of internal governance and the positions of their member states, they may express positive or negative opinions as to declarations of independence, or choose to offer or withhold membership to a partially recognised state.|$|E

25|$|It is {{particularly}} {{popular in the}} western states of the USA where high winds often hinder the effectiveness of other varmint rounds in prairie dog hunting. Many states in the USA have minimum caliber restrictions on larger game such as deer, although most <b>states</b> <b>do</b> allow the cartridge {{to be used for}} big game.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{parties and}} Independents flourish. Rules which {{eliminate}} smaller parties from {{the ballot in}} most <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not exist in Vermont. As a result, voters often have extensive choices for general elections. Among others, this more open policy enabled independents like Bernie Sanders to win election as mayor of Burlington, U.S. Congressman and U.S. Senator.|$|E
25|$|Under {{international}} law, {{intergovernmental organisations}} do not themselves possess the legal capacity to recognise any state diplomatically; their member <b>states</b> <b>do</b> so individually.

25|$|The {{legality}} of polygamy varies widely around the world. Polygamy is legal in 58 out of nearly 200 sovereign states, {{the vast majority}} of them being Muslim-majority countries situated in Africa and Asia. In most of these states, polygyny is allowed and legally sanctioned. Polyandry is illegal in virtually every state in the world. The rest of the sovereign <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not recognize polygamous marriages.|$|E
25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legally recognized in New York since July 24, 2011, under the Marriage Equality Act, which {{was passed by}} the New York State Legislature on June 24, 2011 and signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo on the same day. The Marriage Equality Act does not have a residency restriction, as some other <b>states</b> <b>do,</b> and allows religious organizations to decline to officiate same-sex wedding ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|The CCJ {{is based}} in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The {{majority}} of member states however, continue to utilize the Privy Council as their final appellate court and three member <b>states</b> <b>do</b> not use the CCJ for either its original jurisdiction or its appellate jurisdiction because they have either not signed the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (the Bahamas and Haiti) or are a current British colony (Montserrat).|$|E
