25|$|The Augustinian, or Austin, friars (O.S.A.), are a mendicant order. As consecrated religious, {{they pray}} the Liturgy of the Hours {{throughout}} the day. This Latin Rite Order, while a contemplative Order, differs from traditional monastic Orders in three ways: 1) They {{do not take}} vows of stability, meaning that they can live in one house (called a friary or sometimes a monastery) typically for several years before being moved into a different community of the Order. 2) They are engaged in apostolic activity, such as mission work, education, prison ministries, etc. The Order is {{under the supervision of}} a Prior General in Rome, and as an international Order they are divided into various Provinces throughout the world, with each Province being led by a Prior Provincial; (3) As an Order, they have a <b>special</b> <b>commitment</b> to corporate poverty as opposed to simply the poverty professed by the individual friar. While this is not currently legislated {{as it was in the}} origins of the Order, this is to be a distinguishing mark of their lives as a community.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} part of the debate over physician-assisted suicide concerns moral duties that are specific to physicians. It is sometimes argued that physicians, by virtue of <b>special</b> <b>commitments</b> rooted in the nature of their profession, may never intentionally kill a patient, and that therefore, whether or not assisted suicide may be justifiable, it can never be right for a physician to take part in such an act. I examine four types of argument that have been offered in support of this conclusion, and find that none succeeds. Each attempts to show why the duty to conserve life must be unconditional for physicians, yet a consideration {{of the ways in which}} contemporary medicine has evolved shows that such a duty is now no more fundamental to the profession than a duty to relieve suffering, which may in some cases override it...|$|R

Collaborations need to disseminate training and news to their wide-ranging members, and universities seek to provide their students with more useful studying tools.

Our software and hardware architecture has been used to record events for CERN, ATLAS, many units inside the University of Michigan, Fermilab, the American Physical Society and the International Conference on Systems Biology at Harvard.

In 2006 we formed the MScribe project, using a larger scale, and highly automated recording system to record and archive eight University courses in a wide array of subjects. Several robotic carts are wheeled around campus by unskilled student helpers to automatically capture and post to the Web audio, video, slides and chalkboard images. The advances the MScribe project has made in automation of these processes, including a robotic camera operator and automated video processing, are now being used to record ATLAS Collaboration events, making them available more quickly than before and enabling the recording of more events. ...|$|R

Much recent discussion of the distinctive nature and character ofCatholic higher education has focused upon its <b>special</b> <b>commitments</b> to the teaching and formation of students, especially with regard to service and social justice. Increasingly four elements play leading roles in attempts to define the character and identity of Catholic colleges and universities. Those four components are: (1) a high level of personal and institutional commit-ment to excellence in teaching; (2) concern for development of the student’s whole person in her or his intellectual, ethical and spiritual dimensions; (3) emphasis on the formation of women and men in service of others; and (4) promotion of social justice especially in regard to the poor and the oppressed. Commitments to teaching, formation of the whole person, service, and social justice must be indispensable elements in Catholic higher education. However, excessive focus upon these dimensions alone is too narrow, and will not provide a sufficient basis for a distinctive style or distinctive institutions of Catholic higher education, for at least four reasons. • First, there are a great many non-Catholic colleges and universities that have strong commitments to some or all four of these elements. To cite just one illustration, there has been a phenomenal growth of service learning programs outside of Catholic higher education over the past decade. • Second, if Catholic higher education were to be defined exclusively by means of these four elements, there would be no clear rationale for how the vas...|$|R
