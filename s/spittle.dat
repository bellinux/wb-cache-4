500|$|Professor David Harman {{observed}} that Swaminarayan [...] "criticized the popular shakta cults and 'gosai' and 'nath' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental {{way in which}} they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women." [...] Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to protect the ill treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics. Swaminarayan [...] "forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex." [...] This strict precept was one he likely internalized [...] "after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [...] he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman". To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught “the woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, <b>spittle,</b> blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, and there is nothing to be attractive.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Spittles</b> {{is an area}} {{of coastal}} cliff in the county of Dorset on the south coast of England.

The cliff contains layers of Blue Lias and clay; in wet seasons the clay causes the layers above to become saturated and hence landslips occur, exposing many fossils. Mary Anning famously found an Ichthyosaurus in the <b>Spittles.</b>|$|R

2500|$|To {{cure the}} disease, it is {{necessary}} to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he likes it or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his <b>spittle</b> is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ch'i, he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it {{does not need to be}} fumigated any more [...]|$|E

2500|$|Mark {{contains}} twenty {{accounts of}} miracles and healings, accounting {{for almost a}} third of the gospel and half the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel. In the gospels as a whole, Jesus' miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of God's rule, but Mark's descriptions of Jesus' healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using <b>spittle</b> to heal blindness (Mark 8:22–26) and magic formulae ("Talitha cumi," [...] 5:41, [...] "Ephphatha," [...] 7:34), were those of a magician. This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: they say he is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit (Mark 3:22) and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14). [...] "There was... no period {{in the history of the}} [...] empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society," [...] subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen. All the gospels defend Jesus against the charge, which, if true, would contradict their ultimate claims for him. The point of the Beelzebub incident in Mark (Mark 3:20–30) is to set forth Jesus' claims to be an instrument of God, not Satan.|$|E
2500|$|Dwarves {{look like}} small humans, but are less {{proportional}} than elves. Dwarves have many abilities. They can unhinge their jaws to chew through earth extremely quickly. When digging they shovel the dirt into their mouth, digest it {{to remove any}} useful minerals, then (sometimes for self-defence or as a weapon) excrete the remnants. [...] Their spit glows {{in the dark and}} hardens once it leaves their mouths. Dwarf <b>spittle</b> is also a sedative, as seen in the fifth book, and is used to ward off evil spirits, as seen in the eighth book. Their hair can be used as keys because rigor mortis sets in once they pluck it off. When the hair is still attached to the dwarf, they can be used to detect vibrations. Since dwarves can drink water by absorbing it through their pores, if they go long enough without drinking, their pores create a vacuum effect, allowing them to stick to walls. Dwarves can use gas consumed in tunneling [...] to flatulate with colossal power (enough to knock out trolls). Their flatulence also is a by-product of a gas used for deep sea divers to prevent 'the bends'. They also have the gift of tongues. Dwarves are extremely sensitive to sunlight, and can burn after three minutes in the sun. They also hate fire and ice. Dwarves despise goblins as a general rule, and often erupt in s against them. Another ability was shown in , where Diggums touched his beard to a deep cut on his head, which resulted in the wound [...] "sewing" [...] itself together with only a scar left in its place. They are also shown in the seventh book with the ability to [...] "trim the weight", in which they rapidly mobilise their body fat as dwarf gas to rapidly escape dangerous situations. Dwarves can only use this ability every ten years, and it is usually triggered by great stress.|$|E
