40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is emerging}} {{as one of the}} major health problems in the 21 st century. Neuropathies are among the most common complications. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the prevalence and characteristics of peripheral neuropathy in Yemeni patients including 155 patients. The clinical examination included a full history and physical examination. The relative laboratory investigations were performed. Electrophysiological studies were conducted. All data were subjected to statistical analysis. There were 79 female and 76 male diabetic patients. The mean duration was 10. 43 #. 59 years, being higher in males. The mean blood sugar levels were also higher in males, while cholestrol and triglycerides were higher in females. The complications including polyneuropathy, small vessel disease, hypertension, renal and heart disease, peripheral artery occulosion and <b>strocke</b> were all presented. The risk factors for the development of diabetic polyneuropathy included: duration of D,M, higher glucose levels, other systemic involvements, higher lipids and Qat chewing. Nerve conduction studies showed that lower limbs were affected more than upper limbs. The recommendations suggested extension of this study to other population groups to implement population â€“based measure for prevention, and aggressive control of blood sugar and lipids and life-style changes...|$|E
40|$|Specific motor {{abilities}} in modern sport {{are probably the}} determining factor for solving sports tasks and achievingsport success. <b>Strockes</b> with an arm and leg in karate sport are dominant techniques which help a karate athlete toscore points or win a fight. Karate sport and particularly sports discipline fight (kumite) is characterized with polystructural movements, {{and the most important}} motor skills are explosiveness, speed and coordination. The subjectof this research derives from the previous knowledge and arguments and it is directed toward determination of themeasuring characteristics (reliability, sensitivity and validity) of the specific "Mae Geri" motor test. The research has been conducted in the Republic of Macedonia with an intentional sample of 30 male examinees(karate athletes), at the age older then 18. During the research with the sample of examinees, 1 (one) manifest specific-motor variable (newly constructed composite test) was applied, characteristic for the karate sport. The aim of thisresearch was to determine the measuring characteristics of the newly constructed test. Using the Hoteling method,the factor validity of this test was determined, as well as its latent dimensions, and the main component accordingto Kaiser-Gutman criterion were established. Based on the obtained results of the research, there have been someconclusions which refer to the measuring characteristics of the applied test, and primarily to the factor validity,sensitivity and reliability of the same...|$|R
