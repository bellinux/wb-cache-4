5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
25|$|Flap {{interface}} {{particles are}} a finding whose clinical significance is undetermined. Particles {{of various sizes}} and reflectivity are clinically visible in about 38.7% of eyes examined via <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> biomicroscopy and in 100% of eyes examined by confocal microscopy.|$|E
25|$|Conjunctivitis is {{identified}} by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva. Except in obvious pyogenic or toxic/chemical conjunctivitis, a <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> (biomicroscope) {{is needed to}} have any confidence in the diagnosis. Examination of the tarsal conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than the bulbar conjunctiva.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{are often}} readily {{observed}} by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist {{with the use}} of an ophthalmoscope or <b>slit</b> <b>lamp.</b> However, if the floater is near the retina, it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the sufferer.|$|E
25|$|The retinal {{changes are}} easily {{identified}} by ophthalmoscopy, which is performed under general anesthesia {{if the child}} is very young. The abnormal vessels are even better seen with fluorescein angiography. In advanced disease, glaucoma is diagnosed by measuring intraocular pressure and cataract by using <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> biomicroscopy.|$|E
25|$|While {{the cause}} is unknown, it is {{believed}} to occur due {{to a combination of}} genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. About seven percent of those affected {{have a family history of}} the condition. Proposed environmental factors include rubbing the eyes and allergies. The underlying mechanism involves changes of the cornea to a cone shape. Diagnosis is by examination with a <b>slit</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmoscopy or fundus photography: Ophthalmoscopy is an {{examination}} of the retina in which the eye care professional: (1) looks through a <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or (2) wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Fundus photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the fundus, and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time.|$|E
25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.|$|E
25|$|If {{keratoconus}} is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will {{search for}} other characteristic {{findings of the}} disease by means of <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring {{can be observed in}} around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.|$|E
2500|$|Diffuse {{lamellar}} keratitis [...] {{an inflammatory}} process that involves {{an accumulation of}} white blood cells at the interface between the LASIK corneal flap and the underlying stroma. It is known colloquially as [...] "sands of Sahara syndrome" [...] because on <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> exam, the inflammatory infiltrate appears similar to waves of sand. The USAeyes organisation reports an incidence of 2.3% after LASIK. It is most commonly treated with steroid eye drops. Sometimes {{it is necessary for}} the eye surgeon to lift the flap and manually remove the accumulated cells. DLK has not been reported with photorefractive keratectomy due to the absence of flap creation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965, the Model 100/16 <b>Slit</b> <b>Lamp</b> was {{produced}} {{based on the}} <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> by Littmann. This was soon followed by the Model 125/16 <b>Slit</b> <b>Lamp</b> in 1972. The only {{difference between the two}} models was their operating distances of 100 mm to 125 mm. With the introduction of the photo <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> further advancements were possible. In 1976, the development of the Model 110 <b>Slit</b> <b>Lamp</b> and the 210/211 Photo Slit Lamps were an innovation by which each were constructed from standard modules allowing {{for a wide range of}} different configurations. At the same time, halogen lamps replaced the old illumination systems to make them brighter and essentially daylight quality. From 1994 onwards, new slit lamps were introduced which took advantage of new technologies. The last major development was in 1996 in which included the advantages of new <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> optics.

5000|$|Koeppe is {{also known}} for popularizing and making {{improvements}} to the <b>slit</b> <b>lamp,</b> an ophthalmic device that had been recently devised by Allvar Gullstrand (1862-1930). In addition, he travelled throughout Europe and North America giving lectures and demonstrating the usage of the <b>slit</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eye disease: JIA is {{associated}} with inflammation {{in the front of}} the eye (specifically iridocyclitis, a form of chronic anterior uveitis), which affects about one child in five who has JIA, most commonly girls. This complication is usually asymptomatic and can be detected by an experienced optometrist or ophthalmologist using a <b>slit</b> <b>lamp.</b> Later <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> features include synechiae. Most children with JIA are enrolled in a regular <b>slit</b> <b>lamp</b> screening program, as poorly controlled chronic anterior uveitis may result in permanent eye damage, including blindness.|$|E
