25|$|Muckross Lake and the Upper Lake {{are high}} quality {{oligotrophic}} systems, with {{water that is}} slightly acidic and low in nutrients. This is caused by run-off from the upland sandstones and blanket bogs in their catchment areas. They have diverse aquatic vegetation, including quillwort (Isoetes lacustris), <b>shoreweed</b> (Littorella uniflora), and water lobelia (Lobelia dortmanna).|$|E
500|$|Pawston lies [...] west of Kilham on {{the south}} bank of the Bowmont Water. [...] It {{was the site of}} the deserted medieval village of Thornington, first {{recorded}} in 1296. To the north east of Pawston House are single storey shelter sheds and a two-storey granary, dating from the 18th century. [...] An old beam forms a continuous bressumer over the door and two windows, and the building has a steeply pitched Scottish slate roof. South of the house is a 17th-century sundial base decorated with foliage, grotesque heads and festoons. John Selby, a [...] "gentleman dwelling at Pawston", was killed in 1596 while defending his home against Scottish marauders. Pawston Hill has the remains of an Iron Age settlement. The locally rare wood carpet moth was found at Pawston Lake in 1929, and a number of nationally or locally scarce plants are also present, including the autumnal water starwort, blunt leaved pondweed, gypsywort, maiden pink and <b>shoreweed.</b>|$|E

50|$|Surveys have {{identified}} the following rare species: reed grass (Glyceria maxima); Carex aquatilis; viper's bugloss (Echium vulgare); marestail (Hippuris vulgaris); field scabious (Knautia arvensis); spiked water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum); <b>shoreweed</b> (Littorella uniflora); butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha); ivy-leaved crowfoot (Ranunculus hederaceus); weld (Reseda luteola); marsh yellow-cress (Rorippa islandica); bay willow (Salix pentandra); creeping yellow-cress (Rorippa sylvestris); and the relatively rare plant, bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), that grows in sheltered areas {{on the west bank}} of the loch.|$|E
50|$|In Britain, {{floating}} water-plantain {{is rare in}} river habitats. River populations in general occur in slow-flowing, low-gradient sections of base-poor rivers along with aquatic plants such as intermediate water-starwort Callitriche hamulata, bog pondweed Potamogeton polygonifolius and <b>shoreweed</b> Littorella uniflora. These populations are small and associated with upstream lakes that may act as sources of propagules. Riverine populations in France and Denmark are associated with natural river-floodplain systems where new oxbow lakes are constantly being created by erosion and deposition.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the ponds over many centuries with constantly changing levels of water has also created a habitat for some extremely rare plant communities. On the soils of many ponds coral necklace (Ilecebrum verticillatum), strapwort (Corrigiola litoralis) or <b>shoreweed</b> (Littorella uniflora) may be found growing. They are dependent on this constant fluctuation of water levels in the reservoir and so the nature conservation authorities have agreed with the pond operators an operating regime that will secure {{the existence of these}} plants in the waterbodies concerned. By other ponds there are meadow bogs (Kleinseggenried), which are rich in sedges, rushes and cottongrass and moss communities.|$|E
50|$|In summers, {{phytoplankton}} algae {{are dominated}} by cyanobacteria and some carapace flagellates. Other species have been abundant, but today only a single nitrogen fixating algae {{is present in the}} lake. During winters and springs, Planktothrix agardhii adopt a red colour which occasionally colours the lake in shades of red and brown. Larger zooplankton include water fleas (Bosmina) and copepods (Daphnia); and smaller species, rotifers, seem to have increased during the later part of the 1990s. An inventory of aquatic plants in 1997 resulted in a list of 13 species, most commonly spring quillwort, awlwort, <b>shoreweed,</b> and needle spike-rush. The shores of Flaten are covered with bog-myrtle. Trailing plants have occasionally been abundant near the bathe.|$|E
50|$|Wind Pudding Lake State Natural Area is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area {{featuring}} the 180-acre Wind Pudding Lake, its associated wetlands, {{and some of}} its surrounding uplands. The lake is noteworthy for its separate basins, each having distinctive characteristics. The eastern basin is the deepest, at 35 ft, and has a primarily sand/gravel bottom. This basin contains a well-developed population of sterile-rosette aquatic vegetation, with several species considered either rare, or with a restricted range within the State of Wisconsin, such as the plantain <b>shoreweed</b> (Littorella uniflora). The central and western basins are much shallower and muck-bottomed, with extensive areas covered by a mat of floating peat, which supports a dense growth of aquatic vegetation, including sundew (Drosera intermedia), purple bladderwort (Utricularia purpurea), yellow-eyed grass (Xyris montana), and the rare Robbin's spike-rush (Eleocharis robbinsii). \The western basin does have some development, with several houses, {{while the rest of the}} lake is undeveloped.|$|E
