5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E

25|$|Inverted or {{retracted}} nipples <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> {{attachment to}} the breast difficult. These mothers need additional support to feed their babies. Treatment is started {{after the birth of}} the baby. The nipple is manually stretched out several times a day. A pump or a plastic syringe is used to draw out the nipple and the baby is then put to the breast.|$|E

25|$|Attempts to find wanted {{or missing}} {{individuals}} through public alert systems <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> {{use of a}} type of event based prospective memory called prospective person memory. In prospective person memory, {{a picture of a}} wanted or missing person is presented to the public with instructions to report any sightings of the individual to authorities. Field experiments show that prospective person memory is often quite poor.|$|E
25|$|Tanner {{made his}} UFC debut in 1999 at UFC 18, {{submitting}} fellow Amarillo native Darrell Gholar by rear naked choke {{in the first}} round. Tanner's next fight in the UFC was against Valerie Ignatov at UFC 19. Ignatov was widely known for his leg submissions and because of this, Tanner decided to fight barefoot {{for the first time}} in his career, citing that shoes <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> it easier for an opponent to gain a submission.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{identified}} {{causes of the}} waste {{in the health care}} system is a lack of communication between doctors and patients. The decisions of physicians account for most of a patient's expenses, yet physicians work under various pressures including limited time to talk with patients and review their information. Patients <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> requests for treatment against their doctor's advice in cases where more effective choices would be made if doctors had time to consult expert medical opinion.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Arika Okrent guessed in her book In the Land of Invented Languages that there might be 20–30 fluent speakers. Its vocabulary, heavily {{centered}} on Star Trek–Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, can <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> it cumbersome for everyday use. For instance, while words for transporter ionizer unit (jolvoy’) or bridge (of a ship) (meH) have been known since close to the language's inception, the word for bridge {{in the sense of a}} crossing over water (QI) was unknown until August 2012. Nonetheless, mundane conversations are common among skilled speakers.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the name}} Withington tends {{to refer to}} the areas roughly defined by the modern council wards of Withington and Old Moat, {{although}} fluctuating local government boundaries <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> these distinctions unclear. Withington and Old Moat wards are currently represented on Manchester City Council by three councillors each: Chris Paul (Labour and Co-operative Party), Chris Wills (Labour and Co-operative Party), and Rebecca Moore (Labour) in Withington; Andrew Fender (Labour), Suzannah Reeves (Labour) and Gary Ridges (Labour) in Old Moat. Council elections took place on 22 May 2016 with each ward returning one councillor, Chris Wills and Andrew Fender respectively in Withington and Old Moat wards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E

25|$|Peafowl roost {{in groups}} {{during the night}} on tall trees but may <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> use of rocks, {{buildings}} or pylons. In the Gir forest, they chose tall trees in steep river banks. Birds arrive at dusk and call frequently before taking their position on the roost trees. Due to this habit of congregating at the roost, many population studies are made at these sites. The population structure is not well understood. In a study in northern India (Jodhpur), the number of males was 170–210 for 100 females but a study involving evening counts at the roost site in southern India (Injar) suggested a ratio of 47 males for 100 females.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the mythical}} tales and poems that are presumed to have existed during the Middle Ages, Viking Age, Migration Period, and prior, {{only a tiny}} amount of poems and tales survive. Later sources {{reaching}} into the modern period, such as a medieval charm recorded as used by the Norwegian woman Ragnhild Tregagås—convicted of witchcraft in Norway in the 14th century—and spells found in the 17th century Icelandic Galdrabók grimoire also <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> references to Norse mythology. Other traces, such as place names bearing the names of gods may provide further information about deities, such as a potential association between deities based on placement of locations bearing their names, their local popularity, and associations with geological features.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of these two doomed Bond girls, it is never explained why Bond's love interest in one film is gone by the next, and is never mentioned or even alluded to again. This {{is not always the}} case in the novels, which do <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> references to the Bond girls who have appeared in previous books. Tiffany Case and Honey Ryder are revealed to have married other men (in From Russia With Love and The Man With the Golden Gun respectively), and in Doctor No, Bond briefly wonders about Solitaire. A unique case is Mary Goodnight, who appears in the novels, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice as Bond's secretary, before becoming a full-fledged Bond girl in The Man With the Golden Gun.|$|E

25|$|When a {{security}} is sold, the seller is contractually obliged {{to deliver it}} to the buyer. If a seller sells {{a security}} short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller fails to deliver, the transaction does not settle, and the seller {{may be subject to}} a claim from its counterparty. Certain large holders of securities, such as a custodian or investment management firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as securities lending. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full title of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for margin buying.|$|E
25|$|Willow's {{earliest}} {{and most}} consistent relationships are with Buffy and Xander, {{both of whom}} she refers to as her best friends although they have their conflicts, and Giles as a father figure. Willow takes on the leadership role when Buffy is unavailable, and her growing powers <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> her resent being positioned as Buffy's sidekick. Some scholars see Willow as Buffy's sister-figure or the anti-Buffy, similar to Faith, another Slayer whose morals are less strict. In early seasons, Willow's unrequited crush on Xander creates some storylines involving the relationships between Xander, Cordelia, and Oz. Willow {{is part of a}} powerful quartet: she represents the spirit, Giles intelligence, Xander heart, and Buffy strength of the Scoobies. Although they often drift apart, they are forced to come together and work in these roles to defeat forces they are unable to fight individually.|$|E
25|$|Adventure {{games have}} strong storylines with {{significant}} dialog, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> {{effective use of}} recorded dialog or narration from voice actors. This genre of game is known for representing dialog as a conversation tree. Players are able to engage a non-player character by choosing a line of pre-written dialog from a menu, which triggers a response from the game character. These conversations are often designed as a tree structure, with players deciding between each branch of dialog to pursue. However, there are always {{a finite number of}} branches to pursue, and some adventure games devolve into selecting each option one-by-one. Conversing with characters can reveal clues about how to solve puzzles, including hints about what that character would want before they will cooperate with the player. Other conversations will have far-reaching consequences, deciding to disclose a valuable secret that has been entrusted to the player. Characters may also be convinced to reveal their own secrets, either through conversation or by giving them something that will benefit them.|$|E
