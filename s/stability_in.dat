5|$|After {{the end of}} the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the {{subsequent}} peace treaties ceded the region to Albania. This turn of events catalyzed an uprising among the local Greeks, which led to the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence, on February 28, 1914. The International Commission of Control, an organization responsible for securing peace and <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the region, eventually intervened and the Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914. However the protocol’s terms were never implemented because of the politically unstable situation in Albania following the outbreak of World War I, and it was eventually annulled in 1921 during the Conference of Ambassadors.|$|E

5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> bad weather {{as she had}} {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E
30|$|We {{remark that}} {{stability}} {{results of the}} Euler-Lagrange-type quadratic equation (4) in normed spaces {{are very different from}} those of Equation (4) in non-Archimedean normed spaces, of which <b>stability</b> results <b>in</b> non-Archimedean normed spaces maybe come from the opposite direction to <b>stability</b> results <b>in</b> normed spaces in view of Corollaries 4.3 and 4.4.|$|R

30|$|The {{comparison}} of specific properties of native and variant structures revealed difference <b>in</b> <b>stability.</b> This variation leads to slight deviation in energy and decrease <b>in</b> <b>stability.</b> This change <b>in</b> <b>stability</b> {{can be explained}} by the reason that the variant residue has bulkier R group than the wild type and cannot fit within the available space. The free carboxylic acid group on Asp can disturb the ionic interaction of nearby residues and hence causing vulnerable effects. The wild-type residue is non-polar while the variant residue is negatively charged and hydrophilic. Furthermore, there is difference in solvent accessibility of both residues with native being buried and variant being fully exposed, hence slight deviation in energy and decrease <b>in</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|R
5|$|Conrad {{completed}} {{construction of}} the castles of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach, which Archbishop Gebhard had started to build in 1077. In Styria, he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties, and built strong fortresses. For defense against Hungary, he built strongholds at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica castle. He also expanded the Burg Deutschlandsberg castle {{at the center of}} the Salzburg possessions in western Styria. In 1131, he made peace with King Béla II of Hungary, which was followed by a long period of <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the border region.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political <b>stability.</b> <b>In</b> the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E

Speculation at the time pointed to him taking a position as ambassador to China, a special commission on <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> Central America, or a Cabinet position. Ultimately Magoon did not take up any of those new responsibilities and formally entered retirement. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1920 after complications from surgery for acute appendicitis.|$|E

5|$|Having {{achieved}} <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the West, Alexios {{could turn}} {{his attention to}} the severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the Empire's traditional defences. However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks.

5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the double bond. The thermodynamical <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> this compound, {{and the role of}} steric protection in preventing dimerisation, has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E
5|$|John and Manuel pursued active {{military}} policies, {{and both}} deployed considerable resources on sieges and on city defences; aggressive fortification policies {{were at the}} heart of their imperial military policies. Despite the defeat at Myriokephalon, the policies of Alexios, John and Manuel resulted in vast territorial gains, increased frontier <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> Asia Minor, and secured the stabilisation of the Empire's European frontiers. From c. 1081 to c. 1180, the Komnenian army assured the Empire's security, enabling Byzantine civilisation to flourish.|$|E
