5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall <b>stems</b> in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short <b>stems,</b> then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall <b>stems.</b> Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stem</b> cell {{research}} and therapy are progressing these days dramatically. <b>Stem</b> cell therapy holds enormous treatment potential for many diseases which currently have no or limited therapeutic options. Unfortunately, this potential {{also comes with}} side-effects. In this review, {{the positive and negative}} effects of regulation of <b>stem</b> cells will be explained. <b>Stem</b> cells are undifferentiated cells which able to develop into many different cells of types in the body during early life and growth. There are five types of <b>stem</b> cells: embryonic <b>stem</b> cells, induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> cells, somatic <b>stem</b> cells, fetal <b>stem</b> cells and mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells. <b>Stem</b> cell transplantation is one form of <b>stem</b> cell therapy, it comes with different techniques sourced, and those are autologous and allogeneic transplantation <b>stem</b> cells. In an autologous transplant, a patient's blood-forming <b>stem</b> cells are collected, meanwhile, in an allogeneic transplant, target cells are replaced with new <b>stem</b> cells obtained from a donor or donated umbilical cord blood. Its abilities to maintain the phenotype, self-renewing and differentiate itself into specialized cells, give rise to <b>stem</b> cell as an innovation for the treatment of various diseases. In the clinical setting, <b>stem</b> cells are being explored for different conditions, such as in tissue repair and regeneration and autoimmune diseases therapy. But along with its benefit, <b>stem</b> cell therapy also holds some harm. It is known that the treatment using <b>stem</b> cell for curing and rehabilitation has the risk of tumor formation.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in <b>stem</b> cell research is opening a new hope for cell therapy in regenerative medicine. Two breakthroughs {{were made in}} the <b>stem</b> cell era, one, new discoveries in multipotentiality of adult <b>stem</b> cells beyond the traditionally appreciated extent, and the other, establishment of pluripotent <b>stem</b> cell from human embryo. In addition to the newly identified multipotentiality of adult <b>stem</b> cells, their ability to be trans-differentiated toward other tissue types (<b>stem</b> cell plasticity) as well as to migrate toward the site of tissue damage make adult <b>stem</b> cells particularly attractive choice for <b>stem</b> cell based therapy. <b>Stem</b> cell therapy for organ regeneration, therefore, could be approached from three distinct dimensions: first, direct differentiation of multi-potent <b>stem</b> cells toward desired tissue types; secondly, regeneration of specific tissues through in vivo <b>stem</b> cell plasticity, and lastly, by tissue-specific <b>stem</b> cells from many types of organs.

40|$|This {{study is}} to examine the effect of <b>stem</b> {{architecture}} on biomass allocation between leaf and <b>stem</b> and between leaf size and number in plant twigs of woody species. We investigated leaf size, leaf number, <b>stem</b> length, <b>stem</b> diameter, and mass for 282 woody species of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in southwest China. Both <b>stem</b> diameter and <b>stem</b> length were positively correlated with individual leaf mass and area but were negatively associated with leaf number per unit <b>stem</b> mass and leaf number per <b>stem</b> length. This suggests that these <b>stem</b> architecture traits can be a physiological mechanism underlying the leaf size versus leaf number tradeoff. The ratio of <b>stem</b> length to <b>stem</b> diameter (LDR) was negatively correlated with leaf size and leaf number per <b>stem</b> length, due to the difference in the strength of the effects of <b>stem</b> length and <b>stem</b> diameter on leaf size and leaf number. Similarly, both <b>stem</b> diameter and <b>stem</b> length were positively correlated with leaf mass and <b>stem</b> mass. LDR was negatively correlated with leaf biomass fraction (the ratio of leaf mass to twig mass), due to the difference in the strength of the effect of <b>stem</b> length and <b>stem</b> diameter on leaf mass and <b>stem</b> mass. This indicates that <b>stem</b> architecture can significantly influence biomass allocation between leaf and <b>stem.</b> These relationships were generally strong when expressed as correlated evolutionary divergences. In addition, LDR was generally larger in the high-rainfall habitat than in the low-rainfall site. Accordingly, LDR can be regarded as a functional trait and {{an important component of the}} leading dimension of leaf size-twig size spectrum in plants.
