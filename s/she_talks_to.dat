500|$|Tenar, from whose {{perspective}} The Tombs of Atuan is told, is {{born on the}} Kargish {{island of}} Atuan before being taken away to serve the Nameless Ones as their high priestess. She is told {{that she is the}} reincarnation of the high priestess, and has lived at the tombs since time immemorial; though she believes this early in her life, she begins to question the idea later in the novel. For much of the book she is known only as Arha, or the [...] "Eaten one"; her identity as an individual is gradually erased. Though she is depicted as a person of strength and imagination, her development is stunted by the priestesses; her feelings are repressed, and her mind has no place to wander except the labyrinth. After trapping Ged, <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> him about the rest of Earthsea, and begins to desire a life outside the barrenness of the Tombs. It is only after her escape that she seems to regain her name, crying [...] "I have my name back. I am Tenar!" [...] Tehanu, the fourth Earthsea novel, is narrated from Tenar's point of view; it depicts her life on Gont and her reunion and relationship with Ged. She reappears in The Other Wind, the sixth Earthsea book. Tenar plays the role of a heroine in The Tombs of Atuan, in which she is somewhat stereotypically cast as a [...] "side-kick" [...] to Ged, but later breaks out of this role to become a central character in her own right in Tehanu. Tenar is part of multiple pairs of characters that develop together; both Ged, in The Tombs of Atuan, and later Tehanu in her eponymous novel, are shown as being dependent on her.|$|E
