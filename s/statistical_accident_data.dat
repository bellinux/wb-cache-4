40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{vulnerability}} of elderly road users is analyzed by means of <b>statistical</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data.</b> Two data sources are used: Dutch national accident data of 1987 based on police registration and Dutch national hospital data of 1987. After a short introduction {{about the problem of}} elderly road users in general and some crash theory, these data sources are used to calculate and demonstrate differences in fatality, injury and other relevant accident parameters between elderly (55 years and older) and a comparison group of 25 - 44 years old. In view of the differences, conclusions are drawn about {{the vulnerability of}} elderly crash victims, with emphasis on influence of age, sex and traffic category. Finally, suggestions for solutions of the problem are derived using general injury prevention knowledge combined with the specific protection need of the elderly.

40|$|Currently {{there are}} no {{sufficiently}} detailed and specific regulations and guidelines applicable to Floating Regasification Units. In {{view of the fact}} that these units are likely to become more popular in the near future, their safety needs to be examined urgently. During the design of the world's first medium-sized floating regasification unit a qualitative risk assessment was carried out. Although the results are useful, they cannot be used for developing rules and regulations directly. For such purposes some detailed quantitative studies are essential. This paper addresses this gap and introduces a hierarchical system modelling method to overcome the problem of the lack of direct <b>statistical</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> of novel systems. The method was implemented in IQRA (integrated quantitative risk assessment), a piece of software developed in-house for quantitative risk assessment. The safety of the floating regasification unit mentioned above was assessed using this software and the results were compared against the results obtained from conventional qualitative and the quantitative risk assessment. It was found that the qualitative risk assessment had a tendency to overestimate the frequency of the accidents but to underestimate their consequence, while the quantitative risk assessment based on the result of the qualitative assessment inherently underestimated both the frequency and the consequence of hazards. The hierarchical modelling was found to be an excellent method of dealing with complex systems with short operational history...|$|E
40|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role for traffic safety development involving the road system, vehicle design, and driver education. Vehicle manufacturers use data from accident mail surveys {{as an integral part of}} the product development process. Low response rates has, however, lead to concerns on whether estimates from a mail survey can be trusted as a source for making strategic decisions. The main objective of this paper was to investigate nonresponse bias in a mail survey addressing driver behaviour in accident situations. Insurance data, available for both respondents and nonrespondents were used to analyze, as well as adjust for nonresponse. Response propensity was investigated by using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. The survey data was then weighted by using inverse propensity weights. Two specific examples of survey estimates are addressed, namely driver vigilance and driver's distraction just before the accident. The results from this paper reveal that driver age and accident type were the most influential variables for nonresponse weighting. Driver gender and size of town where the driver resides also had some influence, but not for all survey variables investigated. The main conclusion of this paper is that nonresponse weighting can increase confidence in accident data collected by a mail survey, especially when response rates are low. Weighting has a moderate influence on this survey, but a larger influence may be expected if applied on a more diverse driver population. The development of auxiliary data collection can further improve accident mail survey methodology in future...|$|E

40|$|In a <b>statistical</b> {{analysis}} of <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> {{before and after}} a speed limit reduction, {{the time of the}} countermeasure is, of course, well known. Our understanding of the accident process may, however, be increased if we assume in a thought experiment that this time is unknown. We ask if the data themselves can tell us something about such a possible time. By means of time series of traffic accidents in Zurich before and after a speed limit reduction, different exploratory methods are presented to identify the "unknown" time of this measure. For most of the investigated series, the most likely time was found to lie in the three months before the true introduction. A possible explanation of this result may be that the media already informed the public before the countermeasure was actually introduced. This finding leads to an improved parsimonious intervention model which distinguishes between a possible "preintervention effect" and the usual "intervention effect. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{traffic in}} Osjecko–Baranjska County is {{strongly}} {{marked by the}} regional road named Sv. Leopolda Bogdana Mandica (so-called “Cepinska cesta”). With its high traffic density and specific significance, this road is negatively characterized by traffic jams, waiting, minor and major <b>accidents.</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>data</b> for the Republic of Croatia indicate {{that this is one}} of the roads with the heaviest traffic load in the country. In an experimental study conducted using traffic, operational and statistical methods of measurement, the problem of Poisson queuing model with a single waiting point was recognized. High frequency of vehicles exceeds the expected and assumed number of clients in a queue, which increases the average waiting time in the queuing model. For this reason, stationary traffic counting is undertaken in order to establish the traffic load. These results, as well as those for waiting times, confirm it is necessary to propose a new traffic organization for this road, which would decrease avarage waiting times and eliminate unneccesary halts. This in turn would increase the flow rate and minimize negative traffic situations. traffic density, stationary traffic counting, peak periods, Poisson queuing model, rationalization, statistical analysis...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{analysis}} for multi-agent systems {{is complicated by}} the, potentially nonlinear, interactions between agents. This paper proposes a method for analyzing the safety of multi-agent systems by explicitly focusing on interactions and the <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> of systems that are similar in structure and function to the system being analyzed. The method creates a Bayesian network using the <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> from similar systems. A feature of our method is that the events in <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> are labeled with HAZOP guide words. Our method uses an Ontology to abstract away from {{the details of a}} multi-agent implementation. Using the ontology, our methods then constructs an “Interaction Map,” a graphical representation of the patterns of interactions between agents and other artifacts. Interaction maps combined with <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> from <b>accidents</b> and the HAZOP classifications of events can be converted into a Bayesian Network. Bayesian networks allow designers to explore “what it” scenarios and make design trade-offs that maintain safety. We show how to use the Bayesian networks, and the interaction maps to improve multi-agent system designs...|$|R
