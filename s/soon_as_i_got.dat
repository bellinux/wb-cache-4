500|$|.....as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E
2500|$|ERICKSON: Well, if the kid {{came in to}} see me, {{the first}} thing I would {{do would be to}} want to examine the cross. And I would want to improve it in a very minor way. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the {{slightest}} minor change in it, the way would be open for a larger change. And [...] pretty soon I could deal with the advantages of a different cross - he ought to have at least two. He ought to have at least three so he could make a choice each day of which one. It's pretty hard to express a psychotic pattern of behavior over an ever-increasing number of crosses.|$|E
2500|$|Ward, {{who first}} saw it, said, [...] "It {{looked more like}} an old broken-down suitcase. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to it and got a good look, I knew exactly what it was." [...] McNief called the police from Ochsenbein's Grocery Store. Runnels investigated, with Deputy Sheriff Z. C. Henslee and {{officers}} Pete Carrara and Bill Bagwell. The music case {{was placed in a}} paste board box and returned to Chief Runnels's office. The saxophone was tarnished and the leather case's bottom and lining had deteriorated enough that pieces fell to the ground as it was placed in the box. A Texas High School emblem was also in the case, as well as sheet music for [...] "The Song of the Navy", probably played at the dance on the night of Booker's death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said I, [...] "it only remains {{you should}} give me an address to write you at in France; and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am <b>got</b> to Leyden <b>I</b> will send you mine." ...|$|R
60|$|CHR. I {{met with}} a gentleman so <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> over the Slough of Despond, who persuaded me that I might, in the village before me, find a man that could take off my burden.|$|R
60|$|We {{went to the}} House together. It {{happened}} to be an Irish afternoon, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> the cries and the faces a little sorted out, I gathered there were grievances in the air, but {{how many of them}} was beyond me.|$|R
2500|$|Bianca and Babe's {{friendship}} {{became popular}} with viewers while both characters were pregnant. The relationship {{was described as}} a [...] "beautiful friendship" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Within the series, when the two give birth to their children on the same night (Bianca to Miranda and Babe to Little Adam), their bond further endeared them to the audience. Of the birth scenes, actress Eden Riegel, Bianca's portrayer, stated, [...] "I had done so much research. I read books [...] What to Expect When You're Expecting. I watched the TLC series A Baby Story. It felt like I watched hundreds of episodes! As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home I'd be watching women give birth on TV." [...] Riegel added that one of her makeup artists was pregnant and invited her to go along to a Lamaze class. She sat in a room [...] "full of pregnant Upper West Siders" [...] and practiced breathing exercises.|$|E
2500|$|Producers later made {{a series}} of changes to Grace's characterisation. Her style changed and they {{introduced}} a new hairstyle, which has been described as an [...] "enormous bouffant hair-do". Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace. She told an Inside Soap reporter that [...] "as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> this big hair, I felt the character get bigger. She strutted about more, and it brought a bit of comedy to her." [...] The actress has admitted that it took time for her make-up team to perfect Grace's look. She was unhappy with Grace's shot in the Hollyoaks opening title sequence because the hair was not big enough. But over time she began to leave the make-up department with almost square hair as it grew. Wall is supplied with an additional hair piece which is applied to her head each morning. It takes the make-up department two hours daily to wash, dress and curl it and an additional forty minutes to style it onto Wall's head. Grace's hair is very big and is often seen with differing styles, but always with plenty of volume in the roots to achieve her signature look. The hair style became known as [...] "Beryl Bouffant" [...] on the Hollyoaks set. The hair got so big that directors would sometimes complain that it was blocking views of other characters during filming.|$|E
60|$|And as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Geisenheimer's {{they played}} that 'Michigan' thing.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw his}} arms around my neck, bent me over his stomach to his breast, kissed me on both cheeks, hugged me four or five times, and then placed me in his own arm-chair. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> well again, we began {{business}} at once.|$|R
6000|$|This matter {{warmed up}} into a quarrel; then into a fight; and each man got pretty badly battered. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> myself mended up after a fashion, I ascended to the {{hurricane}} deck in a pretty sour humor. I found Captain McCord there, and said, as pleasantly as my humor would permit-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} {{everything}} in the house, mother, and you must get a grand tea <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> a servant for you--for, you know, {{you must have a}} servant now." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} I was fully {{resolved}} neither should be, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{into a situation}} to control the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{should have}} liked to have written and thanked you for them as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them,” said Ella, and Bertie’s sky clouded at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "General," [...] said I, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{into his}} paijamahs (or tent), [...] "you must leave your lunch {{if you want}} to fight the enemy." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> the bundle, and {{the maid}} {{was out of}} sight, I goes on towards the alehouse, where the porter's wife was, so that if I had met her, I had then only been going {{to give her the}} bundle, and to call her to her business, <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> was going away, and could stay no longer; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did not meet her, I walked away, and turning into Charterhouse Lane, then crossed into Batholomew Close, so into Little Britain, and through the Bluecoat Hospital, into Newgate Street.|$|R
60|$|This, I am well aware, was not {{the quickest}} way to take of obeying the {{directions}} which I had received. But I was resolved to see for myself what new mystification was going on before I trusted Rosanna's boot in the Sergeant's hands. My old notion of screening the girl, if I could, seemed to have come back on me again, at the eleventh hour. This state of feeling (to say nothing of the detective-fever) hurried me off, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> the boot, at the nearest approach to a run which a man turned seventy can reasonably hope to make.|$|R
60|$|This {{carried it}} off pretty well; and getting over this, got {{over most of}} the rest, and I began to be easy again; and, in a word, that I may dismiss the story too, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> may be, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> rid at last of my visitors, who I had wished gone two hours sooner than they {{intended}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to London," [...] Tommy answered, [...] "I {{went into}} a bookseller's shop, pretending I {{wanted to buy a}} dictionary, and I looked the word up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he protested. [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> away it {{was just}} as it always had been. I mean that your voice and your looks went {{together}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{here because}} you are," [...] he replied, and the {{simplicity}} of his reply moved her deeply. [...] "I came as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> your letter," [...] he went on.|$|E
6000|$|Kelley went on: [...] "Moreover, {{some of my}} greaser {{friends have}} started a line of fool talk about making me sheriff, and that has just {{naturally}} set the whole political ring against me. They'd just <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> killed <b>as</b> not--a little sooner. I've a right to resign, haven't I? Nobody has a license to call me a coward after what I've done, have they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me go!" [...] <b>I</b> cried, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> my wind. As {{luck would}} have it, I had run {{into a pair of}} daredevil young Kentuckians who had more than once tasted the {{severity}} of Clark's discipline,--Fletcher Blount and Jim Willis. They fairly shook out of me what had happened, and then dropped me with a war-whoop and started for the prairie, I after them, crying out to them to beware of the run. A man must indeed be fleet of foot to have escaped these young ruffians, and so it proved. When I reached the hollow there were the two of them fighting with a man in the water, the ice jangling as they shifted their feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know'd it--I know'd it!" [...] exclaimed Deerslayer, who {{was already}} {{preparing}} to force a fresh bullet into his rifle; [...] "I know'd it must come to this, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> the range from the creatur's eyes. A man sights suddenly, and fires quick when his own life's in danger; yes, I know'd {{it would come to}} this. I was about the hundredth part of a second too quick for him, or it might have been bad for me! The riptyle's bullet has just grazed my side--but say what you will for or ag'in 'em, a red-skin is by no means as sartain with powder and ball as a white man. Their gifts don't seem to lie that a way. Even Chingachgook, great as he is in other matters, isn't downright deadly with the rifle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They told me, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{into the}} county, that you, and all {{belonging}} to you, {{were preparing to}} retreat {{the morning after the}} attempt to fire your house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{determined}} to come and look you up as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> time, but the House sat very late. However, I have got a fortnight here now, and shall see plenty of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to the {{restaurant}} I felt in the lines of my palms that I should beware of a tall, red, damfool man, and I {{was going to lose}} a sum of money.|$|E
6000|$|... "Daughter, {{you shall}} {{be what you}} shall be!" [...] an oracle that made me shrug my {{shoulders}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> outside the door. Few of us know what we are to come to certainly, but for all that had happened yet, I had good hopes of living and dying a sober-minded Protestant: there was a hollowness within, and a flourish around [...] "Holy Church" [...] which tempted me but moderately. I went on my way pondering many things. Whatever Romanism may be, there are good Romanists: this man, Emanuel, seemed of the best; touched with superstition, influenced by priestcraft, yet wondrous for fond faith, for pious devotion, for sacrifice of self, for charity unbounded. It remained to see how Rome, by her agents, handled such qualities; whether she cherished them {{for their own sake}} and for God's, or put them out to usury and made booty of the interest.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, that's what I {{am going}} to do, too,' said the bad little pumpkin vine, 'all but the pies; but I'm {{not going to stay}} here to do it. I'm going to that fence over there, where the morning-glories were last summer, and I'm going to show them what a pumpkin-glory is like. I'm just going to cover myself with {{blossoms}}; and blossoms that won't shut up, either, when the sun comes out, but 'll stay open, as if they hadn't anything to be ashamed of, and that won't drop off the first day, either. I noticed those morning-glories all last summer, when I was nothing but one of the blossoms myself, and I just made up my mind that <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to be a vine, I would show them a thing or two. Maybe I can't be a morning-glory, but I can be a pumpkin-glory, and I guess that's glory enough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{guess that}} settled me. <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> to git at once, so I began to crawl off towards {{the foot of}} the cliffs. By the time <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> there, there war six torches burning a hundred yards below, and the men who carried them were searching every bush and prying under every rock. Along the middle of the valley six other torches were burning fifty yards apart. There was one advantage, the torches were {{pitch-pine}} and gave a fairish light, but not so much as tarred rope would have done; but it was enough for {{me to be able to}} make out the face of the cliff, and I saw a break by which I could get up for a good bit anyhow. It was where a torrent came down when the snows were melting, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> to the bottom I made straight up. There were rocks piled at its foot, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to the top of these without being seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{my breath}} again, I called to mind my talk with Penelope, and I said to myself, 'Here's the {{proof that he}} was in Miss Rachel's sitting-room between twelve last night, and three this morning!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “These, my lord, {{are a few}} traits {{with which}} you discern the genius [...] of Mr. Lintot, which I have chosen for {{the subject of a}} letter. I [...] dropped him as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Oxford, and paid a visit to my Lord [...] Carleton, at Middleton....|$|E
60|$|ENID. When I went I was all {{on their}} side, but as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there I {{began to feel}} quite {{different}} at once. People talk about sympathy with the working classes, they don't {{know what it means}} to try and put it into practice. It seems hopeless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{not afraid}} {{to go back to}} the town, for my own people would not know me again. In that {{fortnight}} I had grown from a young man into the man you see me; only I was older-looking then than I am now, for <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> younger in the Sahib's service. My hair had turned white, and so had my beard, which was longer and more matted than before. My forehead was wrinkled, and my cheeks had fallen away. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> to Cawnpore, <b>I</b> went straight to the jemadar's house, to see if he would recognize me; but he did not: for even my voice was hoarser and harsher than of old, through fever and exposure. So I went and told my story to the Feringhee doctor, how I had been wounded in keeping the tuhseelie for his people; and he tended my arm, and made it well again. For though the Feringhees are savage like tigers to their enemies, if you befriend them, they will treat you well. In that they are better than the Musalmans.|$|R
6000|$|... [122] Mr. Skene in his Reminiscences says:--"The {{family had}} been at Abbotsford, and it had long been their {{practice}} the day they came to town to take a family dinner at my house, which had accordingly been complied with upon the present occasion, and I never had seen Sir Walter in better spirits or more agreeable. The fatal intimation of his bankruptcy, however, awaited him at home, and next morning early I was surprised by a verbal message to come to him <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> up. Fearful that he had got a fresh attack of the complaint from which he had now for some years been free, or {{that he had been}} involved in some quarrel, I went to see him by seven o'clock, and found him already by candle-light seated at his writing-table, surrounded by papers which he was examining, holding out his hand to me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> entered, he said, [...] "Skene, this is the hand of a beggar. Constable has failed, and I am ruined de fond en comble. It's a hard blow, but I must just bear up; the only thing which wrings me is poor Charlotte and the bairns."" ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{little book}} was written before either [...] "Jane Eyre" [...] or [...] "Shirley," [...] and yet no indulgence can be {{solicited}} {{for it on}} the plea of a first attempt. A first attempt it certainly was not, as the pen which wrote it had been previously worn a good deal in a practice of some years. I had not indeed published anything before I commenced [...] "The Professor," [...] but in many a crude effort, destroyed almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> composed, <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> over any such taste <b>as</b> <b>I</b> might once have had for ornamented and redundant composition, and come to prefer what was plain and homely. At the same time I had adopted a set of principles {{on the subject of}} incident, &c., such as would be generally approved in theory, but the result of which, when carried out into practice, often procures for an author more surprise than pleasure.|$|R
