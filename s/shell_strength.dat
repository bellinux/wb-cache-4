50|$|The first RML heavy {{guns were}} {{introduced}} into British service in about 1865. By 1878, 11 models of Woolwich rifled guns had been introduced, ranging from 7 inches to 12.5 inches. Unfortunately, Woolwich rifling {{had a major}} defect, namely, that hot powder gas escaping around the ammunition ("Windage") caused excessive barrel erosion, especially in the rifling grooves. Extensive research was performed in the early 1870s to find a solution, and by 1878 two types of gas-checks had been designed. Both gas-checks were made of copper with a little added zinc. They were, in effect, shallow cups of about the same diameter as the ammunition that were attached {{to the base of}} the ammunition. When the gun was fired, the powder gas pressure forced the sides of the cup into the rifling grooves, creating a gas seal. It was immediately found that gas-checks also increased the range of guns, and provided greater accuracy. It was also realised that gas-checks were capable of rotating the ammunition, removing the need for studs. This facilitated the use of polygroove rifling, which used a lot of shallow grooves, in place of the Woolwich system which used only a few deeper grooves. Polygroove rifling was less detrimental to the strength of the guns. Also, studless ammunition was stronger and flew more accurately than studded ammunition. <b>Shell</b> <b>strength</b> was particularly important for armour-piercing ammunition.|$|E

At the end of the 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th and 11 th laying month, approximately 40 hens were randomly chosen from each housing system and slaughtered (478 hens in total). Humerus and tibia strengths were analysed using a three-point-bending machine. Keel bone status was evaluated on a scale from 1 (severe) to 4 (no deformity). <b>Shell</b> breaking <b>strength</b> was measured every four weeks, totalling 4, 887 eggs. Statistical analyses were performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Humerus and tibia strengths of LS layers housed in SG were significantly higher compared to LS hens kept in FC.

Shell colour polymorphism of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis is a well-known model in evolutionary research. Nevertheless, the knowledge on the ecological causes driving its evolution remains incomplete and proxi-mal factors shaping predatory pressure on C. nemoralis morphs are unknown. We evaluated shell crushing resistance and thickness, constituting crucial snail anti-predator de-fences in two shell areas (the apex and labium) of eight C. nemoralismorphotypes differing in shell colour and banding pattern. A GLM showed a significant effect of shell colour, banding pattern and shell thickness on <b>shell</b> <b>strength.</b> Pink shells were stronger than yellow ones, and banded forms had stronger shells than unbanded snails. The labium (usually attacked by mice) was generally thicker and more resistant than the apex (usually crushed by birds).

The combined effect of ocean acidification and warming on the functional properties of bivalve shells is largely unknown and of growing concern as the shell provides protection from mechanical and environmental challenges. We examined the effects of near-future pH (ambient pH – 0. 4 pH units) and warming (ambient temperature + 4 °C) on the shells of the commercially important bivalve, Mytilus edulis when fed for a limited period (4 – 6 h day− 1). After six months exposure, warming, but not acidification, significantly reduced <b>shell</b> <b>strength</b> determined as reductions in the maximum load endured by the shells. However, acidification resulted in a reduction in shell flex before failure. Reductions in <b>shell</b> <b>strength</b> with warming could not be explained by alterations in morphology, or shell composition but were accompanied by reductions in shell surface area, and by a fall in whole-body condition index. It appears that warming has an indirect effect on <b>shell</b> <b>strength</b> by re-allocating energy from shell formation to support temperature-related increases in maintenance costs, especially as food supply was limited and the mussels were probably relying on internal energy reserves. The maintenance of <b>shell</b> <b>strength</b> despite seawater acidification suggests that biomineralisation processes are unaffected by the associated changes in CaCO 3 saturation levels.
