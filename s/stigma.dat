5|$|<b>Stigma</b> towards TB {{may result}} in delays in seeking {{treatment}}, lower treatment compliance, and family members keeping cause of death secret – allowing the disease to spread further. At odds is Russia, where <b>stigma</b> was associated with increased treatment compliance. TB <b>stigma</b> also affects socially marginalized individuals {{to a greater degree}} and varies between regions.|$|E
5|$|Slow {{progress}} in preventing the disease may in part {{be due to}} <b>stigma</b> associated with TB. <b>Stigma</b> {{may be due to}} the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This <b>stigma</b> may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS. Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Taylor & Francis via the DOI in this record. Background: Variation in style length has been {{reported}} in Senecio vulgaris and has been associated with outcrossing rate. Aims: To determine if (i) long styles lack germinated pollen on <b>stigmas</b> left to self-pollinate, (ii) successful self-pollination causes styles to stop elongating and shrink in length and (iii) seed set increases with the amount of pollen deposited on <b>stigmas.</b> Methods: Determined germinated self-pollen on <b>stigmas</b> of long and short styles after auto-self-pollination; scored style length over 48  h in self-pollinated and non-pollinated florets; recorded seed set after placing different amounts of pollen on <b>stigmas.</b> Results: Most long-styled florets had zero or low amounts of germinated pollen on <b>stigmas</b> in contrast to most short-styled florets. Styles initially elongated to the same length in self-pollinated and non-pollinated florets, then shrank in length in self-pollinated florets while continuing to elongate in non-pollinated florets. Seed set increased with number of pollen grains deposited on <b>stigmas.</b> Conclusions: Successful self-pollen deposition and/or germination on <b>stigmas</b> of S. vulgaris are indicated by presence of short styles, whereas the opposite is indicated by presence of long styles in florets left to self-pollinate.

5|$|<b>Stigma</b> is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The <b>stigma</b> may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E
5|$|The many stamens are {{arranged}} in two series, which is a distinctive characteristic of the genus. The inner stamens are fused at the base to form a short tubular structure. The outer stamens arise from along the floral tube. The style is usually dark red and has a <b>stigma</b> with 6–8 lobes; the style plus <b>stigma</b> is roughly the same length as the stamens. If the flower is fertilized, a fleshy fruit forms, either smooth or with ribs. The brown or black seeds are about 1mm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive <b>stigma</b> surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the <b>stigma</b> of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
60|$|Pollen from a short-styled {{plant was}} placed on the five <b>stigmas</b> of a long-styled flower, and these, after thirty hours, were found deeply {{penetrated}} by a multitude of pollen-tubes, far too numerous to be counted; the <b>stigmas</b> had also become discoloured and twisted. I repeated this experiment on another flower, and in eighteen hours the <b>stigmas</b> were penetrated by a multitude of long pollen- tubes. This is what might have been expected, as the union is a legitimate one. The converse experiment was likewise tried, and pollen from a long-styled flower {{was placed on}} the <b>stigmas</b> of a short-styled flower, and in twenty-four hours the <b>stigmas</b> were discoloured, twisted, and penetrated by numerous pollen-tubes; and this, again, is what might have been expected, as the union was a legitimate one.|$|R

40|$|Menstruation <b>stigmas</b> {{and a lack}} of {{facilities}} to manage periods have been identified as possible hinders for girls’ equal access to education all over of the world. This paper focuses on investigating how menstruation <b>stigmas</b> generate obstacles for girls’ equal access to, and participation in, education. Its aim is to investigate how girls in an Indian context perceive menstruation <b>stigmas</b> to affect them, {{particularly when it comes to}} school attendance and ability to learn in school. This is done by conducting group wise individual respondent interviews with female students from a school deemed to be less likely to subject its students to strong restricting <b>stigmas</b> and norms. An informant interview with the school principal, a text analysis of the school’s biology text book and respondent interviews with teachers were used as additional material for the study. The girls at the analysed school were found to perceive their capabilities to participate in education to be affected by menstruation <b>stigmas</b> and norms. Because these results were found in a less stigmatising environment, the paper suggests that students subjected to even more social pressure might be even more affected by menstruation <b>stigmas.</b> Recommendations are thus for development research and practice to break taboos and lessen the <b>stigmas</b> that surround menstruation...|$|R
5|$|The ovary is {{inferior}} (below {{the floral}} parts) and trilocular (three chambered) {{and there is}} a pistil with a minutely three lobed <b>stigma</b> and filiform (thread like) style, which is often exserted (extending beyond the tube).|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the <b>stigma,</b> style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the <b>stigma</b> {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a narrative, autoethnographic, theoretical {{account of the}} public and private negotiation of “minor bodily stigmas,” which are mild physical “imperfections” that make us fear we stand out and might be rejected. To examine the situated complexity of stigmatized identity, I tell a story that shows concrete interactional details of an episode in which minor bodily <b>stigmas</b> evolved into a significant topic of conversation between strangers. My personal narrative explores the felt experience of minor bodily <b>stigmas</b> {{from the perspective of the}} experiencing and interacting holder. Thus, my work problematizes Erving Goffman 2 ̆ 7 s sociological approach to <b>stigmas,</b> which examines inclusively all forms of <b>stigmas</b> from a distanced observational stance of beholder that privileges the outsider perspective of how others see us. Using minor bodily <b>stigmas</b> as a heuristic category, I emphasize how they are experienced as a double bind in interaction (to notice or not to notice) and a double bind in personal feelings (of moral character as well as physical appearance). I seek to connect theoretical and categorical understandings of minor bodily <b>stigmas</b> to their concrete felt experience in day-to-day life in order to examine possibilities for resisting and reframing <b>stigmas</b> in everyday life...|$|R

5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and <b>stigma</b> so that the pollen either fails to reach the <b>stigma</b> or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
