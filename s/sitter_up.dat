40|$|We use the {{auxiliary}} fields and (excited-) de Sitter solutions {{to study the}} standard power spectrum of primordial fluctuations of a scalar field in the early universe. The auxiliary fields are the negative norm solutions of the field equation and as it is shown, with a fixed boundary condition, utilizing these states results in a finite power spectrum without any infinity. The power spectrum {{is determined by the}} de <b>Sitter</b> solutions <b>up</b> to some corrections and the space-time symmetry is not broken in this point of view. The modulation to the power spectrum is of order (H/Λ) ^ 2, where H is the Hubble parameter and Λ is the energy scale, e. g., Planck scale.

The wave amplitudes are assumed to form a homogeneous and isotropic stochastic process. No restriction for the wavelengths is assumed. The effective stress-energy tensor T^e_μν is calculated {{in terms of the}} correlation functions of the process. We discuss in particular a situation where T^e_μν is the dominant excitation of the background metric.

40|$|We {{develop the}} basics of twistor theory in de <b>Sitter</b> space, <b>up</b> to the Penrose {{transform}} for free massless fields. We treat de Sitter space as fundamental, as one does for Minkowski space in conventional introductions to twistor theory. This involves viewing twistors as spinors of the de Sitter group SO(4, 1). When attached to a spacetime point, such a twistor can be reinterpreted as a local SO(3, 1) Dirac spinor. Our approach highlights the antipodal map in de Sitter space, which gives rise to doublings in the standard relations between twistors and spacetime. In particular, one can generate a field with both handedness signs from a single twistor function. Such fields naturally live on antipodally-identified de Sitter space dS_ 4 /Z_ 2, which has been put forward as the ideal laboratory for quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant.

5000|$|The three-quarter {{portrait}} shows a dark-skinned man in orange-red open collar clothing, {{sitting on}} a stone bench, against a muted background, with the <b>sitter</b> taking <b>up</b> most the frame. Large metallic manacles are visible around his wrists, which lie on his lap, and a heavy chain falls across the bench {{and out of the}} frame. The man is gazing up and to his left. [...] At its original showing it was entitled, The Captive Slave, and the viewer is informed of the sitter's condition as a slave by the manacles and by his dark skin, which connects him to the African slave trade. His clothes suggest somewhat foreign origin but also prison garb. The features of the subject show the man as a recognizable individual person. The painting is described as a portrait but also a hybrid with genre painting, as the name of the character in the painting is unknown. [...] His aspect is saintly or heroic, imploring, vulnerable, and somewhat passive in rest, which allowed the British viewer when the portrait was shown to safely sympathize or pity the subject and deplore his condition. While the portrait follows high art conventions for depicting the saintly or long suffering, portraits of individual slaves were rare in the European high art tradition.|$|R

50|$|Frans Hals painted {{an unusual}} pair of wedding portraits for them, showing Isabella in an active state of {{presenting}} her husband with a rose, with {{only half of}} the rose showing in the painting. She is standing, and her husband is seated with his hand outstretched in a passive state of expectation. Though many pendant wedding portraits from the Dutch Golden Age have since been split up, this particular pair of portraits, that have been split up since 1886, receive the most commentary about this fact in the documentation. Hals certainly never gave any other woman so much action in a portrait painting. Her hair is also loose on her shoulders, and she is wearing a décolletage, though modest.

40|$|As {{quotient}} spaces, Minkowski and de Sitter {{are fundamental}} spacetimes {{in the sense}} that they are known "a priori", independently of Einstein equation. They represent different non-gravitational backgrounds for the construction of physical theories. If general relativity is constructed on a de Sitter spacetime, the underlying kinematics will no longer be ruled by Poincaré, but by the de Sitter group. In this case the definition of diffeomorphism changes, producing concomitant changes in the notions of energy and entropy. These changes are explicitly discussed for the case of the Schwarzschild solution, in which the black hole and the de <b>Sitter</b> horizons show <b>up</b> as a unique entangled system. Such entanglement, together with energy conservation, create a constraint between the black hole activity and the evolution of the de Sitter radius, providing a new scenario for the study of cosmology.

60|$|The wedding morning came. Nobody {{would have}} {{imagined}} from appearances that Blooms-End had {{any interest in}} Mistover that day. A solemn stillness prevailed around the house of Clym's mother, {{and there was no}} more animation indoors. Mrs. Yeobright, who had declined to attend the ceremony, sat by the breakfast table in the old room which communicated immediately with the porch, her eyes listlessly directed towards the open door. It was the room in which, six months earlier, the merry Christmas party had met, to which Eustacia came secretly and as a stranger. The only living thing that entered now was a sparrow; and seeing no movements to cause alarm, he hopped boldly round the room, endeavoured to go out by the window, and fluttered among the pot-flowers. This roused the lonely <b>sitter,</b> who got <b>up,</b> released the bird, and went to the door. She was expecting Thomasin, who had written the night before to state that the time had come when she would wish to have the money, and that she would if possible call this day.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a recent proposal for defining a conserved mass in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes {{that is based}} on a conjectured holographic duality between such spacetimes and Euclidean conformal field theory. We show that an algorithm for deriving such terms in asymptotically anti de Sitter spacetimes has an asymptotically de Sitter counterpart, and derive the explicit form for such terms up to 9 dimensions. We show that divergences of the on-shell action for de Sitter spacetime are removed in any dimension in inflationary coordinates, but in covering coordinates a linear divergence remains in odd dimensions that cannot be cancelled by local terms that are polynomial in boundary curvature invariants. We show that the class of Schwarzschild-de <b>Sitter</b> black holes <b>up</b> to 9 dimensions has finite action and conserved mass, and construct a definition of entropy outside the cosmological horizon by generalizing the Gibbs-Duhem relation in asymptotically dS spacetimes. The entropy is agreement with that obtained from CFT methods in $d= 2 $. In general our results provide further supporting evidence for a dS/CFT correspondence, although some important interpretive problems remain. Comment: 16 pages, LaTeX, typos correcte...|$|R
40|$|Since 1952 the Geological Department of the Leiden University {{has carried}} out the {{geological}} mapping of the southern slopes of the Cantabrian Mountains in the provinces of Palencia and León in northern Spain, slowly progressing from east to west. Our interest has been centred almost exclusively on the Palaeozoic rocks. Untill recently very little was known or published about {{this part of the}} Cantabrian Mountains. Quiring, 1939, had given some provisional maps, the 1 : 400. 000 Spanish maps gave only the broadest of outlines and the survey by Comte dating from before the war was not published until 1959, when our mapping had already covered the same territory. The stratigraphic sequence of the Paleozoic extends from the earliest Cambrian, resting on some Pre-Cambrian (de <b>Sitter,</b> 1961 b), <b>up</b> to the highest Carboniferous. The Lower Palaeozoic, Cambrian to Silurian, crops out only in the western portion of the map and has a rather uniform development, described adequately by Comte, 1959, and further details of the Cambrian by Lotze and Sdzuy, 1961. Devonian outcrops occur scattered over the whole map area, and are of particular interest to stratigraphers because of their rich fauna (Comte, 1959, Kullman, 1960). The Devonian is less uniform than the older formations and shows variations indicating its development in well defined separate areas. Comte (1959) gave an excellent description of the rocks of the Bernesga-Esla zone. The development of the Carboniferous sequence is very variable due to several distinct folding periods of varying intensity (de Sitter, 1961 a) and its stratigraphical development is still doubtful in many areas...|$|R
40|$|The future {{evolution}} of the universe suggested by the cosmological model proposed earlier at this meeting by the authors is explored. The fundamental {{role played by the}} positive "cosmological constant" is emphasized. Dyson's 1979 paper entitled "Time Without End" is briefly reviewed. His most optimistic scenario requires that the universe be geometrically open and that biology is structural {{in the sense that the}} current complexity of human society can be reproduced by scaling up its (quantum mechanical) structure to arbitrary size. If the recently measured "cosmological constant" is indeed a fundamental constant of nature, then Dyson's scenario is, for various reasons, ruled out by the finite (De Sitter) horizon due to exponential expansion of the resulting space. However, the finite temperature of that horizon does open other interesting options. If, as is suggested by the cosmology under consideration, the current exponential expansion of the universe is due to a phase transition which fixes a physical boundary condition during the early radiation dominated era, the behavior of the universe after the relevant scale factor crosses the De <b>Sitter</b> radius opens <b>up</b> still other possibilities. The relevance of Martin Rees' apocalyptic eschatology recently presented in his book "Our Final Hour" is mentioned. It is concluded that even for the far future, whether or not cultural and scientific descendants of the current epoch will play a role in it, an understanding (sadly, currently lacking) of community and political evolution and control is essential for a preliminary treatment of what could be even vaguely called scientific eschatology.
