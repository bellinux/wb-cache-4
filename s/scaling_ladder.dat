60|$|A postern {{had been}} unbarred below by Fortemani, who {{had led the}} way with a half-dozen of the men; and a huge <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder</b> that lay in {{readiness}} in that subterranean gallery was rushed out across the moat, which at this point was a roaring torrent.|$|E

60|$|At {{last one}} <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder</b> was planted upon {{the bodies of}} the dead, and hooked firmly on the gunwale of the hoarding. Ere it could be hurled off again by the English, it was so crowded with men that even Hereward's {{strength}} was insufficient to lift it off. He stood at the top, ready to hew down the first comer; and he hewed him down.|$|E
60|$|Of {{the enemy}} they caught no glimpse; {{not so much}} as a sentry, for every one of Gian Maria's men had been pressed into the {{investment}} of the castle. Thus they emerged from Roccaleone, and made their way down that rough bridge into the pleasant meadows to the south. Already Fortemani and his dozen men had disappeared at the trot, making for the front of the castle, when Francesco stepped last upon the bridge, and closed the postern after him. Then he glided rapidly to the ground, and with the assistance of a dozen ready hands he dragged away the <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder.</b> They carried it some yards from the brink of the torrent, and deposited it in the meadow. With a laugh of purest relish Francesco stepped to Valentina's side.|$|E
60|$|Fascines and <b>scaling</b> <b>ladders</b> were prepared. The Green Brigade were to {{head the}} assault, and Gustavus, {{addressing}} them, bade them remember New Brandenburg.|$|R

60|$|They marched, {{over the}} ice of Lake Champlain, down to Ticonderoga, where they rested a week, and {{constructed}} three hundred <b>scaling</b> <b>ladders.</b> Three days' further march, up Lake George, {{brought them to}} the English fort.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{plan was}} started long about '83 {{for no other}} reason than to show the men who were then in the service how to use the <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder</b> which had just been introduced, and the idea seemed to work so well that it {{gradually}} grew, kind of swelled out, so to speak, till it became a reg'lar school. First off, before the new headquarters was built, the city hired an old sugar warehouse on One Hundred and Fifty-eighth Street and North River, where the men were shown how to use scaling ladders and a life net, and I've been there when one class counted up sixty scholars, all of us old hands at the business. Remember this, Amateur, you'll never be too old to go to school, leastways that's what I've found.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{assembled}} people thronging round {{the corpse of}} the priest, heard the madman shouting in his frenzy, as if to a great body of adherents round him, to pour down the molten lead and the scorching sand; to hurl back every <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder</b> planted against the walls; to massacre each prisoner who was seized mounting the ramparts to the assault; and as they looked up to the building from the street, they saw at intervals, through {{the bars of the}} closed gates, the figure of Ulpius passing swift and shadowy, his arms extended, his long grey hair and white robes streaming behind him, as he rushed round and round the temple reiterating his wild Pagan war-cries as he went. The enfeebled, superstitious populace trembled while they gazed--a spectre driven on a whirlwind would not have been more terrible to their eyes.|$|E
60|$|The besiegers {{held the}} bridge, and some strong towers upon the bridge; {{and here the}} Maid of Orleans {{attacked}} them. The fight was fourteen hours long. She planted a <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder</b> with her own hands, and mounted a tower wall, but was struck by an English arrow in the neck, and fell into the trench. She was carried away and the arrow was taken out, during which operation she screamed and cried with the pain, as any other girl might have done; but presently {{she said that the}} Voices were speaking to her and soothing her to rest. After a while, she got up, and was again foremost in the fight. When the English who had seen her fall and supposed her dead, saw this, they were troubled with the strangest fears, and some of them cried out that they beheld Saint Michael on a white horse (probably Joan herself) fighting for the French. They lost the bridge, and lost the towers, and next day set their chain of forts on fire, and left the place.|$|E

60|$|The Normans {{knew that}} well; and as Hereward spoke two panels {{in the front}} of the sow creaked on their hinges, and dropped landward, forming two draw-bridges, over which reeled to the attack a close body of knights, mingled with {{soldiers}} bearing <b>scaling</b> <b>ladders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{next night}} (6 May) the castle was stormed {{with the aid}} of <b>scaling</b> <b>ladders.</b> The Roundheads took about {{a quarter of an hour}} to reach the walls of the castle. The <b>scaling</b> <b>ladders</b> proved to be too short, but despite the {{defenders}} throwing boulders down upon the attackers (doing more injury than their gunfire had caused) the Parliamentarians managed to scale the walls and enter the castle. The Royalists fled from the parapets, begging for quarter, which was granted. Parliamentarian casualties were eight killed and about 40 wounded. The Royalists suffered about 50 killed with 100 officers and between 650 and 800 soldiers taken prisoner. Among the officers captured were Sir Charles Dallison, the former Recorder of Lincoln, and Sir Francis Fane.|$|R
60|$|The result, however, was, that he {{abandoned}} plans of further conquest, {{and turned his}} steps again toward the west. He met with various adventures as he went on, and incurred many dangers, often in a rash and foolish manner, and for no good end. At one time, while attacking a small town, he seized a <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder</b> and mounted with the troops. In doing this, however, he put himself forward so rashly and inconsiderately that his ladder was broken, and while the rest retreated he was left alone upon the wall, whence he descended into the town, and was immediately surrounded by enemies. His friends raised their ladders again, and pressed on desperately to find and rescue him. Some gathered around him and defended him, while others contrived to open a small gate, by which {{the rest of the}} army gained admission. By this means Alexander was saved; though, when they brought him out of the city, there was an arrow three feet long, which could not be extracted, sticking into his side through his coat of mail.|$|E

50|$|On May 22, 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant {{ordered an}} assault on the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

50|$|Joan of Arc {{initiated}} {{an assault}} on the town walls, surviving a stone projectile that split in two against her helmet as she climbed a <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder.</b> The English suffered heavy losses. Most estimates place the number at 300-400 of some 700 combatants. Suffolk became a prisoner. The French had some 1200 troops and their losses appear to have been light. Joan moved her army to Meung-sur-Loire. There, she decided to launch an assault.|$|E
50|$|In March 1959, just a {{few months}} before the opening of the college, the Elvet block (then the main block of the college) was devastated by fire. However, the college {{recovered}} to open as scheduled in October and adopted the phoenix as its unofficial badge. The college coat of arms features a <b>scaling</b> <b>ladder</b> (or gré—the badge of the Grey family) between two St Cuthbert's crosses (the symbol of Durham). A new grant of arms in 2004 confirmed these and added the phoenix as a crest.|$|E
60|$|Carlisle was {{assaulted}} by Douglas, but unsuccessfully.

60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of that day a detachment of English and Dutch troops twelve hundred strong was ordered to assemble in the allied camp for the purpose, as was supposed, of covering the embarkation. <b>Scaling</b> <b>ladders</b> and everything necessary for an assault had already been privately prepared by the Catalan peasants under Peterborough's instructions.|$|R
50|$|Although heartbroken {{from these}} events, Hwang Jin ordered his {{garrison}} {{to defend the}} castle. As the Japanese raised <b>scaling</b> <b>ladders</b> under cover of arquebusiers, the Koreans dumped rocks and hot burning oil on the Japanese. The Koreans also returned fire with bows, mortars, and arquebuses. Unfortunately, when the Japanese brought in siege towers, the Koreans were unable to resist.|$|R
