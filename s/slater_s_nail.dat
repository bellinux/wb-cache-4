We now demonstrate that murine CMV (MCMV) {{infection of}} SV 40 -transformed macrophages and fibroblasts prevents presentation of SV 40 T antigen to SV 40 -specific CTL. MCMV-infected macrophages failed to stimulate SV 40 -immune CTL precursors in vitro. In addition, MCMV-infected, SV 40 -transformed macrophage and fibroblast target cells lost their susceptibility to lysis by {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I-restricted, SV 40 -specific CTL clones. MCMV infection did not alter the synthesis of SV 40 T antigen in the target cells. MCMV early gene expression was required for inhibition of SV 40 T-antigen presentation; immediate-early gene expression was insufficient for this effect. Early viral gene expression also resulted in significant reduction of H- 2 K and H- 2 D molecules {{on the surface of}} MCMV-infected fibroblasts. However, this reduction occurred independently from suppression of antigen presentation to CTL. The same target cells which were resistant to lysis by SV 40 CTL were susceptible to lysis by MCMV-specific CTL. MCMV early gene products therefore interfere with the processing and/or presentation of SV 40 T-antigen determinants to CTL independent of alterations in the major histocompatibility complex...|$|R

This {{is accompanied by}} a significant decrease in surface expression of H- 2 Kb and H- 2 Db. We therefore examined the effects of MCMV infection on the intracellular expression of H- 2 Kb and H- 2 Db by immunoprecipitation with conformation-independent antibodies. MCMV early-gene products severely repressed synthesis of H- 2 Kb and H- 2 Db. This down-regulation was not restored by gamma interferon treatment. The MCMV-induced suppression of MHC class I protein synthesis resulted in a retarded rate of accumulation of these molecules within the cell. In addition, MCMV infection prevented maturation of class I heavy chains to the fully glycosylated forms and inhibited transport of H- 2 Db from the endoplasmic reticulum-cis Golgi. Virus infection had no effect on the rate of degradation of the class I molecules. These results demonstrate that MCMV early-gene products down-regulate synthesis and posttranslational events in MHC class I expression, thereby limiting the number of antigen-presenting molecules within infected cells.

Through close-readings {{of the character}} of Mr Darcy, and comparing and contrasting the re-interpretations of him with the original character in Pride and Prejudice, I argue that by taking it upon themselves to give Mr Darcy a new story and a new life they are taking an active role in reading Pride and Prejudice and making the change from reader to author. I argue that the authors have taken liberties in changing the character in order to make him more compatible with the fantasies they are trying to fulfill. My analysis has shown how the authors of these novels show loyalty to the character and to Austen herself, by defending his actions and arrogance, and how his arrogance and pride survive the re-imaginings of his character. Through giving Mr Darcy a new story and new destiny, the authors are contributing in keeping the character, and the original novel, alive beyond the original pages of Pride and Prejudice.

The third person limited point of view shifts protagonists every time a character comes into contact with a certain shade of red nail polish, Million Dollar Red. According to Quynh, the owner of the salon, the polish has the magical power to give women what they need but not what they want. Once the six women have encountered the color, the narrative rotates through their lives, alternating between manicurist and client. Each client enters the salon with a personal conflict, but this conflict changes with the application of the red polish and the interaction with the manicurist. In the backdrop, the manicurists struggle with the central conflict: the impending health inspection. Million Dollar Red exaggerates the differences and similarities of the women in Eastside San Jose, pitting their cultural stereotypes against each other comically, ironically, and sometimes tragically.

40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{presented}} a study of those electrons which hold together a chemically elementary crystal and {{are responsible for the}} homoeopolar bonds between neighboring atoms. The starting point of the theory is Slater's form of the secular equations for first order perturbations arising from the interactions of identical atoms composing a system. A rigorous solution of these equations is given in section 4. The investigation is carried through in a unified way for magnetic and non-magnetic materials, with respect to internal energies and to magnetic properties. As anticipated by Heisenberg, the deciding factor is the sign of the Heitler and London interchange integral J 1. Substances with large negative J 1 are non-magnetic, those with large positive J 1, potentially ferromagnetic. For non-magnetic bodies, the theory gives a confirmation of Bloch's conclusions with slight differences of interpretation. On the other hand, the results for magnetic materials are new and entirely different from Bloch's. As to specific heats, it is found that at very low temperatures they have the expression c= 0. 208 sR(T/θ) 3 / 2, where R is the gas constant, s the number of valency electrons per atom, and θ has a close relation to the Curie point. With respect to ferromagnetism, the result is that a crystal satisfying Slater's equations is spontaneously magnetized almost to saturation but that the polarity of this magnetization changes its sense at irregular intervals. This fact suggests that ferromagnetic crystals must have a block structure and that they are coherent, {{in the sense of the}} validity of <b>Slater</b> <b>s</b> equations, only within the blocks (compare sections 10 and 11). With this hypothesis the theory accounts for the fundamental facts of ferromagnetism...|$|R

Methods: Review of the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) data identified 5244 male patients in whom an intertrochanteric proximal femoral fracture had been treated in a VA hospital between 1998 and 2005. The overall sample was used to assess trends in device use, thirty-day mortality, thirty-day surgical complications, and one-year mortality. Next, propensity score matching methods were used to compare 1013 patients identified as having been treated with an intramedullary nail with 1013 patients who had a sliding-screw procedure. Multiple logistic regression models for the matched sample were used to calculate odds ratios for mortality and complications according to the choice of internal fracture fixation. Results: Use of intramedullary nails in VA facilities increased from 1998 through 2005 and varied by geographic region. Unadjustedmortality and complication percentages were similar for the two procedures, with approximately 8 % of patients dying within thirty days after surgery, 28 % dying within one year, and 19 % having at least one perioperative complication.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) infection causes down-regulation {{of major}} histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains. We determined previously {{that there are two}} HCMV loci which encode functions responsible for that phenotype and that US 11 is one of these loci (T. R. Jones, L. A. Hanson, L. Sun, J. <b>S.</b> <b>Slater,</b> R. M. Stenberg, and A. E. Campbell, J. Virol. 69 : 4830 - 4841, 1995). Through the construction and analysis of defined viral mutants and stably transfected cell lines, we identify US 2 as the other locus. US 2 is expressed from very early through late times postinfection, with its predominant product being a relatively unstable 24 -kDa endoglycosidase H-resistant glycoprotein. In cell lines constitutively expressing US 2, free class I heavy chains are proximal targets for US 2 -induced degradation, shortly after their synthesis. Both US 2 and US 11 can function in concert with US 3 to down-regulate class I. Beta- 2 -microglobulin-associated heavy chains which are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as a result of binding to the US 3 glycoprotein are susceptible to destabilization caused by both US 2 and US 11 gene products. Thus, three HCMV genes which affect either the stability or the transport of class I heavy chains have been identified. The observation that each of these proteins is most abundant early in the replicative cycle suggests that they may play an important immunomodulatory role in vivo prior to productive infection, either during the latent or persistent phase or during reactivation...|$|R

Currently accepted concepts such as early fixation of long-bone fractures in multiply injured patients, immediate fix-ation of open fractures, use of the piri-formis fossa as an entry portal, limited reaming, and the value of interlocking screws were all identified in this seminal article. How has the information in the article withstood the “test of time”? The striking results of this study, which surpassed those provided by any other treatment technique, {{had a profound effect on}} the management of femoral shaft fractures in North America. In a preliminary 1971 report 1, the authors had noted a promising technique, but this large series was compelling evidence of its superiority over traction, cast-bracing, and open fixation. The article ushered in the era of intramedullary nailing and spawned numerous clinical and biome-chanical investigations in American trauma centers. The basic principles of closed nailing delineated in this study are valid today. How has our thinking changed with regard to this subject since the publi-cation of this landmark work? The relatively high rates of shortening and malrotation reported by the authors have been addressed over the last fifteen years by a remarkable growth in inter-locking nailing systems. Improvements in reamer and nail designs, reduction ma-neuvers, and retrograde nailing tech-niques have also been advocated. Closed intramedullary nailing of femoral frac-tures has remained one of the most pre-dictable and rewarding procedures in orthopaedic trauma care...|$|R

(2010). PHEBUS: A double {{ultraviolet}} spectrometer {{to observe}} Mercury's exosphere. Planetary and Space Science, 58 (1 - 2), 201 - 223. Probing of Hermean exosphere by ultraviolet spectroscopy (PHEBUS) {{is a double}} spectrometer for the Extreme Ultraviolet range (55 ? 155 nm) and the Far Ultraviolet range (145 ? 315 nm) devoted to the characterization of Mercury's exosphere composition and dynamics, and surface?exosphere connections. This French-led instrument is implemented in a cooperative scheme involving Japan (detectors), Russia (scanner) and Italy (ground calibration). PHEBUS will address the following main scientific objectives relative to Mercury's exosphere: determination of the composition and the vertical structure of the exosphere; characterization of the exospheric dynamics: day to night circulation, transport between active and inactive regions; study of surface release processes; identification and characterization {{of the sources of}} exospheric constituents; detection and characterization of ionized species and their relation with the neutral atmosphere; space and time monitoring of exosphere/magnetosphere exchange and transport processes; study and quantification of escape, global scale source/sink balance and geochemical cycles synergistically with other experiments of BepiColombo (Mercury Sodium Atmospheric Spectral Imager (MSASI), Mercury Plasma Particle Experiment (MPPE) on Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO); Mercury imaging X-ray spectrometer (MIXS), Search for exosphere refilling and emitted neutral abundance (SERENA) on Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO)). Two gratings and two detectors are used according to a specific, compact design. The spectrum detection is based on the photon counting method and is realized using micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors with Resistive Anode Encoder (RAE). Typical photocathodes are CsI or KBr for the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) range, CsTe for the far ultra-violet (FUV) range. Extra visible lines are monitored using a photo-multiplier (PM) that is also used in photon counting mode. In order to prevent sensitivity losses which are critical in UV ranges, a minimum of reflections is achieved inside the instrument using only an off-axis parabola and a set of holographic gratings. A one degree-of-freedom scanning system allows to probe, at the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio, selected regions and altitude ranges of interest. Different modes of observation will be used sequentially (vertical scans, along-orbit scans, grazing observations at twilight, etc.). During the mission, the instrument will be regularly calibrated on well chosen stars, in such a way to quantitatively estimate the overall degradation of the sensitivity of the instrument.

40|$|Removal of {{fracture}} fixation devices due to symptomatic or asymptomatic {{reasons is}} a costly procedure which is further increased when complications are encountered. One {{of the main}} difficulties faced by a surgeon is a timely and successful removal of the device due to excessive bone overgrowth. Due to the increased time required for removal of the bone from the device, complications such as increased surgery time, excessive blood loss, debris contamination and implant breakage are often encountered. Practically all internal fixation systems such as locking compression plate constructs, and intramedullary nails, are fabricated for clinics with a micro-rough surface. However, it is well known, that surface micro-topography can be {{a major factor in}} determining the type, and extent of tissue integration. Despite the knowledge that surface microtopography can be a major determinant of osseointegration, this avenue has only been investigated for applications requiring accelerated bony integration and has not previously been explored as a potential resolution to issues involving device removal. Thus, we hypothesise that reducing the surface micro-topography of clinically available materials will reduce the incidence of excessive bony over-growth, and consequently will ease implant removal. To investigate this hypothesis, we first characterised, using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, contact angle, and white light profilometry, changes in the surface micro-topography of the clinically available materials commercially pure titanium (cpTi), titanium- 6 %aluminum- 7 %niobium (TAN), and titanium- 15 %molybdenum (Til 5 Mo) in their standard micro-rough form, as well as in their experimental electropolished, and paste polished form. Stainless steel (Ss) was included as the orthopaedic grade 'smooth 9 surface control. Additionally, we employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to examine the changes, if any, in the chemical composition of the surfaces. Overall, it was shown that both electropolishing and paste polishing techniques were successful at reducing the micro-roughness of the respective materials, as well as producing a smoothened surface morphologically. As all surfaces were anodised subsequent to polishing, alterations in the surface chemical composition were not evident. Initial in vitro analysis, which involved culturing rat calvarial cells on the various surfaces, showed that surface polishing did not significantly influence cell growth compared to standard micro-rough counterparts. Furthermore, viability on these surfaces was not found to be significantly different from standard micro-rough samples, indicating that overall, surface polishing does not affect the cytocompatibility of cpTi, TAN or Til 5 Mo. However, paste polished TAN was found to be the exception. Specifically, viability was significantly reduced on this surface compared to standard micro-rough TAN. While cell growth was not significantly affected on paste polished TAN, it was observed that initial cell attachment for this surface was lower compared to standard micro-rough TAN. Fluorescent labelling of the cytoskeletal components actin, tubulin and vinculin revealed that cell morphology was differentially influenced by the various surface morphologies. Generally, polished surfaces advocated a more well spread, elongated phenotype compared to the cuboidal phenotype noted for cells cultured on micro-rough surfaces. Paste polished TAN and standard micro-rough TAN samples also showed some degree of cytoskeletal disruption attributable to the inherent presence of beta-phase particles on their surface. Subsequent analysis of genotype, using real time PCR technology, revealed that for cpTi, TAN and Til 5 Mo samples, surface polishing essentially provokes its influence in different manners at initial stages of differentiation and consequently then similarly at the later stages of terminal differentiation, and that the magnitude of this effect is material dependent [...] Subsequently, we applied surface polishing technology to two clinically relevant internal fixation systems, namely locking compression plates (LCP) and screws, and intramedullary nails (IM), to assess if surface polishing holds potential for reducing implant removal related morbidity. In our LCP model electropolished, paste polished and standard TAN cortical screws were evaluated in combination with electropolished, paste polished and standard cpTi plates, respectively, with stainless steel screws and plates included as a control system. Samples were implanted in a bilateral non-fracture sheep tibia model for 6, 12 and 18 months. At each timepoint, removal torque and percentage of bone contact were quantified for each screw type. Results indicate that both polishing techniques significantly reduce the torque removal required for cortical screws, compared to standard micro-rough cortical screws. Histomorphometric analyses indicated that polished constructs showed a trend for reduced bone contact, however, this was only found to be significantly different for paste polished screws. In our second in vivo model, IM nails fabricated from standard micro-rough TAN and paste polished TAN were implanted in a bilateral, non-fracture sheep model for 12 months. Control animals were implanted with <b>Ss</b> IM <b>nails</b> and standard micro-rough TAN IM nails in the contralateral tibia. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
