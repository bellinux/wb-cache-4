The synergy at the national level is decomposed at the level of states and Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) as regions. Thereafter, we zoom in to the state of California and in even more detail to Silicon Valley. Our results do not support the assumption of a national system of innovations in the U. S. A. Innovation systems appear to operate {{at the level of the}} states, the CBSA regions are too small, so that <b>systemness</b> spills across their borders. Decomposition of the sample in terms of high-tech manufacturing (HTM), medium-high-tech manufacturing (MHTM), knowledge-intensive services (KIS), and high-tech services (HTKIS) does not change this pattern, but refines it. The East Coast [...] New Jersey, Boston, and New York [...] and California are the major players, with Texas a third one in the case of HTKIS. At the regional level, Chicago and industrial centers in the Midwest also contribute synergy.

40|$|This paper aims to {{highlight}} {{the analysis of the}} integrated role of time and knowledge factors for the SME competitiveness in the service sector, in the perspective of an intersystemic co-evolution. Particularly, it refers to hotels. The analysis is developed from a conceptual base emphasizing time value in its subjective (i. e. socio-cultural) perspective, in the recursive setting of firm knowledge, here synthesized within the time-knowledge binomial, and cal-led co-evolutionary time. The appropriateness of this analysis is motivated by the observation of the evolutionary dynamics emerging in this sector. The paper combines theory and practice thanks to the case study of the Sextantio “albergo diffuso”, a hotel appreciated throughout the world for its innovative business.

40|$|We {{present a}} model to assess the <b>systemness</b> of an {{innovation}} system. Patent and citation data with an institutional address in Catalonia (1986 - 1996) were analyzed in terms of relational linkages and the development in these distributions over time was evaluated using methods from systems dynamics. Relational linkages are extremely scarce. A transition at the systemâ s level could be indicated around 1990 when using institutional addresses, but not when using cognitive categories. The institutional restructuring has led {{to changes in the}} pattern of linkages (coauthorship, etc.), but the reproduction of the systemâ s knowledge base has remained differentiated. We conclude that although a system in several other respects, Catalonia cannot (yet) be considered as a (knowledge-based) innovation system.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{system at}} the European level can be conceptualized as a pattern of relations among member states that tends to be reproduced despite disturbances in individual trajectories. The Markov property is used {{as an indicator of}} <b>systemness</b> in the distribution. The individual trajectories of nations participating in the European Monetary System is assessed using an information theoretical model that is consistent with the Markov property in the multivariate case. Economic and monetary integration are analyzed using independent data sets. Increasing integration can be retrieved in both of these dimensions, notably since the currency crises of 1992 and 1993. However, the dynamics for countries which have strongly coupled their currency to the German Mark are different from those which did not. Additionally, developments in inflation and exchange rates at the European level are assessed in relation to global developments. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper elaborates on the Triple Helix {{model for}} {{measuring}} {{the emergence of a}} knowledge base of socio-economic systems.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} nature and extent of {{political}} party institutionalization in Kenya. More specifically, it focuses on the four dimensions of party institutionalization, namely organizational <b>systemness,</b> value-infusion, decisional autonomy and reification. The study itself is largely located within the historical-institutionalist school of thought, with particular emphasis on the path dependency strand of this theoretical framework. However, the study also employs a political economy approach. It recognizes that the development trajectory of party politics in Kenya did not evolve in a vacuum but within a particular historical-institutional and political-economic context. The thesis advances the notion that those current low levels of party institutionalization that are evident in almost all parties, and the relatively peripheral role that they have in Kenya's governance can be traced to Kenya's colonial and post-colonial political history, the resource poor environment and the onset of globalization...|$|E

40|$|Complexity {{science is}} {{increasingly}} cited {{as an essential}} component of a Futures Studies (FS) capable of assisting with the wide-ranging and complex societal problems of the 21 st century. Yet, the exact implications of complexity science for FS remain somewhat opaque. This paper explicitly sets out the challenges for FS that arise from six complexity science concepts: 1) irreversibility of time 2) path dependence 3) sensitivity to initial conditions 4) emergence and <b>systemness</b> 5) attractor states 6) complex causation. The discussion highlights the implications of these challenges for FS tools such as horizon scanning and weak signals, and sets out the benefits of overcoming the challenges to create an explicitly complexity orientated FS. The discussion concludes with a set of questions summarising the challenge for FS from complexity science with the aim of stimulating a discussion as to how they can be met. The concluding remarks make some initial suggestions in this regard...|$|E
40|$|Using the Triple Helix {{model of}} university-industry-government relations, one can measure {{the extent to}} which {{innovation}} has become systemic instead of assuming the existence of national (or regional) systems of innovations on a priori grounds. <b>Systemness</b> of innovation patterns, however, can be expected to remain in transition because of integrating and differentiating forces. Integration among the functions of wealth creation, knowledge production, and normative control takes place at the interfaces in organizations, while exchanges on the market, scholarly communication in knowledge production, and political discourse tend to differentiate globally. The neoinstitutional and the neo-evolutionary versions of the Triple Helix model enable us to capture this tension reflexively. Empirical studies inform us whether more than three helices are needed for the explanation. The Triple Helix indicator can be extended algorithmically, for example, with local-global as a fourth dimension or, more generally, to an N-tuple of helices.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the longitudinal trend of <b>systemness</b> in networked research relations in South Korea using a triple helix (TH) indicator of university-industry-government (UIG) relations. The data were harvested from the Science Citation Index (SCI) and its {{counterparts in the}} social sciences (SSCI) and the arts and humanities (A&HCI). The total number of Korean SCI publications has grown rapidly since 1965. However, the TH indicator shows that the network dynamics have varied considerably according to the research policies of the national government. The collaboration patterns, as measured by co-authorship relations in the SCI noticeably increased, with some variation, from the mid- 1970 s to the mid- 1990 s. However, inter-institutional collaboration {{in the first decade of}} the 21 st century was negatively influenced by the new national science and technology (S&T) research policies that evaluated domestic scientists and research groups based on their international publication numbers rather than on the level of cooperation among academic, private, and public domains. The results reveal that Korea has failed to boost its national research capacity by neglecting the network effects in science, technology, and industry.

40|$|To {{eliminate}} {{the problems of}} climate warming, several countries have devoted {{a great deal of}} time and money to reduce CO 2 emissions by replacing combustion energy power plants with cleaner technologies such as wind, hydro or solar power. However, with this energy transition new demand rises to the power grid. This new demand constitutes a major challenge both economically and technologically, yet very little research has been conducted on infrastructure transformation. This thesis seeks to explain how technological change comes about in infrastructure sectors. To explain the mode of technological change, the European HVDC subsea cable industry was chosen as a case unit. Using the sectoral system of innovation (SSI) perspective, this paper examines three dimensions of the European HVDC subsea cable industry, namely; (1) knowledge and technologies; (2) actors, relationships and networks; and (3) institutions. This paper shows that infrastructure sectors evolve slowly due to the techno-economic properties of infrastructures. An example of this is the external <b>systemness</b> dependency on the functioning of the infrastructure service. This creates highly risk-averse customers and thus slowing down technological change. Homogenous demand and technology with high cumulativeness has also created a very homogenous firm environment that might also slow down technological change. This thesis ends by suggestions some policy implications to help facilitate faster technological change in the infrastructure sectors...|$|E
40|$|Leveraging {{technology}} {{may be a}} viable solution in the higher education industry as enrollments decline and institutions {{have a hard time}} meeting their projected budgets. One innovative approach to mitigating this problem was approved in March of 2013 by the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York (SUNY). It is called Open SUNY. Open SUNY consists of nine components: the creation and expansion of online programs to meet workforce development needs, the development of online credit-bearing experiential learning experiences, support for training of faculty who opt to use emerging technologies, support for student access to online courses, the availability of prior learning assessment system-wide, the development of a research initiative to identify best practices and offer professional development, exploration of open education resources to bring down costs for students, support for expansion of online program development, and the creation and promotion of learning commons to facilitate communication and house content. The purpose of this qualitative bounded case study was to observe the rollout of Open SUNY from the fall of 2014 through spring of 2015 in order to describe the experience of stakeholders at SUNY’s various campuses. To triangulate the data, multiple sources were used to observe the phenomenon such as interviews, documents and surveys. Purposeful sampling allowed for all institution types and geographic areas {{to be included in the}} population sample. Data were coded and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Three themes that arose from the data interpretation were: inclusiveness, <b>systemness,</b> and openness.
