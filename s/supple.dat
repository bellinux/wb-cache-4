5|$|Sorabji {{was also}} {{influenced}} by Eastern culture. According to Michael Habermann, this manifests itself in the following ways: highly <b>supple</b> and irregular rhythmic patterns, abundant ornamentation, an improvisatory and timeless feel, frequent polyrhythmic writing and the vast dimensions {{of some of his}} compositions.|$|E
5|$|The ideal riding camel is strong, {{slender and}} long-legged with thin, <b>supple</b> skin. The special adaptations of the dromedary's feet {{allow it to}} walk with ease on sandy and rough terrain and on cold surfaces. The camels of the Bejas of Sudan and the Anafi camel bred in Sudan are common breeds used as riding camels.|$|E
5|$|The bark {{of other}} {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become <b>supple,</b> less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.|$|E

5000|$|Peacocke knew {{he wanted}} to be an actor from the age of 16. He had many {{performances}} on stage at Newcastle University, one of which he was awarded a City of Newcastle Drama Award for his portrayal of Ricko in Nick Enright's A Property of the Clan in 2004. He went on to act in the short play festival Brand Spanking New with actress Bel Deliá [...] in playwright/director Augusta <b>Supple's</b> work Interrupting Grace directed by Nick Curnow, and also on <b>Supple's</b> later venture Stories from the 428. He also had a role in Kit Brookman's It Was Raining All Afternoon.|$|R
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as <b>supple</b> and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E

5|$|X (stylized as X & Y) is {{the third}} studio album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was {{released}} on 6 June 2005 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by Coldplay and producer Danton <b>Supple.</b> It is noted for its troubled and urgent development, with producer Ken Nelson having originally been tasked with producing much of the album; however, many songs written during his sessions were discarded owing to the band's dissatisfaction with them. The album's cover art {{is a combination of}} colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code.|$|E

5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his <b>supple</b> wrist action.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually <b>supple</b> skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E

25|$|Blaufränkisch wines have {{aromas of}} dark ripe {{cherries}} and dark berries, are spicy, have medium tannin levels and sometimes very good acidity. Young wines are deeply fruity {{and become more}} velvety, <b>supple</b> and complex with age.|$|E
25|$|Impulsion {{can occur}} at the walk, trot and canter. It is highly {{important}} to establish good, forward movement and impulsion at the walk, as achieving desirable form in the trot and canter relies heavily on {{the transition from a}} good, <b>supple,</b> forward walk.|$|E

50|$|Business or {{retailers}} {{who have}} strong relationships with local suppliers {{do not have}} to go through a long supply chain which will help to reduce the cost of sales, resulting in attracting more consumers with a lower selling price.

25|$|Central Otago {{with the}} second highest area planted, has strong, sweet plum and cherry {{flavours}} and thyme notes. In wines from cooler sub-regions there are edgier qualities with fresh herb, spice and pronounced mineral flavours. Wairarapa produces wines that are lighter, softer and more <b>supple.</b> Waipara in Canterbury has two styles. Wines produced on the flat valley floor are lighter and <b>supple</b> and have a bias toward red fruits. Pinot produced on the surrounding hills appear more concentrated, with dark fruit flavours and occasionally with a chalk/mineral influence. Nelson is similarly divided into two sub-regions with the Waimea plains producing accessible wines with vibrant acidity and those from the Moutere Valley producing wine that is richer, more concentrated and structured.|$|E
25|$|Abhidharma in the Pali Canon differentiates {{between a}} root cause (hetu) and facilitating cause (pacca). By the {{combined}} interaction of both these, an effect is brought about.
