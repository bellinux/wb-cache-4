5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Act, various {{treaties}} and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and native peoples. Most notably, {{a series of}} eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the indigenous and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921. These treaties are agreements with the Canadian Crown-in-Council, administered by Canadian Aboriginal law, and overseen by the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Development. The role of the {{treaties and}} the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982. These rights may include provision of services, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> and exemption from taxation. The legal and policy framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, {{the federal government can}} initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E

25|$|Fox {{argues that}} if the liberal {{commitment}} to autonomy is important enough {{for the state to}} mandate childrearing practices <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and basic education, that very same interest is important enough for the state to mandate safe, effective, and functionally integrated genetic practices that act on analogous all-purpose traits such as resistance to disease and general cognitive functioning. He concludes that the liberal case for compulsory eugenics is a reductio ad absurdum against liberal theory.|$|E

25|$|Specific {{occupational}} safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry. Construction workers might be particularly at risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of drowning. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies the fishing, aviation, lumber, metalworking, agriculture, mining and transportation industries as among some of the more dangerous for workers. Similarly psychosocial risks such as workplace violence are more pronounced for certain occupational groups <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> employees, police, correctional officers and teachers.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of Mandatory Swedish {{argue that}} it brings Finland closer to the Nordic countries, since Swedish is quite similar to, {{and to some extent}} {{mutually}} intelligible with, both Danish and Norwegian, while Finnish belongs to the unrelated Finnic language group. Supporters also say that studying Swedish makes it easier to learn other Germanic languages, such as English and German. Lastly, they argue, mandatory Swedish is necessary to ensure that Swedish-speakers can interact with governmental institutions and get service, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> in their own mother tongue.|$|E
25|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} rule have persistent, long term effects {{on the success of}} former colonies. Lakshmi Iyer, of Harvard Business School, conducted research to determine the impact type of rule can have on a region, looking at postcolonial India, where both systems were present under British rule. Iyer’s findings suggests that regions which had previously been ruled indirectly were generally better-governed and more capable of establishing effective institutions than areas under direct British rule. In the modern postcolonial period, areas formerly ruled directly by the British perform worse economically and have significantly less access to various public goods, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> public infrastructure, and education.|$|E

25|$|Premier Wen Jiabao {{delivered}} the working Government Report {{for the year}} 2006, and gave a policy outlook for 2007 during the opening session of the NPC {{on the morning of}} March 5, 2007. The speech lasted nearly two hours and fifteen minutes, and focused largely on populist issues <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and education, with an unprecedented tone addressing corruption, waste, and environmental concerns. As in previous years, urban-rural and regional disparities were a common theme. Wen opened saying that this is the last year of the 10th National People's Congress, and thus the government's term will legally expire by March 2008. In his 2007 outlook he stressed various issues of general concern of late.|$|E
25|$|Denmark {{also began}} {{a number of}} reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their {{dependence}} on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms {{have led to a}} number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments. Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.|$|E

Jarman later left the office, and Harbin's salary was cut substantially.
