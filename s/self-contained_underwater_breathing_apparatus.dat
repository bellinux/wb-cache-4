25|$|Scuba diving {{implies the}} use of an {{autonomous}} breathing gas supply carried by the diver, the <b>self-contained</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> which provides the name for this mode of diving. Scuba may be the simpler and more popular open circuit configuration or one of the more complex and expensive closed or semi-closed rebreather arrangements. Rebreathers used for recreational diving are generally designed to require a minimum task loading on the diver and as far as possible to fail safe and give the diver ample warning to bail out to open circuit and abort the dive.|$|E

25|$|Diving with a <b>self-contained</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus,</b> {{which is}} {{completely}} independent of surface supply, provides the diver with {{the advantages of}} mobility and horizontal range far beyond what is possible when supplied from the surface by the umbilical hoses of surface-supplied diving equipment. Scuba has limitations of breathing gas supply, communications between diver and surface are problematic, {{the location of the}} diver may be difficult to monitor, and it is considered a higher-risk mode of diving in most circumstances. Scuba is specifically forbidden for some professional applications. Decompression is often avoided, and if necessary, is generally in-water, but may use a variety of gases.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawback}} to the equipment pioneered by Deane and Siebe was {{the requirement for}} a constant supply of air pumped from the surface. This restricted the movements and range of the diver and was also potentially hazardous as the supply could get cut off {{for a number of}} reasons. Early attempts at creating systems that would allow divers to carry a portable oxygen source did not succeed, as the compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, two basic templates for scuba, (<b>self-contained</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus),</b> had emerged; open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaust is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the diver's unused oxygen is filtered from the carbon dioxide and recirculated.|$|E
25|$|Scuba diving {{is a form}} of {{underwater}} diving {{where the}} diver uses a <b>self-contained</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> (scuba) which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers. Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas. Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit; therefore, a smaller cylinder or cylinders, may be used for an equivalent dive duration. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption, they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E
