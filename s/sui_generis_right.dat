Since rights should not be created in any which way if one is to avoid privileges and rent-seeking, {{it is important to be}} clear about design constraints stemming from such rights being species of property rights, adapted to deal with the particular content of information structures that need special encouragement or protection. Examination of the logic of property rights in general and of intellectual property rights in particular reveals that intellectual property rights are sought because of their decentralised incentive and information effects, but that they need to be circumscribed because of the monopolistic effects they entail. The trouble with monopoly is that whilst it is in place, one does not realise the creativity that is prevented from emerging. All intellectual property rights reflect compromises of these contradictory tendencies and as a result, more and stronger intellectual property rights are not necessarily better from a general welfare point of view. The forms of <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>rights</b> proposed for folklore appear modelled on copyright, but with the removal of several key features that define the equilibrium inherent in copyright: no originality requirement; no known creation date or creators; indefinite duration. Folklore kept secret is altogether taken out of commerce. As a result, these rights strike a balance very much more to the monopoly side of the spectrum than do existing intellectual property rights and hence risk severely constraining creativity. This may seem like an acceptable constraint given the objective of preservation, but one must realise that it will affect the future carriers of the protected information. Faced with severe restrictions on ways they can improve their lives within the protected setting, they may well opt for the exit option and head for greener pastures. This would severely strain efforts to preserve whatever the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>rights</b> aim to protect. Information lock-up may not be the most promising formula for preservation...|$|R

50|$|A {{chemical}} patent, {{pharmaceutical patent}} or drug patent is a patent for an invention in the chemical or pharmaceuticals industry. Strictly speaking, in most jurisdictions, there are essentially {{no differences between}} the legal requirements to obtain a patent for an invention in the chemical or pharmaceutical fields, in comparison to obtaining a patent in the other fields, {{such as in the}} mechanical field. A chemical patent or a pharmaceutical patent is therefore not a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right,</b> i.e. a special legal type of patent.|$|E

Dickson described the nature of Aboriginal title as a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> that has no equivalent. It is an inherent right that existed because of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and is based upon the requirement to surrender land to the Crown as well as the historic relationship between the Crown and Aboriginals.

50|$|The {{copyright}} protection of computer programs was, {{and to some}} extent still is, the subject of much debate in France.

The legal position was resolved by the transposition of May 14, 1991 EU Directive into French law: computer programs and any associated preparatory works qualify for {{copyright protection}} in France as in other European Union jurisdictions.

40|$|This Paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of legal protection of databases in USA and EU. EU, {{with the intention}} to strengthen it's postition in the world database industry, introduced by a Directive 96 / 9 /EC a legal experiment of <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> to databases, protecting databases {{on the basis of}} an investment only, regardless of the coypright law requirement of originality. USA does not offer the Directive's <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right,</b> however protects the databases by whole range of traditional means of legal protection. On the basis of the comparative analysis of the traditional and present legal protection of databases in the EU and USA, as well as a critical assessment of the Directive and it's impact on the EU database industry, the Author rebuts the U. S. <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> proponents' arguments and proves her initial hypothesis that USA does not lack <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> protection, nor does it have a single reason to introduce this legal experiment into it's well established and working legal system...|$|E
40|$|The European Database Directive {{introduced}} a new protection regime for database producers in 1996. This was to complement the already existing copyright protection for collections. This new <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> offers protection to producers who undertake a substantial investment {{in the production of}} a database. Even though it was presented as a unique right without precedent, its scope closely resembles an intellectual property right, while its rationale – preventing misappropriation of another’s investment – is related to the tenet of unfair competition. The <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> is the main focus of this book. Its most important concepts are extensively discussed, such as the criterion of the substantial investment, the definition of the producer, and the scope of the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right.</b> For this, a comparative study is made of the literature and case law of the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom. Particular attention is paid to the important judgments which the European Court of Justice delivered on the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> in November 2004. Furthermore, consideration is given to the (re) introduction of a compulsory licensing regime to ward off information monopolies.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to assemble, store, and make available information in databases is ever growing. This development has accelerated in recent decades, {{driven by the}} advent and increased use of digital networks. Already at an early stage, it led to demands for legal protection of databases. In most countries databases have been protected in national legislation based on copyright principles. However, this kind of protection has been regarded as insufficient. The {{reason for this is}} that copyright protection only covers the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database. By rearranging the contents, it is possible to avoid liability for copyright infringement. To address the specific needs of producers of databases, the then European community adopted a directive in 1996 on the legal protection of databases. The Directive aims to harmonise copyright protection for databases and to introduce a new, <b>sui</b> <b>generis,</b> <b>right</b> for the legal protection of databases. The <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> protects the investments in obtaining, verifying, and presenting the contents in a database. The <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> has been described in the literature as one of the most complex intellectual property rights ever established. Its complexity resides in the unclear relationship between the requirements for protection and the content and scope of protection. This dissertation describes, analyses, compares and systematises the legal protection for databases as provided for in the EU Database Directive – both in relation to copyright and sui generis protection, but also in relation to the intellectual property system in general and principles and rules on unfair competition. The study also describes and analyses the Directive as implemented into Swedish law. To do this, it makes use of relevant legal sources, with particular account taken of relevant sources of EU law such as the Directive itself, adjacent directives in the field of copyright and related rights, as well as unfair competition law and the case law and legal method developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The study also draws on underlying theories of intellectual property protection and unfair competition law, as well as arguments based on unjust enrichment and pure economic loss. The study establishes how the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right</b> serves as a legal hybrid between traditional intellectual property rights and protection against unfair competition. The structure of the right resembles traditional intellectual property rights, with requirements for protection, provisions on exclusive rights, exceptions and limitations and a term of protection. At the same time, the content and scope of protection provide measures similar to those countering unfair competition with aspects of protection against pure economic loss. The right protects against certain activities carried out in the market rather than providing protection for a traditional object of intellectual property law. When implementing the Directive, the Swedish legislator overlooked these aspects of the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>right,</b> creating legal uncertainties when interpreting and applying the national legislation. The study concludes with a look forward and suggestions for future research...|$|E
