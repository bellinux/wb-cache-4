A comparison with the global <b>sea-level</b> <b>chart</b> shows that some breaks correspond to third-order cycles.

Most of the siliciclastic turbidites were derived from source areas rich in quartz detritus: detailed studies show that two source areas provided quartzose detritus to the Sulu Sea in the Miocene. In the Celebes Sea, volcanic source areas were also important source areas of terrigenous detritus. Turbidites of redeposited carbonate sediments occur in both basins...|$|E
40|$|During the Triassic, Siberia was a basin {{approximately}} 1800 kilometers wide {{filled by}} red beds and the widespread Tunguska basalts. Rifting {{occurred in the}} northern part of the basin. The western part of the Siberian basin became the West Siberian basin, which was bounded by rising uplifts both to the east and to the west. The differentiation between the effects of tectonics and eustasy in cratonic basins is simple in that the global eustatic signal is basin-wide and enhanced by regional and local tectonics. Thus the first, second and third order cycles of the Upper Jurassic - Turonian in the West Siberian Basin were primarily influenced by eustasy. The Upper Jurassic - Turonian was deposited during an overall transgression and is subdivided into two second-order and sixteen third-order transgressive-regressive cycles. Fourth-order cycles appear to be controlled by delta shifting. A relative sea-level curve for the Upper Jurassic - Turonian resembles the "global" <b>sea-level</b> <b>chart</b> of Hardenbol, et al.

40|$|The middle Eocene Tamet Formation on {{the eastern}} side of the Sirte Basin, is largely shallow-marine {{carbonate}} platform-to-basin transition formed along passive margin. The stratigraphy and deposition of this formation were largely controlled by eustatic processes of superimposed short-term and long-term of relative sea-level fluctuations. Tamet sediments were mostly deposited in subtidal environments, which ranged from above fairweather- to below storm wave-base. Intrinisic processes such as storm and wave redeposition and reworking may have acted to inhibit aggradation into the zone of peritidal sedimentation. Estimates of water depth during deposition range from a few metres to a few tens metres maximum. There are three major plat formal facies associations in the transition from deep subtidal to hypersaline deposits. These facies associations are defined and interpreted on the basis of their constituent microfacies and depend on their palaeogeographic setting on the platform. The spatial distribution of the complete spectrum of the facies associations suggest that deposition took place under low-energy conditions, as a stacked prograding homoclinal ramp. Ten microfacies types have been distinguished, and their vertical interrelationships reflect metre-scale, shallowing-upward subtidal cycles, which are considered as the basic building blocks of the Tamet ramp. Two different types of subtidal cycle have recognised in the study area. Open-marine subtidal cycles are present along the outer through inner ramp within the transgressive and most of the highstand deposits. They are characterised by relatively deep subtidal microfacies at the base, gradationally overlain by shallow subtidal microfacies. Hypersaline subtidal cycles are present only upon the Cyrenaica Platform and predominated during the late phase of highstand deposition; they are composed of dolomitised shallow subtidal microfacies, capped by anhydrite. The middle Eocene across this area is not a single carbonate ramp but rather an amalgamation of stacked ramps. Facies associations and cycles within the Tamet Formation have allowed the recognition of three depositional sequences separated by stratigraphic transitional zones. Each sequence represents a prograded ramp. The development of a sequence framework is based on the metre-scale cycle architecture and maintaining microfacies interpretations. Most of the sequences are interpreted as transgressive-highstand deposits. Each transgressive ramp is typically characterised by an aggradational patterns of relatively deep subtidal mud-rich carbonates deposited in a catch-up depositional system and episodically affected by storm events. Away from the ramp-margin, the transgressive facies change and stratigraphically thin into lagoonal facies deposited under keep-up conditions. The subsequent highstand ramp begins with an aggradational geometry but finally shifts into a distinct progradational pattern. The highstand cycles cover a broader area than that occupied by the transgressive sediments and are made up of mud-poor packstones reflecting a keep-up depositional system. The Cyrenaica Platform at this time was occupied by a very shallow and hypersaline sea. Carbonate sedimentation was shut off and replaced by precipitation of shallow-water evaporites; associated with this was dolomitisation, marking the end of sequence. Several lines of evidence suggest that the magnitude of the middle Eocene sea-level fluctuations {{on the eastern}} Sirte Basin were relatively low. First, if the magnitude of the oscillations had been greater, then the sea-level falls would potentially have lead to formation of major sequence boundaries on the Tamet sequence upper surfaces. Second, if the magnitude was larger, then the rapid sea-level rises would have caused drowning of the ramp or domination by "catch-up" style of subtidal deposits. However, the Haq et al.

40|$|Scope and {{outline of}} the thesis: With the aim set for this study, the European {{sequence}} chosen as reference for global correlation is the Barremian type section at Angles, SE France (Birkelund et al., 1984). Various studies on this section, which contains a Barremian-Aptian transition interval, have already described its ammonite stratigraphy (Delanoy, 1995), δ 13 C isotope stratigraphy (Wissler et al., 2002), and dinocyst content (e. g. De Renéville and Raynaud, 1981; Srivastava, 1984; Wilpshaar, 1995). A corresponding stratigraphic interval was sampled at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) site 263 located on the NW Australian continental margin. To test the established bio-stratigraphic framework for Australia, further drillholes were chosen from two other depositional basins, i. e., from the Carpentaria Basin the Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) Mossman- 1 core, and from the Eromanga Basin: Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) Hughenden- 7, GSQ Manuka- 1, and GSQ Eromanga- 1, drillcores. In Chapter 2 the direct correlation between an Australian Barremian-Aptian marine section with European ammonite controlled standard successions, based on corresponding stratigraphic events in the compositional development of the dinoflagellate assemblages is presented. It outlines {{the correlation between the}} Barremian-Aptian part of DSDP site 263 in NW Australia, and the equivalent interval in the Barremian stratotype section at Angles, SE France. The correlation provides a suit of nine dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) index events, which are useful for cross- hemisphere comparisons. These dinocyst events further enable age-assessment for the Australian dinocyst zonation scheme traditionally used for Austral biostratigraphic correlation. Palaeoenvironmental evaluation of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in DSDP site 263 indicates that the NW Australian margin was affected by cool water-currents during the Barremian-Aptian. In Chapter 3 the established timeframe from chapter 2 is applied to BMR Mossman- 1 located in northeastern Australia. Comparison of the palynostratigraphic framework, elaborated with δ 13 Corg data, with time equivalent Tethyan and Atlantic records shows identical bio- and geochemical stratigraphic changes and reveals an interval in BMR Mossman- 1, which most likely corresponds to oceanic anoxic event (OAE) 1 a. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions are based on groups distinguished within the dinocyst and spore/pollen assemblages. These groups indicate warmer and wetter conditions prior to OAE 1 a changing to cooler and drier conditions starting at the onset of OAE 1 a. The δ 13 Corg results add new detail to global stratigraphic changes in Barremian-Aptian carbon isotope records and confirm the assumption that OAE 1 a was of global extent. In comparison with the global <b>sea-level</b> <b>chart</b> of Hardenbol et al. (1998), the changes in palynology, carbon isotope stratigraphy, and lithology allow identification of variations within a third order cycle. In Chapter 4 the dinoflagellate cyst zonation as presented in chapter 2 and 3 is further tested by applying it to three cores from the Eromanga Basin in eastern Australia; GSQ Hughenden- 7, GSQ Manuka- 1, and GSQ Eromanga- 1, respectively. The dinocyst events combined with the δ 13 Corg records inferred an Early Aptian to Albian age for the studied sections. The changes in palynology, isotope stratigraphy and lithology are deduced to reflect third order sea-level fluctuations. Comparison of the data with the BMR Mossman- 1 core from the Carpentaria Basin reveals that the start of the mid-Cretaceous marine incursion into the Eromanga Basin is related with the earliest Aptian sea-level rise. Further comparison with time-equivalent Tethyan records shows that the Toolebuc Formation relates to OAE 1 c and correlates with the inflexion point of a relative maximum sea-level fall in the earliest Late Albian. The same palaeoenvironmental groups as in the previous chapter have been used, they indicate cooler and drier conditions at the onset, changing to warmer and more humid conditions within {{the upper part of the}} Toolebuc Formation. In Chapter 5 comparison of Barremian to Albian sequences from the three Early Cretaceous depositional basins in Australia show similar variations within the δ 13 Corg stratigraphy as in timeequivalent Atlantic and Pacific sequences. The observed excursions in the isotope records from the European and Australian sequences can be correlated by biostratigraphic events. For the Barremian-Albian time interval eleven successive dinocyst events proof to be useful for global comparisons. Correlation of the selected results reveals similar patterns and responses in the δ 13 Corg records for the Tethyan, Boreal and Austral realms, and that two periods of oceanic anoxic events, representing OAE 1 a and 1 c, can be recognized in Australia as well. Furthermore, it enabled recognition of mid-Cretaceous stage and substage boundaries in Australia, and as such provides age assessment for the Australian dinocyst zonation scheme. The similar patterns in the carbon isotope records, and the response of the palynological assemblages from Australia and other areas to palaeoenvironmental and climatic changes during the mid-Cretaceous indicate that OAE 1 a and 1 c were of global extent. The first anoxic event lies within the transgressive systems tract of cycle T 13, and the latter correlates to the inflexion point of the regressive R 14 and following transgressive systems tract of cycle T 15, indicating that the underlying driving forces for the various OAEs differ...|$|E
40|$|The late Eocene to {{earliest}} Oligocene sediments between Punakaiki and Westport on the West Coast of the South Island, {{including the}} Brunner Coal Measures and the Rapahoe Group, comprise an unconformity-bounded transgressive-regressive sequence. The lower unconformity, below the Brunner Coal Measures, is formed on Cretaceous and Paleozoic granitoids, metamorphic rocks, and the Paleozoic Greenland Group metasediments. The upper bounding unconformity is located below the shoreline Little Totara Sand (a {{part of the}} Rapahoe Group) around Cape Foulwind, and between {{other elements of the}} Rapahoe Group and the overlying Nile Group limestones south of Charleston. The upper unconformity is usually erosional, and at Woodpecker Bay dissolution of a layer of rhodolithic limestone indicates subaerial exposure of the unconformity surface. An Early Whaingaroan age for the upper unconformity has been obtained at Gibsons Beach: the more southern exposures of the upper unconformity are poorly dated but consistent with this age. No correlative unconformity has been recognised in the Eocene-Oligocene successions at Greymouth and Murchison, but an exposure at Whitecliffs near Inangahua contains an unconformity related to sea-level fall, and of a similar age. Breccia deposition at the Little Wanganui River mouth was initiated in the Early Whaingaroan, and may be causally related to the upper unconformity. The restriction of the upper unconformity to the area north of Punakaiki suggests that a local tectonic event, or tectonic basin controls, may be the cause of the erosion. Global <b>sea-level</b> <b>charts</b> do not suggest a major sea-level fall at this time.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{comprehensive}} magnetostratigraphic study of early Eocene (Ypresian) sedimentary sequences in the London Basin, Belgium, and the Varengeville outlier of northern France. A re-investigation of part of the lower Eocene section at Whitecliff Bay (Isle of Wight), in the Hampshire Basin, has also been carried out. The palaeomagnetic results from each area are used to refine existing litho- and biostratigraphic correlations. The magnetostratigraphy of the sedimentary sequence in each area is linked to the geomagnetic polarity time-scale using biostratigraphic data from calcareous nannoplankton and dinoflagellates. The Ypresian deposits were laid down during the interval spanning geomagnetic Chrons C 24 BR to C 22 R. In the Hampshire Basin, deposition of Lutetian (middle Eocene) sediments extended into Chron C 21 R, but the apparent absence of a record of Chron C 22 N suggests an unconformity separating the lower and middle Eocene of between 0. 6 and 2. 0 Ma in duration, at the basin margin. In this paper, recently acquired Ypresian stratigraphic data are integrated with previously published data, and a high-resolution 'even-stratigraphy' is developed for the Ypresian deposits of the southern margin of the North Sea Basin.

Warm months were characterized by thermic indices (TI) based on values of the standardized anomalous temperatures. Different patterns of anomalously warm and cold months were qualitatively identified {{on the basis of}} the spatial distributions of the TIs. The standardized sea-level pressure (SLP) values at 56 grid points in the domain 35 – 65 °N, 30 °W– 40 °E, for each of the anomalously warm and cold months, were subjected to T-mode Principal Component Analysis.

40|$|Sequence-stratigraphic {{concepts}} {{are used to}} identify genetically related strata and their bounding regional unconformities, or their correlative conformities, in seismic, well-log, and outcrop data. Documentation and age dating of these features in marine outcrops {{in different parts of}} the world have led to a new generation of Mesozoic and Cenozoic <b>sea-level</b> cycle <b>charts</b> with greater event resolution than that obtainable from seismic data alone. The cycles of sea-level change, interpreted from the rock record, are tied to an integrated chronostratigraphy that combines state-of-the-art geochronologic, magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data. In this article we discuss the reasoning behind integrated chronostratigraphy and list the sources of data used to establish this framework. Once this framework has been constructed, the depositional sequences from sections around the world, interpreted as having been formed in response to sea-level fluctuations, can be tied into the chronostratigraphy. Four cycle charts summarizing the chronostratigraphy, coastal-onlap patterns, and sea-level curves for the Cenozoic, Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic are presented. A large-scale composite-cycle chart for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic is also included (in pocket). The relative magnitudes of sea-level falls, interpreted from sequence boundaries, are classified as major, medium, and minor, as are the condensed sections associated with the intervals of sediment starvation on the shelf and slope during the phase of maximum shelf flooding during each cycle. Generally, only the sequence boundaries produced by major and some medium-scale sea-level falls can be recognized at the level of seismic stratigraphic resolution; detailed well-log and/or outcrop studies are usually necessary to resolve the minor sequences. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate {{platforms}} {{are increasingly}} being studied using sequence stratigraphic concepts and models borrowed {{from the study of}} siliciclastic shelves in passive margin settings. The direct transposition of the stratigraphic model for a siliciclastic shelf to its carbonate counterpart, the carbonate shelf, assumes that the two systems respond in a very similar way to changes of relative sea-level, the interpreted major control upon depositional stacking patterns. Current models depicting the sequence stratigraphic evolution of carbonate shelves are and have been frequently applied without regard for the differences between the siliciclastic and carbonate shelf depositional systems. It is {{the purpose of this study}} to test the current sequence stratigraphic model and its assumptions for a carbonate shelf. Carbonate shelves do differ quite fundamentally from their siliciclastic equivalents. The carbonate shelf has the capacity to respond in quite different ways to changes in relative sea-level, compared to siliciclastic systems, as a result of the strong physio-chemical control upon carbonate sedimentation and the potential high rates of carbonate production at the shelf margin in comparison to rates of relative sea-level rise. Carbonate sedimentation rates are also differential across a shelf and highly sensitive to slight environmental' changes such as nutrient upwelling and temperature increases or decreases. This can lead to abrupt changes of sedimentation rate not necessarily related to changes of relative sea-level. Because of these differences carbonate shelves can develop stratal patterns similar to siliciclastic settings, but in the majority of cases they are very different. In direct contrast to siliciclastic systems the lowstand systems tract is normally impoverished on the flanks of carbonate shelves. Two different end-members of lowstand sedimentation are distinguished for carbonate shelves and these reflect the inherited morphology of the slope: low angle, mud-dominated slopes are characterized by basin-floor slides and debrites during times of falling relative sea-level and by a relatively large volume autochthonous slope wedge. In direct contrast, high angle slopes are characterized by basin-floor megabreccias and volumetrically very small or even absent autochthonous slope wedges. The carbonate transgressive systems tract can also develop a wide variety of stratal patterns, a reflection of the often complex interplay of variable sedimentation rates and rates of relative sea-level rise. Two different types of geometric stacking pattern are distinguished: type 1 geometries, developed when sedimentation rates are less than rates of relative sea-level rise, and type 2 geometries formed when sedimentation rates are equal to or greater than rates of relative sea-level rise. The highstand systems tract is the time of maximum carbonate production potential and is normally associated with rapid basinwards progradation. For the highstand systems tract two different types of foreslope progradation are distinguished, slope aprons and toe-of-slope aprons. These differences between carbonate and siliciclastic depositional models suggest that simple application of the previously published models can lead to incorrect interpretation of systems tracts, sequences and therefore relative sea-level curves. Sequence stratigraphic models and concepts are tested by application to the spectacular seismic scale exposures of the mid-Cretaceous Urgonian platform, SE France. The platform is divided into a lower regressive' part, the Glandasse Formation and an upper 'transgressive' part the Urgonian Limestone Formation. These are dominated by progradational outer-shelf grainstone facies and aggradational shelf-lagoonal facies respectively. Criteria are developed to identify key surfaces and stratal packages upon the Urgonian platform. On the shelf sequence boundaries are readily defined and are marked by sub-aerial exposure surfaces associated with meteoric diagenesis. Lowstand sedimentation is generally absent, but can be represented by lacustrine facies. Strong erosional truncation is only developed on the shelf if siliciclastics are introduced during lowstand of sea-level. Thus, the transgressive and highstand systems tracts dominate shelf sedimentation but can only be distinguished if a clear flooding surface is developed, and this is not always the case. On the slope large-scale erosional surfaces developed by sedimentary bypass and/or slope collapse can develop at any stage of a sequence and make identification of the sequence boundary more difficult Similarly, on the basin-floor allochthonous debris derived from slope collapse and/or bypassing is not restricted to times of falling relative sea-level. From the criteria developed for identification of key stral surfaces and packages a sequence stratigraphy for the Urgonian platform is built This is placed within the time scale of Haq et al. (1987), and relative sea-level curves for the platform are constructed. These are compared to the eustatic <b>sea-level</b> <b>charts</b> from which they differ significantly. Minimum aggradation rates are also compared to other well known ancient carbonate platforms, from which the Urgonian is shown to have very high sedimentation rates...|$|R
