5|$|Historians' {{assessments}} of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. While there is consensus that the type was obsolete, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it nevertheless proved successful. Others, including the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre, have judged that the Vengeance's performance was mixed and the type was not suited to Australia's requirements.|$|E
5|$|Other {{details about}} the {{poisoning}} have always been in dispute. While <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Claudius was in Rome, others claim he was in Sinuessa on the night he was poisoned. Whether one ingestion of poison was only enough to cause Claudius to fall ill and whether a second dose was given to kill him is also debated.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> double-sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize vessels in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Women {{from within}} the Black Lives Matter, {{including}} professor and civil rights advocate Treva B. Lindsey, have argued that BLM has sidelined black women's experiences in favor of black men's experiences. For example, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> more protests have been organized around the killings of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin than around the killings of Kayla Moore or Rekia Boyd.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the opposite {{seems to be}} the case. A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S. Paul found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with social ills like crime. The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E

5000|$|Languages of the {{northwest}} coast of North America, including Salishan, Wakashan and Chinookan languages, allow stop consonants and voiceless fricatives as syllables at the phonemic level, {{in even the most}} careful enunciation. An example is Chinook [...] those two women are coming this way out of the water. Linguists have analyzed this situation in various ways, <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> such syllables have no nucleus at all and <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the concept of [...] "syllable" [...] cannot clearly be applied at all to these languages.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{currents}} {{in the mainstream}} and branches of heterodox economics <b>argue</b> differently, with <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> budget deficits are always harmful, and others <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> budget deficits are not only beneficial, but also necessary.|$|R

50|$|Another {{debate was}} over Zhang Xun's refusal to surrender. <b>Some</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that,</b> when the Tang army {{ran out of}} food {{supplies}} around July 757 AD, the army should have surrendered, which would have prevented the cannibalism that happened later on. On the other hand, <b>some</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Zhang Xun made the correct choice in delaying the Yan army {{for as long as}} he could. They believed that his only mistake was wrongly believing that the other Tang governors, or even the imperial guards, would give him support much earlier than October.|$|R
5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that,</b> in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E
5|$|From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria {{fought for}} control of the {{southern}} Levant. Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East. Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years). <b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> disease was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city; however, Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.|$|E
50|$|Many Modern Orthodox {{authorities}} {{are inclined to}} permit contraception for {{a broad array of}} reasons, with <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> a couple may decide to delay procreation even without specific rabbinic permission.|$|R

30|$|Most {{scholars}} and United Nations’ official reports believe China’s total fertility rate is about 1.4 – 1.5, while <b>some</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> it {{has fallen to}} 1.18, based on census in 2010 (Mu 2012).|$|R
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the device user {{should be involved}} in the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> nature {{represents}} a chaotic, lawless order {{which is in}} direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur’s peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance. Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak’s wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the sin-stained girdle, nature is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense). In this view, Gawain {{is part of a}} wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> domain-general perspectives do not fully {{address the question of}} how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>some</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{easier access}} to {{abortion}} would cause abortion rates to increase, {{the number of abortions}} has remained stable since the early 1970s, especially when adjusted for demographic changes related to fertility.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Coleman's DNA was tested. He {{was found}} to be within the 2% of the {{population}} who could have committed the crime. <b>Some</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> DNA and blood tests combined reduced this figure to 0.2%.|$|R
5000|$|Historians {{have also}} been divided over {{the reasons for the}} British invasion, with <b>some</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> it was to protect the Suez Canal and prevent [...] "anarchy", while others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it was to protect the {{interests}} of British investors with assets in Egypt (see Anglo-Egyptian War).|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
