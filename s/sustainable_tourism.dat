5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of <b>sustainable</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island Board is a NSW Statutory Authority {{established}} {{under the}} Lord Howe Island Act 1953, {{to administer the}} island {{as part of the}} state of New South Wales. It reports directly to the state's Minister for Environment and Heritage, and is responsible for the care, control and management of the island. Its duties include: the protection of World Heritage values; the control of development; the administration of Crown Land, including the island's protected area; provision of community services and infrastructure; and regulating <b>sustainable</b> <b>tourism.</b> In 1981 the Lord Howe Island Amendment Act gave islanders the administrative power of three members on a five-member Board. The Board also manages the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery which, together with tourism, provides the island's only sources of external income. Under an amendment bill in 2004 the Board now comprises seven members, four of whom are elected from the islander community, thus giving about 350 permanent residents a high level of autonomy. The remaining three members are appointed by the Minister to represent the interests of business, tourism and conservation. The full Board meets on the island every three months while the day-to-day affairs of the island are managed by the Board's administration, with a permanent staff that had increased to 22 people by 1988.|$|E

40|$|Small, remote island {{communities}} often share {{problems of}} isolation and limited natural resources to sustain a viable economy, consequently many have sought to diversify into the tourism industry. The Aboriginal community of Cape Barren Island, Tasmania, has very limited economic activities and is considering <b>tourism</b> ventures. <b>Sustainable</b> island <b>tourism</b> may provide important economic, social and cultural opportunities to stimulate selfsufficiency, community cohesion, cultural preservation, as well as self-determination and empowerment for the Aboriginal community. The {{aim of the research}} was to analyse how the Cape Barren Island community could develop <b>sustainable</b> island <b>tourism.</b> The research pathway was directed by ascertaining the natural and cultural values on the island and identifying and assessing the opportunities, benefits, issues and constraints for the community to develop <b>sustainable</b> island <b>tourism.</b> A qualitative research approach was employed which incorporated the concept of triangulation. Semi-structured interviews, a focus group and field observations were conducted on Cape Barren Island. Key informant interviews representing the Tasmanian Aboriginal community and the tourism industry provided an overview of the issues and constraints surrounding indigenous tourism development in a Tasmanian context. From the research a number of themes developed: 1) accessibility, 2) infrastructure and natural resources, 3) land ownership and control, 4) community cohesion, 5) human resources, 6) skills, training and capacity building, 7) traditional skills and knowledge, 8) funding and costs, 9) cultural awareness and product, 10) authenticity and interpretation, and 11) seasonality and exogenously driven forces. There is the potential for the community to develop <b>sustainable</b> island <b>tourism</b> which could provide significant economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits and opportunities, however, a number of issues and constraints would have to be overcome.

500|$|A {{series of}} levees on the park's eastern border marks {{the line between}} urban and {{protected}} areas, but development into these areas threatens the park system. Florida still attracts nearly a thousand new residents every day, and building residential, commercial and industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses the water balance and ecosystems within the park. On the park's western border, Fort Myers, Naples and Cape Coral are expanding, but no system of levees exists to mark that border. National Geographic rated both Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve the lowest-scoring parks in North America, at 32 out of 100. Their scoring system rated 55parks in terms of <b>sustainable</b> <b>tourism,</b> destination quality, and park management. The experts who compiled the results justified the score by stating: [...] "Encroachment by housing and retail development has thrown the precious ecosystem into a tailspin, and if humankind doesn't back off, there will be nothing left of one of this country's most amazing treasures".|$|E

With this situation, the ideal of <b>sustainable</b> coastal <b>tourism</b> has found much support by brokers who control tourism, locals who witness tourism, and varieties of (eco) tourists. Mechanisms that have shown potential for shaping coastal tourism systems in positive ways include tourism management, tourism planning, and tourism education. However, the attainment of <b>sustainable</b> coastal <b>tourism</b> goals will also depend on multidisciplinary tourism research, enhanced broker-broker communication and cooperation, and the commitment of tourists to be alert to ecological and cultural consequences of their travel...|$|R
