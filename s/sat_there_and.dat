500|$|William H. Schlesinger, {{dean of the}} Nicholas School of Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University said [...] " [...] got all the {{important}} material and got it right." [...] Robert Corell, chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment was also impressed. [...] "I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> I'm amazed at how thorough and accurate. After the presentation I said, 'Al, I'm absolutely blown away. There's a lot of details you could get wrong.'...I could find no error." [...] Michael Shermer, scientific author and founder of The Skeptics Society, wrote in Scientific American that Gore's slide show [...] "shocked {{me out of my}} doubting stance." [...] Eric Steig, a climate scientist writing on RealClimate, lauded the film's science as [...] "remarkably up to date, with reference to some of the very latest research." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{books in the}} Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15million copies {{worldwide}} together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I found that I can't really allow myself to think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> I started obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother.|$|E
500|$|Film score {{composer}} James Newton Howard {{was approached}} by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. [...] "He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director do that for me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, {{and it would have}} been great, but there is something about the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked. [...] "It's definitely more misterioso." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} told him, whilst he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> hunched <b>and</b> shuddering.|$|R
60|$|Our {{glasses were}} filled, <b>and</b> we still <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> dazed <b>and</b> dumb. Then Basil spoke.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> dipping <b>and</b> {{painting}} and dipping again, with never {{a word for}} me--standing patiently and humbly behind her.|$|R
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E
500|$|Rossen filmed The Hustler {{over six}} weeks, entirely in New York City. Much {{of the action}} was filmed at two now-defunct pool halls, McGirr's and Ames Billiard Academy. Other {{shooting}} locations included a townhouse on East 82nd Street, which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton's character Findley, and the Manhattan Greyhound bus terminal. The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> waited to place their orders. Willie Mosconi served as technical advisor on the film and shot {{a number of the}} trick shots in place of the actors. All of Gleason's shots were his own; they were filmed in wide-angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames. Rossen, in pursuit of the style he termed [...] "neo-neo-realistic", hired actual street thugs, enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras. Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie {{is on his way to}} town (originally slated to be the first scene of the film) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny's Bar which establishes Preacher is a junkie.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Canning of IGN said the episode was great {{and gave it}} an 8.8 out 10 rating, {{saying that he was}} [...] "impressed" [...] with how the ending handled Jack and Nancy's [...] "not-quite romance." [...] Canning enjoyed the [...] "platonic romance" [...] between them saying, [...] "A lesser series could have simply had the pair hook up, break up and move on, but 30 Rock has drawn out the relationship with flirtation, what-ifs and possible future ex-husbands." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, found the episode [...] "perfectly" [...] and [...] "well-timed". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club said that the episode started [...] "out wicked strong, with everyone in the cast getting great lines". In regards to the two plots, Pierce said that the Liz, TGS, and Dale Snitterman story was [...] "stuffed with great comedic moments", while the Jack and Nancy angle just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> flopped [...] "around like a dying fish." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the Boston theme in [...] "Winter Madness"; his only complaint was that the episode {{had nothing to do with}} TGS, the fictional show on 30 Rock. [...] "I'm getting a little tired of that. I want more sketches and NBC network shenanigans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> smoking, <b>and</b> I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> thinking. Twice 'e {{spoke to}} me, and I held my 'and {{up and said}} 'H'sh.' Then I turned to 'im {{all of a sudden}} and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped 'is beer.|$|R
60|$|Joe Blunt {{likewise}} sat by {{the fire}} along with him, ruminating too, and smoking besides. Henri also <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> smoking, <b>and</b> looking a little the worse of his late supper.|$|R

500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they chose}} good seats near the {{companion}} way, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> their husbands brought them carpet bags {{to put their}} feet upon.|$|R
60|$|They {{accordingly}} <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> <b>and</b> then. By {{three o'clock}} an imposing array of sheets of foolscap covered with badly-written Greek {{lay on the}} study table.|$|R
60|$|So, torn by {{conflicting}} emotions, he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> still, stiff <b>and</b> {{motionless in}} his seat as an Egyptian statue.|$|R
2500|$|A {{supervisor}} in another building 300 yards away heard the fire alarm and walked outside. He {{had served in}} Vietnam, but said the explosion was worse than anything encountered in his war experience: [...] "I watched B-52s drop 500-pound bombs. This is the biggest explosion I ever saw and I saw some pretty good-sized ones. When it blew, the explosion kept rolling out, rolling out. We <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> watched the ball of fire coming toward us." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{get that}} understanding, Englund had darkened his lower eyelids with {{cigarette}} ash {{on his way}} to the audition and slicked his hair back. [...] "I looked strange. I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> listened to Wes talk. He was tall and preppy and erudite. I posed a bit, like Klaus Kinski, and that was the audition," [...] he said later. He took the part because it was the only project that fit his schedule during the hiatus between the V miniseries and series.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} with the Descendents, Navetta {{was known for his}} {{aggressive}} playing and eccentric personality. [...] "I know he had a rough familial thing growing up," [...] recalled Stevenson, [...] "just a lot of familial discord, and I think that can fuel a fire pretty well. I never <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> went ‘wow, what made this guy so weird? [...] "All three of us—Frank, Bill, and I—came from divorced families," [...] said Lombardo, [...] "so that was maybe one of our bonds of commonality." ...|$|E

6000|$|Paul drew {{himself up}} in his saddle, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> glum <b>and</b> unbending. [...] "I am at your service," [...] he answered. [...] "I have had the {{pleasure}} already of a short conversation with your sister this morning." ...|$|R
60|$|Ben was off {{in one of}} his {{laughing}} spells again; <b>and</b> Toby <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> stiff <b>and</b> straight, hardly {{knowing whether}} to join in the mirth or to get angry at the sport which had been made of his name.|$|R
2500|$|... "(Guru Mani Madhava Chakiar) {{began playing}} the dual role of Parvati and Shiva... {{he sat on}} a wooden chair...I have never ever seen a Parvati so exquisitely beautiful. I have never seen a Shiva so {{handsome}} and so cunning. I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> wept as if I were alone in the presence of God. I then realised what theatre was all about – the falsehood of that old man made me arrive at a state where inhibitions and convictions, all became so fluid and beautiful. And this vision has remained with me always" ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{hand was}} writing out the words, 'There's a lady is sure , all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a {{stairway}} to heaven'. I just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at them}} and almost leapt out of my seat." [...] Plant's own explanation of the lyrics was that it [...] "was some cynical aside about a woman getting everything she wanted all the time without giving back any thought or consideration. The first line begins with that cynical sweep of the hand ... and it softened up after that.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News Nicki commented on her collaboration with the producer will.i.am stating; [...] "I worked with tons of producers on my album, shout out to all of them. Will’s the only producer that produced me. He really <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> got this weird sound, and I was like, ‘What?’ It was so simple. He was sitting there and he made the beat on the spot." [...] She continued on saying that [...] "I was sitting there, {{and it was like}} five minutes later, he finished the beat!" [...] The Buggles, the British band behind the original, performed the updated record [...] "Check It Out" [...] at shows at London’s Supperclub and The British Music Experience at the O2.|$|E
60|$|Pierson {{took the}} glass, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{nibbling}} <b>and</b> sipping. It was nice, very! He had not quite realised {{how much he}} needed food and drink. Noel returned from the cupboard a second time; she too had a glass and a biscuit.|$|R
60|$|The fumes of the {{buttermilk}} {{had died}} {{out of his}} brain. He was thinking, as he <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> of midnight <b>and</b> what it would bring.|$|R
60|$|Beppo {{looked at}} the princess, {{and he thought he}} had never seen any one so {{beautiful}} in all his life. It was all like a dream, and he hoped he might never waken. But the princess <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> weeping <b>and</b> weeping, and said nothing.|$|R
2500|$|Guy Spier, {{who shared}} {{tutorials}} with him, remembers {{him as an}} outstanding student: [...] "We were doing our best to grasp basic economic concepts. David—there was nobody else who came even close. He would be integrating them {{with the way the}} British political system is put together. He could have lectured me on it, and I would have <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> taken notes." [...] When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil's ideas about a [...] "Bill of Rights" [...] to replace the Human Rights Act, however, Professor Bogdanor, himself a Liberal Democrat, said, [...] "I think he is very confused. I've read his speech and it's filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding".|$|E
2500|$|The American {{reaction}} {{was that they}} would not apply any undue pressure on Israel to quit Lebanon as the Israeli presence in Lebanon may prove to be a catalyst for the disparate groups of Lebanon to make common cause against both Syrian and Israeli forces. Haig's analysis, which Ronald Reagan agreed with, was that this uniting of Lebanese groups would allow President Elias Sarkis to reform the Lebanese central Government and give the Palestinian refugees Lebanese citizenship. Additional evidence that the United States approved the Israeli invasion comes from longtime CIA analyst Charles Cogan, who says {{that he was in the}} room during a May 1982 meeting in The Pentagon during which Sharon explained to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger [...] "in great detail how the Israelis were going to invade Lebanon... Weinberger just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> said nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Mr. Lincoln continued, [...] "that {{was on a}} Monday, I reckon, and {{the boys}} a-shouting to have their horses shod. Maybe you think they didn't have some fun with Sam'l. But Sam'l <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> {{after a while the}} old man pulled out his dinner-pail. Sam'l never opened his mouth. First thing you know, snip went the tongs." [...] Mr. Lincoln turned gravely around. [...] "What do you reckon Sam'l said, Judge?" ...|$|E

60|$|I suppose I {{must have}} <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> {{shivering}} <b>and</b> yawning, {{for about an}} hour, when, tired of inactivity, I {{got up and went}} and leaned {{over the side of the}} vessel. The sound of the water gurgling and lapping by was so soothing that I began to doze.|$|R
60|$|Rachel obeyed, and Noie sat by her, {{holding her}} hand, till {{presently}} {{her eyes shut}} and she slept. But Noie did not sleep. All that night she <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> watching <b>and</b> listening, till at length the dawn came and she lay down also by the door and rested.|$|R
