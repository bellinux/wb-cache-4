40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to study the}} special rights <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares</b> in Spanish Law {{and the protection of}} their holders in cross-border mergers of limited liability companies within the European Union frame. Special rights <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares</b> are recognised as an independent legal category within legal systems of some EU Member States, such as Germany or Spain, through the implementation of the Third Directive 78 / 855 /CEE concerning mergers of public limited liability companies. The above-cited Directive contains a special regime of protection for the holders of securities, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares,</b> to which special rights are attached, consisting of being given rights in the acquiring company, at least equivalent to those they possessed in the company being acquired. This safeguard is to highlight the intimate connection between this type of rights and the company whose extinction determines the existence of those. Pursuant to the Directive 2005 / 56 /CE on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, each company taking part in these operations shall comply with the safeguards of members and third parties provided in their respective national law to which is subject. In this regard, the protection for holders of special rights <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares</b> shall be ruled by the domestic M&A regime. As far as Spanish Law are concerned, holders of these special rights are recognized a right of merger information, in the same terms as shareholders, as well as equal rights in the company resulting from the cross-border merger. However, these measures are not enough guarantee for a suitable protection, thus considering those holders of special rights as special creditors, sometimes {{it will be necessary to}} go to the general protection regime for creditors. In Spanish Law, it would involve the recognition of right to the merger opposition, whose exercise would prevent the operation was completed until ensuring equal rights. ...|$|R

The goal {{of this paper is}} to study financial systems convergence through the lens of household asset allocation. We analyze s and ß convergence of total household financial assets and their main components: deposits, securities <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares,</b> <b>shares</b> and <b>other</b> equity, insurance technical reserves. The novelty of the paper is to exploit a database containing time series since 1980 for nine OECD countries.

Weaker results are obtained for convergence of household securities <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares,</b> and currency and deposits. In a nutshell, financial systems show signals of convergence in asset allocation, but national characteristics persist when households invest in securities and deposits. financial systems, alpha and beta convergence...|$|R

50|$|The design {{objective}} for MacWorks Plus was 100% compatibility with software that {{ran on the}} Macintosh Plus, {{which at the time}} was Apple's flagship product. This was a technically challenging goal because <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>sharing</b> the same Motorola 68000 processor, the underlying hardware architectures of the two systems were radically different. In order to understand how MacWorks Plus worked, it is easiest to divide the discussion into three areas: hardware interface, memory model and bootstrap protocol. These were the hardware-dependent aspects of the classic Mac OS at the time. The simplest method of transporting the Mac OS to another machine was to emulate them completely. Once achieved, the much larger hardware-independent code in the 128K ROM could execute with no modification. This is what was done with MacWorks Plus.|$|R

When beggars harass, owners may benefit from sharing part of the food if their consumption rate is low relative to the rate of cost accrual. Our model predicts that harassment can be a profitable strategy for beggars if they reap some direct benefits from harassing <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shared</b> food (such as picking up scraps). Therefore, beggars may manipulate the owner’s fitness payoffs {{in such a way as}} to make sharing mutualistic...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} use of a {{software}} distributed shared memory system, Treadmarks, as a platform for supporting an I/O-intensive application, specifically the database Postgres. Software distributed shared memory (DSM) systems allow applications to run on cheap and powerful networks of workstations without the complexity of explicit message-passing. Such systems are usually used for computationally-intensive scientific applications. I/O-intensive applications have significantly different characteristics. Despite this, Postgres needed only minimal changes to run on Treadmarks. This is partially because we wrote emulation layers for many APIs Postgres already used. We created additional support pieces for Treadmarks to handle the problems that arose because of the different application characteristics. These were divided into three areas. Some issues were related to usage of forms of communication <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shared</b> memory, some to Treadmarks, and some to the UNIX API.
