5|$|A 2010 report {{correlates}} low sunspot {{activity with}} high hurricane activity. Analyzing historical data, {{there was a}} 25% chance {{of at least one}} hurricane <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> continental United States during a peak sunspot year; a 64% chance during a low sunspot year. In June 2010, the hurricanes predictors in the US were not using this information.|$|E
5|$|A Slovene {{account of}} the same event asserts that the {{soldiers}} began to fire only when an Austrian citizen discharged a revolver {{in the direction of}} the Slovene soldiers, <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> bayonet of one. The soldiers then returned fire: according to this account 11 were killed, and an unknown number wounded.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds are produced using dampening techniques. The desired effect is produced after <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and dampens its surface using their hands.|$|E
5|$|After <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, {{the storm}} caused {{widespread}} damage while becoming the strongest storm {{to affect the}} archipelago since 1970, which was also ironically also named Irma. The hardest hit was the province of Camarines Norte along the eastern portion of the island of Luzon.|$|E
5|$|As in the 2005 season, {{the team}} {{predicted}} it was highly probable {{that at least}} one major hurricane would directly impact the United States. The forecast suggested an 81%probability {{that at least one}} major hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland, a 64%chance of at least one major hurricane <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> East Coast of the United States (including the Florida peninsula), and a 47%chance of at least one major hurricane <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> Gulf Coast of the United States from the Florida Panhandle westward. The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average. A few months later, on April 4, 2006, CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions.|$|E
50|$|The third common {{method of}} sound {{production}} in stringed instruments is to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> string. The piano and hammered dulcimer use {{this method of}} sound production. Even though <b>the</b> piano <b>strikes</b> <b>the</b> strings, the use of felt hammers means that the sound that is produced can nevertheless be mellow and rounded, {{in contrast to the}} sharp attack produced when a very hard hammer <b>strikes</b> <b>the</b> strings.|$|R

5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> coin in silver to base metal in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created it. Without rare dates or silver content, the dime is less widely sought by coin collectors than other modern U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels {{supplied}} the bullion for the coins, {{at a cost}} of about $850,000. He paid $17,500 as the Mint's fee for <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> coins, $2,500 for designs, and $250 for dies. A final change reduced the total value in dimes to $25,000 (250,000 coins) while increasing the value in half dollars to $350,000 (700,000 coins).|$|E
5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E
50|$|During the Conservative {{government}} of Edward Heath {{there were five}} declarations of emergency under this Act, {{by far the most}} any government.

5|$|Alternatively, Pachycephalosaurus {{and other}} pachycephalosaurid genera may {{have engaged in}} flank-butting during {{intraspecific}} combat. In this scenario, an individual may have stood roughly parallel or faced a rival directly, using intimidation displays to cow its rival. If intimidation failed, the Pachycephalosaurus would bend its head downward and to the side, <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> rival pachycephalosaur on its flank. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} relatively broad torso of most pachycephalosaurs, which would have protected vital organs from trauma. The flank-butting theory was first proposed by Sues in 1978, and expanded upon by Ken Carpenter in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Despite this surrender, leaving Dawes {{standing}} awkwardly holding seven swords, {{the fighting}} continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates {{were able to}} escape back to Herr Ridge. The three Union regiments lost 390440 of 1,184 engaged, but they had blunted Davis's attack, prevented them from <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> rear of the Iron Brigade, and so overwhelmed the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat {{for the rest of}} the day. The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1,707 engaged.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
50|$|From 22 October 1970 to 3 June 1971, VF-211 was {{deployed}} on USS Hancock. On 28 October F-8J #149202 {{was lost}} in a ramp <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> pilot LT G Carloni was killed.

5|$|The {{earliest}} time in {{the year}} for a hurricane to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> nation was June 9, which was set by Hurricane Alma in 1966. The earliest major hurricane to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> nation occurred in 1934, when an unnamed tropical cyclone made landfall on June 16. The latest in the year for a hurricane to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> nation was on November 24 with Hurricane Iwa in Hawaii; for the Atlantic basin the latest was on November 22, which was set by Hurricane Kate in 1985. The latest in the year for a major hurricane to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> nation was from the 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane, which moved ashore on October 25.|$|R
25|$|The PATH ran {{extra service}} between 33rd Street and the World Trade Center from 6 AM to 8 PM {{during the days}} of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> PATH {{recorded}} a 50% increase in daily ridership compared to before <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the act, a series of test strikes {{depicting}} Martha Washington were carried out to test a variety of gold-colored metallic compositions. Although the act provided for creation of the new coin, it also allowed for resumption of <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> Anthony design until production began on the gold-colored dollar. Nearing depletion of Treasury stores, on May 20, 1999, the U.S. Mint announced that production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar would resume. In total, 41,368,000 Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck for circulation dated 1999. The design was officially retired in 2000, when the Sacagawea dollar entered production.|$|E
5|$|Following the Wehrmacht's {{victory at}} Operation Market Garden, Hitler decided {{to launch a}} last-ditch {{offensive}} in the West aiming to catch the Anglosphere forces by surprise, {{with the objective of}} retaking Antwerp, <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> seam between the British and Americans that leads to political as well as military disharmony between the Allies, isolate the 21st Army Group, thereby allowing their encirclement and destruction before the American leadership (particularly the political leadership) could react and erasing the enemy ground threat to the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hazel was {{the deadliest}} and costliest {{hurricane}} of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm {{killed at least}} 400people in Haiti before <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> United States near the border between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81people, mostly in Toronto. As {{a result of the}} high death toll and the damage caused by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|The 1960 Writers Guild of America <b>strike</b> was <b>the</b> second longest writers <b>strike</b> in <b>the</b> {{history of}} the Writers Guild.

Negotiations were between the Writers Guild of America, west, the Writers Guild of America, East, and the Association of Motion Picture Producers.|$|R
25|$|There are two types. The {{first is}} for {{moving to the}} next waza after a failed first <b>strike,</b> and <b>the</b> second holds your opponent's {{attention}} and posture to create the suki for a second <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> former requires a continuous rhythm of correct <b>strikes.</b> <b>The</b> latter requires continuous execution of waza, {{to take advantage of}} your opponent's suki.|$|R

5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design {{it had in}} the late Victorian Era, and kept that motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> ten pence piece. The old two shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{the season}} {{resulted}} in about 63 fatalities and over $10 million in damages. The {{first and last}} storms of the season were largely insignificant, although the second, fourth, and fifth storms had considerable effects. Two hurricanes struck the United States: a major hurricane that struck Texas and Louisiana in late September, disrupting the Louisiana Maneuvers, and Hurricane Five, which made two landfalls in Florida, {{the first of which}} was near Miami at Category 2 intensity, inflicting widespread damage. Another major storm—Hurricane Four—traversed the Caribbean before <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> Nicaragua–Honduras border at Category 4 intensity, leaving 47 men dead at sea.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's five {{tropical}} cyclones, three reached hurricane status. Furthermore, one {{of those}} strengthened into a major hurricane, which is Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category3 strength with 125mph (205km/h) winds. After making landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina border, the storm caused 26fatalities and extensive damage in the area. Hurricane Four caused four deaths and approximately $20,000 (1854USD) in damage after <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> coast of Texas. Hurricane One also caused moderate damage in Texas.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound is}} {{produced}} by hitting the membrane with either hand - the left hand, which also holds <b>the</b> dayereh, <b>strikes</b> <b>the</b> edges, and <b>the</b> right hand <b>strikes</b> <b>the</b> center. The right-hand fingers are fastened about their neighbours and suddenly released (like the action of finger-snapping) to produce loud, rapid, sharp sounds.|$|R
25|$|Early in 1934, Bridges and the Albion Hall {{group and}} militants in other ports began {{planning}} a coast-wide <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> Roosevelt administration tried {{to head off}} <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> by appointing a mediation board to oversee negotiations, but neither side accepted its proposed compromise. Bridges was elected chairman of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> committee. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> began on May 9. While the elected local officers were the nominal leaders of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> at its outset, Bridges led the planning of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> along with his friend Sam Kagel.
