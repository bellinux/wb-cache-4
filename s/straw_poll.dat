5|$|Paul was {{considered}} a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date {{the start of the}} 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential <b>straw</b> <b>poll.</b> Paul {{went on to win the}} <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.|$|E
5|$|To {{close the}} month, Thompson campaigned in Iowa, {{and made a}} brief stop in New Hampshire on June 25. On June 26, he won the Linn County <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids.|$|E
5|$|According to Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, a {{subgroup}} of the IAU met on August 18, 2006 {{and held a}} <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> on the draft proposal: only 18 were in favour of it, with over 50 against. The 50 in opposition preferred an alternative proposal drawn up by Uruguayan astronomer Julio Ángel Fernández.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Straw</b> <b>polls</b> provide {{dialogue}} among movements within large groups. Impromptu <b>straw</b> <b>polls</b> {{often are}} taken {{to see if there}} is enough support for an idea to devote more meeting time to it, and (when not a secret ballot) for the attendees to see who is on which side of a question. However, in meetings subject to Robert's Rules of Order, <b>straw</b> <b>polls</b> are not allowed.|$|R
50|$|The Washington Post {{questioned}} {{the reliability of}} <b>straw</b> <b>polls</b> to predict the winner of mayoral elections. Prior to the 2006 mayoral election, candidates Linda W. Cropp and Michael A. Brown won <b>straw</b> <b>polls,</b> but Fenty won every precinct in the actual Democratic primary election.|$|R

5|$|In the campaign, Hunter {{emphasized}} {{his conservative}} credentials, {{focusing on the}} issues of border security, the War on Terrorism, and trade. Throughout 2007, he was in the second tier of Republican candidates, consistently receiving three percent or less support among Republicans in national polls. However, the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the announcement, Hunter {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} retired Air Force Brigadier General Chuck Yeager. He won the January 13, 2007 Maricopa County, Arizona <b>straw</b> <b>poll,</b> edging all three projected top tier candidates including Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Ten days later, Hunter filed papers with the Federal Elections Commission to officially begin his presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|In polling, Dodd {{has seemed}} unable {{to break through}} to the top tier. In Nationwide polls he usually only polls at or around 1%. A November 7, 2007 Gallup poll placed him in last place, behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich at 1%. At the state level, Dodd has also not done so well. In a November 18, 2007 Iowa poll {{conducted}} by ABC news, he registered with 1% the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31, 2007. In New Hampshire, a poll conducted by CNN placed Dodd at 1% constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July. However, on the <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> level, Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5, 2007. He won the York County <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> by receiving 28% of the 100 votes cast. Barack Obama came in second with 24%. Hillary Clinton got 18% and John Edwards received 11%. The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win.|$|E

5|$|Paul won several early straw {{polls for}} the 2012 Republican presidential {{nomination}} and in late April 2011, he formed an official exploratory committee. He {{participated in the}} first Republican presidential debate on May 5, 2011 and on May 13, 2011, Paul formally announced his candidacy {{in an interview on}} ABC's Good Morning America. He placed second in the 2011 Ames <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll,</b> missing first by 0.9%.|$|E
5|$|About {{one year}} before {{entering}} the race, Tancredo won the Macomb County <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll</b> in Michigan on July 5, 2006. He received 60 of the 327 votes cast or 18% of the vote. Tancredo beat out the second-place finisher Rudy Giuliani by 15 votes. On February 13, 2007, the American Conservative Union issued ratings for potential presidential candidates for the 2008 election. Tancredo took first with a lifetime ranking of 99 out of 100. The website ConservativesBetrayed.com polled 525 people who attended CPAC 2007, and 88.1% believed that Tancredo would govern as a conservative. Newt Gingrich polled next at 87.9%.|$|E
5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll</b> and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E
50|$|The Republican caucuses {{were held}} between Sunday, January 29, and Saturday, March 3, at various {{locations}} {{throughout the state}} of Maine. Presidential preference <b>polls</b> (<b>straw</b> <b>polls)</b> were held at the caucuses, but those polls were not binding on the choices of delegates to the Maine Republican Party convention. The caucuses chose delegates in processes separate from the <b>straw</b> <b>polling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Security Council held {{a series}} of six <b>straw</b> <b>polls</b> in the {{consultation}} room.

5|$|In early September, Huntsman began {{shifting}} campaign {{resources from}} Florida to New Hampshire; by moving staffers, Huntsman {{had the largest}} operational staff there at the time. The development came as the campaign reorganized New Hampshire operations, firing its campaign manager {{in charge of the}} state, Ethan Elion. Elion was replaced by Sarah Crawford Stewart, who had served as state-director of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's New Hampshire campaign before he suspended his bid after the Ames <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Tommy Thompson, 42nd Governor of Wisconsin and Secretary of Health and Human Services {{began when he}} announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination {{for president of the}} United States on April 1, 2007. Thompson centered his campaign in Iowa, focusing primarily on the issues of health care reform and the War in Iraq. He dropped out of the race on August 12, 2007 following a sixth-place finish in the Ames <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> and went on to endorse Rudy Giuliani for president and then John McCain following Giuliani's withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> and scientific public opinion polls by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine {{the best time to}} act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E

50|$|Initially, the Security Council voted publicly, {{leading to}} many public {{confrontations}} between the superpowers. After the consultation room {{was built in}} 1978, the voting took place in secret, and the public vote became a ratification of a decision {{that had already been}} reached. To break the deadlocked selection of 1981, the Security Council began to take <b>straw</b> <b>polls</b> by secret ballot. The system of <b>straw</b> <b>polls</b> was set down on paper in 1996 as the Wisnumurti Guidelines.|$|R
25|$|Since 1979, the RPI {{has held}} a <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> in Iowa in each year {{preceding}} a presidential election, except {{when there is}} a Republican incumbent. This <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> is separate from the Republican caucuses. The <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> includes a dinner, multiple speeches by candidates, and a variety of booths set up by various candidates and causes, in addition to an actual <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> of participants' presidential preferences.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, August 13, 2011, the <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> was {{conducted}} on the campus of Iowa State University at the Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa, with Bachmann narrowly defeating Paul, and former Governor Tim Pawlenty in third place. The 2011 <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> had the second highest turnout in history, second only to 1999 <b>straw</b> <b>poll,</b> when then-Governor George W. Bush won in a landslide. Governor Rick Perry, who announced the day of the <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> in South Carolina, but whose name did not appear on the ballot, received a significant amount of write-in votes, placing in sixth. Other non-participating candidates, such as Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and former Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman, performed poorly in the <b>straw</b> <b>poll,</b> placing a distant seventh, eighth, and ninth respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{event of the}} {{campaign}} was the Ames <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll,</b> {{which took place in}} Iowa on August 13, 2011. Michele Bachmann won the <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> (this ultimately proved to be the acme of her campaign). Pawlenty withdrew from the race after a poor showing in the <b>straw</b> <b>poll,</b> as did Thaddeus McCotter, the only candidate among those who qualified for the ballot who was refused entrance into the debate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next round}} of <b>straw</b> <b>polling</b> reveals the {{existence}} of any vetoes. The permanent members vote on red paper, and the rotating members vote on white paper. If any permanent members vote [...] "discourage," [...] this is treated as a likely veto. <b>Straw</b> <b>polling</b> continues until a candidate has no vetoes and more [...] "encourage" [...] votes than the other candidates. The Security Council then votes to recommend the candidate to the General Assembly. Since 1996, the vote has been taken by acclamation so that the Secretary-General is recommended unanimously.|$|R
25|$|In the August 13 Ames <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll,</b> a {{traditional}} <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> held in Iowa Republican caucuses, Bachmann narrowly defeated Paul, with Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty trailing in third. Following his disappointing showing, Pawlenty {{dropped out of}} the race.|$|E
25|$|As the Ames <b>Straw</b> <b>Poll</b> {{approached}} in August 2011, visits and spending by the campaigns dramatically increased. Several candidates, including Bachmann, Congressman Ron Paul, former Senator Rick Santorum, Congressman Thaddeus McCotter, former Governor Tim Pawlenty, and businessman Herman Cain made bids for spots {{to compete at}} the <b>straw</b> <b>poll.</b> Congressman Paul bid the most, and was awarded the prime spot at the <b>straw</b> <b>poll,</b> which Mitt Romney occupied in 2007, and eventually led to his victory.|$|E
25|$|Guam's 173,000 {{residents}} are U.S. citizens, and must obey U.S. laws passed in Washington, {{yet they have}} neither a voting member of Congress, nor votes in the Electoral College. Since 1980, they have held a <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> for president {{at the same time}} as the U.S. national elections. In 2007, Guam's legislature voted to move the <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> up to September to draw attention to the choices of Guam's population and their continued disfranchisement, but the governor vetoed the bill. Obama won the 2008 Guam <b>straw</b> <b>poll</b> with 20,120 votes to McCain's 11,940.|$|E
