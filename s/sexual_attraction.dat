5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to others, or low or absent {{interest}} in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.|$|E

5|$|A lesbian is {{a female}} homosexual: a female who {{experiences}} romantic love or <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to other females.

5000|$|The American Psychological Association defines sexual {{orientation}} as [...] "an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or <b>sexual</b> <b>attractions</b> to men, women, or both sexes," [...] ranging [...] "along a continuum, from exclusive {{attraction to the}} other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex." [...] Sexual orientation can also be [...] "discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or <b>sexual</b> <b>attractions</b> {{to members of the}} other sex), gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or <b>sexual</b> <b>attractions</b> to members of one's own sex), and bisexual (having emotional, romantic, or <b>sexual</b> <b>attractions</b> to both men and women)." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction.</b> Muslims {{were also more likely to}} report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{family is}} {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} originated in the 1830s: courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, married couples began to emphasize the importance of <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> and compatibility in their relationships. This led to more intimate and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom. The transition of the family was influenced by the Great Depression, which forced many women into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability. In 1932, a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government. This resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working.|$|E

25|$|In the West, a man often cannot {{acknowledge}} or display <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> {{for another}} man without the homosexual or bisexual label being attached to him.

25|$|Sexual {{orientation}} is an enduring pattern of romantic or <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> (or {{a combination of}} these) to persons {{of the opposite sex}} or gender, the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that, {{for most}} women, high sex drive {{is associated with}} increased <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation. Similarly for most bisexual women, high sex drive is associated with increased <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to both women and men; while for bisexual men, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex, and weakened attraction to the other.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>attraction,</b> {{behavior}} and identity {{may also be}} incongruent, as <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> or behavior {{may not necessarily be}} consistent with identity. Some individuals identify themselves as heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Likewise, self-identified gay or lesbian individuals may occasionally sexually interact with members of the opposite sex but do not identify as bisexual. The terms queer, polysexual, heteroflexible, homoflexible, {{men who have sex with}} men and women who have sex with women may also be used to describe sexual identity or identify sexual behavior.|$|E
25|$|Innate {{bisexuality}} {{is an idea}} {{introduced by}} Sigmund Freud. According to this theory, all humans are born bisexual in a very broad sense of the term, that of incorporating general aspects of both sexes. In Freud's view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexuality. Freud believed that {{in the course of}} sexual development the masculine side would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women, but that as adults everyone still has desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures. Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to both genders.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatrist Anil Aggrawal {{explains}} why the terms are useful in a glossary: Androphilia – The romantic and/or <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction</b> to adult males. The term, along with gynephilia, is needed to overcome immense difficulties in characterizing the sexual orientation of transmen and transwomen. For instance, {{it is difficult to}} decide whether a transman erotically attracted to males is a heterosexual female or a homosexual male; or a transwoman erotically attracted to females is a heterosexual male or a lesbian female. Any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but arouse offense among the affected subjects. In such cases, while defining <b>sexual</b> <b>attraction,</b> it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather than on the sex or gender of the subject.|$|E

40|$|Abundant {{research}} has shown that men’s <b>sexual</b> <b>attractions</b> are more category-specific in relation to gender than women’s are. We tested whether the early automatic allocation of spatial attention reflects these <b>sexual</b> <b>attractions.</b> The dot-probe task was used to assess whether spatial attention was attracted to images of either male or female models that were naked or partially clothed. In Experiment 1, men were faster if the target appeared after the female stimulus, whereas women were equally quick to respond to targets after male or female stimuli. In Experiment 2, neutral cues were introduced. Men were again faster to female images in comparison to male or neutral images, but showed no bias on the male versus neutral test. Women were faster to both male and female pictures in comparison to neutral pictures. However, in this experiment they were also faster to female pictures than to male pictures. The results suggest that early attentional processes reveal category-specific interest to the preferred sexual category for heterosexual men, and suggest that heterosexual women do not have category-specific guidance of attentional mechanisms. The technique may have promise in measuring sexual interest in other situations where participants may not be able, or may not be willing, to report upon their sexual interests (e. g., assessment of paedophilic interest...|$|R
