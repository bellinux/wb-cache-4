50|$|TCF21 is {{essential}} for cardiac fibroblast cell fate, {{as demonstrated by the}} failed development of cardiac fibroblasts in mice lacking TCF21. In the absence of TCF21, these fibroblast progenitor cells do not undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While TCF21-expressing epicardial cells are initially multipotent, they become committed to the fibroblast lineage over time. Those TCF21-expressing cells that do not commit to the fibroblast lineage lose this expression and remain undifferentiated epicardial cells or coronary vascular smooth muscle cells. TCF21 is expressed in mesodermal cells in the proepicardial organ that give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) and loss of TCF21 results in increased expression of smooth muscle markers by cells on the heart <b>surface</b> <b>consistent</b> with premature SMC differentiation. This suggests that early expression of TCF21 is important for expansion of the SMC compartment of the coronary circulation, with persistent TCF21 expression being required for cardiac fibroblast development.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe epitaxy of GaAs monolayers on SrTiO(3) {{substrates}} is {{studied by}} extensive first-principles simulations, considering both cleavage (100) and polar (110) orientations of SrTiO(3) with distinct terminations, and several adsorption {{sites for the}} overlayer. Large charge transfers take place for the two SrTiO(110) /GaAs and O(2) -(110) /GaAs polar heterojunctions, at variance with other substrate terminations, which are polar compensated by construction.

40|$|The {{prevention}} {{recognition and}} correction of wavelet instability {{is critical to}} exploration success in the present scenario. The proper selection of processing sequence and their quality con-trol can provide improvement for this problem. It has been seen {{that the effect of}} random noise leaking into the deconvolution operator cause most wavelet instability problems. This can be mini-mized by using <b>surface</b> <b>consistent</b> hypothesis. In this hypothesis, a seismic trace is the convolution of source operator, a receiver operator, a reflecdvity operator and offset related operator. Applica-tion of <b>surface</b> <b>consistent</b> deconvolution (SCD) on real data shows tremendous improvement in data quality by reducing random noise, removing the variation of amplitudes due to near surface irregularities and improves the statics estimation. On the other hand, single trace deconvolution fails to do so. In this paper effect of SCD on wavelet stability and seismic attributes have been studied by selecting a portion of seismic line from Vindhyan basin, India. Its robust to any kind of noise and estimation of stable wavelets have also been shown and correlated from the single trace deconvolution. Seismic attributes extracted from <b>surface</b> <b>consistent</b> deconvolved data show major differences as compared to single trace deconvolved data.

40|$|AbstractSignificant {{effort has}} been {{undertaken}} to {{study the effects of}} engineered surfaces, such as those developed through laser texturing, and the potential tribological benefits that can arise. However, the theoretical models can be contradictory, and few good experimental studies of such systems exist. In this work, dimpled surfaces were created using laser surface texturing (LST) which were tested in a reciprocating wear tester. Friction and wear coefficients were measured and compared to surfaces without dimples for both metal-on-metal and metal-on-plastic contacts. The geometry of the dimple to accommodate unidirectional sliding was considered.

Such generalized DFT calculations of potential energy surfaces yield the structure of Xe adlayers in good agreement with experiments and retrieve the dilation of commensurate monolayer phase in which the intralayer Xe-Xe radial force constants are strongly reduced. This provides a first principles interpretation of the observed vibrational properties of adlayers, in general, and the much debated dispersion of in-plane polarized vibrations, in particular...|$|R

More than 300 Sun photometer data points from more than 30 AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) sites globally were used in validating the aerosol optical depths obtained during July - September 2000.

40|$|Lactoferrin is a {{multifunctional}} mammalian immunity {{protein that}} limits microbial growth through sequestration of nutrient iron. Additionally, lactoferrin possesses cationic protein domains that directly bind and inhibit diverse microbes. The implications for these dual functions on lactoferrin evolution and genetic conflicts with microbes remain unclear. Here {{we show that}} lactoferrin has been subject to recurrent episodes of positive selection during primate divergence predominately at antimicrobial peptide <b>surfaces</b> <b>consistent</b> with long-term antagonism by bacteria. An abundant lactoferrin polymorphism in human populations and Neanderthals also exhibits signatures of positive selection across primates, linking ancient host-microbe conflicts to modern human genetic variation. Rapidly evolving sites in lactoferrin further correspond to molecular interfaces with opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis. Because microbes actively target lactoferrin to acquire iron, we propose that the emergence of antimicrobial activity provided a pivotal mechanism of adaptation sparking evolutionary conflicts via acquisition of new protein functions...|$|R

For x = 0, above the structural and magnetic transition temperature (T-s), the spectral weight near the Fermi level is considerably suppressed around the Gamma {{point where the}} Fe 3 d yz/zx orbital degeneracy is expected. This observation suggests that the Jahn-Teller type instability is playing {{an important role in}} the tetragonal phase above T-s.

Given their importance, we examined how the visual system recovers these primitives from sparse disparity fields that do not provide sufficient information for their recovery. We hypothesized that the visual system interpolates sparse disparities with planes, resulting in a patchwork approximation of the implicitly defined shapes. We presented observers with stereo displays simulating planar or smooth curved surfaces having different curvatures. The observers‘ task was to detect whether dots deviated from these surfaces or to discriminate planar from curved or planar from scrambled <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Consistent</b> with our hypothesis, increasing curvature had detrimental effects on observers‘ performance (Experiments 1 - 3).
