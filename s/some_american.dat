5|$|Other legal {{troubles}} {{were left}} over in {{wake of the}} expansion collapse. Louisiana courts eventually ordered the Gliebermans to repay Shreveport US$1 million with interest; the dispute centered over whether the city had agreed to share losses or simply lent money to the ownership group. Art Williams, enraged after discovering <b>some</b> <b>American</b> owners had received discounts and extended payment periods on their franchise fees, threatened litigation and at first refused to honour the balance of Matt Dunigan's sizable contract before the matter was dragged through court.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>American</b> {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid.

The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E

5|$|After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, {{and ground}} crew {{over to the}} Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in {{accordance}} with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and <b>some</b> <b>American</b> guards {{turned a blind eye to}} escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E
5|$|Although Marshall had {{recommended}} that MacArthur appoint as many Australian and Dutch officers to senior positions as possible, {{most of his}} staff {{was made up of}} US Army officers who had served under him in the Philippines. The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, had been on the staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical shortage of staff officers, which he did not wish to exacerbate. Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as <b>some</b> <b>American</b> naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E
5|$|As a {{follow-on}} to the Mach 1 capable North American F-100 Super Sabre, the F-105 {{was also}} armed with missiles and a cannon; however, its design was tailored to high-speed low-altitude penetration carrying a single nuclear weapon internally. First flown in 1955, the Thunderchief entered service in 1958. The single-engine F-105 could deliver a greater bomb load than <b>some</b> <b>American</b> heavy bombers of World War II {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The F-105 {{was one of the}} primary attack aircraft of the Vietnam War; over 20,000 Thunderchief sorties were flown, with 382 aircraft lost including 62 operational (non-combat) losses (out of the 833 produced). Although less agile than smaller MiG fighters, USAF F-105s were credited with 27.5 kills.|$|E

5|$|Bodyguard of Lies is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work. Named for a wartime quote of Winston Churchill, it is a narrative account of Allied military deception operations during the Second World War. The British and American governments resisted Brown's attempts to research the book. Many of the topics were still classified and he was denied access to British war records. The material {{in the book is}} predominantly based on oral testimony as well as <b>some</b> <b>American</b> records, declassified toward the end of Brown's research.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Kong {{was officially}} {{licensed}} from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets.

Nintendo was quick to take legal action against those distributing the game in the US. Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to {{make plans}} for a {{production}} of Pinafore in America.

In November, Carte returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including J. H.

To these, he added <b>some</b> <b>American</b> singers, including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran.

5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Winnipeg {{started in}} 1954. The federal government refused to license any private broadcaster until the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{had created a}} national network.

Additionally, <b>some</b> <b>American</b> network affiliates are available over-the-air. Winnipeg is home to 33 AM and FM radio stations, two of which are French-language stations. CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 broadcast local and national programming in the city. NCI is devoted to Aboriginal programming.|$|E
5|$|That month, Nagato, Yamato, Fusō and {{the escort}} carrier , escorted by two heavy cruisers and five destroyers {{transferred}} to Truk in the Caroline Islands. In {{response to the}} carrier raid on Tarawa on 18 September, Nagato {{and much of the}} fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted <b>some</b> <b>American</b> radio traffic that suggested an attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, Nagato and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok {{to be in a position}} to intercept any such attack. The fleet arrived on 19 October, departed four days later, and arrived back at Truk on 26 October. Hayakawa was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 November and he was relieved on 25 December by Captain Yuji Kobe.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{strongly}} influenced many early civilizations. Greeks {{believed that they}} were battles waged by Zeus, who hurled lightning bolts forged by Hephaestus. <b>Some</b> <b>American</b> Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird, who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit. The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight Jötnar, with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mjölnir. Hinduism recognizes Indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms. Christian doctrine accepted the ideas of Aristotle's original work, called Meteorologica, that winds were caused by exhalations from the Earth and that fierce storms were the work of God. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.|$|E
