40|$|The {{solubility}} of <b>satranidazole</b> {{in several}} water-N,N-dimethylformamide mixtures was analysed {{in terms of}} solute-solvent interactions and data were treated {{on the basis of}} extended Hildebrand solubility approach. The solubility profile of <b>satranidazole</b> in water-N,N-dimethylformamide mixtures shows a curve with a solubility maxima well above the ideal solubility of drug. This is attributed to solvation of the drug with the water-N,N-dimethylformamide mixture, and indicates that the solute-solvent interaction energy (W) is larger than the geometric mean (δ 1 δ 2) of regular solution theory. The new approach provides an accurate prediction of solubility once the interaction energy (W) is obtained. In this case, the energy term is regressed against a polynomial in δ 1 of the binary solvent mixture.

The solubility of <b>satranidazole</b> in various propylene glycol-water mixtures was analyzed in terms of solute-solvent interactions using {{a modified version of}} Hildebrand-Scatchard treatment for regular solutions. The solubility equation employs term interaction energy (W) to replace the geometric mean (δ 1 δ 2), where δ 1 and δ 2 are the cohesive energy densities for the solvent and solute, respectively.

Poorly soluble, high dose drug, <b>Satranidazole</b> was optimally nanoprecipitated (SAT-NP) employing principles of Formulation by Design (FbD). The potential risk factors influencing the critical quality attributes (CQA) of SAT-NP were identified using Ishikawa diagram. Plackett-Burman screening design was adopted to screen the eight critical formulation and process parameters influencing the mean particle size, zeta potential and dissolution efficiency at 30 min in pH 7. 4 dissolution medium. Pareto charts (individual and cumulative) revealed three most critical factors influencing CQA of SAT-NP viz. aqueous stabilizer (Polyvinyl alcohol), release modifier (Eudragit (R) S 100) and volume of aqueous phase. The levels {{of these three}} critical formulation attributes were optimized by FbD within established design space to minimize mean particle size, poly dispersity index, and maximize encapsulation efficiency of SAT-NP. Lenth's and Bayesian analysis along with mathematical modeling of results allowed identification and quantification of critical formulation attributes significantly active on the selected CQAs. The optimized SAT-NP exhibited mean particle size; 216 nm, polydispersity index; 0. 250, zeta potential; - 3. 75 mV and encapsulation efficiency; 78. 3 %. The product was lyophilized using mannitol to form readily redispersible powder. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the conversion of crystalline SAT to amorphous form. In vitro release of SAT-NP in gradually pH changing media showed < 20 % release in pH 1. 2 and pH 6. 8 in 5 h, while, complete release (N 95 %) in pH 7. 4 in next 3 h, indicative of burst release after a lag time.
