5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown <b>spots</b> that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these <b>spots</b> has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal <b>spots,</b> which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side <b>spots</b> may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark <b>spots.</b>|$|E

5|$|Neptune's dark <b>spots</b> {{are thought}} {{to occur in the}} {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they {{are thought to}} be vortex structures. Often associated with dark <b>spots</b> are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark <b>spots</b> may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark <b>spots</b> may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken <b>spots</b> a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black <b>spots</b> occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his ARIA work, Fischbach also researched rapid desensitization of glutamate receptors in chicken spinal cord and rat hippocampal neurons.

Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot <b>spots</b> may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.|$|E

More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
