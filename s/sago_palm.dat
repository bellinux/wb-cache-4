5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the <b>sago</b> <b>palm,</b> one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{form part}} of the human diet in some cultures, and in Thailand, crickets are farmed for this purpose in the north of the country and palm weevil larvae in the south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on {{commercial}} pelleted poultry food, while the palm weevil larvae live on cabbage palm and <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> trees, which limits their production to areas where these trees grow. Another delicacy of this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally several {{ethnic groups}} in Indonesia are known to consume insects—especially grasshopper, cricket, termite, also the larvae of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> weevil and bee. In Java and Kalimantan, {{grasshoppers}} and crickets are usually lightly battered and deep fried in palm oil as crispy kripik or rempeyek snack. In Banyuwangi, East Java, there is a specialty botok called botok tawon (honeybee botok), which is beehives that contains bee larvae, being seasoned in spices and shredded coconut, wrapped inside banana leaf package and steamed. Dayak tribes of Kalimantan, also Moluccans and Papuan tribes in Eastern Indonesia, are known to consumes ulat sagu (lit. sagoo caterpillar) or larvae of <b>sago</b> <b>palm</b> weevil. This protein-rich larvae is considered as a delicacy in Papua, eaten both roasted or raw.|$|E
5|$|The {{houses of}} the Melanau people were built in rows {{on both sides of}} the Kemena River, mostly {{furnished}} by Nipah and <b>Sago</b> <b>palms.</b> Each house had its own shed projection into the entrance of the river, which was used for the processing of <b>Sago</b> <b>palms.</b> On 8 September 1867, the first Sarawak General Council meeting (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly) took place here. It was made up of 21 elected local community members (five British officers and 16 Malay and Melanau local chiefs). The Council was formed by Raja Muda Charles Brooke under orders from Rajah James Brooke. The Council is the oldest state legislative assembly in Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sago</b> <b>palms</b> grow very quickly, in {{clumps of}} {{different}} ages similar to bananas, one sucker matures, then flowers and dies. It is replaced by another sucker, with up to 1.5 m of vertical stem growth per year. The stems are thick and are either self-supporting or have a moderate climbing habit; the leaves are pinnate. Each palm trunk produces a single inflorescence at its tip {{at the end of}} its life. <b>Sago</b> <b>palms</b> are harvested at the age of 7-15 years, just before or shortly after the inflorescence appears and when the stems are full of starch stored for use in reproduction. One palm can yield 150-300 kg of starch.|$|R

The climbing habit in palms is {{not restricted to}} Calamoideae, but has also evolved in three other evolutionary lines—tribes Cocoeae (Desmoncus with c. 7–10 species in the New World tropics) and Areceae (Dypsis scandens in Madagascar) in subfamily Arecoideae, and tribe Hyophorbeae (climbing species of the large genus Chamaedorea in Central America) in subfamily Ceroxyloideae. They do not have spinose stems and climb by means of their reflexed terminal leaflets. Of these only Desmoncus spp. furnish stems of sufficiently good quality {{to be used as}} rattan cane substitutes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sago</b> from Metroxylon <b>palms</b> {{is nearly}} pure {{carbohydrate}} and {{has very little}} protein, vitamins, or minerals. 100 grams of dry sago typically comprises 94 grams of carbohydrate, 0.2 grams of protein, 0.5 grams of dietary fiber, 10 mg of calcium, 1.2 mg of iron and negligible amounts of fat, carotene, thiamine and ascorbic acid and yields approximately 355 calories. <b>Sago</b> <b>palms</b> are typically found in areas unsuited for other forms of agriculture, so sago cultivation is often the most ecologically appropriate form of land-use and the nutritional deficiencies of the food can often be compensated for with other readily available foods.|$|R

60|$|We {{were beyond}} British ground, on the {{opposite}} bank, where any one guiding Europeans is threatened with punishment: we had expected a guide to follow us, but his non-appearance caused us to delay for some hours; four roads, or rather forest paths, meeting here, {{all of which were}} difficult to find. After a while, part of a marriage-procession came up, headed by the bridegroom, a handsome young Lepcha, leading a cow for the marriage feast; and after talking to him a little, he volunteered to show us the path. On the flats by the stream grew the <b>Sago</b> <b>palm</b> (Cycas pectinata), with a stem ten feet high, and a beautiful crown of foliage; the contrast between this and the Scotch-looking pine (both growing with oaks and palms) was curious. Much of the forest had been burnt, and we traversed large blackened patches, where the heat was intense, and increased by the burning trunks of prostrate trees, which smoulder for months, and leave a heap of white ashes. The larger timber being hollow in the centre, a current of air is produced, which causes the interior to burn rapidly, till the sides fall in, and all is consumed. I was often startled, when walking in the forest, by the hot blast proceeding from such, which I had approached without a suspicion of their being other than cold dead trunks.|$|E
50|$|Pengesiseng {{coincides with}} the month of February. Strong winds bring heavy rain, blowing flowers off trees and {{uprooting}} them; floodwaters then {{bring them to the}} sea, where they are pushed ashore by huge waves. The wind blows branches and fronds of the coconut, <b>sago</b> <b>palms</b> and other trees, opening them to resemble the gills of a fish (hence its name). Pengesiseng marks the end of the Melanau year.|$|R
50|$|Many food pastes are an {{intermediary}} {{stage in the}} preparation of food. Perhaps the most notable of such intermediary food pastes is dough. A paste made of fat and flour and often stock or milk is an important intermediary for the basis for a sauce or a binder for stuffing, whether called a beurre manié, a roux or panada.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} vegetation zones, based on altitude. Along the coast {{is either a}} rocky or sandy beach, where pandanus, coconuts, and vines predominate, or a swamp, supporting mangrove and <b>sago</b> <b>palms.</b> Terminalia grows in some drier areas. The lower slopes, up to about , have a hardwood forest of banyans, Canarium, Indo-Malayan hardwoods, and, at higher altitudes, bamboo. In forested groves, there is relatively little undergrowth. In this zone {{is also the most}} intense human cultivation, which, when abandoned, a dense secondary forest grows, which is nearly impassibly thick with shrubs and softwoods.

50|$|For food, the Kombai hunt {{pigs and}} other forest animals, fish, eat the larvae of beetles and plants and eat <b>sago</b> from <b>sago</b> <b>palms.</b> The Kombai often use small dogs to help track down and kill animals. The Kombai cook meat by heating stones under a fire, {{wrapping}} the meat in large leaves, and placing the hot stones on top, until {{the meat is}} cooked. Fishing is done by building a small dam on a stream, beating the poison out of toxic roots into the stream, forcing the fish up. The fish are then easily captured. As food is abundant in the forest, none is stored. The tribe are also known to have practiced cannibalism.|$|R
