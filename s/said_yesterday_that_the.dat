60|$|I {{am quite}} ready to admit <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> you make a {{particular}} branch of trade more profitable, induces more people to engage in that branch of trade. That is what I call stimulating Colonial production {{through the agency of}} price. I am quite prepared to admit that a very small tax on staple articles would affect prices in a very small manner. Reference has been made to the imposition of a shilling duty on corn, and I think it was Mr. Moor[3] who <b>said,</b> <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> shilling duty was imposed prices fell, and when it was taken off prices rose. That may be quite true. I do not know that it is true, but it may be. The imposition of such a small duty as a shilling on a commodity produced in such vast abundance as wheat, might quite easily be swamped or concealed by the operation of other more powerful factors. A week of unusual sunshine, or a night of late frost, or a ring in the freights, or violent speculation, might easily swamp and cover the operation of such a small duty; but it is the opinion of those whose economic views I share--I cannot put it higher than that--that whatever circumstances may apparently conceal the effect of the duty on prices, the effect is there all <b>the</b> same, and <b>that</b> any duty that is imposed upon a commodity becomes a factor in <b>the</b> price of <b>that</b> commodity. I should have thought that was an almost incontestable proposition.|$|R
