25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{to lower the}} <b>sidelobe</b> levels of the compressed pulses for non-linear FM chirps are compared by Varshney and Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Mainly, the <b>sidelobe</b> {{levels of}} W-OFDM are lower. This results in less ICI, {{as well as}} greater {{robustness}} to narrowband interference. These two properties are especially useful in PLC, {{where most of the}} lines aren't shielded against EM-noise, which creates noisy channels and noise spikes.|$|E
25|$|Mainlobe jamming can {{generally}} only {{be reduced}} by narrowing the mainlobe solid angle and cannot fully be eliminated when directly facing a jammer which uses the same frequency and polarization as the radar. <b>Sidelobe</b> jamming can be overcome by reducing receiving sidelobes in the radar antenna design and by using an omnidirectional antenna to detect and disregard non-mainlobe signals. Other anti-jamming techniques are frequency hopping and polarization.|$|E
50|$|Because an antenna's {{far field}} {{radiation}} pattern is a Fourier Transform of its aperture distribution, most antennas will generally have <b>sidelobes,</b> unless the aperture distribution is a Gaussian, {{or if the}} antenna is so small, as to have no <b>sidelobes</b> in the visible space. Larger antennas have narrower main beams, as well as narrower <b>sidelobes.</b> Hence, larger antennas have more <b>sidelobes</b> in the visible space (as the antenna size is increased, <b>sidelobes</b> move from the evanescent space to the visible space).|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} figure, Blackman-Harris {{weighting}} {{has been applied}} to the compressed pulse spectrum. Although the close-in <b>sidelobes</b> have been reduced, the far-out <b>sidelobes</b> remain high with a predicted level of, approximately -20×log10(100) = -40 dB, as predicted for a time-bandwidth product of 100. With lower time-bandwidth products, these <b>sidelobes</b> will be even higher.|$|R
2500|$|Unfortunately, {{when the}} new {{compressor}} waveform is truncated, then far-out <b>sidelobes</b> reappear once more. [...] The next figures shows {{what happens to the}} compressed pulse when the compressor is set at 2T duration and then at 1.1T duration. [...] New far-out <b>sidelobes</b> have appeared with amplitudes that make them clearly visible. [...] These <b>sidelobes</b> are often referred to as “gating sidelobes”. [...] They can be irritatingly high but, fortunately, even if the compressor is set have just 10% extension, the <b>sidelobes</b> are still at a level than that achieved without correction.|$|R
25|$|Jamming is {{problematic}} to radar since the jamming signal only needs to travel one way (from the jammer to the radar receiver) whereas the radar echoes travel two ways (radar-target-radar) {{and are therefore}} significantly reduced in power {{by the time they}} return to the radar receiver. Jammers therefore can be much less powerful than their jammed radars and still effectively mask targets along the line of sight from the jammer to the radar (mainlobe jamming). Jammers have an added effect of affecting radars along other lines of sight through the radar receiver's sidelobes (<b>sidelobe</b> jamming).|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{the more}} the <b>sidelobe</b> levels are lowered, the broader the main lobe will become. [...] However, the various {{windowing}} functions do perform differently from one other, with some giving main lobes which are unnecessarily broad for the <b>sidelobe</b> levels achieved. [...] The most efficient function is the Dolph-Chebyshev window (see Window functions) as this gives the narrowest pulse at a given <b>sidelobe</b> level. [...] A selection of the better performing windowing functions are shown in the graph of Beamwidth × Bandwidth as <b>sidelobe</b> level.|$|E
2500|$|The {{procedure}} {{is most effective}} when both the signal chirp and the compressor chirp have modified rise-times, when <b>sidelobe</b> levels can be lowered by 15 – 20dB. [...] However, {{it is not always}} possible to apply amplitude modulation in the transmitter, so there is less improvement when only the compressor waveform is modified. [...] Even so, a <b>sidelobe</b> reduction of about 6dB can still be achieved.|$|E
50|$|The nulls between <b>sidelobes</b> {{occur when}} the {{radiation}} patterns passes through the origin in the complex plane. Hence, adjacent <b>sidelobes</b> are generally 180° out of phase to each other.|$|R
30|$|Golay {{figure of}} merit {{measures}} the energy in autocorrelation function <b>sidelobes.</b> Low energy <b>sidelobes</b> lead to better and faster sequence synchronization. Better synchronization gives better performance in systems where sequence synchronization is performed using autocorrelation function.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] Example of a {{simulated}} HRS antenna radiation pattern from a shortwave relay station in Canada. It {{consists of a}} main lobe with two major <b>sidelobes.</b> The <b>sidelobes</b> look curved because of the map projection.|$|R
2500|$|The lowest full line on {{the graph}} is for Dolph-Chebyshev {{weighting}} which, as already mentioned, sets the narrowest lobe possible for a given <b>sidelobe</b> level. [...] So, from this plot, if a <b>sidelobe</b> level of -40dB is desired, the graph shows that the smallest achievable half-power beamwidth × bandwidth is 1.2. [...] Thus a chirp sweeping over a 20MHz frequency band will have a compressed pulsewidth of 60 nanoseconds (at least).|$|E
2500|$|Cook, using paired-echo {{distortion}} methods, {{estimated that}} in order to keep <b>sidelobe</b> levels below -30dB, the maximum allowed Doppler frequency is given by ...|$|E
2500|$|Many early {{dispersive}} filters {{were built}} using lumped element all-pass filter sections., but these proved hard to fabricate with any accuracy {{and it was}} difficult to achieve a satisfactory and repeatable performance. [...] Consequently, the time <b>sidelobe</b> levels of the compressed pulses were high with these early systems, even after spectral weighting, with results no better than those achieved by phase coding or chip coding at that time. [...] Typically, <b>sidelobe</b> levels were in the range -20 to -25dB [...] a poor result when compared to later achievements.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel apodisation scheme for photo-induced {{waveguide}} gratings. The apodisation is implemented with double exposures that have reversely varying duty cycles. We have successfully applied the proposed scheme {{to remove the}} <b>sidelobes</b> of long period gratings (LPGs). We also observed {{for the first time}} super strong <b>sidelobes</b> in LPGs when creating them with only a single varying-duty-cycle exposure. The strong <b>sidelobes</b> can be well explained with a Mach-Zehnder interference model...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{suppression}} of range <b>sidelobes</b> in chirp pulse-compression radar system for spaceborne rain-mapping application demonstrated in {{operation of aircraft}} version of system. Radar system operates at center frequency of 13. 8 GHz, developed for operation aboard NASA DC- 8 aircraft to measure vertical rainfall-rate profiles and rain-cell dimensions. <b>Sidelobes</b> suppressed by at least 55 dB. Technique applied to other frequencies, therefore, useful in other radar systems in which low <b>sidelobes</b> at mid to far range needed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} Doppler {{frequency}} <b>sidelobes</b> control is addressed with reference to a WiFi-based Passive Bistatic Radar (PBR). In particular we show that the Ambiguity Function of typical WiFi transmissions usually yield a high <b>sidelobes</b> level which might strongly limit the detection capability of the PBR. Conventional weighting networks are shown to be ineffective against such Doppler <b>sidelobes</b> structures. Thus an innovative method is introduced to design effective weighting networks based on the solution of a constrained optimization problem. The performed analysis against both simulated and real data demonstrates that the proposed technique allows a significant improvement in terms of Peak to <b>Sidelobes</b> Ratio thus making the considered waveform more attractive for passive local area surveillance...|$|R
2500|$|Linear chirps with a time-bandwidth {{product of}} less than 2000, say, {{are found to be}} very {{tolerant}} of Doppler frequency shifts, so main pulse width and the time <b>sidelobe</b> levels ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{paper by}} Vizitui, <b>sidelobe</b> {{reduction}} is considered where phase pre-distortion {{is applied to}} non-linear FM chirps, rather than to linear chirps. [...] Lower sidelobes and some improvement in Doppler tolerance is claimed.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of {{waveform}} degradation {{is caused}} by eclipsing, where part of a returning chirp pulse is missing. [...] As expected, this results {{in the loss of}} signal amplitude and a rise in <b>sidelobe</b> levels.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{the use of}} a cosine {{pulse profile}} has an even more marked effect, with the {{amplitude}} of the <b>sidelobes</b> practically becoming negligible. The main lobe is again increased in amplitude and the <b>sidelobes</b> correspondingly reduced, giving a significant improvement in performance.|$|R
30|$|The ACF <b>sidelobes</b> of the {{generated}} sequence {{are expected}} to be under required levels, {{in order to avoid the}} weak targets being masked by the <b>sidelobes</b> of strong targets. The desired waveform should own low PSL of ACF to avoid interference of echoes among different range bins.|$|R
30|$|The {{envelope}} of the <b>sidelobes</b> is monotonically decreasing.|$|R
2500|$|Consider {{first the}} {{compressed}} pulse when TB = 250, which {{is shown in}} the left-hand figure below. [...] For this result no weighting has been applied to the transmit pulse, but the full Hamming weighting has been applied in the compressor. [...] As can be seen, the close-in <b>sidelobe</b> levels are consistent with the Hamming weighting (-42dB), but further out, the <b>sidelobe</b> levels rise to a peak value of -45dB at T/2 each side of the main lobe. [...] In the right-hand figure, where TB =25, the problems with the far-out sidelobes are much more serious. [...] Here these sidelobes now rise to -25dB at T/2 ...|$|E
2500|$|When the {{frequency}} sweep of a chirp is linear, the compression process {{is found to}} be very tolerant of Doppler frequency shifts on target returns, {{for a wide range of}} time-bandwidth products. [...] It is only when T×B [...] is very large (>2000, say) that loss of performance due to Doppler becomes an issue (with main-pulse broadening and increased <b>sidelobe</b> levels). [...] In these situations a chirp with a hyperbolic frequency law can be used, as it has been shown to be fully tolerant to Doppler shifts. [...] Windowing techniques can still be applied to the compressed pulse spectra, to lower <b>sidelobe</b> levels, in a similar manner to linear chirps.|$|E
2500|$|... {{show little}} change for Doppler {{frequencies}} {{up to several}} percent of system bandwidth, [...] In addition, linear chirps which use phase pre-distortion to lower <b>sidelobe</b> levels, as described in an earlier section, {{are found to be}} tolerant of Doppler.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} test the effect of SRAF, {{simulations}} are performed {{and the results are}} provided in this section. SRAF is not only applied to range <b>sidelobes</b> suppression of correlation output for noise SAR, moreover, it is implemented to control the <b>sidelobes</b> of matched filtering output for general SAR.|$|R
30|$|From Figure  14, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} {{spectrum}} modification technique has good suppression effect for the <b>sidelobes</b> neighboring the mainlobe. What is the most important, this technique bring a great advantage that suppress the <b>sidelobes</b> far away from the mainlobe to the level under – 62 dB.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} digital {{sampling}} causes ringing in the filters {{that are used}} to remove reflected signals from slow moving objects. Sampling causes frequency <b>sidelobes</b> to be produced adjacent to the true signal for an input that is a pure tone. Windowing suppresses <b>sidelobes</b> induced by the sampling process.|$|R
2500|$|The {{transmitter}} {{and receiver}} subsystems of a radar are not distortion free. [...] In consequence system performance is often less than optimum. [...] In particular, the time <b>sidelobe</b> levels of the compressed pulses {{are found to be}} disappointingly high.|$|E
2500|$|In the two {{examples}} below, the chirps have a non-linear sweep characteristic which gives a spectrum with Taylor weighting which, used alone, will achieve a <b>sidelobe</b> level of -20dB on its compressed pulses. [...] To achieve lower level sidelobes, this spectral shape is augmented by amplitude weighting {{so that the}} final target <b>sidelobe</b> level for the compressed pulses is -50dB. [...] Comparing the results for Doppler shifts of 10kHz and 100kHz with those shown earlier it is seen that the new spurious sidelobes, caused by the Doppler, are seen to be 6dB lower than before. [...] However, the mismatch loss has increased from 0.1dB to 0.6dB, but this is still better than the 1.6dB figure for linear chirps.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of non-linear chirps is their sensitivity to Doppler frequency shifts. [...] Even modest values of Doppler {{will result in}} broadening of the main pulse, raising of the <b>sidelobe</b> levels, increase in mismatch loss {{and the appearance of}} new spurious sidelobes.|$|E
30|$|In Figures 14, 17, and 20, we {{see that}} nulls between cisoids are deeper in the Periodogram and multitaper spectrums {{than those of the}} four-subband lattice method; the {{proposed}} lattice method in four-subband results in smoother spectrums with narrow mainlobes and low <b>sidelobes</b> while the Periodogram and multitaper spectrums have broader mainlobes and higher <b>sidelobes.</b> We then compare the lattice four-subband spectrums with those of the Capon, APES, and IAA in Figures 15, 18, and 21. It can be seen in these figures that the Capon spectrums have the highest null between cisoids among all of the methods, but they are smooth with relatively broader mainlobes and higher <b>sidelobes</b> comparing to the lattice four-subband spectrums. The APES spectrums have deeper nulls between cisoids than the lattice four-subband spectrums, and they are also smooth with broader mainlobes and higher <b>sidelobes</b> than the lattice four-subband spectrums. The IAA spectrums have the lowest nulls, but their mainlobes are broader and their <b>sidelobes</b> are higher in SNR improvement and whitening experiments comparing to the proposed method using four-subbands.|$|R
