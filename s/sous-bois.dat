The overall interior was designed by Airbus, who had previously worked with Chapelain-Midy to design sets for a performance of Les Indes galantes at the Palais Garnier in 1952. Slightly forward, the Salon Fontainebleau was decorated by Maxime Old, and within was contained three tapestries by Lucien Coutaud (Les femmes fleurs), two by Claude Idoux (Jardin magique, Fée Mirabelle) and Camille Hilaire (<b>Sous-bois,</b> Forêt de France). Near to that room was the Salon Debussy (Music Room) with three bronze lacquered panels by Bobot, and a bronze abstract sculpture of a young woman playing a flute, by Hubert Yencesse. The theatre's interior was done in red, grey and gold by Peynet, with the ceiling in grey mosaic tile, and the port and starboard walls in vertical gold lacquered aluminium panels, tilted outwards to allow for recessed lighting from behind. The [...] was created by Anne Carlu Subes (daughter of Jacques Carlu) in silver anodized aluminium panels arranged in a 45-degree grid pattern. Jacques Noël created trompe-l'œil panels for all four walls of the First Class Children's Playroom in a Renaissance theme, and Jean A.

50|$|Rather than {{painting}} landscapes {{from afar}} like traditional painters, 19th century rural painters climbed or walked into forested areas for a close view of wooded scenes. Paintings of the <b>sous-bois,</b> evoking {{the trees and}} grassy undergrowth, were often made vertically on canvas, as opposed to horizontal views of sweeping landscapes. In a <b>sous-bois,</b> the sky is barely visible, just a glimpse of sky sometimes penetrating the branches. This type of composition was rare before the 19th century when artists of the Barbizon School made paintings of forested areas in the Fontainebleau region of France. Close {{to the subject of}} the painting, artists painting <b>sous-bois</b> capture their experience in the forested scene. In German, the painting of interior forests was called Waldinneres, meaning enclosed woodland space.|$|E

40|$|Irregular forest stands {{regeneration}} {{is considered}} using gap creation that provokes a light {{increase in the}} understorey. The light increase leads to the recruitment of new trees {{as well as the}} potential colonization by competitive herbaceous and shrubby species. This study focused on light interactions between Scots pine (Pinussylvestris) seedlings and saplings and competitive vegetation made up of Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea andPteridium aquilinum growing in mixed sessile oak (Quercus petraea) -Scots pine stands in acidic temperateforests in France. The light was the key limiting factor controlling Scots pine seedling and sapling growth. Seedlings are able totolerate a consequent shading, whereas sapling light requirement increases with their size. The growth of C. vulgaris, M. caerulea and P. aquilinum was measured according to light availability. For a given cover,P. aquilinum intercepted more light than M. caerulea and C. vulgaris. P. aquilinum involved a more pronounceddecrease of pine seedling growth as this species was able to reach high cover even in very shaded conditions. For all the three species, processes like allelopathy, belowground competition or mechanical interference were assumed to also impede with pine seedling growth. All those results were integrated in a conceptual forest dynamics model named RReShar (Resource and Regeneration Sharing).

40|$|Abstract: Understanding the {{relationships}} between forest overstory and understory communities is essential for predict-ing changes in the abundance and distribution of understory plants through successional time {{and in response to}} forest management. We used correlation analysis, multiple regression, and nonparametric models to explore {{the relationships}} between overstory characteristics (canopy cover, stand density, and tree-size distributions) and the abundance of species in the herb and shrub layers in mature forests of western Washington. Overstory variables explained> 50 % of the varia-tion in the mean response of total shrub cover and ca. 50 % of the variation in cover of Acer circinatum Pursh (the most common shrub species) and late-seral herbs (species reaching their greatest abundance in late-successional for-ests). Stronger relationships (80 – 90 % variance explained) were found between overstory variables and the maximum cover of total shrubs, A. circinatum, total herbs, and each of three functional groups of herbaceous species. These em-pirical relationships represent both direct resource limitations and time-dependent responses for which overstory charac-teristics may be surrogates. Models of maximum abundance yielded the most consistent results, suggesting the relative importance of different overstory variables as limiting factors for understory response, although these limiting factors have different effects on plants with different life-history strategies.

40|$|Summary &mdash; A semi-empirical {{model of}} {{radiation}} penetration in a maritime pine canopy was developed so that mean solar (and net) radiation absorption by crowns and understorey could be estimated from above-canopy measurements only. Beam radiation Rb {{was assumed to}} penetrate the canopy accord-ing to Beer’s law with an extinction coefficient of 0. 32; this figure was found using non-linear regression techniques. For diffuse sky radiation, Beer’s law was integrated over the sky vault assuming a SOC (stan-dard overcast sky) luminance model; the upward and downward scattered radiative fluxes were obtained using the Kubelka-Munk equations and measurements of needle transmittance and reflectance. The penetration of net radiation within the canopy was also modelled. The model predicts the measured albedo of the stand very well. The estimation of solar radiation transmitted by the canopy was also satis-factory with the maximum difference between this and the mean output of mobile sensors at ground level being only 18 W m- 2. Due to the poor precision of net radiometers, the net radiation model could not be tested critically. However, as the modelled longwave radiation balance under the canopy is always between- 10 and- 20 Wm- 2, the below-canopy net radiation must be {{very close to the}} solar radiation balance. model / solar radiation / net radiation / penetration / maritime pine Résumé&mdash; Mesure et modélisation de la transmission du rayonnement à l’intérieur d’une par-celle de pins maritimes (Pinus pinaster Ait).
