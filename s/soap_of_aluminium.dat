40|$|A {{suite of}} {{amorphous}} silica-aluminas (ASAs) was prepared by homogeneous deposition–precipitation (HDP) <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> on a silica surface followed by calcination. The HDP process {{was investigated in}} detail by 27 Al NMR spectroscopy of solid and liquid aliquots of the synthesis mixture. Deposition occurs predominantly via a hydrolytic adsorption <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> onto the hydroxyl groups of the silica surface. Precipitation becomes more significant at higher aluminium concentration. Depending on the aluminium loading, the surface contains four- and six-coordinated aluminium as well as patches <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> hydroxides. Calcination results in two competing process, that is the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into the silica network and sintering <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into separate patches of a phase which mainly consists of octahedral Al. These ASAs exhibit Brønsted acidity similar to industrial amorphous silica-aluminas prepared by the grafting <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> on very reactive silica gels. Their acidity does not vary systematically with the aluminium concentration, except below 5 wt% Al 2 O 3. The acidity increases with the calcination temperature. The active sites form due to the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into the silica network at high temperatures, leading to Al substitutions of Si atoms. This is expected as the acidity does not correlate with anything else, viz., the amount <b>of</b> four-coordinated <b>aluminium</b> nor the presence of segregated Al or five-coordinated aluminium at the interface of these domains and the mixed silica-alumina phase. The surface of an amorphous silica-alumina consists <b>of</b> isolated <b>aluminium</b> grafted onto the silica surface (pure silica-alumina phase) with a very small amount <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> in the silica network, which brings about the Brønsted acidity, and small patches <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> oxides. Graphical abstract Well-defined precursors to amorphous silica-alumina are prepared through the grafting <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> to silica via hydrolytic adsorption. Calcination results in two competing processes, namely the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into the silica network to give the desired Brønsted acidity and the surface aggregation into small domains <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> oxide...|$|R
