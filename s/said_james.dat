25|$|In 1686, James {{tried to}} convert Rochester to Catholicism and every {{audience}} Rochester {{had with the}} king was spent in arguments over {{the authority of the}} Church and the worship of images. Rochester had interviews with Catholic divines in order to appear open-minded but he refused to convert. The king agreed to a conference between Catholic and Protestant divines in a formal disputation. James allowed Rochester to choose any Anglican ministers except John Tillotson and Edward Stillingfleet. Rochester chose two chaplains who happened to be in waiting, Simon Patrick and William Jane. The conference was held in secret on 30 November at Whitehall and the divines discussed the real presence, with the Catholics taking on the burden of proof. Patrick and Jane said little, with Rochester defending the Anglican position. At one point Rochester lost his temper and angrily asked whether it was expected that he would convert on so frivolous grounds. He then composed himself, knowing how much he was risking, and complimented the divines and requested that he be given time to digest what was <b>said.</b> <b>James</b> knew now that Rochester did not intend to be convinced.|$|E
500|$|Kerr's {{first film}} role {{was in the}} British {{production}} Contraband in 1940, but her scenes were left on the cutting room floor. With her next two British films—Major Barbara and Love on the Dole (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, <b>said</b> <b>James</b> Agate of Love on the Dole, [...] "is not {{within a mile of}} Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star". She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in The Day Will Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.|$|E
500|$|James did {{not play}} at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England. He became {{the leader of the}} team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, {{stepping}} back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history. He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. Afterwards, Krzyzewski <b>said</b> <b>James</b> [...] "is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Triton has {{increased}} in absolute temperature by 5% since 1989 to 1998. A similar rise of temperature on Earth would be equal to about 11°C (20°F) increase in temperature in nine years. [...] "At least since 1989, Triton has been undergoing a period of global warming. Percentage-wise, it's a very large increase," [...] <b>said</b> <b>James</b> L. Elliot, who published the report.|$|E
2500|$|The Americans went an undefeated 8–0 and {{averaged}} 116 points per game, winning {{by an average}} margin of 32.1 points—the fifth highest in US Olympic history. Team USA trailed {{in the fourth quarter}} only once, against Lithuania in the opening round. James became the leader of the team with Bryant—who would turn 34 in August 2012—stepping back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. After winning the gold, Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski <b>said</b> <b>James</b> [...] "is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now". Durant scored a United States Olympics record of 156 points in the tournament. He also made 34 three-point field goals, breaking the previous United States mark of 17; Anthony (23) also exceed the old record. Bryant was not in peak condition early, but he played himself into shape and was a key contributor in the final three games. While Chandler was the team's only true center—Davis was thin and had no professional experience—Krzyzewski also played Love, James or Anthony as Team USA's de facto center. Love led the team with 61 rebounds (27 offensive).|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Walsham {{soon came}} downstairs again, and <b>said</b> that <b>James</b> <b>said</b> he never felt better in his life, and that, by all means, {{she was to}} go up to the Hall. She then set about and {{prepared}} a cup of tea, which greatly restored Aggie, and, by the time the carriage arrived, the girl was able to walk to the gate.|$|R
2500|$|In 1421 Robert {{acted as}} his nephew's executor, {{following}} Gilbert's {{death in the}} disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Baugé. From his nephew, Umfraville inherited the Redesdale and Kyme estates; he had already lost his lordship of Langley in 1414 when the second Earl of Northumberland was restored to his patrimony. It was with this Henry Percy that Sir Robert {{spent much of the}} remainder of his military career in the north of England (this included not only fighting but diplomatic duties- for instance in 1425, he was sent to King James to assist the ongoing negotiations, although the results of this particular embassy is unknown). His duties also involved administrative work such as presiding over the Warden's Marcher Court, negotiating temporary truces, attending peace conferences, and travelling on embassies. He also continued to keep the peace in his home county as well, for example helping to arbitrate the dispute between the Northumberland gentry families of Heron (of Ford Castle) and Manners between 1428 and 1431, although as a feoffee to Sir William Heron- and being one of [...] "the two most powerful knights in the county"- Sir Robert took the part of Heron's wife, Isabel, after Heron was killed by Manners. This event, <b>said</b> <b>James</b> Raine, [...] "abounds with incident, characterising, at the same time, the pugnacious state of the borders, the total absence of every thing in the shape of legal redress, and the omnipotence of the church." [...] In this arbitration, Prior Wessington acted as an umpire. In Umfraville's own words, he wished to see [...] "gude rest and pece to be had in the cuntre." [...] Eventually, through Wessington's and Langley's arbitration, Umfraville informed the former on 3 April 1428 that he would request Isabel's lawsuit in London be withdrawn if Manners would pay a surety of 400 marks to Heron's widow and help Umfraville redeem the Heron estates from royal custody (for which he would attempt to get the anount of compensation demanded by the widow reduced). On the 23rd of the month, Manners may have indentured himself to Umfraville's [...] "lytill and esy tretye," [...] as it was termed, to pay all Heron's debts and to establish chantries for those that died during the course of their dispute. A tripartite Indenture was eventually agreed and delivered at Newcastle on 24 May 1431, which Umfraville attended, and at which he received the first instalment of the 250 marks compensation he- and Heron's widow- were now due from John Manners.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--yes. Well--" [...] <b>said</b> <b>James</b> vaguely, nervously, {{giving a}} glance at Mr. May. Whilst Mr. May abstractedly fingered his black knight.|$|E

6000|$|... "But seriously," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>James,</b> whose vexation {{had not yet}} spent itself, [...] "don't {{you think}} the Rector might do some good by speaking?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I don't,' <b>said</b> <b>James,</b> his cousin's {{brightness}} awakening his livelier manner. 'It {{needs an}} apprenticeship {{to be up}} to their blunders.' ...|$|E
