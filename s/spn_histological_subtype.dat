OBJECTIVES: To identify the epidemiology of basal {{cell carcinoma}} in Taubat&# 233;-SP and verify a possible association between topography and the different <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> of this tumor. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at The University Hospital of Taubat&# 233; between 01 / 01 / 08 and 12 / 31 / 09. The study included patients with a confirmed diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, of both genders, without age restrictions. The variables studied were incidence of basal cell carcinoma, topography, <b>histological</b> <b>subtype,</b> skin color, age and gender. We employed the chi-square test to identify the association between <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> and topography, and the student's t test to compare the mean age of onset for the different <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes.</b> RESULTS: The study included 239 individuals. The mean age of the sample was 68. 0 years. Male subjects (57. 7 %) and whites (87. 1 %) predominated in the study. The predominant <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> was nodular (34. 7 %), followed by the superficial subtype. The most frequent sites of involvement were the head and neck (areas exposed to light), with predominance of the nasal region. The superficial subtype was an exception, as it showed a strong association with unexposed areas like the trunk. The mean age of onset of superficial basal cell carcinoma also differed from that of the other <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes,</b> 63. 0 and 69. 0 years, respectively.

A study was undertaken {{to determine whether}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is a risk factor for the squamous {{cell carcinoma}} <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> in smokers with surgically resectable NSCLC. METHODS: Using a case-control design, subjects with a surgically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled from smokers undergoing lung resection for NSCLC in the District Hospital of Ferrara, Italy. Control subjects were smokers who underwent lung resection for NSCLC in the same hospital and had a surgically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC of any histological type other than squamous cell. RESULTS: Eighty six cases and 54 controls (mainly adenocarcinoma, n = 50) were enrolled. The presence of COPD was found to increase the risk for the squamous cell <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> by more than four times.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} found {{differences}} in the <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> of lung cancers affecting males and females. Our objective was to investigate trends {{in the incidence of}} <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> of lung cancer in males and females in relation to socio-economic deprivation in South East England. Methods Data on 48, 031 males and 30, 454 females diagnosed with lung cancer between 1995 and 2004 were extracted from the Thames Cancer Registry database. Age-standardised incidence rates for <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> were calculated for each year, using the European standard population. Using the Income Domain of the Multiple Index of Deprivation 2004, patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 were classified into quintiles of socio-economic deprivation based on their postcode of residence. Age-standardised rates for each <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> were then calculated for each deprivation quintile. A Poisson regression model was fitted to the data for males and females separately to test the hypothesis that the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and adenocarcinoma was less strong than for other subtypes. Results In males all specific <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> except adenocarcinoma declined in incidence. Squamous cell carcinoma remained the most common specific subtype and large cell carcinoma the least common. In females squamous cell carcinoma was initially most common, but its incidence declined slightly and that for adenocarcinoma increased. In both sexes the overall age-standardised incidence rate of lung cancer increased with increasing deprivation. However, these trends were less strong for adenocarcinoma than for the other subtypes in both males (p Conclusion The temporal trends and distribution of <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> of lung cancer in males and females are similar to that reported from other western populations.

40|$|Abstract Background Conventional {{high-grade}} osteosarcoma is {{a primary}} malignant bone tumor, which is most prevalent in adolescence. Survival rates of osteosarcoma patients have not improved significantly in the last 25 years. Aiming to increase this survival rate, a variety of model systems are used to study osteosarcomagenesis and to test new therapeutic agents. Such model systems are typically generated from an osteosarcoma primary tumor, but undergo many changes due to culturing or interactions with a different host species, which may result in differences in gene expression between primary tumor cells, and tumor cells from the model system. We aimed to investigate whether gene expression profiles of osteosarcoma cell lines and xenografts are still {{comparable to those of}} the primary tumor. Methods We performed genome-wide mRNA expression profiling on osteosarcoma biopsies (n = 76), cell lines (n = 13), and xenografts (n = 18). Osteosarcoma can be subdivided into several <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes,</b> of which osteoblastic, chondroblastic, and fibroblastic osteosarcoma are the most frequent ones. Using nearest shrunken centroids classification, we generated an expression signature that can predict the <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> of osteosarcoma biopsies.

We retrospectively investigated {{the accuracy of}} classifying <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> on diagnostic biopsies and examined the impact of different diagnostic procedures on the outcome. Methods: Consecutive patients with histologically confirmed MPM who underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) from 1994 to 2009 were included. Patient records were reviewed, and the initial diagnoses of <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> were obtained. The archival EPP specimens were reviewed {{by a panel of}} pathologists. The <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> obtained at review was compared with the initial diagnosis. Results: Eighty-five patients underwent EPP. Two patients achieved a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, leaving 83 patients to be included in this review. Different diagnostic methods were used before EPP: 81 % thoracoscopy; 7 % thoracotomy; 11 % computed tomography-guided procedure; and 1 % other. Patients determined to have an epithelial subtype (n = 64) at EPP were diagnosed correctly at initial diagnostic biopsy in 84 % of cases, whereas patients considered to have a biphasic subtype (n = 19) at EPP were diagnosed correctly at diagnostic biopsy in 26 % of cases. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic biopsy for epithelial MPM was 93 % and 31 %, respectively. The overall subtype misclassification rate was 20 %. Biopsy by thoracotomy was most accurate in subtype classification (83 %) compared with thoracoscopy (74 %) and computed tomography-guided procedure (44 %). Conclusions: The determination of <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> from a diagnostic biopsy is difficult due to sampling error, but an adequate specimen obtained from surgical biopsy increases the accuracy of subtype classification compared with radiological-guided biopsies. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionPrevious {{studies have}} shown that lung {{squamous}} cell carcinoma has higher 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) than adenocarcinoma. We hypothesized that <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> of lung adenocarcinoma were also different in 18 F-FDG uptake. MethodsPatients who had preoperative PET/computed tomography (CT) scan and had undergone complete resection for lung adenocarcinoma between April 2007 and December 2009 were enrolled in this study. Because of the limitation of spatial resolution on PET/CT, tumors less than 1 cm were excluded for analysis. Two independent classification systems were used to categorize <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> of adenocarcinoma; one was modified from the current World Health Organization classification and the other used the morphological features of the terminal respiratory unit (TRU). The maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on PET/CT and the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT- 1) expression of the tumors were measured and correlated to the histology of lung adenocarcinoma. ResultsOne hundred fifty-two patients with 153 primary lung adenocarcinomas were included. There was a significant difference in SUVmax among different <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes.</b> Namely, solid predominant adenocarcinomas had significantly higher SUVmax than those with other predominant histology (p < 0. 001), and TRU-type adenocarcinomas had significantly lower SUVmax than non-TRU-type adenocarcinomas (p < 0. 001). Consistently, GLUT- 1 expression was higher in tumors with a solid growth pattern than those without (p < 0. 001) and in tumors with non-TRU type than TRU type (p < 0. 001). ConclusionsThe <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> of lung adenocarcinomas differ in GLUT- 1 expression and 18 F-FDG uptake on the PET/CT scan, suggesting that <b>histological</b> <b>subtyping</b> not only has morphological but also biological implications...|$|R

The prevalence of <b>histological</b> <b>subtypes</b> was as follows: 14 patients had a single subtype, either ES (12) or G (2); 12 patients had two subtypes, ES+G (4), ES+PV (3), ES+H (4) or G+H (1); six patients had three subtypes, ES+P+H (4) or ES+G+H (2); and three patients had all four subtypes. Multivariate analysis showed that important predictors were FIGO stage, chemotherapeutic regimen and residual tumour size. However, for stage I, multivariate analysis showed that the <b>histological</b> <b>subtype</b> was a superior predictor to the subclassification of FIGO stage I, age or chemotherapeutic regimen (P = 0. 03). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that YSTs composed of an admixture {{of three or four}} subtypes was associated with a better prognosis than those composed of one or two subtypes (P < 0. 01), other variables being constant...|$|R
