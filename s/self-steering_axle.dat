40|$|The gross {{vehicle weight}} (GVW) and {{dimensions}} of articulated freight vehicles have been considerably relaxed {{during the past few}} decades, which has encouraged the use of multi-axle trailers. Multiple axle trailers with liftable and self-steering axles are commonly used to enhance their maneuverability on tight turns and minimize the tire scrub. Many concerns have been raised on the use of liftable axle, as they transmit considerably higher tire loads to the pavement, when retracted. The self-steering axles, on the other hand, could provide adequate maneuverability and reduce the tire scrub, while limiting the magnitudes of tire loads transmitted to the pavement. The reduced cornering forces due to <b>self-steering</b> <b>axle</b> tires, and higher axle loads due to retracted liftable axles, could further alter the handling and directional performance of the vehicle. This dissertation is concerned with relative directional performance and pavement-loading characteristics of multiple axle articulated vehicles with conventional, liftable and self-steering axles.
