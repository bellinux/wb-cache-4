Efforts to immunize humans <b>against</b> <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> have been frustrated by toxic reactions to almost any streptococcal product introduced into the human host (1). ~'Purifled" M protein vaccines have apparently contained tenaciously associated nontype-specific antigens which have accounted, at least in part, for the toxic effects of various M protein preparations (2, 3). Since conventional methods have failed to separate the nontype-specific antigens from the type-specific M antigen, various new methods for the extraction and purification of M protein have been tried by a number of different investigators (4 - 10).

40|$|C 5 a peptidase, {{also called}} SCPA (surface-bound C 5 a peptidase), is a surface-bound protein on group A streptococci (GAS), {{etiologic}} agents {{for a variety}} of human diseases including pharyngitis, impetigo, toxic shock, and necrotizing fasciitis, as well as the postinfection sequelae rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. This protein is highly conserved among different serotypes and is also expressed in human isolates of group B, C, and G streptococci. Human tonsils are the primary reservoirs for GAS, maintaining endemic disease across the globe. We recently reported that GAS preferentially target nasal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) in mice, a tissue functionally analogous to human tonsils. Experiments using a C 5 a peptidase loss-of-function mutant and an intranasal infection model showed that this protease is required for efficient colonization of NALT. An effective vaccine should prevent infection of this secondary lymphoid tissue; therefore, the potential of anti-SCPA antibodies to protect <b>against</b> <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infection</b> of NALT was investigated. Experiments showed that GAS colonization of NALT was significantly reduced following intranasal immunization of mice with recombinant SCPA protein administered alone or with cholera toxin, whereas a high degree of GAS colonization of NALT was observed in control mice immunized with phosphate-buffered saline only. Moreover, administration of anti-SCPA serum by the intranasal route protected mice <b>against</b> <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> These results suggest that intranasal immunization with SCPA would prevent colonization and infection of human tonsils, thereby eliminating potential reservoirs that maintain endemic disease...|$|R

Although it is known that the disease is triggered by infections with so-called nephritogenic strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, the pathogenesis has been poorly understood mainly because the antigens involved have not been identified.

Shared sequences of types 5, 6, and 19 M proteins have been shown to evoke antibodies that react with several myocardial and skeletal muscle proteins, including myosin, tropomyosin, and other as yet unidentified proteins (1 - 6).

Crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies allow us to propose a general catalytic mechanism for the whole glycoside hydrolase family 25.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) infections, causing rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, and invasive disease, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. We describe an innovative vaccine strategy to induce mucosal antibodies of significant magnitude against peptide antigens of GAS using a novel biocompatible liposomal platform technology. The approach is to encapsulate free diphtheria toxoid (DT), a standard vaccine antigen, within liposomes {{as a source of}} helper T-cell stimulation while lipidated peptide targets for B-cells are separately displayed on the liposome surface.

Despite the damaging effect that EndoSe has on IgG, antibodies against EndoSe can neutral-ize its function. Antibodies against EndoSe restored the opsonic activity of specific opsonizing antibodies. Mice infected with either S. equi subsp. equi or subsp. zooepidemicus or S. pyogenes could be protected by vaccination with EndoSe.

40|$|Summary: Streptococci readily colonize mucosal tissues in the nasopharynx; the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and {{genitourinary}} tracts; and the skin. Each {{ecological niche}} presents {{a series of}} challenges to successful colonization with which streptococci have to contend. Some species exist in equilibrium with their host, neither stimulating nor submitting to immune defenses mounted against them. Most are either opportunistic or true pathogens responsible for diseases such as pharyngitis, tooth decay, necrotizing fasciitis, infective endocarditis, and meningitis. Part {{of the success of}} streptococci as colonizers is attributable to the spectrum of proteins expressed on their surfaces. Adhesins enable interactions with salivary, serum, and extracellular matrix components; host cells; and other microbes. This is the essential first step to colonization, the development of complex communities, and possible invasion of host tissues. The majority of streptococcal adhesins are anchored to the cell wall via a C-terminal LPxTz motif. Other proteins may be surface anchored through N-terminal lipid modifications, while the mechanism of cell wall associations for others remains unclear. Collectively, these surface-bound proteins provide Streptococcus species with a “coat of many colors,” enabling multiple intimate contacts and interplays between the bacterial cell and the host. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated direct roles for many streptococcal adhesins as colonization or virulence factors, making them attractive targets for therapeutic and preventive strategies <b>against</b> <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections.</b> There is, therefore, much focus on applying increasingly advanced molecular techniques to determine the precise structures and functions of these proteins, and their regulatory pathways, so that more targeted approaches can be developed...|$|R

Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) has been proposed as a possible candidate for vaccine formulation <b>against</b> <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections,</b> because LTA is a common constituent of streptococci and the antibody to LTA inhibits bacterial attachment to epithelial cells in vitro. Streptolysin-O and streptococcal whole cell body are highly immunogenic and the antibodies to these antigens are reported to be better parameters for <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> The objective {{of the present study}} is to investigate how systemic and local immune activities against S. pyogenes may be associated with RT. Methods: Sera from 178 children with or without RT aged 1 - 15 years with a median age of 5 years were investigated for the levels of total immunoglobulins and antibodies specific to streptococcal antigens such as whole cell body, LTA, and streptolysin-O. Pharyngeal secretions from 67 children with or without RT aged 2 - 14 years with a median age of 6 years were subjects to secretory IgA (SIgA) antibody levels to streptococcal LTA. The antibodies to whole cell body and LTA were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total immunoglobins and the antistreptolysin- O antibody were assayed by nephelometry. Results: An age-matched comparison revealed that either levels of serum IgG antibody or pharyngeal SIgA antibody to streptococcal LTA at 2 - 5 years of age were significantly lower in RT children than in non-RT children (1. 39 vs. 5. 14 μg/ml, p= 0. 001; 10. 6 vs. 29. 9 units/ng/ml total SIgA, p= 0. 015; respectively) and correlated inversely to episodes of tonsillitis (r=– 0. 242, p= 0. 024; r=– 0. 3, p= 0. 024; respectively). Either serum total immunoglobulin levels of IgG or IgA correlated positively to episodes of tonsillitis in children aged 2 - 5 years(r= 0. 293, p= 0. 011; r= 0. 361, p= 0. 002; respectively). No difference was found on either serum levels of IgG antibody tostreptococcal whole cell body or antibody to streptolysin-O between RT and non-RT children in any age-matched comparisons. High serum antibody levels to whole cell body was associated with high antibody levels to streptococcal LTA in non-RT children (r= 0. 198, p< 0. 05), but no association was found between these antibody levels in RT children.

40|$|Development of a {{synthetic}} vaccine <b>against</b> group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infection</b> is increasingly paramount {{due to the}} induction of autoimmunity by the main virulent factor - M protein.

For self-adjuvanting human vaccines, the conjugation of immunostimulatory lipids has been demonstrated as a potentially safe method. This study describes the design and optimized synthesis of two lipopeptide conjugated carbohydrate templates and the assembling of peptide antigens.

40|$|Immunization <b>against</b> Group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> {{has been}} {{hampered}} by toxic properties of preparations of M protein employed as vaccines (1, 2). Intradermal injections of purified preparations of M protein in man have produced local inflammatory responses resembling cell-mediated reactions (1, 3 - 6).

Theoretically, therefore, hypersensitivity to the type-specific M antigen when isolated in pure form should be encountered only in the host specifically immune to the homologous type. This concept is also supported by the resistance to phagocytosis of the intact M-rich streptococcus in fresh, nonimmune human blood in vitro (7). In such preparations the surface of the organism appears nonreactive with platelets and white blood cells (8).

These findings are of considerable concern to investigators attempting to develop M protein vaccines that would protect against infection by strains of group A streptococci that may give rise to acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. The fear has been that the vaccines themselves may evoke autoimmune responses that could lead to host tissue injury.

40|$|Group A Streptococcus is a Gram-positive human {{pathogen}} able to colonize both {{upper respiratory tract}} and skin. GAS is responsible for several acute diseases and autoimmune sequelae that account for half a million deaths worldwide every year (Cunningham et al., 2000). As other bacteria, GAS infections requires {{the capacity of the}} pathogen to adhere to host tissues and to form cell aggregates. The ability to persist in distinct host niches like the throat and the skin and to trigger infections is associated with the expression of different GAS virulence factors. GAS pili has been described as important virulence factors encoded by different FCT-operon regions. Based on this information, we decided to study the possible effect of environmental conditions that could regulate the pili expression. In this study we reported the influence of pH environment variations in biofilm formation for strains pertaining to a panel of different GAS FCT-types. The biofilm formation was promoted, excepted in the FCT- 1 strains, by a changing in pH from physiological to acidic condition of growth in in vitro biofilm assay. By analyzing the possible association between biofilm formation and pH dependence, we have found that in FCT- 2 and FCT- 3 strains, the biofilm is promoted by pH reduction leading to an increase of pili expression. These data confirmed a direct link between pH dependent pilus expression and biofilm formation in GAS. As pili are a multi component structure we decided to investigate the functional role of one of its subunits, the AP- 1 protein. AP- 1 is highly conserved through the different FCT-types and suggests a possible essential role for the pili function. We focused our attention on the AP- 1 protein encoded by the FCT- 1 strains (M 6). In particular this AP- 1 protein contains the von Willebrand Factor A (VWFA) domain, which share an homology with the human VWFA domain that has been reported to be involved in adhesion process. We have demonstrated that the AP- 1 protein binds to human epithelial cells by its VWFA domain, whereas the biofilm formation is mediated by the N-terminal region of AP- 1 protein. Moreover, analyzing the importance of AP- 1 in in vivo experiments we found a major capacity of tissue dissemination for the wild-type strain compared to the isogenic AP- 1 deletion mutant. Pili have been also reported as potential vaccine candidates against Gram positive bacteria. For these reason we decided to investigate the relationship between cross reaction of sera raised against different GAS and GBS pilin subunits and the presence of a conserved Cna_B domain, in different pilin components.

40|$|O Streptococcus pyogenes (Grupo A de Lancefield) é uma bactéria Gram positiva e beta-hemolítica, responsável por infecções, tais como Faringite, Sepse, Fasciíte Necrotizante e Síndrome do Choque Tóxico Estreptocócico. Indivíduos suscetíveis podem desenvolver sequela não supurativa auto-imune pós-estreptocócica, como a Febre Reumática, Doença Reumática Cardíaca e a Glomerulonefrite Aguda. A proteína M é o {{principal}} antígeno bacteriano. Consiste em aproximadamente 450 resíduos de aminoácidos dispostos em quatro regiões (A, B, C e D), contendo alguns blocos de repetições. As regiões C e D são conservadas e a N-terminal (regiões A e B) é polimórfica. Atualmente, existem mais de 250 genótipos de emm conhecidos em todo o mundo, de acordo com o Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Há vários anos, o desenvolvimento de uma vacina contra S. pyogenes (StreptInCor - identificação médica) foi iniciado, com base na região conservada da proteína M, com o objetivo de proteger o indivíduo vacinado contra infecções estreptocócicas, sem causar reações autoimunes. No presente estudo foi analisada a capacidade ïn vitrod̈e anticorpos anti-StreptInCor neutralizarem/opsonizarem as cepas de S. pyogenes mais freqüentes em São Paulo, através da análise do reconhecimento das cepas por soros de camundongos imunizados com StreptInCor. Também foi avaliada por Western blotting a presença de anticorpos de reação cruzada dirigidos ao tecido cardíaco valvular humano. Anticorpos anti-StreptInCor foram capazes de neutralizar/opsonizar, pelo menos, cinco diferentes cepas mostrando que a imunização com StreptInCor pode ser eficaz contra várias cepas de S. pyogenes, assim como prevenir a infecção e sequelas subsequentes, sem causar reações auto-imunes. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) is a Gram {{positive and}} beta-hemolytic bacteria, responsible for infections such as Pharyngitis, Sepsis, Necrotizing Fasciitis and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome. Susceptible individuals may develop post-streptococcal non-suppurative autoimmune sequelae such as Rheumatic Fever, Rheumatic Heart Disease and Acute Glomerulonephritis. The M protein {{is the major}} bacterial antigen. It consists of approximately 450 amino acid residues arranged in four regions (A, B, C and D), containing some repeated blocks. C and D regions are conserved and the N-terminus (regions A and B) is polymorphic. Currently there are over 250 known emm genotypes worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several years ago {{the development of a}} vaccine against S. pyogenes (StreptInCor - medical identification) was initiated, based on the M protein conserved region, aiming to protect <b>against</b> <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> without causing autoimmune reactions. In the present study we analyzed the ïn vitroäbility of anti-StreptInCor antibodies to neutralize/opsonize the most frequent S. pyogenes strains in Sao Paulo by examining the strains recognition by sera from StreptInCor immunized mice. We also evaluated the presence of cross reactive antibodies directed to the human heart valve tissue by Western blotting. Anti-StreptInCor antibodies were able to neutralize/opsonize at least 5 strains, showing that the immunization with StreptInCor can be effective against several S. pyogenes strains as well as preventing infection and subsequent sequelae, without causing autoimmune reactions...|$|R
40|$|Serum opacity factor (SOF) is {{a protein}} {{expressed}} by Streptococcus pyogenes that opacifies mammalian serum. SOF {{is also a}} virulence factor of S. pyogenes, {{but it has not}} been previously shown to elicit a protective immune response. Herein, we report that SOF evokes bactericidal antibodies against S. pyogenes in humans, rabbits, and mice. Rabbit antiserum against purified recombinant SOF 2 opsonized SOF-positive M type 2, 4, and 28 S. pyogenes in human blood but had no effect on SOF-negative M type 5 S. pyogenes. Furthermore, affinity-purified human antibodies against SOF 2 also opsonized SOF-positive streptococci. A combination of antisera against M 2 and SOF 2 proteins was dramatically more effective in killing streptococci than either antiserum alone, indicating that antibodies against SOF 2 enhance the opsonic efficiency of M protein antibodies. Mice tolerated an intravenous injection of 100 μg of SOF without overt signs of toxicity, and immunization with SOF protected mice against challenge infections with M type 2 S. pyogenes. These data indicate that SOF evokes opsonic antibodies that may protect against infections by SOF-positive serotypes of group A streptococci and suggest that different serotypes of SOF have common epitopes that may be useful vaccine candidates to protect <b>against</b> group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Invasive group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> {{are serious}} infections that carry a high mortality. Objective: The {{aim was to}} review current methods of {{diagnosis}} and treatment of invasive group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> as well as to provide background on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these infections. Methods: The most recent literature regarding pathogenesis, epidemiology, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} invasive group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> is reviewed. Results/conclusion: The incidence of invasive group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> in industrialised countries is in the order of 3 per 100, 000, whereas in developing countries available evidence suggests that the incidence is several-fold higher. Management of invasive group A <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> includes supportive care, surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, correct use of antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin and contact prophylaxis. Recent studies suggest that the early use of intravenous immunoglobulin may reduce the need for radical debridement of tissue in cases of necrotising fasciitis...|$|R

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> and their sequelae have declined dramatically in the past century, yet the prevalence of <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> is still high. The reasons for this decline must be intimately related to host resistance, virulence of the agent, and environmental factors, especially crowding. Close examination of these fundamental influences does not reveal any evidence that humans have become less resistant to <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections,</b> but they react less violently. There {{is some evidence that}} the agent may have lost a degree of its virulence. The decline in morbidity and mortality due to <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> began long before antibiotics, especially penicillin, were available. However, penicillin has proved to be an important factor in prevention of <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections,</b> especially in rheumatic fever prophylaxis. There are certain indications that repeated <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections</b> due to similar M types, occurring in young children over the past several decades, have resulted in some degree of immunity as well as the possible evolution of less virulent, but not less infectious, strains of group A streptococci. Also, a decrease in crowding would be expected to result in fewer <b>streptococcal</b> <b>infections.</b> Although there are more people in the world {{than at any other time}} in the history of man, urban population density in the western world, at least, is less than in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s...|$|R
