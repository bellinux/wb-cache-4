At the same time, decisions made {{at the beginning of}} a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Research into {{integration}} of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>systems</b> <b>methodologies</b> for solving messy problems highlighted {{the need for}} an in-depth understanding not evident in systems thinking and system dynamics literature. The search for better insights was built around concept (cognitive) mapping of reports of Boards of Inquiry, Royal Commissions and Coronial Inquests. It was found that surrounding each accident were myriad factors and high levels of interconnectedness. Common to all cases were failures by almost everybody to recognise emergent patterns of events. There was repeated failure to understand, and to learn. This paper demonstrates that the key to correcting repeated failure to learn starts with recognising these recurring patterns...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{inherent}} complexity of public health practice, practitioners are faced with both a requirement to demonstrate effectiveness and a dearth of tools to do so. The authors {{have been working on}} the development of realist approaches to evaluation for a number of years. This has proved a particularly successful methodological framework (Carr et al 2008 a). The authors have used realist approaches in conjunction with appreciative enquiry (Carr & Lhussier (2008), with health impact assessment (Lhussier et al. 2008) and with <b>soft</b> <b>system</b> <b>methodology</b> (Carr et al. 2008 b). This presentation aims to expose and encourage discussion about these methodological developments. Realist approaches encourage practitioners to populate a ‘context-mechanism outcome’ framework. This enables a surfacing of often implicit forms of knowledge, so that details of intervention mechanisms can be contextualised. From there, practitioners are encouraged to identify short, medium and long outcomes which they expect the intervention might achieve. This enables practitioners to establish evidence generating evaluation strategies to support intervention development. – In conjunction with principles of health impact assessment, a realist approach enabled practitioners to become explicit about why their project worked in the particular circumstances (Lhussier et al. 2008). – In conjunction with <b>soft</b> <b>system</b> <b>methodology,</b> realist methodology enabled practitioners to highlight the complexity of their combined intervention and potential synergies of action. (Carr et al. 2008 b) – In conjunction with appreciative inquiry, realist synthesis enables a co-creation of understanding that builds on past success and frames {{them in a way that}} will facilitate replication (Carr & Lhussier 2008). Methodologically, these advances offer huge potential to practitioners faced with the necessity to generate evidence of effectiveness. They offer the possibility to frame past successes, to acknowledge local specificities and the often impossibility of achieving long term epidemiologically measurable impacts, and to frame and assess progress...|$|R
