50|$|In Hungarian cuisine, {{sour cherry}} soup or meggyleves is a soup {{made from the}} fruits of the <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> (Prunus cerasus), and not from sweet cherries. The name is formed from hideg meaning 'cold', meggy meaning 'sour-cherries' / morellos, and leves meaning 'soup'. It is {{traditionally}} served as a dinner course, usually as either the appetizer, soup or dessert, on warm summer nights or for hot summer luncheons. The soup is cooked with whole sour cherries, including the pits. Sour cherry trees are numerous in Hungary, and the soup {{is a good example of}} the quintessentially Hungarian fusion of Eastern/Asian influences and traditional Continental European cuisine. It is customary that the soup contain fresh sour cherries, fresh cream and sometimes cloves and cinnamon. Canned regular cherries are sometimes added and sour cream is often substituted for fresh cream. A small amount of sweet white or dry red wine is also sometimes added before serving. Packets of dried meggyleves powder are also sold in Hungary.|$|E

40|$|Characterization {{of spatial}} {{patterns}} of plant disease can provide insights into important epidemiological {{processes such as}} sources of inoculum, mechanisms of dissemination, and reproductive strategies of the pathogen population. While two-dimensional patterns of disease (among plants within fields) have been studied extensively, there is limited information on three-dimensional patterns within individual plant canopies. Reported here are the detailed mapping of different symptom types of brown rot (caused by Monilinia laxa) in individual <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> (Prunus cerasus) canopies, {{and the application of}} spatial statistics to the resulting data points to de-termine patterns of symptom aggregation and association. Methods – A magnetic digitizer was uti-lized to create detailed three-dimensional maps of three symptom types (blossom blight, shoot blight, and twig canker) in eight <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> canopies during the green fruit stage of develop-ment. The resulting point patterns were analyzed for aggregation (within a given symptom type) and pairwise association (between symptom types) using a three-dimensional extension of nearest-neighbor analysis. Key Results – Symptoms of M. laxa infection were generally aggregated within the canopy volume, but there was no consistent pattern for one symptom type to be more or less aggre-gated than the other. Analysis of spatial association among symptom types indicated that previous year’s twig cankers may {{play an important role in}} influencing the spatial pattern of current year’s symptoms. This observation provides quantitative support for the epidemiological role of twig can-kers as sources of primary inoculum within the tree. Conclusions – Presented here is a new approach to quantify spatial patterns of plant disease in complex fruit tree canopies using point pattern anal-ysis. This work provides a framework for quantitative analysis of three-dimensional spatial patterns within the finite tree canopy, applicable to many fields of research...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the genomic diversity of plant pathogenic viruses is essential for devising control strategies. Over the last two decades, improved sequencing technologies and the discovery of RNA silencing have profoundly impacted our ability to understand the diversity of virus populations and develop resistant plants. In Chapter 1 of this dissertation, I critically evaluate the literature regarding materials providing resistance against viruses and vectors in Vitis species and discuss their availability for disease management. This review indicates little or no useful resistance toward most virus diseases, and the critical need to develop resistant materials. In Chapter 2, {{in order to gain}} insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), sequence information was obtained from fourteen isolates collected in naturally infected vineyards in California. My results indicated that some isolates result from interspecies recombination between GFLV and Arabis mosaic virus, and suggest that recombination and purifying selection are important evolutionary mechanisms in the genetic diversification of GFLV. In Chapter 3, I designed various resistance constructs derived from GFLV based upon an analysis of sequence variability. These constructs were tested for resistance to GFLV using a transient expression system. Results indicated that some of these constructs are capable of reducing virus titers in GFLV-infected plants. In Chapter 4, I reviewed the literature regarding environmental and human safety issues related to virus-resistant transgenic horticultural crops. My analysis suggests that the use of virus-resistant transgenic plants is a safe and effective way to control viral diseases. In Chapter 5, I present the results of a survey for Prunus necrotic ringspot virus in an orchard of sour and sweet cherry trees. Sequence analysis of the viral coat protein gene from various isolates indicated one predominant and several minor molecular variants. Results revealed a higher rate of infection among sour cherry vs. sweet cherry trees, and also suggested that this virus may have been transferred from a single infected <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> into the orchard by pollen transfer. In Chapter 6, I present conclusions regarding the implications of my research and suggest future directions of the work presented in the preceding five chapters...|$|E

40|$|Simazine and dalapon {{have been}} used to control weeds in many crops during the last few years, but in 1963, when this study was begun, their uses in fruit {{orchards}} were limited. To study the effects of simazine and dalapon both on the control of weeds and on various metabolic changes in apple (Malis pumila), Montmorency <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus cerasus), sweet cherry (Prunus avium), and Prunus mahaleb root s tock, experiment s were conducted from 1964 through 1966 in both the field and in the greenhouse. The application of a low do sage of simazine (4 lb/A) to soil around twelve-year-old Montmorency <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> in the field resulted in 60 to 70 percent weed control, while tree growth, chlorophyll content of the leaves, fruit y i e ld, and fruit quality were enhanced. Simazine applied at the higher dosages (8 and 12 lb/A) gave very good weed control (up to 100 percent) but reduced tree growth, chlorophyll content, and fruit yield and quality. In the greenhouse, the application of simazine at all three levels caused severe damage to R· mahal eb and sweet <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> and hence reduced the water uptake, but young apple trees treated with simazine showed no visible damage, although water uptake was reduced. In young <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> treated with 4 lb/A simazine, slight chlorophyll increase s we re observed, while at the higher dosages, decreases were observed. Simazine applied to the soil surface was absorbed readily by all trees. It accumulated in large amounts in the l eaves compared with the other parts of these plants. <b>Sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> accumulated more simazine than apple trees. Results from both field and greenhouse trial sindicate that apple trees were comparatively resistant, and sweet cherry and ~ · mahaleb trees were very sensitive. Enzyme analys i s indicated that simazine caused an increase in the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in all trees. The activity of catalase and cytochrome oxidase was decreased in f. mahaleb, sweet <b>cherry,</b> and <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees,</b> but apple trees showed an increase in both catalase and cytochrome oxidase activity. Compared to the other trees, the most tolerant, untreated trees (apple) had relatively high peroxidase and low polyphenol oxidase activity, with moderate catalase and cytochrome oxidase activity. The moderately resistant species (<b>sour</b> <b>cherry)</b> had moderate peroxidase, catalase, and cytochrome oxidase activity but very low polyphenol oxidase activity, while the sensitive trees (~. mahaleb and sweet cherry) showed a wide range of enzyme activities. ~ · mahaleb leaves had low peroxidase and catalase activities and high polyphenol oxidase and cytochrome oxidase activities, but sweet cherry leaves had moderate peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase, high catalase, and l ow cytochrome oxidase activities.
