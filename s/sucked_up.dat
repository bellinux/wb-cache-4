25|$|If ballast {{is badly}} fouled, the {{clogging}} will reduce {{its ability to}} drain properly; this, in turn, causes more debris to be <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> from the sub-ballast, causing more fouling. Therefore, keeping the ballast clean is essential. Bioremediation {{can be used to}} clean ballast.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} ventilation in VIP latrines is {{the action of}} wind blowing {{across the top of}} the vent pipe. The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and up and out of the vent pipe. Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> and exhausted out of vent pipe, leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the vent pipe.|$|E
25|$|Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae {{in their}} mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders {{lay their eggs}} in a pit, which are <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> {{into the mouth of}} the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are {{colorful}} spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.|$|E

25|$|In humans the metacyclic promastigotes are {{injected}} by sandfly {{through the}} skin during its blood meal. When sandfly bites using its proboscis it ejects the parasites that are stored inside the hollow tube. Some promastigotes may enter the blood stream directly where some are destroyed by macrophagic cytolysis. But many are also taken up through phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes in liver, spleen and bone marrow. Inside the cells they undergo spontaneous transformation into oval-shaped amastigotes. Granulocytes selectively kill the promastigotes by oxidative mechanism, while amastigotes are resistant. Then the surviving amastigotes undergo cell division using simple binary fission. Multiplication continues until the host cell can no longer hold and ruptures. In a fully congested cell there can {{be as many as}} 50 to 200 amastigotes, which are released into tissue cavities. Each individual amastigote is then capable of invading fresh cells. As a result, the entire tissue is progressively infected and destroyed. A number of free amastigotes then enters the blood stream where many are phagocytosed by macrophages. These free and phagocytosed amastigotes in peripheral blood are then <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> by blood-feeding sandfly.|$|E
25|$|Dahl also {{features}} in his books characters {{who are very}} fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins {{are a few of}} these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge is featured in James and the Giant Peach and the nasty farmer Boggis in Fantastic Mr Fox is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from Willy Wonka's chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In Matilda, Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school. Featured in The Witches, Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. Dahl's mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in The BFG, the fox family in Fantastic Mr Fox and the trolls in The Minpins.|$|E
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E

500|$|Depending on {{how fast}} the winds from a {{waterspout}} are whipping, anything that is within about one yard of {{the surface of the}} water, including fish of different sizes, frogs, and even turtles, can be lifted into the air. A waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish {{out of the water and}} all the way up into the cloud. Even if the waterspout stops spinning, the fish in the cloud can be carried over land, buffeted up and down and around with the cloud’s winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere. Depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere, the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down. People as far as [...] inland have experienced raining fish. Fish can also be <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> from rivers, but raining fish is not a common weather phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 24 November 1998, the hotel was devastated by a fire which started in the kitchen. [...] A chef was frying eggs and {{sausages}} in a pan; hot fat spilt and caught light, and flames were immediately <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> a vent to the top floor. [...] The fire spread quickly, assisted by strong winds, and all 160 people in the building were evacuated. [...] The Public and Commercial Services Union had to cancel their annual conference, due to be held that day, because of the disruption caused to its delegates, {{most of whom were}} staying at the hotel. [...] About 160 firefighters from all parts of East and West Sussex attended the fire from about 8.20am until late in the evening, in what was later described as Brighton's [...] "biggest firefighting operation for nearly 30 years". [...] All parts of the hotel were affected by smoke, water and structural damage, but the original corner building was particularly badly affected.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the 1970s, the Mary Rose was meticulously surveyed, {{excavated}} {{and recorded}} {{with the latest}} methods {{within the field of}} maritime archaeology. Working in an underwater environment meant that principles of land-based archaeology did not always apply. Mechanical excavators, airlifts and suction dredges were used in the process of locating the wreck, but as soon as it began to be uncovered in earnest, more delicate techniques were employed. Many objects from the Mary Rose had been well preserved in form and shape, but many were quite delicate, requiring careful handling. Artefacts of all sizes were supported with soft packing material, such as old plastic ice cream containers, and some of the arrows that were [...] "soft like cream cheese" [...] had to be brought up in special styrofoam containers. The airlifts that <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> clay, sand and dirt off-site or to the surface were still used, but with much greater precision since they could potentially disrupt the site. The many layers of sediment that had accumulated on the site could be used to date artefacts in which they were found, and had to be recorded properly. The various types of accretions and remnants of chemicals with artefacts were essential clues to objects that had long since broken down and disappeared, and needed to be treated with considerable care.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a mixed review and rated the episode three out of five. The two praised the scene {{featuring}} the cow getting <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> by the tornado, calling it [...] "really, very funny" [...] and [...] "comic genius", but noted that [...] "a romantic comedy cannot work by flying cows alone." [...] Shearman and Pearson cited casting flaws {{as to why the}} episodes as not able {{to live up to its}} potential. Other reviews were more negative. In a review of the seventh season episode [...] "Brand X", Sarah Kendzior from 11th Hour Magazine cited [...] "The Rain King" [...] as one of the worst episodes of The X-Files. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris heavily criticized the [...] "flying cow" [...] scene—noting that the scene was both [...] "poorly executed" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] for turning the death of a creature into a joke—as well as the final scene, which, according to her, featured a [...] "false pastel sky". Andy Meisler, in The End and the Beginning noted that the episode was poorly received by fans on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|When Grandpa Joe {{sees the}} ticket, he {{jumps out of}} bed and dances with joy. He offers to {{accompany}} Charlie on the tour, but Charlie explains how he was offered money for the ticket and intends to sell it. Grandpa George (David Morris) reminds Charlie that money is far more common than the tickets, and convinces Charlie to keep it. Upon meeting him {{on the day of the}} tour, the visitors find Wonka to be peculiar, lonely and acting odd at the mention of [...] "parents". The tour shows how the fantastical factory operates under the efforts of the short humans called Oompa-Loompas. The other four children succumb to temptation, and end up being caught in the factory workings and have to be safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit in worse shape than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into a river of chocolate and is <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> by a pipe before being rescued from the fudge processing center; Violet expands into an oversized blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum despite Wonka's warning; Veruca is thrown away as a [...] "bad nut" [...] by trained squirrels down the garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk down to a few inches in height after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention. [...] During the tour, Wonka has flashbacks from his childhood where he remembers that he had a troubled relationship with his father, Wilbur. Due to his father being a dentist he was forbidden from candy consumption, but after managing to sneak a taste, he became hooked and later ran away from home to live his dream. He then returned several days later to find his father and home completely gone.|$|E

500|$|While in {{the comics}} Shaw's {{absorption}} power was depicted by having him {{grow up to}} ten times his original size, First Class instead does what company Digital Domain called a [...] "kinetic echo", where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated [...] "iterations" [...] that appear in a short period, to [...] "see [...] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way". According to Dykstra, {{the biggest problem with}} Frost's diamond body was depicting it [...] "without looking like she was made of Jell-o or the polygon model of a human being". The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass, was rotomated into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips. As the character kept on {{going in and out of}} her diamond form, a motion capture tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference. For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way, and the designers added iridescence to [...] "make the wings prettier". The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as Schlieren photography. The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings, concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then match moved into Till's mimed throwing. For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig. Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the [...] "inky smoky effects" [...] used with Nightcrawler, who appeared in X2 and is Azazel's son in the comics. However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke [...] "because he was more closely aligned with the devil". The fire was also used [...] "as a mask to hide or reveal the body", according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson. Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble [...] "a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness" [...] by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with dry ice, which was augmented by computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with [...] "the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca." [...] For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Sloth {{bears are}} expert hunters of termites, which they locate by smell. On {{arriving}} at a mound, they scrape at the structure with their claws till they reach the large combs {{at the bottom of}} the galleries, and disperse the soil with violent puffs. The termites are then <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> through the muzzle, producing a sucking sound which can be heard 180 m away. Their sense of smell is strong enough to detect grubs 3ft below ground. Unlike other bears, they do not congregate in feeding groups. They rarely prey on other mammals. Sloth bears may supplement their diets with fruit and plant matter; in March and April, they eat the fallen petals of mowha trees and are partial to mangoes, sugar cane, jackfruit, and the pods of the golden shower tree. Sloth bears are extremely fond of honey. When feeding their cubs, sows are reported to regurgitate a mixture of half-digested jack fruit, wood apples, and pieces of honeycomb. This sticky substance hardens into a dark yellow, circular, bread-like mass which is fed to the cubs. This [...] "bear's bread" [...] is considered a delicacy by some of India's natives.|$|E
