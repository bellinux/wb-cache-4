However, wild species remain largely unexploited for eggplant breeding.

We characterizated six eggplant accessions, 21 accessions of 12 wild species (the only primary genepool species S. insanum and 11 <b>secondary</b> genepool <b>species)</b> and 45 interspecific hybrids of eggplant with wild species (18 with S. insanum and 27 with <b>secondary</b> genepool <b>species)</b> using 27 conventional morphological descriptors and 20 fruit morphometric descriptors obtained with the phenomics tool Tomato Analyzer. Significant differences were observed among cultivated, wild and interspecific hybrid groups for 18 conventional and 18 Tomato Analyzer descriptors, with hybrids generally having intermediate values. Wild species were generally more variable than cultivated accessions and interspecific hybrids displayed intermediate ranges of variation and coefficient of variation (CV) values, except for fruit shape traits in which the latter were the most variable. The multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) reveals a clear separation of wild species and cultivated accessions. Interspecific hybrids with S. insanum plotted closer to cultivated eggplant, while hybrids with <b>secondary</b> genepool <b>species</b> generally clustered together with wild species. Many differences were observed among wild species for traits of agronomic interest, which allowed identifying species of greatest potential interest for eggplant breeding.

A population assessment was conducted {{during the week of}} June 4, 2007 using 3 gill nets and 8 trap nets. Black Crappies ranged from 7.4 in to 13.0 in, and their numbers were the highest since sampling of the lake has been conducted. Northern Pike ranged from 17.6 in to 30 in. Walleye were also abundant, and 59% of those sampled were 14 in or greater. Most fish from East Graham Lake are safe to eat. However, pregnant women, women who may become pregnant and children under age 15 are advised to refrain from eating walleye more than once per week due to mercury levels. West Graham is primarily managed for walleye with black crappie and channel catfish as <b>secondary</b> <b>species.</b> Walleye fry and fingerlings are stocked in successive years, with the third year left blank.

40|$|Abstract. — The {{issue of}} species {{delimitation}} {{has long been}} confused with that of species conceptualization, leading to a half century of controversy concerning both {{the definition of the}} species category and methods for inferring the boundaries and numbers of species. Alternative species concepts agree in treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the primary defining property of the species category, but they disagree in adopting different properties acquired by lineages during the course of divergence (e. g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, diagnosability, monophyly) as secondary defining properties (<b>secondary</b> <b>species</b> criteria). A unified species concept can be achieved by treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the only necessary property of species and the former <b>secondary</b> <b>species</b> criteria as different lines of evidence (operational criteria) relevant to assessing lineage separation. This unified concept of species has several consequences for species delimitation, including the following: First, the issues of species conceptualization and species delimitation are clearly separated; the former <b>secondary</b> <b>species</b> criteria are no longer considered relevant to species conceptualization but only to species delimitation. Second, all of the properties formerly treated as <b>secondary</b> <b>species</b> criteria are relevant to species delimitation {{to the extent that they}} provide evidence of lineage separation. Third, the presence of any one of the properties (if appropriately interpreted) is evidence for the existence of a species, though more properties and thus more lines of evidence are associated with a higher degree of corroboration. Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, a unified species concept shifts emphasis away from the traditional species criteria, encouraging biologists t...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- The liming {{effects on}} the growth of fifteen woody species of Brazil were {{evaluated}} under glasshouse conditions. The species used belong to different ecologic groups, namely: pioneer, secondary and climax trees. The soil treatments consisted {{in the absence of}} liming (-LIM) and liming sufficient to reach soil pH 6. 0 (+LIM). In general, the pioneer and <b>secondary</b> <b>species</b> presented higher responses in total dry matter production (TDM) to soil liming, whereas the TDM of the climax species were not affected by the soil treatments. Thus, the ranking of species in relation to soil acidity tolerance ranged from highly sensitive to highly tolerant. The pioneer and <b>secondary</b> <b>species</b> growing in limed soil (+LIM) showed higher calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P) contents, and, at the same time lower Ca, Mg utilization efficiency (CaUE and MgUE respectively), whereas the P utilization (PUE) was higher.

40|$|Co-occurring {{foundation}} {{species can}} determine biological community structure via facilitation cascades. We examined the density dependencies of facilitation cascades, including how {{the density of}} a basal foundation species influences the density of <b>secondary</b> foundation <b>species,</b> and how the density of <b>secondary</b> foundation <b>species</b> influences community structure. The system in which we assessed density dependencies was a temperate mangrove forest in which pneumatophores trap the fucoid alga Hormosira banksii and provide substrate for the oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. The alga and oyster in turn determine benthic community structure. In the field, algal biomass {{was positively correlated with}} pneumatophore density. Oysters, by contrast, were highly over-dispersed and correlated with the presence/ absence of pneumatophores. Epifaunal abundance and species richness were positively correlated with algal and oyster abundance, but their effects were independent. The positive effect of pneumatophore density on epifauna was primarily an indirect effect of trapping more algae. Pneumatophores did not directly influence invertebrate communities. Experiments revealed that, at very low pneumatophore densities, algal retention was insufficient to facilitate epifauna above that found on pneumatophores alone. At higher densities, however, increasing the density of pneumatophores increased algal retention, and the density and diversity of associated invertebrates. Shading by the mangrove canopy reduced algal biomass but did not modify the density-dependent nature of the cascade. Our results extend facilitation theory by showing that the density of both basal and <b>secondary</b> foundation <b>species</b> can be critical in triggering facilitation cascades. Our study also reveals that, where foundation species cooccur, multiple, independent cascades may arise from a single basal facilitator. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of density-dependent facilitation cascades in community assembly. 14 page(s...|$|R
