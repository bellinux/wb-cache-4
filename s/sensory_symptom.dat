40|$|SummaryRespiratory symptom {{perception}} {{research has}} focused mainly on respiratory sensations. Because dyspnea is multidimensional, affective aspects should be investigated. Patients with asthma (N= 25) underwent a histamine provocation until a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1). After each dose level, 6 symptoms of dyspnea intensity and 6 symptoms of dyspnea affectivity were rated. Individual perceptual sensitivity was determined by calculating the linear slope between the fall in FEV 1 {{and the increase in}} the total symptom score, and for affective and sensory symptoms separately [Bijl-Hofland, Folgering, van den Hoogen, et al. Perception of bronchoconstriction in asthma patients measured during histamine challenge test. Eur Respir J 1999; 14 : 1049 – 54]. Trait anxiety, baseline state anxiety, daily asthma symptoms and catastrophizing during an asthma exacerbation were also assessed. Sensitivity was unrelated to physiological indices of disease severity (i. e., baseline FEV 1 and histamine dose level at 20 % fall in FEV 1), whereas it was positively related to trait anxiety, state anxiety, daily asthma symptoms and catastrophic thinking during an asthma exacerbation in daily life. These relationships were overall much stronger for affective than for <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> slopes. In stepwise multiple regressions, state anxiety was the best predictor of the affective symptom slopes, whereas catastrophic thinking during an asthma exacerbation was the best predictor for the <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> slopes.

40|$|Maryam Shaygan, 1 Andreas Böger, 2 Birgit Kröner-Herwig 11 Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Göttingen, Germany; 2 Pain Management Clinic at the Red Cross Hospital, Kassel, GermanyBackground: A {{large number}} of {{population-based}} studies of chronic pain have considered neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{to be associated with}} a high level of pain intensity and negative affectivity. The present study examines the question of whether this association previously found in non-selected samples of chronic pain patients can also be found in chronic pain patients with underlying pathology of neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Methods: Neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> in  306  patients with chronic pain diagnosed as typical neuropathic pain, radiculopathy, fibromyalgia, or nociceptive back pain were assessed using the Pain DETECT Questionnaire. Two separate cluster analyses were performed to identify subgroups of patients with different levels of self-reported neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> and, furthermore, to identify subgroups of patients with distinct patterns of neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> (adjusted for individual response bias regarding specific symptoms). Results: ANOVA (analysis of variance) results in typical neuropathic pain, radiculopathy, and fibromyalgia showed no significant differences between the three levels of neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> regarding pain intensity, pain chronicity, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and depressive symptoms. However, in nociceptive back pain patients, significant differences were found for all variables except pain chronicity. When controlling for the response bias of patients in ratings of symptoms, none of the patterns of neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> were associated with pain and psychological factors. Conclusion: Neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> are not closely associated with higher levels of pain intensity and cognitive-emotional evaluations in chronic pain patients with underlying pathology of neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms.</b> The findings are discussed in term of ­differential response bias in patients with versus without verified neuropathic <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> by clinical examination, medical tests, or underlying pathology of disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-I Associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM) is {{a chronic}} myelopathy, and pain has been {{mentioned}} as a frequent <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> in this condition. The authors aimed at analyzing this symptom in a TSP/HAM patients series. METHOD: For this, 46 patients were analyzed considering demographic and clinical characteristics and complaint of pain as to verbal description, time of onset and classification, correlated with the degree of motor disability and type of pain. RESULTS: Among the 46 TSP/HAM patients, 28 (60. 8 %) complained of pain, predominant in the early phase of the disease. Most of the patients exhibited neuropathic characteristics of pain, correlated with increased motor disability. CONCLUSION: Pain in TSP/HAM patients is a frequent and early symptom, and the neuropathic type is predominant (57. 1 %) and paralleled with increased incapacitation.

40|$|Surgical {{outcome for}} {{patients}} suffering from cervical myelopathy (CM) is unpredictable with varying motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> recovery. Previous in-vivo {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) studies of patients surgically treated for CM have demonstrated decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) /creatine levels in the motor cortex indicating reduced neuronal function. The goal of this thesis {{was to determine whether}} absolute NAA changes in the motor and sensory cortices mirror the pattern of motor and sensory functional change observed in patients post surgical treatment. MRS data were acquired on a 3. 0 Tesla Siemens MRI along with clinical outcome measures at baseline, 6 -weeks and 6 -months post-surgery. The results showed that absolute NAA levels declined in both cortices in a similar temporal pattern but opposite in direction to clinical motor and sensory functional recovery. Findings suggest that low NAA levels may be a trigger for functional recovery although the neural mechanisms involved have not been elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Although the DSM- 5 added <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> as a {{criterion}} for ASC, there {{is a group of}} children who display <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> but do not have ASC; children with sensory processing disorder (SPD). To be able to differentiate these two disorders, our aim was to evaluate whether children with ASC show more sensory symptomatology and/or different cognitive styles in empathy and systemizing compared to children with SPD and typically developing (TD) children. The study included 210 participants: 68 children with ASC, 79 with SPD and 63 TD children. The Sensory Processing Scale Inventory was used to measure <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms,</b> the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to measure autistic traits, and the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ) to measure cognitive styles. Across groups, a greater sensory symptomatology was associated with lower empathy. Further, both the ASC and SPD groups showed more <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> than TD children. Children with ASC and SPD only differed on sensory under-reactivity. The ASD group did, however, show lower empathy and higher systemizing scores than the SPD group.

No data regarding the acute effect of low doses of pramipexole have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effect of a low dosage of pramipexole (0. 125 mg) on <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> and motor signs of RLS and on the macro- and microstructure of sleep. METHODS: We initially recruited 13 patients affected by severe idiopathic RLS and included 10 of them in our study. For 2 consecutive nights the selected patients were evaluated. Pramipexole 0. 125 mg was administered before the second night at 9 : 00 p. m. A visual analog scale {{was used to assess}} the <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> of RLS. The motor manifestations of RLS and the architecture of sleep were analyzed by polysomnography. RESULTS: After the acute administration of pramipexole, we observed a significant improvement of the <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> and motor signs of RLS. Several sleep macrostructure and microstructure parameters improved as well.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine cough {{triggers}} in individuals with chronic cough (CC), identify sensory symptoms consistent with central reflex sensitization (paresthesia and allotussia), and interpret this information in relation to sensory laryngeal neuropathy. Study Design: Prospective observational study. Methods: Patients (n = 53) with CC that was refractory to medical management based on the anatomic diagnostic protocol completed questionnaires regarding cough triggers, anxiety and depression, and factors contributing to laryngeal irritation such as vocal hygiene and laryngopharyngeal reflux. Results: An abnormal sensation in the laryngeal area (laryngeal paresthesia) was present in 94 % of people with refractory CC. Nontussive stimuli including phonation were frequent triggers for cough (allotussia), occurring in 71 % of participants. Although tussive stimuli were significantly more potent than nontussive stimuli (P = 0. 005), the relative clinical importance was not statistically different (P = 0. 072). Most participants with refractory cough had poor vocal hygiene. Conclusion: The <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> changes that accompany CC suggest central reflex sensitization and include laryngeal paresthesia and allotussia.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} if systematic variation of the diagnostic terminology embedded within written discharge information (i. e., concussion or mild traumatic brain injury, mTBI) would produce different expected symptoms and illness perceptions. We hypothesized that compared to concussion advice, mTBI advice {{would be associated with}} worse outcomes. Sixty-two volunteers with no history of brain injury or neurological disease were randomly allocated to one of two conditions in which they read a mTBI vignette followed by information that varied only by use of the embedded terms concussion (n = 28) or mTBI (n = 34). Both groups reported illness perceptions (timeline and consequences subscale of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised) and expected Postconcussion Syndrome (PCS) symptoms 6 months post injury (Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, NSI). Statistically significant group differences due to terminology were found on selected NSI scores (i. e., total, cognitive and <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> cluster scores (concussion > mTBI)), but there was no effect of terminology on illness perception. When embedded in discharge advice, diagnostic terminology affects some but not all expected outcomes.

40|$|Tinnitus {{describes}} the subjective {{perception of a}} sound {{despite the absence of}} external stimulation. Being a <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> the majority of studies focusses on the auditory pathway. In the recent years, a series of studies suggested a crucial involvement of the limbic system in the manifestation and development of chronic tinnitus. Regarding cognitive symptoms, several reviews addressed the presence of cognitive impairments in tinnitus as well and concluded that attention and memory processes are affected. Despite the importance for social communication and the reliance on a highly functional auditory system, speech comprehension remains a largely neglected field in tinnitus research. This is why we review here the existing literature on speech and language functions in tinnitus patients. Reviewed studies suggest that speech comprehension is impaired in patients with tinnitus, especially in the presence of competing noise. This is even the case in tinnitus patients with normal hearing thresholds. Additionally, speech comprehension measures seem independent of other measures such as tinnitus severity and perceived tinnitus loudness. According to the majority of authors, the speech comprehension difficulties arise as a result of central processes or dysfunctional neuroplasticity...|$|E

40|$|Painful radiculopathies (RAD) and {{classical}} neuropathic pain syndromes (painful diabetic polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia) show differences how the patients express their sensory perceptions. Furthermore, several clinical trials with neuropathic pain medications failed in painful radiculopathy. Epidemiological and clinical data of 2094 patients with painful radiculopathy were collected within a cross sectional survey (painDETECT) to describe demographic data and co-morbidities and to detect characteristic sensory abnormalities {{in patients with}} RAD and compare them with other neuropathic pain syndromes. Common co-morbidities in neuropathic pain (depression, sleep disturbance, anxiety) do not differ considerably between the three conditions.

Despite similarities in sensory symptoms there are two important differences between RAD and other neuropathic pain disorders: (1) The paucity of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia might be {{explained by the fact that}} the site of the nerve lesion in RAD is often located proximal to the dorsal root ganglion. (2) The distinct sensory profile found in RAD might be explained by compression-induced ectopic discharges from a dorsal root and not necessarily by nerve damage.

The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate RLS prevalence in a large population of MS patients, comparing clinical and MRI findings between patients with and without RLS. Each of the 156 MS patients (100 females, 56 males, mean age 40. 7 +/- 10. 4) enrolled in a prospective study underwent a medical history interview, a neurological examination with the assessment of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and a structured questionnaire to verify the presence and features of RLS. Conventional brain-spinal MRIs of 99 subjects were also evaluated and compared between patients with and without RLS. Fifty-one subjects (32. 7 %) (mean age 43. 8 +/- 12. 8) met the criteria for RLS. In a few patients (8. 5 %), the RLS preceded clinical MS onset, whilst in the remaining cases the RLS was followed by or was simultaneous with clinical MS onset. Comparing the RLS group with the group without RLS, no significant differences were found in MS duration, gender, and referred sleep habits. The primary progressive MS course was more represented in the RLS group, which also showed a higher EDSS score. RLS is a very common finding in MS patients and should be considered amongst the symptomatic RLS forms. RLS is also associated with higher disability...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Conflict between motor-sensory {{central nervous}} {{processing}} {{has been suggested}} as one cause of pain in those conditions where a demonstrable or local nociceptive aetiology cannot be convincingly established (e. g. complex regional pain syndrome type 1, repetitive strain injury, phantom limb pain and focal hand dystonia). The {{purpose of this study}} was to discover whether pain could be induced in pain-free healthy volunteers when this conflict was generated transiently in a laboratory setting. Methods. Forty-one consecutively recruited healthy adult volunteers without a history of motor or proprioceptive disorders performed a series of bilateral upper and lower limb movements whilst viewing a mirror/whiteboard, which created varied degrees of sensory-motor conflict during congruent/incongruent limb movements. A qualitative method recorded any changes in sensory experience. Results. Twenty-seven subjects (66 %) reported at least one anomalous <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> at some stage in the protocol despite no peripheral nociceptive input. The most frequent symptoms occurred when incongruent movement was performed whilst viewing the reflected limb in the mirror condition, the time of maximum sensory-motor conflict. Symptoms of pain were described as numbness, pins and needles, moderate aching and/or a definite pain. Other sensations included perceived changes in temperature, limb weight, altered body image and disorientation. There were indications that some individuals were more susceptible to symptom generation than others. Conclusions. Our findings support the hypothesis that motor-sensory conflict can induce pain and sensory disturbances in some normal individuals. We propose that prolonged sensory-motor conflict may induce long-term symptoms in some vulnerable subjects...|$|E

Total and domain scores from the symptom burden tool and the OSDI were normalized to achieve comparability. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the relationship between domains and subscales. Agreement between the symptom burden tool and OSDI was assessed by Bland-Altman plot.

40|$|Axial {{low back}} pain can be {{considered}} as a syndrome with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain components (mixed-pain). Especially neuropathic pain comprises a therapeutic challenge in practical experience and may explain why pharmacotherapy in back pain is often disappointing for both the patient and the therapist. This survey uses epidemiological and clinical data on the symptomatology of 1083 patients with axial {{low back pain}} from a cross sectional survey (painDETECT). Objectives were (1) to estimate whether neuropathic pain contributes to axial low back pain and if so to what extent. (2) To detect subgroups of patients with typical <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> profiles and to analyse their demographic data and co-morbidities. (3) To compare patients with and without prior intervertebral disc surgery (IVD). Neuropathic pain components could be detected in 12 % of the entire cohort. Cluster analyses of these patients revealed five distinct subgroups of patients showing a characteristic sensory profile, i. e. a typical constellation and combination of symptoms. All subgroups occurred in relevant numbers and some showed distinct neuropathic characteristics while others showed nociceptive features. Post-IVD-surgery patients showed a tendency to score more "neuropathic" than patients without surgery (not statistically significant). Axial low back pain has a high prevalence of co-morbidities with implication on therapeutic aspects. From these data it can be concluded that sensory profiles based on descriptor severity may serve as a better predictor for therapy assessment than pain intensity or sole diagnosis alone. Standardized phenotyping of pain symptoms with easy tools may help to develop an individualized therapy leading to a higher success rate in pharmacotherapy of axial low back pain...|$|E

Guided by the Rugh Model of Psychological Components of Pain, {{an exploration of the}} characteristics of pain experienced by individuals with PD, and the relationships among the emotional, cognitive, perceptual, and behavioral aspects of pain was undertaken. A convenience sample of 125 patients with PD reporting average daily pain as ≥ 2 on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, were recruited for a cross-sectional descriptive survey from two large urban movement disorder centers. Multiple measures were used to assess PD symptoms, depression, attention, beliefs, pain severity, pain interference, quality of pain, and classification of pain symptoms. Multivariable data analyses included descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, and correlational techniques. Results demonstrated the strength of the Rugh Model for an examination of pain as a multidimensional experience in PD. Participants reported over two distinct pain symptoms each, with most symptoms classified as musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, most participants described pain as unrelated to idiopathic PD. Correlations with medium to large effect size supported the Rugh Model with significant relationships among pain severity, pain behavior, pain beliefs, depression, sensory quality of pain, and affective quality of pain. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that 46 % of the variance in Pain Interference was explained by pain severity, depression, and pain beliefs. A significant contribution of the study was the use of the International Association for the Study of Pain scheme for coding chronic pain diagnosis modified with M. A. Lee’s classification of pain in PD. Intervention trials should integrate assessment for depression in concert with effective strategies for pain management. Clinical research on pain in PD needs to move beyond pain as a <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> and examine pain from a biopsychosocial perspective. ...|$|E

Methods: The seven-item {{version of}} painDETECT provides an overall score that targets only sensory symptoms, while the nine-item version adds responses on two items {{to the overall}} score, covering pain course pattern and pain radiation. Both versions have relevance in terms of characterizing broad NeP. The nine- and seven-item versions of painDETECT were administered to subjects with confirmed NeP across six conditions identified during office visits to US community-based physicians. Responses on the <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> items were dichotomized into “at least moderate” (ie, moderate, strongly, very strongly) relative to the combined other responses (never, hardly noticed, slightly). Logistic regression of dichotomized variables on the total painDETECT score provided probabilities of experiencing each symptom across the range of painDETECT scores. Results: Both painDETECT versions discriminated among the symptoms with similar probabilities across the score ranges. Using these data, the probability of moderately experiencing each pain sensory item was estimated for a particular score, providing a pain profile. Additionally, the likelihood of experiencing each sensation was determined for a discrete increase in score, ie, the odds {{of at least a}} moderate sensation of burning (versus less than a moderate sensation) was 1. 29 for a 1 -point increase, 3. 52 for a 5 -point increase, and 12. 42 for every 10 -point increase in the nine-item painDETECT score. Conclusion: painDETECT differentiates pain profiles across the range of scores such that, for a particular score, the probability of experiencing at least a moderate sensation of each symptom was determined and compared. These results can help characterize NeP symptomatology, enrich interpretation of painDETECT scores, and provide a basis for individualizing NeP management.

40|$|Atypical {{responses}} to sensory input are increasingly {{recognized as a}} common feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). These unusual sensory responses have also been found among children with other developmental disabilities (DDs), and research has been mixed regarding the specificity of sensory dysfunction in autism. Furthermore, very {{little attention has been}} given to differences or similarities between Autistic Disorder (AD) and Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) in <b>sensory</b> <b>symptom</b> presentations. Moreover, despite the widespread presence of sensory abnormalities in ASDs, there is a dearth of research regarding the behavioral sequelae of sensory dysfunction in this population. The original Sensory Profile (SP) and the Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP) were utilized for measuring sensory symptoms and yielded factor, section, and quadrant scores. Initially, as quadrant scores have not been explored with a clinic-referred sample, the validity of Dunn 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) quadrant model was examined with a combined sample of clinic-referred children with AD, PDD-NOS, and other DDs, between 18 - 71 months of age. Results provided no support for a quadrant model, instead supporting a one-factor model. Quadrant scores were thus not used in additional analyses. Next, the sensory functioning of three groups of children (AD, PDDNOS, other DDs) was compared. Results were largely unsupportive of sensory dysfunction specificity among children with ASDs relative to the DD group, and no differences were noted between AD and PDD-NOS groups. Finally, the relationship between sensory symptoms and Internalizing/Externalizing Problems scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was investigated for the combined sample, yielding a significant positive relationship. For the SP, Vestibular and Emotionally Reactive scores predicted internalizing behaviors; and Touch and Sensory Seeking scores predicted externalizing behaviors. For the ITSP, Auditory, Tactile, Low Threshold-Context, Avoiding, and Low Registration scores predicted internalizing behaviors; and Tactile, Seeking, and Low Registration scores predicted externalizing behaviors. In conclusion, results supported neither the validity of Dunn 2 ̆ 7 s quadrant model nor the specificity of sensory dysfunction in autism. However, results indicated a link between sensory symptoms and problematic behaviors, with important implications for the multidisciplinary assessment and treatment of children with ASDs and other DDs...|$|E
40|$|Parents {{frequently}} {{report that}} their children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) respond atypically to sensory stimuli. Repetitive behaviors {{are also part of}} the ASD behavioral profile. Abnormal physiological arousal may underlie both of these symptoms. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is an index of sympathetic nervous system arousal. The goals of this study were twofold: (1) to pilot methods for collecting EDA data in young children and (2) to examine hypothesized relationships among EDA, and <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> and repetitive behaviors in children with ASD as compared with children with typical development. EDA was recorded on 54 young children with ASD and on 33 children with typical development (TD) during a protocol that included baseline, exposure to sensory and repetitive stimuli, and play. Parents completed standardized questionnaires regarding their child's <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> and repetitive behaviors. Frequency and type of repetitive behavior during play was coded offline. Comparisons between EDA data for ASD and TD groups indicated no significant between-group differences in any measures. Parents of children with ASD reported more abnormal responses to sensory stimuli and more repetitive behaviors, but scores on these measures were not significantly correlated with EDA or with frequency of observed repetitive behaviors. Parent report of frequency and severity of <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> was significantly correlated with reports of repetitive behaviors in both groups. Although parents of children with ASD report high levels of <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> and repetitive behaviors, these differences are not related to measured EDA arousal or reactivity. © 2014 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Restless legs syndrome/Willis–Ekbom disease (RLS/WED) is {{a common}} sensorimotory {{disorder}} affecting almost 30 % of hemodialysis (HD) patients. RLS/WED induces discomfort during rest hours, and its symptoms have also been observed during HD sessions. Anecdotal reports suggest that cooling the dialysate solution during dialysis could help patients overcome those symptoms and improve restlessness. The aim of this double-blind study was to assess whether a reduction of the dialysate temperature by 1 °C could reduce motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> of RLS/WED occurring during HD. Thirty-two HD patients participated in the study. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: the RLS (N= 16) and the non-RLS groups (N= 16). Patients were studied on two different scenarios for two consecutive HD sessions, 1 week apart: 1) standard temperature of the dialysate (37 °C) and 2) low temperature of the dialysate (36 °C cold dialysis scenario). In all sessions, motor (leg movement per hour of HD [LM/hHD]) and <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> were assessed. The reduction of dialysate temperature by 1 °C was effective in reducing motor symptoms as they assessed the LM/hHD by 36 % only in patients with RLS, while a significant interaction was found between “LM/hHD affected by temperature” and “RLS status” (p = 0. 039). <b>Sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> also reduced by 10 % after the reduction of the dialysate temperature. The reduction of the dialysate temperature by 1 °C reduced motor symptoms by 36 – 54 % and <b>sensory</b> <b>symptoms</b> by 10 % in HD patients with RLS/WED. Cold dialysis could be considered a safe nonpharmacological approach for the amelioration of RLS/WED symptoms occurring during HD...|$|R
