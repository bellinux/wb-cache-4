40|$|This {{document}} is {{a revision of}} the original Mexiacan Hat Remedial Action Plan (RAP) and RAP Modification submitted in July 1988 and January 1989, respectively, along with updated design documents. This RAP has been developed to serve a two-fold purpose. It presents the activities proposed by the Department of Energy (DOE) to accomplish long-term stabilization {{and control of the}} residual radioactive materials (RRM) from Monument Valley, Arizona, and Mexican Hat, Utah, at the Mexican Hat disposal site. It also serves to document the concurrence of both the Navajo Nation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the remedial action. This agreement, upon execution by DOE and the Navajo Nation and concurrence by the NRC, becomes Appendix B of the Cooperative Agreement. This document has been structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the remedial action proposed for the Monument Valley and Mexican Hat sites. It includes specific design and construction requirements for the remedial action. Pertinent information and data are included with reference given to the <b>supporting</b> <b>documents.</b> <b>Section</b> 2. 0 presents the EPA standards, including a discussion of their objectives. Section 3. 0 summarizes the present site characteristics and provides a definition of site-specific problems. Section 4. 0 is the site design for the proposed action. Section 5. 0 presents the water resources protection strategy. Section 6. 0 summarizes the plan for ensuring health and safety protection for the surrounding community and the on- site workers. Section 7. 0 lists the responsibilities of the project participants. Section 8. 0 describes the features of the long-term surveillance and maintenance plan...|$|E

40|$|Entity {{retrieval}} {{finds the}} relevant results for a user’s information needs at a finer unit called “entity”. To retrieve such entity, people usually first locate a small set of <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> which contain answer entities, and then further detect the answer entities in this set. In the literature, people view the <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> as relevant documents, and their findings as a conventional document retrieval problem. In this paper, we will state that finding <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> {{and that of}} relevant documents, although sounds similar, have important differences. Further, we propose a logistic regression approach to find <b>support</b> <b>documents.</b> Our experiment {{results show that the}} logistic regression method performs significantly better than a baseline system that treat the <b>support</b> <b>document</b> finding as a conventional document retrieval problem...|$|R

The information system offers companies and organizations the possibility to gather their product information in a joint database {{in order to increase}} the information availability and distribution.

At the moment, users only have the possibility to add and view documents in the database. By also providing users the possibility to create documents, update document contents, effectively reuse <b>document</b> <b>sections</b> and ease the translation of documents within Assert, the document management will be better facilitated. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a prototype which shows the concept and benefits when providing the possibility to share document contents between several documents. The prototype is developed in C#/WPF and provides a word processor with features to reuse document contents and translation management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Statistical machine {{translation}} of patents requires large a-mounts of sentence-parallel data. Translations of patent text often exist for {{parts of the}} patent document, namely title, abstract and claims. However, there are no direct translations of the largest part of the document, the description or background of the invention. We document a twofold approach for extracting parallel data from all patent <b>document</b> <b>sections</b> from a large multilingual patent corpus. Since language and style differ depending on <b>document</b> <b>section</b> (title, abstract, description, claims) and patent topic (according to the International Patent Classification), we sort the processed data into subdomains in order to enable its use in domain-oriented translation, e. g. when applying multi-task learning. We investigate several similarity metrics and apply them to the domains of patent topic and patent <b>document</b> <b>sections.</b> Product of our research is a corpus of 23 million parallel German-English sentences extracted from the MAREC patent corpus and a descriptive analysis of its subdomains. ...|$|R
