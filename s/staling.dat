25|$|Traditionally {{draught beer}} came from wooden barrels, also called casks. In the 1950s these {{began to be}} {{replaced}} by metal casks of stainless steel or aluminium, mainly for quality reasons as they could be sterilised and the beer was therefore less likely to spoil, but also for economic reasons. An additional benefit of the switch to metal casks was that <b>staling</b> from oxygen in the air could be reduced. Subsequently, in the early 1960s a form of metal cask, known as a keg, was introduced which allowed for more efficient cleaning and filling in the brewery.|$|E

60|$|But I was {{not done}} with Jim and the Cats yet. In 1873 I was lecturing in London, in the Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square, and was living at the Langham Hotel, Portland place. I had no {{domestic}} household, and no official household except George Dolby, lecture-agent, and Charles Warren Stoddard, the California poet, now (1900) Professor of English Literature in the Roman Catholic University, Washington. Ostensibly Stoddard was my private secretary; in reality he was merely my comrade--I hired him {{in order to have}} his company. As secretary there was nothing for him to do except to scrap-book the daily reports of the great trial of the Tichborne Claimant for perjury. But he made a sufficient job out of that, for the reports filled six columns a day and he usually postponed the scrap-booking until Sunday; then he had 36 columns to cut out and paste in--a proper labor for Hercules. He did his work well, but if he had been older and feebler it would have killed him once a week. Without doubt he does his literary lectures well, but also without doubt he prepares them fifteen minutes before he is due on his platform and thus gets into them a freshness and sparkle which they might lack if they underwent the <b>staling</b> process of overstudy.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{no denying}} that she {{commanded}} less attention than at first: the audience had lessened, and, judging by appearances, might soon {{be expected to be}} decidedly thin. In excessive lowness of spirit, Ethelberta translated these signs with the bias that a lingering echo of her mother's dismal words naturally induced, reading them as conclusive evidence that her adventure had been chimerical in its birth. Yet it was very far less conclusive than she supposed. Public interest might without doubt have been renewed after a due interval, some of the falling- off being only an accident of the season. Her novelties had been hailed with pleasure, the rather that their freshness tickled than that their intrinsic merit was appreciated; and, like many inexperienced dispensers of a unique charm, Ethelberta, by bestowing too liberally and too frequently, was destroying the very element upon which its popularity depended. Her entertainment had been good in its conception, and partly good in its execution; yet her success had but little to do with that goodness. Indeed, what might be called its badness in a histrionic sense--that is, her look sometimes of being out of place, the sight of a beautiful woman on a platform, revealing tender airs of domesticity which showed her to belong by character to a quiet drawing-room--had been primarily an attractive feature. But alas, custom was <b>staling</b> this by improving her up to the mark of an utter impersonator, thereby eradicating the pretty abashments of a poetess out of her sphere; and more than one well-wisher who observed Ethelberta from afar feared that it might some day come to be said of her that she had ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Staling</b> is not, as is {{commonly}} believed, simply a drying-out process due to evaporation. Bread will stale {{even in a}} moist environment, and stales most rapidly at temperatures just above freezing. Bread stored in the refrigerator will have increased <b>staling</b> rates, and therefore bread should be kept at room temperature. However, refrigeration delays the growth of mold and extends the shelf life of bread.|$|E

50|$|The largest food {{application}} of lactylates {{is in the}} manufacture of baked goods such as yeast-leavened bakery products. In these systems, lactylates are added to strengthen dough and delay bread <b>staling</b> (i.e. soften the crumb). Dough in commercial bakeries requires some resistance to mechanical abuse and shock to maintain desirable volume in the finished baked good. Dough strengtheners interact with the protein components (e.g. gluten) in the dough. The interactions reinforce the protein network, preventing collapse of the loaf during baking. These additives ensure each loaf of bread conforms to the visual and textural quality expectations of the manufacturer and consumer. Crumb softeners are added to bread to reduce or delay <b>staling</b> of the finished baked good. Bread <b>staling</b> occurs when the starch components form hard crystals. Crumb softeners complex with the starch components, preventing or delaying the formation of starch crystals. Lactylate enriched bread will remain fresh for up to five days after baking. Bread prepared without lactylates begins to stale within one to three days after production.|$|E

50|$|Double {{dropping}}, {{also known}} as the dropping system is a brewing method used for the production of ales. During the early 20th century it was the most popular method of clearing trub (inactive yeast and excess, <b>staling</b> and haze-forming protein from the malted barley) during fermentation for English ales. It is less commonly used today as it requires additional brewing vessels in a two-tier system.|$|E
50|$|Soy flour has 50% {{protein and}} 5% fiber. It has {{higher levels of}} protein, thiamine, riboflavin, phosphorus, calcium, and iron than wheat flour. It does not contain gluten. As a result, yeast-raised breads made with soy flour are dense in texture.

Baking food with soy flour gives it tenderness, moistness, a rich color, and a fine texture.|$|E
50|$|Gluten forms when {{glutenin}} molecules cross-link {{to form a}} submicroscopic network {{attached to}} gliadin, which contributes viscosity (thickness) and extensibility to the mix.

Baking coagulates the gluten, which, along with starch, stabilizes {{the shape of the}} final product. Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the <b>staling</b> of bread, possibly because it binds water through hydration.|$|E
