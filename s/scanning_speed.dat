50|$|On Cold War era radar {{displays}} and before, CRT screen phosphor coatings were chosen {{because of their}} half life. This half life was {{on the order of}} more than ten seconds, or more than one complete rotation of the radar. This meant that the display would show the latest returns from a given object as a bright blip, and older ones as somewhat dimmer dots, as they faded. One might expect three or four such blips on the display, depending on the <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> of the antenna. These produced a series of dots that allowed the operator to easily determine the direction of travel, from the dimmest to brightest blip.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> of an AFM {{is also a}} limitation. Traditionally, an AFM cannot scan {{images as}} fast as an SEM, {{requiring}} several minutes for a typical scan, while an SEM is capable of scanning at near real-time, although at relatively low quality. The relatively slow rate of scanning during AFM imaging often leads to thermal drift in the image making the AFM less suited for measuring accurate distances between topographical features on the image. However, several fast-acting designs were suggested to increase microscope scanning productivity including what is being termed videoAFM (reasonable quality images are being obtained with videoAFM at video rate: faster than the average SEM). To eliminate image distortions induced by thermal drift, several methods have been introduced.|$|E
