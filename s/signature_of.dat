40|$|Current {{and wind}} {{variations}} {{at the ocean}} surface can {{give rise to a}} modulation of the sea surface roughness and thus become visible in radar images. The discrimination between radar <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> oceanic and atmospheric phenomena can be quite difficult, since <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> different origin can have very similar shapes and magnitudes and are often superimposed upon each other. In this work we employ a numerical radar imaging model for an investigation of typical properties <b>of</b> radar <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric convective cells and of theoretical differences between such atmospherically induced radar <b>signatures</b> and those <b>of</b> oceanic phenomena. We show that main characteristics of observed multifrequency/multipolarization radar <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric convective cells over the Gulf Stream are reproduced quite well by the proposed model. This encourages us to vary wind and radar parameters systematically {{in order to get a}} general overview of the dependency of atmospherically induced radar signatures on these parameters. Finally, we compare typical characteristics <b>of</b> radar <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric and oceanic phenomena, and we present simulated radar images of a scenario of superimposed atmospheric convective cells and oceanic internal waves. We show that the proposed model supports the experimental finding that radar <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> oceanic phenomena are stronger at horizontal (HH) than at vertical (VV) polarization, while atmospherically induced radar signatures are better visible at VV polarization...|$|R

5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E

The stars were {{near the end}} of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E
