5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants with bulbs grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male <b>spathe</b> of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|E
50|$|The stem has 2 stem leaves, {{from the}} mid point, upwards, {{and a long}} green, <b>spathes</b> (leaves of the flower bud). The <b>spathes</b> are {{different}} to Iris pseudopumila, which has membranous and curled <b>spathes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The stem has 1-2, (scarious) {{membranous}} or sub-scarious, <b>spathes</b> (leaves of {{the flower}} bud). At flowering time, the <b>spathes</b> become brown and papery, or fully scarious. They can be up to 40 - 80 cm long. 1.5-2 in longThe lower <b>spathes</b> are green and leaf-like.|$|R
50|$|The stem has 2 or more, <b>spathes</b> or bracts (leaves of {{the flower}} bud), they are 3 - 5 cm long. The <b>spathes</b> are green, {{elliptic}} (in shape), and have a purple tinge {{at the base of}} the leaf.|$|R
25|$|It has a 1cm long pedicel (flower stalk), {{which is}} {{shorter than the}} <b>spathe,</b> but similar in size to the ovary.|$|E
25|$|Once female {{anthesis}} {{is nearing}} its {{end and the}} female flowers have been pollinated, the <b>spathe</b> will be fully open and male anthesis begins. In the beginning of male anthesis, the fertile male flowers complete the process of producing the pollen and the female flowers become unreceptive to further pollination. Additionally, the spadix moves from its 45° position and presses up flush to the <b>spathe.</b> Towards the end of male anthesis, the <b>spathe</b> begins to close from the bottom, working its way up and forcing the beetles to move up and across the upper region of the <b>spathe,</b> where the fertile male flowers are located. In doing so, the philodendron controls when the beetles come and when they leave and forces them to rub against {{the top of the}} spadix where the pollen is located as they exit, thus ensuring they are well-coated with pollen. One would expect the beetles to stay indefinitely if they could due to the very favorable conditions the inflorescence provides. After male anthesis, the males will go off and find another philodendron undergoing female anthesis, so will pollinate the female flowers with the pollen it had collected from its previous night of mating.|$|E
25|$|Botanically, {{the fruit}} {{produced}} is a berry. The berries develop {{later in the}} season; berry development time varies from species to species from {{a few weeks to}} a year, although most philodendrons take a few months. The <b>spathe</b> will enlarge to hold the maturing berries. Once the fruit are mature, the <b>spathe</b> will begin to open again, but this time it will break off at the base and fall to the forest floor. Additionally, the berries are edible, although they contain calcium oxalate crystals, and have a taste akin to bananas.|$|E
50|$|The stems have 3 <b>spathes</b> (leaves of {{the flower}} bud), which are narrow and are acuminated (ending in a sharp point), {{and they have a}} hyaline (clear and translucent) or {{membranous}} margin. The <b>spathes</b> have a small peduncle (stalk) that are between 1.2 - 2.5 cm long.|$|R

Compared to Iris ventricosa, it has {{parallel}} veins on the <b>spathes,</b> instead of being reticulate.|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is achieved by}} means of beetles, with many philodendron species requiring {{the presence of a}} specific beetle species to achieve pollination. The reverse is not always the case, as many beetle species will pollinate more than one philodendron species. These same beetles could also pollinate other genera outside of philodendron, as well as outside of the family Araceae. The pollinating beetles are males and members of the subfamily Rutelinae and Dynastinae, and to date the only beetles seen to pollinate the inflorescence are in the genera Cyclocephala or Erioscelis. Other smaller types of beetles in the genus Neelia visit the inflorescences, as well, but they are not believed to be involved in pollinating philodendrons. To attract the beetles, the sterile male flowers give off pheromones to attract the male beetles, usually at dusk. This process, female anthesis, is followed by male anthesis, in which the pollen is produced. Female anthesis typically lasts up to two days, and includes the gradual opening of the <b>spathe</b> to allow the beetles to enter. Some evidence suggest the timing of opening of the <b>spathe</b> is dependent on light levels, where cloudy, darker days result in the <b>spathe</b> opening up earlier than on clear days. During female anthesis, the spadix will project forward at roughly 45° relative to the <b>spathe.</b>|$|E

25|$|Pollination of {{the female}} fruits is {{conducted}} in late February and beginning of March which is, according to the Coptic calendar still used for agricultural purposes by the Manasir, {{the end of the}} month Amshir. During this season the stout male spathes split and their inflorescences reach maturity. Fresh strands of flowers are carefully picked out of the male clusters and packaged to strands of two called Rabetah Qaru'ah (ربطة قرعة). The Manasir consider the variety of a potent male seedling irrelevant and pollinate all their female inflorescences from the same male tree. The process of pollination is called Qaffes (قفّز) and can be carried out by any person physically able to climb the palm tree. In each <b>spathe</b> of female inflorescence about 8-15 packages are tucked between the fruit bearing spikelets. An adult female palm produces around 15 to 25 spathes, each <b>spathe</b> containing 150 to 200 date bearing spikelets.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was first}} {{collected}} by Ivo Trinajstić on 1 May 1973, {{and then it}} was first published and described in 'Biosistematika' (Journal) Vol.2 (Issue 1) on page 71 in 1976. Trinajstić had called the plant, a separate species to Iris pallida, due to the difference in <b>spathes.</b> Iris pallida has silvery white <b>spathes</b> while Iris illyrica and Iris pseudopallida have <b>spathes</b> that have a dirty pale rusty tint. [...] Also in 1991, Nikolic & Mitic found that {{the size and shape of}} epidermal cells and stoma, was another difference between the 2 species, but these could be down to habitat effects.|$|R

25|$|The <b>spathe</b> {{provides}} a safe breeding {{area for the}} beetles. As such, the male beetles are often followed by female beetles {{with the intent of}} mating with the males within the <b>spathe.</b> The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the <b>spathe</b> covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process and thus providing philodendrons a means of sexual reproduction. In addition to gaining a safe location to mate, the male beetles may benefit from having a central location, because it allows them to broadcast to females that they are willing and able to mate. Females which see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate know that they can find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because {{they do not have to}} produce pheromones to attract females, since the philodendrons do it for them. Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females, which is not necessarily certain otherwise. In doing so, the philodendron provides male beetles a more efficient way to find females than what they could achieve on their own. Interestingly, pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. In addition to the reproductive benefits to beetles, the philodendrons provide food in two forms. Pollen from the fertile male flowers is eaten by the beetles throughout the night. Secondly, the sterile male flowers consumed by the beetles are rich in lipids.|$|E
500|$|Gardens in {{the upper}} park area include Longfellow Gardens, Minnehaha Falls Pergola Garden, and the Song of Hiawatha Garden. The lower glen area offers {{examples}} of a surprisingly large number of trees that are native to Minnesota including basswood, black ash, maples, oaks, willows, and cottonwoods. [...] Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, skunk cabbage, often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground. [...] As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the <b>spathe</b> that is 15–35 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly. [...] As the <b>spathe</b> dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer. Other wild flowers include wild ginger, trout lilies, anemones, marsh marigold and various ferns and sedges. [...] The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is working to remove invasive species that have been introduced into the park {{in order to promote}} a healthy environment so that native species may survive and grow.|$|E

2500|$|When philodendrons {{are ready}} to reproduce, they will produce an {{inflorescence}} which consists of a leaf-like hood called a <b>spathe</b> within which is enclosed a tube-like structure called a spadix. Depending on the species, a single inflorescence can be produced or a cluster of up to 11 inflorescences can be produced at a single time on short peduncles. The <b>spathe</b> tends to be waxy and is usually bicolored. In some philodendrons, the colour of {{the base of the}} <b>spathe</b> contrasts in colour with the upper part, and in others, the inner and outer surfaces of the <b>spathe</b> differ in coloration. The paler colour tends to be either white or green, and the darker usually red or crimson. Pelargonidin is the predominant pigment causing the red coloration in the spathes. The upper portion of the <b>spathe</b> is called the limb or blade, while the lower portion is called the convolute tube or chamber due to its tubular structure at the base. The spadix is more often than not white and shorter than the <b>spathe.</b> On the spadix are found fertile female, fertile male, and sterile male flowers. The fertile male and female flowers are separated on the spadix by a sterile zone or staminodal region composed of sterile male flowers. This barrier of sterile male flowers ensures [...] fertile male flowers do not fertilize the female flowers. The arrangement tends to be vertical, with fertile male flowers {{at the top of the}} spadix followed by sterile male flowers, and fertile female flowers very close to the bottom in the region known as the <b>spathe</b> tube or chamber. In some philodendrons, an additional region of sterile male flowers is found at the very top of the spadix. The fertile female flowers are often not receptive to fertilization when the fertile males are producing pollen, which again prevents self-pollination. The pollen itself is thread-like and appears to project out from the region where the fertile male flowers are located.|$|E
2500|$|Hybridizing philodendrons {{is quite}} easy if {{flowering}} plants are available, {{because they have}} very few barriers to prevent hybridization. However, some aspects of making crosses can make philodendron hybridization more difficult. Philodendrons often flower at different times and {{the time when the}} <b>spathe</b> opens up varies from plant to plant. The pollen and the inflorescence both have short lives, which means a large collection of philodendrons is necessary if crossbreeding is to be done successfully. The pollen life can be extended to a few weeks by storing it in film canisters in a refrigerator. [...] Artificial pollination is usually achieved by first mixing the pollen with water. A window is then cut into the <b>spathe</b> and the water-pollen mixture is rubbed on the fertile female flowers. The entire <b>spathe</b> is then covered in a plastic bag so the water-pollen mixture does not dry out; the bag is removed a few days later. If the inflorescence has not been fertilized, it will fall off, usually within a few weeks.|$|E

50|$|The stem has green, glaucous, (scarious) membranous, <b>spathes</b> (leaves of {{the flower}} bud).|$|R
2500|$|Some philodendrons {{are also}} used for {{ceremonial}} purposes. Among the Kubeo tribe, native to Colombia, Philodendron insigne is used by witch doctors [...] to treat ill patients. They use the juice of the <b>spathe</b> to stain their hands red, since many such tribes view the color red {{as a sign of}} power.|$|E
2500|$|The male beetles {{will stay}} {{overnight}} in the <b>spathe,</b> eating and mating throughout the night due to the benefits provided by the <b>spathe</b> and spadix. Typically, five to 12 beetles will be within the <b>spathe</b> throughout the night. Rarely, cases of 200 beetles at a time have been observed and almost always the beetles are of the same species. Another interesting feature of this symbiotic relationship, less well understood, is the series of events in which the spadix begins to heat up prior to the <b>spathe</b> opening up for the beetles. This process is known as thermogenesis. By the time the <b>spathe</b> is open and the beetles have arrived, the spadix is usually quite hot; up to around 46°C in some species, but usually around 35°C. [...] The thermogenesis coincides {{with the arrival of}} the beetles and appears to increase their presence. The maximum temperature reached by the spadix remains about 20°C higher than the outside ambient temperature. The time dependence of the temperature can vary from species to species. In some species, the temperature of the spadix will peak on the arrival of the beetles, then decrease, and finally increase reaching a maximum once again when the philodendron is ready for the beetles to leave. Other species, though, only show a maximum temperature on the arrival of the beetles, which remains roughly constant for about a day, and then steadily decreases. A few species will show three peaks in temperature during the flowering. The increased temperature increases the metabolism of the beetles, causing them to move about more within the <b>spathe</b> and increasing the likelihood they will be sufficiently coated with pollen. A sticky resin is also produced in drops attached to the spadix which help to keep the pollen attached to the beetles. This resin producing quality is unique to Philodendron and Monstera, as other genera of Araceae do not produce it on their spadices. The resin is also found on the stems, leaves, and roots of philodendrons. Its color can be red, orange, yellow, or colorless when it is first produced. Yet, over time, it will turn brown as it is exposed to air. Also, some evidence suggests the thermogenesis triggers the beetles to mate. It also appears to distribute the pheromones into the air. The reason for the spadix being held at 45° relative to the <b>spathe</b> may be to maximize the heat's ability to waft the pheromones into the air. Oxidizing stored carbohydrates and lipids has been found to be the energy source for thermogenesis. The part of the spadix that heats up is the sterile zone. As it heats up, carbohydrates are used, but once the spadix has reached its maximum temperature, lipids are oxidized. The lipids are not first converted to carbohydrates, but rather are directly oxidized. The thermogenic reaction is triggered when concentrations of acetosalicytic acid form in the sterile zone. The acid sets off the mitochondria in the cells that make up the sterile zone to switch to an electron transport chain called the cyanide-resistant pathway, which results in the production of heat. Philodendrons consume oxygen during thermogenesis. The rate at which oxygen is used is remarkably high, close to that of hummingbirds and sphinx moths. The spadix has been shown to generate infrared radiation. As the beetles home in on the inflorescence, they first move in a zig-zag pattern until they get reasonably close, when they switch to a straight-line path. [...] The beetles may be using scent to find the inflorescence when they are far away, but once within range, they find it by means of the infrared radiation. This would account for the two different types of paths the beetles follow.|$|E
2500|$|I. orjenii appears {{somewhat}} intermediate, {{in height}} of stem, colour {{of flowers and}} consistence of spathes. The shape of the tepals is different from I. pseudopallida but {{similar to those of}} I. reichenbachii var. bosniaca. The <b>spathe</b> dries out before or during flowering time, getting white to slightly brownish, sometimes with a violet teint, a diagnostic feature for the whole Pallida series, whereas in I. reichenbachii the <b>spathe</b> is sharpely keeled and stays completely green until flowering period is over. Shape of seed, a character regarded to be of high diagnostic value reveals similarity to those of Iris cengialti and Iris illyrica, both closely related to I. pseudopallida, but striking dissimilarities to the latter, which has compressed seeds. Seeds of I. reichenbachii are described to be similar to those of I. orjenii. Shape and undulation of falls and standards are much more similar to I. reichenbachii, whereas no white flowered individuals from wild population of this species have been reported.|$|E

40|$|I {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} deceptive pollination system of Jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisama triphyllum, Araceae) in forests of west-central Indiana. I focused on (a) determining the identities and abundances of insect visitors to <b>spathes,</b> (b) evaluating the success of female <b>spathes</b> in setting fruit, (c) determining the relative importance of pollinator visitation and plant size for fruit number, and (d) investigating the function of the female <b>spathe’s</b> lack of an exit hole, which has been hypothesized to improve pollination success. I found that (a) Jack-in-the-pulpit receives visits from both flies and thrips. Counts of fly corpses from <b>spathes</b> showed the most prevalent families to be Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae with other nematoceran families and a few brachyceran families present as well. Visitation by thrips, determined by visual inspection of <b>spathes,</b> was low, involving only 30 % of plants. (b) Fifty-seven percent of female plants set fruit, with much variation among sites. (c) Mushroom flies, especially the families Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae, were found to be the primary pollinators of Jack-in-thepulpit based on pollen loads, visit rates, and an exclusion experiment. Pollination by thrips, though possible, probably had only a minor effect. (d) An experiment that created an exit hole in female <b>spathes</b> yielded no support for the hypothesis that lack of an exit hole (the natural condition) improves fruit set. Joseph L.
