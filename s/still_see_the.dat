The setup {{consisted of a}} main stage with three elevators and a turntable (which rose and lowered), a central runway with LED and strobe lights connected to a central stage with a LED view screen in the construction and an elevator. The two secondary runways were raised up into the stands and also had view screens inside the construction. Two projection screens were raised above the audience so those who couldn't get {{a clear view of}} the stage could <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> performance. There were also 3 LED screens that moved around during the performance, including one semicircular transparent screen lowered onto the stage during the video interludes.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century, Hellfire Clubs {{sprung up}} in Britain and Ireland. Though {{activities}} varied between the clubs, {{some of them were}} very pagan, and included shrines and sacrifices. Dionysus {{was one of the most}} popular deities, alongside deities like Venus and Flora. Today one can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> statue of Dionysus left behind in the Hellfire Caves.|$|E

25|$|In some {{versions}} of the story, the hill is Penshaw Hill, that on which the Penshaw Monument now stands, but locally the credit goes to the nearby Worm Hill, in Fatfield.

It is said that one can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> marks of the worm on Worm Hill.|$|E
25|$|The Meenakshi Temple, {{destroyed}} by the Mohammedans was re-constructed in 1569.

The statue is still periodically crowned with garlands by modern worshippers. He lived until 1600 and had great influence upon the fate of the Nayaka dynasty until his death.|$|E
25|$|After the Indians left, {{a farmer}} plowed {{much of the}} {{clearing}} at Big Indian Farm. For decades people dug in the burial mounds. But much of the surrounding area, including Little Indian Farm, remains largely as the Indians left it a hundred years ago. You can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> burial mounds, the outlines of cabins, {{the shape of the}} dance ring, and in the surrounding woods you may run across man-made mounds which must have been garden beds.|$|E

25|$|Those who {{witnessed}} the apparition stood in the pouring rain {{for up to two}} hours reciting the Rosary, a series of traditional Catholic prayers. When the apparition began there was good light, but although it then became very dark, witnesses could <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> figures very clearly – they appeared to be the colour of a bright whitish light. The apparition did not flicker or move in any way. The witnesses reported that the ground around the figures remained completely dry during the apparition although the wind was blowing from the south. Afterwards, however the ground at the gable became wet and the gable dark.|$|E
25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
25|$|Parres el Guarda {{was founded}} {{in the middle of}} the 19th century as a rail town, when the line {{connecting}} Mexico City and Cuernavaca was built. Parres was an important stop for both passengers and freight along this line. The community was founded on lands that belonged to the Juan de las Fuentes Parres Hacienda, giving the town its name. Today, one can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ruins of the old hacienda main house. Its economy currently is based on the cultivation of animal feed and is an important producer of this product. It is also known for the sheep meat which is most often used in the preparation of barbacoa in the Mexico City area. Its patron saint is the Virgin of Guadalupe, celebrated on 12 December traditionally with the Chinelos dance, fireworks, cockfights and more.|$|E

25|$|The {{dominant}} power(s) of {{the world}} is/are fluid, the initial period of US unilateralism can be loosely pinpointed to their interventions during the world wars. Following this period of rising US dominance on the world stage, “there have been no shortage of people who, from {{the rise of the}} USSR’s space programme in the 1950s, through to the third world revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam, Iran and elsewhere, and to the emergence of Japan, Europe and now China as major economic powers, have predicted that US dominance, predominance, hegemony or, in more recent, post-Cold War terms, ‘unipolarity’, are ebbing away.” The predictions of these individuals represent the fluidity of power over time, through the idea that, during the period where the US was unequivocally dominant, people could <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> inevitable future, of a change in power and authority, on the world stage.|$|E
500|$|When {{she retired}} from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory {{returned}} to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and demesne at Coole Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy. Her Galway home had long been {{a focal point for}} the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother Jack, George Moore, Seán O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw, Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: [...] "The Wild Swans at Coole", [...] "I walked among the seven woods of Coole", [...] "In the Seven Woods", [...] "Coole Park, 1929" [...] and [...] "Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931".|$|E
500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E

500|$|Alongside his {{intellectual}} pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As {{a small boy}} {{he had begun to}} visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: [...] "The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren... I can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. [...] "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in Korea was training {{a new group of}} animators, and this episode was one of their first efforts. Show runner Mike Reiss said he will always remember it as the episode [...] "that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess." [...] Reardon said there was [...] "literally a mistake in every other scene" [...] when the episode came back from Korea. Several scenes had to be re-animated in the United States because of these glitches, but according to Reardon, [...] "you can <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lesser ones that got through, such as line quality problems particularly in the first act." [...] Though it aired in season three, [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] was produced during the previous season. It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end, and was scheduled to air in autumn that year. The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Mr.Mr {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares from AllMusic labelled the EP [...] "a set of songs that offers something for {{every kind of}} Girls' Generation and expands their musical reach." [...] Phares further praised the EP for helping the group to be an outstanding case of Korean popular music. Writing for Billboard, Jeff Benjamin named the six songs of the EP [...] "strong" [...] and called it a more [...] "impressive effort" [...] compared to the group's 2013 album I Got a Boy. He also deemed the track list [...] "a tight bundle of songs that <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> group dipping and experimenting into new sonic territory, but possibly more focused than ever." [...] Benjamin also wrote an article for Fuse, on which he complimented the album's musical styles as [...] "short, sweet, but strong." [...] On the other hand, Kim Do-heon from online magazine IZM compared the EP to the group's 2011 album The Boys for its [...] "balance of musical competence and appeal to mass popularity", but found the songs to be inadequate. He concluded that the group needed to [...] " [...] a clear direction for the future" [...] after the [...] "mistake" [...] of I Got a Boy, and Mr.Mr was not the answer.|$|E
