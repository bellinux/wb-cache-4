5000|$|When a monomer adds to {{a radical}} chain end, {{there are two}} factors to {{consider}} regarding its stereochemistry: 1) {{the interaction between the}} terminal chain carbon and the approaching monomer molecule and 2) the configuration of the penultimate repeating unit in the polymer chain.

There are two ways that a monomer molecule can approach the terminal carbon: the mirror approach (with like substituents on the same side) or the non-mirror approach (like substituents on opposite sides). If free rotation does not occur before the next monomer adds, the mirror approach will always lead to an isotactic polymer and the non-mirror approach will always lead to a <b>syndiotactic</b> <b>polymer</b> (Figure 25).

The metal-mediated coordination polymerization of three representative polar divinyl monomers, including vinyl methacrylate (VMA), allyl methacrylate (AMA), and N,N-diallyl acrylamide (DAA) by Cs-ligated zirconocenium ester enolate catalysts under ambient conditions exhibits complete chemoselectivity and high stereoselectivity, thus producing the corresponding vinyl-functionalized polymers with high (92 % rr) to quantitative (> 99 % rr) syndiotacticity.

When these associations are stacks of alternating (R) and (S) molecules (as in <b>syndiotactic</b> <b>polymers)</b> this can be accomplished very efficiently.

50|$|Natta {{first used}} {{polymerization}} catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity {{to a special}} feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in {{the picture on the}} left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −CH2−CHR−, like the CH3 groups in the figure. In the isotactic polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration. The stereogenic centers in <b>syndiotactic</b> <b>polymers</b> alternate their relative configuration. A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic. Both isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene are crystalline, whereas atactic polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler-Natta catalysts, is amorphous. The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.|$|R

40|$|The chain {{conformation}} and {{the crystal}} packing of syndiotactic poly(4 -methyl- 1 -pentene) {{have been studied}} by solid state C- 13 NMR cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CPMAS) spectroscopy. The presence in the CPMAS spectrum of two distinct resonances separated by approximate to 5 ppm (one gamma-gauche effect) for the methyl carbons indicates that the two methyl carbons belonging to the monomeric unit are nonequivalent. This has been explained {{on the basis of}} the conformation of the lateral groups proposed in the literature. A single resonance of the backbone methylene carbons, although broad and with various shoulders, is present. The absence of the splitting of approximate to 10 ppm for this resonance, typical of other <b>syndiotactic</b> <b>polymers</b> having TTGG helical conformation, like polypropylene and poly(1 -butene), is still fully consistent with the helical TTGG conformation of the chains of syndiotactic poly(4 -methyl- 1 -pentene), since the conformational assignment of the lateral groups makes the two methylene carbons in conformational environments TG. GT and GT. GT, nearly equivalent. The narrow splitting of the resonance of the backbone methine carbons indicates that the helical TTGG conformation of the chains, approximately described with a s(12 / 7) 2 symmetry, should be better described with a complex nonuniform helix with slightly different values of the backbone torsion angles of different structural units. In this nonuniform helix, backbone methine carbons of different structural units are nonequivalent since they experience different amounts of the gamma-gauche shielding effect resulting in the asymmetric splitting of the corresponding resonance. Both resonances of the methyl carbons present narrow splittings, which can be traced back to packing effect.

40|$|Rh-mediated {{polymerization}} of carbenes gives {{access to}} new highly substituted and stereoregular polymers. While this reaction {{is of interest}} for the synthesis of <b>syndiotactic</b> <b>polymers</b> that are functionalized at every carbon atom of the polymer backbone, the catalyst activation, chain-initiation, and chain-termination processes were so far poorly understood. In this publication we present new information about these processes {{on the basis of}} detailed end-group analyses, dilution-kinetic studies, and a comparison of the activity of well-defined catalysts containing a preformed Rh-C bond. All data point toward complex catalyst activation processes under the applied reaction conditions. The use of well-defined RhI(cod) -alkyl, aryl, and allyl complexes does not lead to better initiation efficiencies or higher polymer yields. MALDI-ToF MS of the oligomeric fractions indicates that during the incubation time of the reaction, the precatalysts are first transformed into oligomer forming species with a suppressed tendency toward β-hydrogen elimination, and accordingly a shift to saturated oligomeric chains that are terminated by protonolysis. Further catalyst modifications lead to a shift from atactic oligomerization to stereoregular high molecular weight polymerization activity. Dilution-kinetic studies reveal that under diluted conditions two different active species operate that differ largely in their chain-termination behavior. Analysis of the reaction products by MALDI-ToF MS also allows conclusions about chain-initiation and chain-termination. Chain-initiation can occur by insertion of a preformed carbene into a Rh-ligand or Rh-hydride bond or by (internal or external) nucleophilic attack of water and/or alcohol on a Rh-carbene moiety. Chain-termination takes place mainly by (nucleophilic) protonolysis involving water or alcohols, while β-H elimination plays only a minor role and is only observed for the shorter oligomers. The detection of ethoxy and hydroxyl end-groups demonstrates the importance of trace amounts of water and ethanol toward chain-initiation. Alcohols further function as a chain-transfer agent, and increasing the alcohol concentration accelerates the chain-transfer process (which remains however relatively slow compared to chain-propagation). On the basis of the chemical properties of the alcohols, we propose a chain-transfer mechanism involving nucleophilic attack of the alcohol (nucleophilic, σ-bond metathesis type, protonolysis). This further allows us to draw some (careful) new conclusions about the oxidation state of the actual polymerization species...|$|R

The project CUSTOM, funded by the European Commission within the FP 7, deals with stand alone portable sensing apparatus based on multiple techniques, integrated in a complex system with a complimentary approach. The objective of the project is to achieve an optimum trade-off between opposite requirements: compactness, simplicity, low cost, sensitivity, low false alarm rate and selectivity. The final goal is the realization of an optical sensing platform able to detect traces of drug precursors compounds, such as ephedrine, safrole, acetic anhydride and the Benzyl Methyl Keton (BMK). This is reached by implementing two main sensing techniques: the fluorescence enhanced by the use of specially developed Organic macro-molecules, and a spectroscopic technique in Mid-IR optical range. The fluorescence is highly selectivewith respect to the target compounds, because it is based on properly engineered fluorescent proteins which are able to bind the target analytes, as it happens in an 'immune-type' reaction.

It has been also found that the chiral optical cocrystalline phase of s-PS with azulene exhibits a monoclinic δ-clathrate form with equal proportions of left- and right-handed helices.

By in-situ X-ray studies performed at elevated pressure-temperature, we show that, for the first time, form II can be also obtained on cooling the isotropic melt at high pressures. When investigated by NMR, the form II thus obtained is found to be free from conformational defects. We observed that above 1. 5 kbar the melting temperature of form II is higher than that of form I. This is in contradiction to the melting behavior of the two different forms below 1. 5 kbar; that is, the melting temperature of form II (crystallized at pressures greater than 1. 5 kbar) is found to be always lower than for form I below 1. 5 kbar. On cooling from the isotropic melt, below 1. 5 kbar, the sample crystallizes in the ordered form I.

Diffraction and NMR data are consistent with the idea that a single crystalline polymorph prevails in the studied samples. The solid-state NMR results allow us to exclude the all-trans (T 4) conformation for cis- 1, 2 syndiotactic polypentadiene and indicate a nonuniform helix of the T 2 G 2 type as most plausible, although other possibilities such as the (T 6 G 2 T 2 G 2) conformation cannot be completely ruled out.

Nevertheless, {{in the presence of a}} stoichiometric amount of methylaluminoxane (MAO), they were able to polymerize 1, 3 -butadiene and substituted 1, 3 -butadienes such as isoprene, (E) - 1, 3 -pentadiene, (E) - 1, 3 -hexadiene, and (E) - 3 -methyl- 1, 3 -pentadiene. Specifically, 1 /MAO gave predominantly <b>syndiotactic</b> 1, 2 <b>polymers</b> from 1, 3 -butadiene and terminally substituted 1, 3 -butadienes (e. g., 1, 3 -pentadiene and 1, 3 -hexadiene), but it was practically not active in the polymerization of internally substituted 1, 3 -butadienes (e. g., isoprene and 3 -methyl- 1, 3 -pentadiene); 2 /MAO and 3 /MAO exhibited instead an opposite behavior, giving predominantly isotactic 1, 2 polymers from 3 -methyl- 1, 3 -pentadiene, and showing very low activity in the polymerization of 1, 3 -butadiene, 1, 3 -pentadiene and 1, 3 -hexadiene. The results obtained are interesting from the mechanistic point of view, and some hypotheses to explain this particular behavior were formulated...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{chemistry}} of poly(lactic acid) was carried out {{with a focus on}} techniques and applications of PLA polymer and copolymers with reference to some of the work that has been accomplished over the last 20 years or so. A {{review of the}} characterisation techniques used to analyse PLA polymers and copolymers was also carried out giving reference to the equipment and methods used herein. 	An investigation into the potential of PLA as the hydrophilic portion of a polymeric surfactant was carried out. To develop PLA based surfactants, the ring opening polymerisation of lactide was carried out in a melt {{in the presence of a}} long chain alcohol (C₇ to C₂₀) or diol (C₄ & C₆) to produce AB or ABA type polymers that follow the traditional surfactant template. Stannous octanoate and 4 -dimethylaminopyridine were typically used as catalysts due to their high activity and relative cheapness. PLA only shows good hydrophilicity with up to 12 lactic acid units in the chain. Above this the electrostatic interactions between polymer chains reduced water solubility. It was also noted that D,L-lactide produced more water soluble <b>polymers</b> (<b>syndiotactic)</b> than the enantiomerically pure L-lactide (isotactic polymer chains). 	An investigation of the hydrophobic properties of PLA was carried out to evaluate their usefulness for other biodegradable surfactant applications. To this end an investigation of sugars as the hydrophilic portion of the molecule was carried out. Due to problems with solubilising sugars, they were deemed unsuitable for use as initiatiors within the scope of this research. Choline chloride was then investigated as a potential hydrophilic initiator and indeed has produced some of the most water soluble of PLA polymers. Choline chloride presented several challenges as an initiator, its high melting point resulted in polar solvents such as t-butanol being employed. Alternatively, more success was achieved by preparation of a choline chloride eutectic mixture prior to the polymerisation. It was discovered that a choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture was capable of self initiation, thus required no further addition of catalyst, this result shows a potential step forward in PLA green chemistry. A final investigation into producing surface-active PLA in a one-pot process that required only a hydroxycarboxylate initiator was carried out. The production of PLA sodium or potassium salts was carried out in a melt polymerisation and the results show some promise. Initiators that have been employed include a range of a, b and g-hydroxycarboxylic acids. These work through tautomerisation to the alkoxide, which then initiates a living type polymerisation of lactide to produce surface-active polymers. As well as the synthesis of these polymers some analysis of the physical and aqueous properties of these materials was carried out. PLA sodium salts were shown to have reasonable surfactant ability (45 mNm⁻¹) and low CMC values of around 5 x 10 ⁻⁹ mol cm⁻³. They were also shown to have some properties as emulsifiers, and in some cases showed non-Newtonian fluid behaviour such as shear-thinning (thixotropy) and shear-thickening (dilatant). The thermal characteristics of the polymers such as T[subscript]g and stability were assessed as well as their ability to retain water...|$|R
