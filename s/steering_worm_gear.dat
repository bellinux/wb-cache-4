40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} process sequence {{of a power}} <b>steering</b> <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> blank is analyzed. The conventional process sequence for manufacturing power assisted steering (PAS) part contains three distinctive operational stages such as indentation, extrusion, and upsetting, which were originally designed by forming equipment experts. Process conditions such as reduction in area, semi die angle and upsetting ratio are carefully considered to prevent from internal or geometrical defects. The simulation results of the conventional forging process are summarized in terms of deformation patterns, load-stroke relationships and die pressures along the interface for each operational stage. Close investigation of simulation results for current forming process leads to a new process sequence in which the number of operation are reduced into just one operation. Comparisons between the existing and proposed processes are made in terms of maximum force requirement, required forming energy, and process time, respectively. Experiment has been performed {{to confirm that the}} proposed process could be applied to replace the existing conventional process sequence and proved the new process to be a safe process sequence for manufacturing PAS part...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Worm</b> <b>gear</b> {{is usually}} made of bronze, {{which is a}} {{precious}} and nonferrous metal. In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed. Compared with <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of bronze, <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material has made <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission possess many advantageous properties. In order to bring the excellent properties of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73). Archimedes <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> has the same anti-fracture capacity as arc tooth <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material. Macrographic analysis shows that load concentration and contact stress concentration of bolt hole caused by bending bolt are significant factors which affect invalidation of <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> The test result shows an important fact that overlapping coefficient of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is much higher than that of calculating in theory, for small modulo of elasticity has a good effect upon the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R
