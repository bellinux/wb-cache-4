We investigated how soil tillage and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> influenced the parasitism rates of pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.) larvae at 8 different spatial scales (from 250 to 2000 m radius circular sectors) in 42 oilseed rape (OSR) fields. We used multimodel inference approaches to identify and rank the influence of soil tillage and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> on parasitism rates, and to quantify the importance of each scale. Parasitism rates were due to three univoltine parasitoid species (Tersilochus heterocerus, Phradis morionellus and P. interstitialis) and varied from 0 to 98 %. We found that both fine and large scales contributed to explain significantly parasitism rates, indicating that biological control of pollen beetle is a multi-scale process. At the 250 m scale, parasitism rates of T. heterocerus were positively related to the proportion of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> and the proximity to previous year OSR fields. At large scales (1500 to 2000 m), parasitism rates of T. heterocerus were positively related to <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> and negatively related to the proportion of previous year OSR fields with conventional soil tillage. Parasitism rates of Phradis spp. were only positively related to the proportion of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> at the 1250 and 1500 m scales.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of conservation interventions for maximizing biodiversity benefits from agri-environment schemes (AESs) {{is expected to}} depend on the quantity of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> in the surrounding landscape. To verify this hypothesis, we developed a hierarchical sampling design to assess the effects of field boundary type and cover of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> in the landscape at two nested spatial scales. We sampled three types of field boundaries with increasing structural complexity (grass margin - simple hedgerow - complex hedgerow) in paired landscapes with presence or absence of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> (radius 0. 5 km), that in turn, were nested within 15 areas with different proportions of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> at a larger spatial scale (10 × 10 km). Overall, 90 field boundaries were sampled across a Mediterranean region (NE Italy). We considered species richness response across three different taxonomic groups: vascular plants, butterflies, and tachinid flies. No interactions between type of field boundary and surrounding landscape were found at either 0. 5 and 10 km indicating that the quality of field boundary had the same effect irrespective of the cover of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> At the local scale, extended-width grass margins yielded higher plant species richness, while hedgerows yielded higher species richness of butterflies and tachinids. At the 0. 5 km landscape scale, the effect of the proportion of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> was neutral for plants and tachinids, while butterflies were positively related to the proportion of forest. At the 10 km landscape scale, only butterflies responded positively to the proportion of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Our study confirmed the importance of testing multiple scales when considering species from different taxa and with different mobility. We showed that the quality of field boundaries at the local scale was an important factor in enhancing farmland biodiversity.

40|$|To enhance biodiversity, {{guidelines}} for farm-based nature management recommend that farmers manage at least 5 % {{of their land}} as <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> in tandem with other measures. Semi-natural habitats are defined here as those areas of a farm that are non-productive, i. e. areas with no intentional inputs of pesticides or nutrients and remaining effectively undisturbed. Reliable information on the actual amount of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> on arable farms was lacking, however. To address this lacuna the absolute and relative area of such habitats was assessed on 105 arable farms in seven regions of The Netherlands. The results on the national level, showed that on conventional Dutch arable farms 2. 1 % of the holding was managed as <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> a disappointing figure. No marked interregional differences were found, reflecting the high intensity of land use throughout the country. On average, 1. 7 % of farm holdings were taken up by farmyards, buildings and farm roads and 96. 2 % by cropped land. Ditch banks were the most common <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> on the farms, followed by ditches, hedgerows and dry ditches.

This study was aimed to study the effect of complexity and structure of landscape on the diversity, abundance and traits of flower-visiting insects in cucumber fields. This study was conducted in cucumber fields surrounded by other agricultural crops, shrubs, <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> and housing area, in Bogor, Cianjur and Sukabumi regencies, West Java, Indonesia.

Sampling of flower-visiting insects was conducted using scan sampling methods. The result showed that landscape complexity affected species richness (but not abundance and trait) of flower-visiting insects both for mobile and less-mobile insects.

A general {{expectation is that}} a decreasing cover of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> negatively affects pollinator reproduction, population size and pollination services, but few studies have investigated the simultaneous effects of landscape complexity on different aspects of pollinator communities and functioning. In 20 agricultural landscape plots {{the size of an}} average Dutch farm, we studied how changing landscape complexity affected wild bee abundance, species richness and reproduction. To measure pollination, we placed potted strawberry plants as phytometers in landscapes. Landscape complexity was characterized as the area of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> In addition, we estimated floral resource abundance in each landscape plot. We expected that i) bee species richness, reproduction and pollination would be positively related to area of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> and flower abundance, and that ii) species richness and reproduction would be positively related to pollination. An increase in <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> in landscapes increased both the abundance of cavity-nesting bees colonizing trap nests, and the growth rates of experimental Bombus terrestris L. colonies, but not the species richness of wild bees measured by pan traps. There was only a tendency for higher pollination levels of strawberry plants with higher cover of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> There was no relationship between species richness and bee reproduction in a landscape and the pollination services. Estimated flower abundance in landscape had a positive effect on bumblebee colony growth only and not on the other variables. Our results suggest that, by improving habitat quality on their farms through establishing more <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> or enhancing the flower availability in <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats,</b> farmers can promote reproduction of a number of functionally important bee species and the pollination services they provide. Bee species richness, however, seems to be more difficult to enhance and requires more than just creating more of the same type of habitats or flowers. </p...|$|R

The benefits of persisting in this approach are challenged by the existence of apparent yield plateaus for many major crops and of crop yield saturating responses to increasing levels of pesticides. Notably, despite the importance of yield stability and the empirical evidence that magnitude and stability of ecosystem functions do not necessarily co-vary positively, few studies on the stability of crop yield have been attempted. Here, we develop a model for crop yield dynamics in a spatially heterogeneous agricultural landscape to explore possible trade-offs between crop production (yield mean and stability) and biodiversity conservation (pollinators) in agroecosystems. We focus on how landscape composition (proportion of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> within the agricultural landscape) and crop pollination dependence shape these trade-offs and how they influence the mean and stability of pollinators, and that of crop yield. We find that agricultural practices impose trade-offs in pollination-dependent agriculture between provisioning and regulating/cultural services in agroecosystems, such as between crop area and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> for pollinator communities, which not only affect the production of crops, but also their stability. These trade-offs are conditioned by mechanisms associated with the pollinator dependence of crops, and the crop relative responsiveness.

Agricultural intensification poses {{a serious}} threat to biodiversity as a consequence of increased land-use intensity, decreased landscape heterogeneity and reduced habitat diversity. Although there is interest in the preservation of total species richness of an agricultural landscape (γ diversity), the effects of intensification have been assessed primarily by species richness at a local scale (α diversity). This ignores species richness between local communities (β diversity), which is an important component of total species richness. 2. In this study, measures of land-use intensity, landscape structure and habitat diversity were related to γ, α and β diversity of wild bees (Apoidea), carabid beetles (Carabidae), hoverflies (Syrphidae), true bugs (Heteroptera) and spiders (Araneae) within 16 local communities in 24 temperate European agricultural landscapes. 3.

However, substantial declines in bee populations and diversity {{have been observed}} in Europe and North America for the past 50 years, {{partly due to the}} loss of natural habitats and reduction of plant diversity resulting from agricultural intensification. To mitigate the negative effects of agricultural intensification, agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been proposed to sustain bees and others pollinators in agrosystems. AES include the preservation of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> such as grasslands, fallows, woodlots, hedgerows or set-aside field margins. However, empirical evidence suggest that the use of those <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> by bees may vary greatly among bee functional groups and may further be influenced by the presence of alternative foraging habitats such as mass-flowering crops. The present study sets out to investigate whether the three bee groups typically targeted by AES (honey bees, bumble bees and other wild bees) differ in the way they use those <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> relative to common mass-flowering crops (oilseed rape, sunflower, alfalfa) in an intensive agricultural farming system. A clear segregation pattern in the use of floral resources appeared between honey bees and wild bees, with the former being tightly associated with mass-flowering crops and the latter with <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Bumble bees had an intermediate strategy and behaved as habitat generalists. Therefore, it would be sensible to treat the three bee groups with distinct AES management strategies, and to further consider potential effects on AES efficiency of alternative foraging habitats in the surrounding.

Most landscape ecology research has focused on the amount (relative surface) and spatial organisation of these habitats. However, these two components of landscape heterogeneity,composition and configuration, are often correlated. Also, landscape structure effects on biodiversity were mostly observed locally, while there is a great need for studying landscape-scale gamma diversity. We conducted a mensurative experiment to determine the independent effects of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> amount and configuration on gamma diversity of carabid beetles and vascular plants. The influence of landscape heterogeneity components were tested on species richness, evenness and composition. Local diversity (species richness and composition) was compared across the various cover types to determine their relative contributions. Only carabid species evenness and composition were influenced by seminatural habitat amount. Carabid and plant species richness and plant species composition remained unaffected by semi-natural habitats. Local diversity analysis showed that three types of habitats can be distinguished in agricultural landscapes: grasslands (temporary and permanent ones), woody habitats (woodlands and hedgerows) and row crops. These results beg for a re-evaluation of thesemi-natural covers. Temporary and permanent grasslands are often similar, probably because of comparable farming management. Permanent grasslands and woody habitats are often combined as semi-natural covers, although they support very different communities.

In particular, we predict that agricultural lands constitute barriers to gene flow and hypothesize that fragmentation has restricted interpopulation dispersal and reduced local levels of genetic diversity. Our results confirmed the expectation that isolation and habitat fragmentation have reduced the genetic diversity of local populations. Landscape genetic analyses based on circuit theory showed that agricultural land offers ~ 1000 times more resistance to gene flow than semi-natural habitats, indicating that patterns of dispersal are constrained by the spatial configuration of remnant patches of suitable habitat. Overall, this study shows that <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> patches act as corridors for interpopulation gene flow and should be preserved due to the disproportionately large ecological function that they provide considering their insignificant area within these human-modified landscapes.

Therefore in 2014 and 2015 a total of 62 sunflower fields were selected in Italy and Hungary. Weed composition was determined by scoring density and percentage cover of the species in 14 1 m 2 plots in each field about 3 weeks after main weed management practices were performed in the crop. The plots were positioned along 2 transects, 10 m apart, at increasing distances into the field. GLM and ANOVA showed that, total weed densities and weed cover were higher next to cropped margins in Hungary while in Italy adjacent SNH type did not affect these variables. The hypothesis that increased distance from the SNH decreases weed density of various weed groups (monocots, dicots, annual, and perennials) was confirmed in Italy but was not so clear in Hungary. In Italy increased weed species richness and abundance were found in fields surrounded by increasing SNH percentage in the 1 km radius landscape sector. The preliminary analyses indicate that the response of weed communities to SNH is area specific [...] This project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration...|$|E
40|$|Modern landscapes {{are often}} highly {{fragmented}} (Angelstam 1992). For many species they consist of patches of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitat</b> {{of various sizes}} in a hostile matrix (Nilsson and Ericson 1992). In the south Swedish landscape, typical patches are wooded, and include small forests, tree rows and even single trees. The dominating matrix consists of cropped fields. A problem in conserva-tion is to determine to what extent these small patches rep-resent the habitat that originally covered the landscape (Nilsson 1986). Lack of representativeness can come from two causes. It {{may be that the}} small patches, on closer view, are different from the original habitat. Small forest patches may have a different set of tree species represented, com-pared to what is found in a natural climax forest. It may also be that patchiness per se, because of area and isolatio...|$|E
40|$|Pollination {{services}} are economically {{important component of}} agricultural biodiversity which enhance the yield and quality of many crops. An understanding of the suitability of extant habitats for pollinating species is crucial for planning management actions to protect and manage these service providers. In a highly modified agricultural ecosystem, we tested the effect of different pollination treatments (open, autonomous self- and wind-pollination) on pod set, seed set, and seed weight in field beans (Vicia faba). We also investigated the effect of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> and flower abundance on pollinators of field beans. Pollinator sampling was undertaken in ten field bean fields along a gradient of habitat complexity; CORINE land cover classification was used to analyse the land use patterns between 500 – 3000 m around the sites. Total yield from open-pollination increased by 185 % compared to autonomous self-pollination. There was positive interactive effect of local flower abundance and cover of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> on overall abundance of pollinators at 1500 and 2000 m, and abundance of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) at 1000 – 2000 m. In contrast, species richness of pollinators was only correlated with flower abundance and not with <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> We did not find a link between pod set from open-pollination and pollinator abundance, possibly due to variations in the growing conditions and pollinator communities between sites. We conclude that insect pollination is essential for optimal bean yields and therefore the maintenance of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> in agriculture-dominated landscapes should ensure stable and more efficient pollination services in field beans...|$|R
40|$|<b>Semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> in {{agricultural}} landscapes are generally assumed {{to enhance the}} biological control of insect pests based on native beneficial insects, by providing alternative prey and hosts, resources and refuges for overwintering. We hypothesized that natural enemies of winter wheat aphids should arrive sooner in fields near <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> We compared aphid, hoverfly (larvae and eggs) and parasitized aphid (mummies) abundances in 54 winter wheat fields located in southern France from 2003 to 2007. Six surveys were recorded each spring and were split into the early period (defined as the period before the peak of aphid growth) and the late period (after the peak). The wheat fields differed by their surrounding landscape composition measured as the proportion of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> (woods, hedges and grasslands), at three different spatial scales: 200 m, 500 m, and 1200 m. Despite great variability in abundance data between years, the abundance of hoverflies appeared more sensitive to landscape composition than aphid abundance was. Early abundance for both aphids and hoverflies {{was positively related to}} wood cover, but not late abundance in spring. The abundance of hoverflies was positively related to hedge and grassland cover at all spatial scales and both periods considered. Aphid parasitism was higher near hedges at the small spatial scale late in the spring. Our results confirmed that higher proportions of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> {{in agricultural}} landscapes enhance the biological control of pests, but this effect depends on the spatial scale, the time period in the spring and the natural enemies considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an on-farm biodiversity assessment of 45 organic arable farms in eastern Austria (region Weinviertel). The core of the assessment method consists of 99 parameters concerning agricultural practices and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> and their impacts on genetic diversity, habitat diversity and species diversity of eleven indicator species groups. For each farm, a biodiversity performance score was calculated ranging from 0 to 100 %, where 100 % would be reached with the highest possible scores for all parameters. The biodiversity assessment of the 45 organic arable farms revealed big between-farm differences in the biodiversity performance (16. 8 to 50. 6 %; Ø 32. 8 ± 6. 1 %). While 32 farms for example achieved biodiversity scores > 40 % in their crop area, only nine farms got more than 10 % concerning <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> These results show that although the assessed farms achieved good biodiversity performances regarding their agricultural practices due to their organic management, <b>semi-natural</b> <b>habitats</b> – which play {{an essential role in}} conserving biodiversity in agricultural landscapes – are underrepresented on all farms and reveal the need for improvement concerning conserving and promoting biodiversity on these farms...|$|R
