5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E

50|$|Titanium rings, {{depending}} on composition, have {{varying degrees of}} fatigue resistance and tensile strength. However, almost all well-known compositions feature higher fatigue resistance, as well as <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> than most, if not all, known metals.|$|R
25|$|Aluminum alloys {{have a lower}} {{density and}} lower {{strength}} compared with steel alloys, however, they possess a better <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> giving them notable weight advantages over steel.|$|E
25|$|Other exotic frame {{materials}} include titanium {{and advanced}} alloys. Bamboo, a natural composite material with high <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and stiffness {{has been used}} for bicycles since 1894. Recent versions use bamboo for the primary frame with glued metal connections and parts, priced as exotic models.|$|E
25|$|The handle {{material}} of the SARK {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a double detent as the locking mechanism. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material are its exceptional <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and corrosion resistance. The handle's scales are made from black G-10 fiberglass, although models were made {{for a few years}} using green G-10. A pocket clip held in place by three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear or MOLLE.|$|E
50|$|From {{the mid-1990s}} racing yachts {{introduced}} {{the use of}} carbon fibre and other composite materials to construct masts with even better <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratios.</b> Carbon fibre masts could also be constructed with more precisely engineered aerodynamic profiles.|$|R
50|$|Dyneema and Spectra are {{lightweight}} high-strength oriented-strand gel spun {{through a}} spinneret. They have yield strengths {{as high as}} 2.4 GPa (350,000 psi) and specific gravity as low as 0.97 (for Dyneema SK75). High-strength steels have comparable yield strengths, and low-carbon steels have yield strengths much lower (around 0.5 GPa). Since steel has a specific gravity of roughly 7.8, this gives <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> for these materials in a range from 8 to 15 times higher than steel. <b>Strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> for Dyneema are about 40% higher than for aramid. Dyneema was invented by Albert Pennings in 1963 but made commercially available by DSM in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Other {{significant}} metallic alloys {{are those}} of aluminium, titanium, copper and magnesium. Copper alloys have been {{known for a long}} time (since the Bronze Age), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.|$|R
25|$|Kevlar is the {{registered}} trademark for a light, strong para-aramid synthetic fiber. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets {{that can be}} used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components. Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> Invented at DuPont in 1965 by Stephanie Kwolek, Kevlar was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires.|$|E
25|$|Closed-die forging {{has a high}} {{initial cost}} due to the {{creation}} of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This {{is one of the major}} reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|E
25|$|Titanium is a {{metal that}} has a better <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> is more wear resistant, and more {{flexible}} than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy {{allow them to be}} heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated. They are often disposable.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{research}} indicates that some HEAs have considerably better <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> with {{a higher degree of}} fracture resistance, tensile strength, as well as corrosion and oxidation resistance than conventional alloys. Although HEAs have existed since before 2004, research substantially accelerated in the 2010s.|$|R
50|$|A {{sandwich}} panel is a composit {{of three or}} more materials bonded {{together to form a}} structural panel.

In addition, FRCs have potential {{for use in}} many applications in dentistry {{and are expected to}} gain increasing applications in the future. This book includes both review and research papers in different FRC areas from contributors around the world...|$|R
25|$|Physically, younger gymnasts, {{particularly}} {{those who have not}} yet gone through puberty, tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more complex skills and gives them a better <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate. Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving Code of Points after the 1960s. In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more {{likely to be able to}} work through pain while injured.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{into the}} {{development}} of powered flight, some manufacturers were beginning to consider the use of metal in airframes to replace wood. Metal structures, even fabric-covered metal frames, offered greater robustness for handling and transportation as well as better resistance to tropical climates, and some designers could see the possibilities of metal skinning, stressed or not, for aerodynamically-clean cantilever wings and advanced monocoque fuselages. There was a realisation too, that mild steel, familiar from bicycle manufacture but with a low <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> {{was not going to}} be the material of choice once the problems of joining aluminium alloy members together and preventing their corrosion had been solved. Vickers in the UK were one of the first to make steel-framed and sparred aircraft that flew, with their series of R.E.P-type monoplanes no.s 1-8 produced between 1911 and 1913. In Germany, Junkers produced the first true all-metal (for years, aircraft with fabric-clad metal frames were described as all-metal, but the Junkers was steel-skinned as well) aircraft, the Junkers J.1, flown in 1915. Bristol's first draft designs for metal aircraft date from 1914, but it was not until the increase of aircraft production during the First World War began to put pressure on the supply of high-grade timber that there was official interest. During 1916 Bristol's designer, Frank Barnwell submitted a design for a metal two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, the M.R.1 (M.R. for Metal Reconnaissance) and gained a contract for two evaluation aircraft.|$|E

However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating. This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars. A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety.

2500|$|Aluminium in pure form is a {{soft metal}} (MH 3.0) with low {{mechanical}} strength. It has a close-packed structure (BCN 12) showing {{some evidence of}} partially directional bonding. It has a low melting point and a high thermal conductivity. Its strength is halved at 200°C, and for many of its alloys is minimal at 300°C. The latter three properties of aluminium limit its use to situations where fire protection is not required, or necessitate the provision of increased fire protection. It bonds covalently in most of its compounds; has an amphoteric oxide; and can form anionic aluminates. Aluminium forms Zintl phases such as LiAl, Ca3Al2Sb6, and SrAl2. A thin protective layer of oxide confers a reasonable degree of corrosion resistance. It is susceptible to attack in low pH (<4) and high (> 8.5) pH conditions, a phenomenon that is generally more pronounced {{in the case of}} commercial purity aluminium and aluminium alloys. Given many of these properties and its proximity to the dividing line between metals and nonmetals, aluminium is occasionally classified as a metalloid. Despite its shortcomings, it has a good <b>strength-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and excellent ductility; its mechanical strength can be improved considerably with the use of alloying additives; its very high thermal conductivity can be put to good use in heat sinks and heat exchangers; and it has a high electrical conductivity.
