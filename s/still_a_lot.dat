Because there was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of snow {{at the time of}} the expedition, Messner and Mutschlechner made very slow progress. In addition, the sheer difficulty of the climb forced the two mountaineers to use fixed ropes. Finally, on 6 May, Messner, Mutschlechner and Ang Dorje stood on the summit. There, Mutschlechner suffered frostbite to his hands, and later to his feet as well. Whilst bivouacking during the descent, the tent tore away from Mutschlechner and Messner, and Messner also fell ill. He was suffering from amoebic liver abscess, making him very weak. In the end he only made it back to base camp with Mutschlechner's help.|$|E

So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way.

[...] However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution, but are upscaled. In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, TechRadar further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.|$|E

[...] GameSpot provided a more negative review, deriding the game's different modes as [...] "seriously boring and predictable," [...] as well as criticizing the lack of {{significant differences in the}} playing style of the game's characters. GameSpot characterized the voice acting as having [...] "some of the worst stereotypes of anime voice acting," [...] and noted the lack of unlockable items and other incentives to continue play.

Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation {{that a lot of people}} have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them."

[...] Mike Wass of Idolator, while reviewing Reclassified, said that, [...] "Of the trio of fuck-you anthems, 'Iggy SZN' is the most light-hearted and upbeat. It showcases Iggy's knack for memorable quips – 'what they make in a year, I can make in a week' – and The Invisible Men's ability to deliver crazy beats."
