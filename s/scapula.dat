5|$|The shoulderblade or <b>scapula</b> {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The <b>scapula</b> constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the <b>scapula</b> into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the <b>scapula.</b> It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Hamilton came {{second in}} the Giro d'Italia despite a broken <b>scapula.</b> The team also nearly won the team time trial at the 2002 Tour de France, thwarted by a flat tire. Jalabert again won the King of the Mountains and {{repeated}} his victory at the Clásica de San Sebastián. He retired {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the head}} and thorax is the {{membranous}} neck or cervix. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between {{the head and}} the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a <b>scapula.</b> In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified {{with a pair of}} tympanal organs.|$|E
50|$|Muscles that {{attach to}} and depress the <b>scapulae</b> include the lower {{trapezius}} muscle and the pectoralis minor. The pec minor also works {{in conjunction with}} the rhomboid muscle and levator <b>scapulae</b> to perform downward rotation of the <b>scapulae.</b>|$|R
50|$|Significant use of {{tortoise}} plastrons {{does not}} appear until the Shang culture sites. Ox <b>scapulae</b> and plastrons, both prepared for divination, were found at the Shang culture sites of Táixīcūn (台西村) in Hebei and Qiūwān (丘灣) in Jiangsu. One or more pitted <b>scapulae</b> were found at Lùsìcūn (鹿寺村) in Henan, while unpitted <b>scapulae</b> have been found at Erlitou in Henan, Cíxiàn (磁縣) in Hebei, Níngchéng (寧城) in Liaoning, and Qíjiā (齊家) in Gansu. Plastrons do not become more numerous than <b>scapulae</b> until the Rénmín (人民) Park phase.|$|R
50|$|During the {{transverse}} lifts, the <b>scapulae</b> {{will also}} articulate and adduct/retract as the weights lift, then abduct/protract as the weights are lowered. Some lifters will retract the <b>scapulae</b> {{and hold them}} there, as opposed to letting them protract, {{to get a better}} stretch in the posterior deltoid. Muscles that retract the <b>scapulae</b> include the rhomboid muscle and the trapezius muscle.|$|R
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the <b>scapula,</b> and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is a cranial nerve that supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It {{is considered the}} eleventh of twelve pairs of cranial nerves, or simply cranial nerve XI, as {{part of it was}} formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle, connecting to the <b>scapula,</b> acts to shrug the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{is reasonably}} complete {{and includes a}} partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the Amargasaurus skull {{is only the second}} skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position: the vertebral column of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the sacrum. Of the skull, only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved. The sacrum, despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade) and coracoid (which sits on {{the lower end of the}} <b>scapula),</b> while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the manus (hand) and most of the pes (foot) missing. The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Anatomical morphometric {{studies of}} the {{coracoid}} process and coraco-glenoid space were carried out on 204 dry <b>scapulae.</b> No statistically significant correlations were found between length, or thickness of the coracoid process, prominence of the coracoid tip, coracoid slope, coraco-glenoid distance, or position of the coracoid tip {{with respect to the}} uppermost point of the glenoid. These anatomical characteristics were independent. of the dimensions of the <b>scapulae.</b> Three configurations of the coraco-glenoid space were identified. Type I configuration was found in 45 % of <b>scapulae</b> and Type II and Type III, in 34 % and 21 % of specimens, respectively. The lowest value of the coraco-glenoid distance were seen in Type I <b>scapulae.</b> Morphometric characteristics which might predispose to subcoracoid impingement were found in 4 % of Type I <b>scapulae.</b> A total of 27 <b>scapulae,</b> nine with each type of configuration were submitted to CT scanning. <b>Scapulae</b> with a Type I configuration were found to have low values for the coraco-glenoid angle and coracoid overlap, which are known to be associated with a short coraco-humeral distance. Subjects with a Type I configuration, and severe narrowing of the coraco-glenoid space, appear to be predisposed to coraco-humeral impingement. These morphometric characteristics may be easily evaluated on CT scans...|$|R
50|$|The {{right and}} left {{proximal}} <b>scapulae</b> are large with a distinct tuberculum coracoideum proximal to it. Both of the <b>scapulae</b> are larger than that of L. crumeniferus, but fall within the size range of L. dubius.|$|R
5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right <b>scapulae</b> and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The <b>scapulae</b> are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the <b>scapulae</b> and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the <b>scapulae.</b> The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|R
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the <b>scapula.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding <b>scapula,</b> and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of shoulder pain of cervical origin being reproduced on shoulder movement is clinically recognized. The {{action of the}} shoulder girdle muscles is a hypothetical cause of the cervical stress. This study examined the mode and degree of Levator <b>Scapulae</b> activity during shoulder activity. Electromyography and x-rays were used to measure levator <b>scapulae</b> activity and length. The {{results of the study}} show that levator <b>scapulae</b> contracts concentrically during the first 90 degrees of shoulder abduction and eccentrically during the second 90 degrees. The action of levator <b>scapulae</b> may be responsible for the application of force on the cervical spine during shoulder abduction. This force might cause cervical joint tissue distortion and pain if a pathological state was present...|$|R

5|$|Nigersaurus {{was named}} and {{described}} {{in more detail}} by Sereno and colleagues only in 1999, based on remains of newly found individuals. The same article also named Jobaria, another sauropod from Niger. The genus name Nigersaurus ("Niger reptile") is a reference to the country where it was discovered, and the specific name taqueti honours Taquet, who was the first to organise large-scale palaeontological expeditions to Niger. The holotype specimen (MNN GAD512) consists of a partial skull and neck. Limb material and a <b>scapula</b> found nearby were also referred to the same specimen. These fossils are housed at the National Museum of Niger.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} pterosaurs was highly {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds. They had a keeled breastbone that was developed for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged brain that shows specialised features associated with flight. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served to stiffen the torso during flight, and provide a stable support for the <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade).|$|E
5|$|The <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The <b>scapula</b> did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of a notch in the anterior {{margin of the}} glenoid cavity of 236 <b>scapulae</b> (118 female, 118 male) was investigated. The notch was found in 129 <b>scapulae</b> (55 %) and {{gave rise to a}} pear-shaped cavity. In 107 <b>scapulae</b> (45 %) the notch was absent, the shape of the cavity being oval. No sex difference was found in the {{prevalence of}} the notch. If a distinct notch exists, the glenoid labrum is not attached to bone at the notch and is therefore liable to be sheared off (Bankart lesion) ...|$|R

50|$|While the use {{of bones}} in divination has been practiced almost globally, such divination {{involving}} fire or heat has generally been found in Asia and the Asian-derived North American cultures. The use of heat to crack <b>scapulae</b> (pyro-scapulimancy) originated in ancient China, the earliest evidence of which extends back to the 4th millennium BCE, with archaeological finds from Liaoning, but these were not inscribed. In Neolithic China {{at a variety of}} sites, the <b>scapulae</b> of cattle, sheep, pigs and deer used in pyromancy have been found, and the practice appears to have become quite common {{by the end of the}} third millennium BCE. <b>Scapulae</b> were unearthed along with smaller numbers of pitless plastrons in the Nánguānwài (南關外) stage at Zhengzhou, Henan; <b>scapulae</b> as well as smaller numbers of plastrons with chiseled pits were also discovered in the Lower and Upper Erligang stages.|$|R
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the <b>scapula</b> to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade. The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis'.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between <b>scapula,</b> coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} (catalogue number QG24) {{has been}} found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface exponation and plant roots. It includes the pelvis and sacrum, most of the left hind limb and foot, a right thigh bone, and twelve anterior tail vertebrae. These remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated (still connected together). Additionally, several disarticulated bones were found, including the right forearm and some metacarpalia and phalanges from both {{the right and left}} forefeet, probably also pertaining to this individual. Later, the site was revisited by the scientists Geoffrey Bond and Michael Cooper, who were able to collect additional remains including a <b>scapula</b> (specimen QG152, a shoulder blade) and a fragment of a neck vertebra. These remains show that more than one individual was present, and it is possible that they do not pertain to Vulcanodon at all. Today, the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated <b>scapula,</b> or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from other}} parts of the UK and Iberia, mostly {{isolated}} teeth, have subsequently been attributed to Baryonyx or similar animals. Isolated teeth and bones from the Isle of Wight, including hand bones and a vertebra, have been attributed to this genus. A maxilla fragment from La Rioja, Spain, was attributed in 1995. In 1999 a postorbital bone, a squamosal bone, a tooth, vertebra remains, metacarpals, and a phalanx from the Sala de los Infantes deposit in Burgos Province, Spain, were attributed to an immature Baryonyx (though some of these elements are unknown in the holotype), and dinosaur tracks near Burgos have been identified as those of Baryonyx or a similar theropod. In 2011 a specimen (ML1190) from the Papo Seco Formation in Boca do Chapim, Portugal, with a fragmentary dentary, teeth, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, a <b>scapula,</b> and a phalanx bone, was attributed to Baryonyx, the most complete Iberian remains of the animal. The skeletal elements of this specimen are also represented in the more complete holotype NHM R9951, except for the mid-neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185mm (7in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152mm (6in) long. The radius of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144mm (5in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The femur (thigh bone) {{is estimated}} to have been 286mm (11in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317mm long (12in).|$|E

In {{the context of the}} oracle bones of ancient China, which chiefly utilized both <b>scapulae</b> and the plastrons of turtle, scapulimancy is sometimes used in a very broad sense to jointly refer to both scapulimancy and plastromancy (similar divination using plastrons). However, the term osteomancy might be more appropriate, referring to divination using bones.
