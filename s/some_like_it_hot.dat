5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot.</b> Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe founded her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, in 1955; the company produced one film independently, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Monroe then appeared in <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> (1959) and The Misfits (1961). She was {{suspended from the}} filming of Something's Got to Give in June 1962, and the film remained uncompleted when she died in August. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million {{by the time of}} her unexpected death in 1962.|$|E
5|$|When {{the studio}} was still {{reluctant}} {{to change her}} contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954; she named it Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961).|$|E

He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for Titanic (1953), and wrote Niagara (1953), the breakthrough film for Marilyn Monroe as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in The Seven Year Itch and <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>it</b> <b>Hot.</b> Brackett's career waned {{by the end}} of the decade, though he did produce the critically praised and Oscar-nominated film The King and I (1956).|$|E

Another Channel 4 poll in 2001 named it the 23rd greatest film of all time (the only comedy that came higher on this occasion was Billy Wilder's <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot,</b> which was ranked 5th).|$|E

Cocteau biographer Francis Steegmuller wrote a profile of Barbette for The New Yorker in 1969 entitled [...] "An Angel, A Flower, A Bird".

500|$|Jean-Paul Belmondo and George Raft {{received}} major billing, {{even though}} both actors appear only briefly. Both appear during the climactic brawl at the end, Raft flipping his trademark coin and promptly shooting himself dead with a backwards-firing pistol, while Belmondo appears wearing a fake moustache as the French Foreign Legion officer who requires an English phrase book to translate [...] "merde!" [...] into [...] "ooch!" [...] during his fistfight. Raft's coin flip, which originally appeared in Scarface (1932), had been spoofed {{a few years earlier}} in <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> (1959).|$|E
500|$|In the end, Wilder {{was happy}} with Monroe's performance, stating: [...] "Anyone can {{remember}} lines, {{but it takes a}} real artist to come on the set and not know her lines and yet give the performance she did!" [...] Despite the difficulties of its production, <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> became a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. Monroe's performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted Variety to call her [...] "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just can't be beat". It has been voted one of the best films ever made in polls by the American Film Institute and Sight & Sound.|$|E
500|$|After <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot,</b> Monroe {{took another}} hiatus until late 1959, when she {{returned}} to Hollywood and starred in the musical comedy Let's Make Love, about an actress and a millionaire who fall in love when performing in a satirical play. She chose George Cukor to direct and Miller re-wrote portions of the script, which she considered weak; she accepted the part solely because she was behind on her contract with Fox, having only made one of four promised films. The film's production was delayed by her frequent absences from the set. She had an affair with Yves Montand, her co-star, which was widely reported by the press and used in the film's publicity campaign. Let's Make Love was unsuccessful upon its release in September 1960; Crowther described Monroe as appearing [...] "rather untidy" [...] and [...] "lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism", and Hedda Hopper called the film [...] "the most vulgar picture she's ever done". Truman Capote lobbied for her to play Holly Golightly in a film adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffany's, but the role went to Audrey Hepburn as its producers feared that Monroe would complicate the production.|$|E

500|$|Monroe {{returned}} to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot.</b> Although she considered {{the role of}} Sugar Kane another [...] "dumb blonde", she accepted it due to Miller's encouragement and the offer of receiving {{ten percent of the}} film's profits in addition to her standard pay. The difficulties during the film's production have since become [...] "legendary". Monroe would demand dozens of re-takes, and could not remember her lines or act as directed– Curtis famously stated that kissing her was [...] "like kissing Hitler" [...] due to the number of re-takes. Monroe herself privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented on her co-stars and director saying [...] " [...] why should I worry, I have no phallic symbol to lose." [...] Many of the problems stemmed from a conflict between her and Wilder, who also had a reputation for being difficult, on how she should play the character. Monroe made Wilder angry by asking him to alter many of her scenes, which in turn made her stage fright worse, and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes to act them her way.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer then {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Susie Diamond, a hard-edged former call girl turned lounge singer, in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), which co-starred Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Baker Boys. She underwent intensive voice training for the role for four months, and performed all of her character's vocals. The film was a modest success, grossing $18.4 million in the US (equivalent to $million in [...] dollars [...] ). Pfeiffer's portrayal of Susie, however, drew rave reviews from critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote of the performance: [...] "she proves to be electrifyingly right. Introducing Ms. Pfeiffer's furiously hard-boiled, devastatingly gorgeous Susie into the Bakers' world affects the film the way a match might affect a fuse," [...] Fellow critic Roger Ebert compared her to Rita Hayworth in Gilda and to Marilyn Monroe in <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot,</b> adding that the film was [...] "one of the movies they will use as a document, years from now, when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star." [...] Variety singled out her performance of 'Makin' Whoopee', writing that Pfeiffer [...] "hits the spot in the film's certain-to-be-remembered highlight... crawling all over a piano in a blazing red dress. She's dynamite." ...|$|E
500|$|Susie's ballads occupy roughly {{one-third of}} the film, {{performing}} {{a combination of both}} contemporary and classic standards. Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>it</b> <b>Hot</b> (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen, because they might be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric tight to her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, but to her sole accompanist Jack instead. According to Slant film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior to this moment, it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters. Observing that the character's tough attitude matches the difficult life she has been through, Janet Maslin of The New York Times believes that Susie must be [...] "singing from experience" [...] when she performs the song [...] "Ten Cents a Dance". Go Slow: The Life of Julie London author Michael Owen considers both Pfeiffer's performance and Susie herself to be a tribute to actress and singer Julie London, citing similarities such as asking her accompanist to perform [...] "More Than You Know" [...] in a slow tempo, swearing into a live microphone and delivering a [...] "sexy rendition" [...] of [...] "Makin' Whoopee", capturing [...] "some of the essence of Julie's style." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susie, dressed in a red evening dress, seductively {{performs}} [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] {{on top of a}} grand piano has since become iconic and often parodied, establishing itself as a modern cinema classic. As the film's most iconic scene, it quickly became [...] "the stuff of legend" [...] according to Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson. The Fabulous Baker Boys tends to be most remembered for this celebrated scene. The Guardians Jane Graham agreed that the film's title [...] "will immediately conjure up an image of a beautiful woman sliding her way across a grand piano", referring to Pfeiffer's performance as [...] "undoubtedly... the most memorable aspect" [...] of The Fabulous Baker Boys, rivaling performances by Marilyn Monroe. Vulture's Angelica Jade Bastién wrote that Pfeiffer elevates the scene [...] "to that small pantheon of definitive bombshell moments that strike with the force of a chemical reaction," [...] comparing it to Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe's performances in Gilda and <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hot,</b> respectively. Additionally, Turner Classic Movies believes that [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] is largely responsible for Pfeiffer's Academy Award nomination. In 2000, Empire film critic Ian Nathan proclaimed that Pfeiffer's [...] "immaculate" [...] rendition of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] had finally achieved [...] "classic" [...] status. Mike D'Angelo of The Dissolve likened the sequence's impact to those of other famous film performances and lines that [...] "are embodied in the cultural consciousness", such as [...] "You talkin' to me?" [...] from Taxi Driver (1976) and [...] "Get to the choppa!" [...] from Predator (1987), concluding, [...] "It's easy to forget ... that there was more to the movie—and to Pfeiffer's terrific work therein—than that one intensely erotic scene. InSing ranked the scene eighth on their [...] "30 sexiest scenes in movie history" [...] countdown. The Calgary Herald considers The Fabulous Baker Boys to be the ninth sexiest film of all-time largely due to [...] "Makin' Whoopee". Nerve ranked Pfeiffer the 33rd [...] "Greatest Female Sex Symbols in Film History", dubbing the actress' rendition of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] "a play from a sex-symbol how-to guide." [...] After providing her own vocals in The Fabulous Baker Boys, Pfeiffer would eventually go on to sing in two more musical films, The Prince of Egypt (1998) and Hairspray (2007), earning positive reviews on each occasion.|$|E
