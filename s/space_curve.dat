Smooth containment of <b>space</b> <b>curves</b> yields Cl-continuous surface fitting, and is a generalization of standard Hermite interpolation applied to fitting curves through point data, equating derivatives at those points. We deal with the containment and matching of “normals ” (vectors orthogonal to tangents), possibly varying along the entire span of the <b>space</b> <b>curves.</b> Such Hermite interpolated surfaces prove useful as “blending ” or “joining” surfaces for solid models as well as “fleshing ” surfaces for curved wireframe models. ...|$|R
