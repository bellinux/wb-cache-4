5|$|The meeting {{attracted}} {{a large crowd}} of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his vicar general, Johannes Fabri. Zwingli summarised his position in the Schlussreden (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles). Fabri, who had not envisaged an academic disputation in the manner Zwingli had prepared for, was forbidden to discuss high theology before laymen, and simply insisted on the necessity of the ecclesiastical authority. The decision of the council was that Zwingli {{would be allowed to}} continue his preaching and that all other preachers <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> only in accordance with Scripture.|$|E

All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E

25|$|According to a {{story in}} the Āyācana Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1)— a scripture found in the Pāli and other — {{immediately}} after his awakening, the Buddha debated whether or not he <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> the Dharma to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, Brahmā Sahampati convinced him, arguing that at least some will understand it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.|$|E
500|$|Shifting from {{teaching}} primarily camping skills to leadership competencies was a paradigm shift. It required rethinking [...] the underlying assumptions, concepts, practices, and values guiding how adults were trained as Scout leaders. Some individuals {{on the national}} staff and many volunteers across the nation resisted the idea of changing the focus of Wood Badge from training leaders in Scout craft to leadership skills. Among them was Bill Hillcourt, {{who had been the}} first United States Wood Badge Course Director in 1948. He remained loyal to the idea that Wood Badge <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> Scoutcraft skills. Although he had officially retired on August 1, 1965, his opinion was still sought after and respected.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present paper surveys recent {{developments}} in algorith-mic teaching. First, the traditional teaching dimension model is recalled. Starting from the observation that the teaching dimension model some-times leads to counterintuitive results, recently developed approaches are presented. Here, main emphasis is put on the following aspects derived from human teaching/learning behavior: {{the order in which}} examples are presented <b>should</b> matter; <b>teaching</b> <b>should</b> become harder when the memory size of the learners decreases; <b>teaching</b> <b>should</b> become easier if the learners provide feedback; and {{it should be possible to}} teach infinite concepts and/or finite and infinite concept classes. Recent developments in the algorithmic teaching achieving (some) of these aspects are presented and compared. ...|$|R

500|$|Later, COBOL {{suffered}} from a shortage of material covering it; it took until 1963 for introductory books to appear (with Richard D. Irwin publishing a college textbook on COBOL in 1966). [...] By 1985, there were twice as many books on Fortran and {{four times as many}} on BASIC as on COBOL in the Library of Congress. [...] University professors taught more modern, state-of-the-art languages and techniques instead of COBOL which was said to have a [...] "trade school" [...] nature. Donald Nelson, chair of the CODASYL COBOL committee, said in 1984 that [...] "academics ... hate COBOL" [...] and that computer science graduates [...] "had 'hate COBOL' drilled into them". A 2013 poll by Micro Focus found that 20% of university academics thought COBOL was outdated or dead and that 55% believed their students thought COBOL was outdated or dead. The same poll also found that only 25% of academics had COBOL programming on their curriculum even though 60% thought they <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> it.|$|E
500|$|Sir Henry Savile, the Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College, {{was deeply}} saddened {{by what the}} 20th-century {{mathematician}} Ida Busbridge has termed [...] "the wretched state of mathematical studies in England", and so founded professorships in geometry and astronomy at the University of Oxford in 1619; both chairs were named after him. He also donated his books to the university's Bodleian Library [...] "for the use chiefly of mathematical readers". He required the professors to be men of good character, at least 26 years old, and to have [...] "imbibed the purer philosophy from the springs of Aristotle and Plato" [...] before acquiring a thorough knowledge of science. The professors could come from any Christian country, but he specified that a professor from England should have a Master of Arts degree as a minimum. He wanted students to be educated {{in the works of}} the leading scientists of the ancient world, saying that the professor of geometry <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> Euclid's Elements, Apollonius's Conics, and the works of Archimedes; tuition in trigonometry was to be shared by the two professors. [...] As many students would have had little mathematical knowledge, the professors were also permitted to provide instruction in basic mathematics in English (as opposed to Latin, the language used in education at Oxford at the time).|$|E

2500|$|From the 1920s to the 1930s, school {{counseling}} [...] grew {{because of the}} rise of progressive education in schools. This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development. Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> only the fundamentals of education. This, combined with the economic hardship of the Great Depression, led to a decline in {{school counseling}}. In the 1940s, psychologists and counselors selected, recruited, and trained military personnel. This propelled the school counseling movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs. Schools accepted these military tests openly. Also, Carl Rogers' emphasis on helping relationships and a move away from directive [...] "guidance" [...] to nondirective or person-centered [...] "counseling" [...] influenced the profession of school counseling.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{viewpoint}} on sex education, historically {{inspired by}} sexologists like Wilhelm Reich and psychologists like Sigmund Freud and James W. Prescott, holds {{that what is}} at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual <b>should</b> <b>teach</b> sexual mores. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized sexual oppression and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of [...] "Reid About Sex" [...] suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.|$|E
