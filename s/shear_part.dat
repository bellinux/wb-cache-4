For most of shell structures, the stiffness matrix of the shell element can be split into membrane, bending and shear stiffness matrices.

For the bending part, displacement-based strain is kept intact and used to formulate the corresponding stiffness matrix. For the <b>shear</b> <b>part,</b> the assumed natural strain method is employed to construct the shear strains to obtain pertinent stiffness matrix and overcome shear locking for thin shell problems.

40|$|With {{the present}} work {{different}} finite element formulations for {{the calculation of}} shells with arbitrary intersections under consideration of finite rotations are presented and compared with each other. For the description of finite rotations the Rodrigues rotation vector is used, which allows a consistent coupling of the rotational degrees of freedom at a shell intersection of arbitrary shell geometries. The Rodrigues rotation vector was introduced by Simo and Vu-Quoc. The proposed formulation does not need any artifical stiffness parameter or penalty factor. But a distinction {{has to be made}} between element nodes which are lying in an intersection and nodes which are lying in a smooth shell area.

In fact, it is mostly observed that creep in fibre-reinforced composites is essentially due to the matrix constituent whose role is to deform and support stresses primarily in shear.

40|$|Abstract- Polymers that attach at solid-liquid {{interfaces}} can considerably {{modify the}} long-ranged forces acting between surfaces.

Recently we have extended these studies to the case of surfaces with adsorbed and with grafted layers as they <b>shear</b> <b>part</b> each other. Our results suggest that the lateral forces depend on the extent of interpenetration of the opposing layers and on their relative shear velocities; they reveal a marked coupling between the normal forces and the shear velocity, beyond a certain critical value of the latter which is probably related to relaxation rates of the end-tethered chains. We find that while non-adsorbing but end-anchored polymer layers are stable with respect to shear and compression, they can be rapidly replaced by addition of shorter polymers with the same adhering end-group...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDelayed damage due fiber/matrix {{debonding}} can {{be observed}} in many unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites, for instance those made with Epoxy-based polymeric resins. As the role of the constitutive matrix is to deform and support stresses primarily in shear, adequate viscoelastic modeling must be adopted.

For the modeling of the degradation by debonding, we use in this work an approach based on continuum damage mechanics. More specifically, two ingredients are involved: (i) the use of the gradient of the damage quantity within a higher-order formulation and, (ii) the damage gradient is herein projected toward the direction of the fibers. Indeed, it is mainly observed that debonding paths mostly propagate along the reinforcements. One then speaks of a directional damage gradient formulation...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of local matter on the chaotic {{behavior}} of a relativistic test particle in non-vacuum static axisymmetric spacetimes. We find that the sign of the sectional curvature in the geodesic deviation equation defined by the Riemann curvature does not always become a good tool to judge the occurrence of chaos in the non-vacuum case. However, we show that the locally unstable region (LU region) defined by the Weyl curvature can provide information about chaos even in non-vacuum spacetime as well as in vacuum spacetime. Since the Weyl tensor affects only the <b>shear</b> <b>part</b> of the geodesic congruence, it works effectively to stretch some directions of geodesic congruence, which helps to cause the chaotic behavior of geodesics. Actually, the orbit moving around an unstable periodic orbit (UPO) becomes strongly chaotic if it passes through an LU region, which means that the LU region {{can be used as a}} good tool to know in which situation the chaos by homoclinic mixing occurs around a UPO.

40|$|International audienceDelayed {{fracture}} due to debonding can {{be observed}} in many unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites when the fibre/matrix interface experiences creep. The aim of this work is to describe such a phenomenon within the recently proposed modeling framework of transverse isotropy that allows for a neat decomposition of the mechanical behavior into fibre-directional, transverse, and pure shear parts. Specifically, debonding is here chosen to be governed by the tension transverse to the fibres. One can then speak of a mode-I debonding if use is made of the terminology adopted in fracture mechanics. On another hand, the time-dependent response is attributed to the matrix constituent. As the role of this latter is to deform and support stresses primarily in shear, a viscoelastic behavior is introduced that affects solely the pure <b>shear</b> <b>part</b> of the behavior. We show that both characteristics can be easily embedded into the aforementioned formulation. Among others, the occurrence of tertiary creep is made possible to predict. It is otherwise found that the predicted debonding path always propagates along the direction of the fibres in agreement with many experimental observations found in the literature.

The obstacle is illuminated by an arbitrary time-harmonic elastic in-cident wave. This work is concerned with an inverse obstacle scattering problem for elastic waves, which is to reconstruct the obstacle’s surface from the displacement field measured at a circle sur-rounding it. The surface of the obstacle {{is assumed to be}} a small and smooth perturbation of a disk. Based on the Helmholtz decomposition, the displacement field is split into its compressional and <b>shear</b> <b>parts.</b> A coupled system of boundary value problems is derived for the decomposed scalar potentials by using the transparent boundary conditions. Utilizing the method of the transformed field expansion, we reduce the coupled system into to a successive sequence of one-dimensional two-point boundary value problems which are solved in closed forms. The inverse problem is linearized by dropping high order terms in the power series expansion and an explicit reconstruction formula is obtained. Moreover, a simple nonlinear correction algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of the reconstructions. Ample numerical examples show that the method is capable of reconstructing the surface with subwavelength resolution. 1...|$|R
