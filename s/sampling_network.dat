40|$|Abstract—Groundwater {{contamination}} {{is one of}} {{the serious}} environmental problems. Effective remediation strategies require accurate characteristics of contamination sources. Contamination source identification approaches need accurate flow and contaminant transport simulation models. In order to obtain reliable solutions, the simulation models need to be provided with reliable hydrogeologic information. In real life scenarios usually sparse and limited hydrogeologic information is available. In this study two hydraulic conductivity sampling networks are ranked based on their effectiveness in identifying reliable contamination source characteristics. Using multiple realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields, and the location and size of the contaminant plume at different monitoring stages, an index of reliability is estimated for each hydraulic conductivity <b>sampling</b> <b>network.</b> It is demonstrated that the source characteristics identified by utilizing the <b>sampling</b> <b>network</b> with higher index of reliability results in more accurate characterization of contamination sources. Therefore the developed methodology provides a tool to select an appropriate hydrogeologic <b>sampling</b> <b>network</b> for more efficient characterizing of contamination sources.

40|$|Due to {{the large}} scales and {{limitations}} in accessing most online social networks, it is hard or infeasible to directly access them in {{a reasonable amount of}} time for studying and analysis. Hence, <b>network</b> <b>sampling</b> has emerged as a suitable technique to study and analyze real networks. The main goal of <b>sampling</b> online social <b>networks</b> is constructing a small scale <b>sampled</b> <b>network</b> which preserves the most important properties of the original network. In this paper, we propose two sampling algorithms for <b>sampling</b> online social <b>networks</b> using spanning trees. The first proposed sampling algorithm finds several spanning trees from randomly chosen starting nodes; then the edges in these spanning trees are ranked according to the number of times that each edge has appeared in the set of found spanning trees in the given <b>network.</b> The <b>sampled</b> <b>network</b> is then constructed as a sub-graph of the original network which contains a fraction of nodes that are incident on highly ranked edges. In order to avoid traversing the entire <b>network,</b> the second <b>sampling</b> algorithm is proposed using partial spanning trees. The second sampling algorithm is similar to the first algorithm except that it uses partial spanning trees.

40|$|Abstract- Groundwater quality {{sampling}} {{networks are}} an aid in characterizing groundwater contamination problems and {{in evaluating the}} performance of a remediation strategy. In this context the goal of a water quality <b>sampling</b> <b>network</b> is to estimate the extent and behavior of the contaminant plume. Estimating concentrations of a contaminant plume in an efficient way depends on both the location of the sampling wells and the times when the contaminant samples are taken. In response to this need two of the authors have proposed a methodology for the design of cost-effective water-quality sampling in which sampling locations and sampling times are decision variables (Herrera 1998, and Herrera and Pinder 1998). The proposed methodology combines stochastic simulation (also known as Monte Carlo simulation) and a Kalman filter to obtain <b>sampling</b> <b>network</b> designs that minimize (we explain in the text in which sense) the uncertainty of the predicted contaminant concentration estimates. One important feature of the methodology is that the number of samples that are taken at a given time {{does not have to be}} stipulated. Rather, the method chooses the ”optimal ” number of samples for each sampling time. In this paper we present an application of the approach to a hypothetical problem and a blueprint for and progress in the application of this methodology to a field problem...|$|E
