25|$|Hot-processed soaps {{are created}} by {{encouraging}} the saponification reaction by adding heat {{to speed up the}} reaction. In contrast with cold-pour soap which is poured into molds {{and for the most part}} only then saponifies, hot-process <b>soaping</b> for the most part saponifies the oils completely and only then is poured into molds.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diagnostic}} dilemma in otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a retractile testis from a testis {{that will not}} descend spontaneously into the scrotum. Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended testes and {{do not need to}} be operated on. In normal males, as the cremaster muscle relaxes or contracts, the testis moves lower or higher ("retracts") in the scrotum. This cremasteric reflex is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile testis high in the scrotum can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though there are various maneuvers used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, <b>soaping</b> the examiner's fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{night of}} October 30th (the night before Halloween) was a {{traditional}} day for pranks but {{became known as}} [...] "Devil's Night" [...] as Detroit youth went on a rampage in the 1980s. A tradition of light-hearted minor vandalism, such as <b>soaping</b> windows, had emerged in the 1930s, but by the 1980s it had become, said Mayor Coleman, [...] "a vision from hell." [...] The arson primarily {{took place in the}} inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well. The crimes became increasingly more destructive. Over 800 fires were set in the peak year 1984, overwhelming the city's fire department. Hundreds of vacant homes across the city were set ablaze by arsonists. The fires continued to happen but the number was sharply reduced by razing thousands of abandoned houses that often were used to sell drugs as well—5,000 in 1989-90 alone. Every year the city mobilizes [...] " [...] Angel's Night," [...] {{with tens of thousands of}} volunteers patrolling areas at high risk [...]|$|E
2500|$|The lye is {{dissolved}} in water. Then, the oils are heated, or melted {{if they are}} solid at room temperature. Once the oils are liquefied and the lye is fully dissolved in water, they are combined. This lye-fat mixture is mixed until the two phases (oils and water) are fully emulsified. Emulsification is most easily identified visually when the soap exhibits some level of [...] "trace," [...] which is the thickening of the mixture. Many modern-day amateur soapmakers use a stick blender to speed up this process. Varying levels of trace can occur at each stage of the saponification process. Depending on how additives affect trace, they may be added at light trace, medium trace, or heavy trace. After much stirring, the mixture turns to the consistency of a thin pudding. [...] "Trace" [...] corresponds roughly to viscosity. Essential oils and fragrance oils can be added with the initial <b>soaping</b> oils, but solid additives such as botanicals, herbs, oatmeal, or other additives are most commonly added at light trace, just as the mixture starts to thicken.|$|E

60|$|I {{sat down}} in the chair and closed my eyes. The barber <b>soaped</b> my face, and then took his razor and gave me a rake that well nigh threw me into convulsions. I jumped out of the chair: Dan and the doctor were both wiping blood off their faces and laughing.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund's heart set hard. He rose, with a shut mouth, {{and went}} {{across to the}} bathroom. There he started. The quaint figure of Gwen stood at the bowl, her back was towards him; she was {{sponging}} her face gingerly. Her hair, all blowsed from the pillow, was tied in a stiff little pigtail, standing out from her slender, childish neck. Her arms were bare to the shoulder. She wore a bodiced petticoat of pink flannelette, which hardly reached her knees. Siegmund felt slightly amused to see her stout little calves planted so firmly close together. She carefully sponged her cheeks, her pursed-up mouth, and her neck, <b>soaping</b> her hair, but not her ears. Then, very deliberately, she squeezed out the sponge and proceeded to wipe away the soap.|$|E

After being three or four months without walking twenty yards it is only natural one's feet should go at first. We ought to have brought some soap with us--I do not mean for washing, though we ought to have brought it for that--but for <b>soaping</b> the inside of our stockings. That is a first-rate dodge to prevent feet from blistering. Well, I must see about the fire. I will go up to those trees on the hillside. I daresay I shall be able to find some sticks there for lighting it. These bushes round here will do well enough when it is once fairly burning, but we shall have a great trouble to get them to light to begin with." ...|$|E

He is heartily with you--might I venture to say with us--on every point but one. He favors immersion! He has been so vile a sinner that he foolishly fears the more simple rite of your church will not make him wet enough. Would you believe it? his uninstructed scruples on the point are so gross and materialistic that he {{actually}} suggested <b>soaping</b> himself as a preparatory ceremony! I believe, however, if instead of sprinkling my friend, you would pour a generous basinful of water on his head--but now that I think of it in your enlightening presence I see that such a proceeding is quite out of the question. I fear we must let matters take the usual course, trusting to our later efforts to prevent the backsliding which may result." ...|$|E
