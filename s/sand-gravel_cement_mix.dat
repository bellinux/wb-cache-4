40|$|To improve cement {{penetration}} {{into the}} cancellous bone of the acetabulum in hip arthroplasty, sequential cementation of each anchoring hole may be feasible. Since this procedure creates laminations in the cement, we have determined {{the conditions under}} which such laminations affect the strength of the cement. Cement bars made at 2, 3 or 4 minutes after the start of <b>cement</b> <b>mixing</b> and with either dry laminations or laminations including blood or saline were tested for tensile strength. Solid unlaminated bars were used as references. Dry and saline laminations made up to 4 minutes after the start of <b>cement</b> <b>mixing</b> did not reduce the strength of the cement. However, there was a time-dependent decrease in cement strength if blood was entrapped in the interface. In such cases, there was a decrease in strength for laminations made at 4 minutes, at 3 minutes this was less pronounced and at 2 minutes no weakening at all was noted. Our findings indicate that a sequential cementation procedure is permissible as regards cement strength, provided it is performed with 2 - 3 minutes after the start of <b>cement</b> <b>mixing.</b> If the <b>cement</b> area is kept free from blood, the time may be prolonged up to 4 minutes, without the risk of weakening the cement strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the physical/chemical and water flow characteristics of various previous concrete mixes made of different concrete materials and their effectiveness in attenuating water pollution. Four pervious concrete mixes were prepared with Portland cement and with 15 % cementitious materials (slag, limestone powder, and fly ash) as a Portland cement replacement. All four pervious concrete mixtures had acceptable workability. The unit weight of the fresh pervious concrete mixtures ranged from 115. 9 lb/yd 3 to 119. 6 lb/yd 3, while the 28 day compressive strength of the pervious concrete mixes ranged from 1858 psi (mix with 15 % slag) to 2285 psi (pure <b>cement</b> <b>mix).</b> The compressive strength generally increased with unit weight and decreased with total porosity (air void ratio). The permeability of the four mixes generally decreased with unit weight and increased with total porosity. The permeability coefficients ranged from 340 in. /hr for the pure <b>cement</b> <b>mix</b> to 642 in. /hr for the mix with 15 % slag. The total porosities of the four pervious concrete mixes ranged from 24. 00 % (mix with 15 % slag) to 31. 41 % (pure <b>cement</b> <b>mix)</b> as measured by the flatbed scanner test method, while the porosities ranged from 18. 93 % (mix with 15 % slag) to 24. 15 % (pure <b>cement</b> <b>mix)</b> as measured by the RapidAir method. The total porosities of the four pervious concrete mixes measured by the flatbed scanner method were higher than those measured by the Rapid Air method, but the specific surface areas measured by the flatbed scanner method were all lower than those measured by the Rapid Air method. For the pollution abatement experiments, mixes with fly ash and limestone powder removed about 30 % of the input naphthalene concentration, while the mix with slag only removed 0. 5 % of the influent naphthalene concentration. The water volume balance showed that less than 1 % of the water added was retained in the experimental column setup...|$|R

Mix ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 and percentage replacement level: 0, 10, 20, and 30 percents of cement by the various pozzolanas were used. Concrete cubes of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were cast, cured in aggressive media (CuSO 4 and NaCl solutions) and crushed at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days to determine their compressive strength hence durability. Test results indicated that fly ash, calcined clay, and rice husk ash were pozzolanic. Compressive strength increases for calcined clay as its contents increases from 10 %- 30 % signifying improved durability, while it is the opposite for fly ash and rice husk ash. All three pozzolanas showed improved durability, with fly ash been the most workable and calcined clay the least workable. Though, the results of the compressive strength of the concrete cubes made from portland-pozzolana cement (PPC) were not higher than that of the control (0 % Portland cement replacement), they were all higher than the minimum strength specified in the British Standard code (ASTM C 618, 1992). It was also observed that NaCl solution have a more severe effect on the durability for all three pozzolanas.

40|$|Abstract. Soil {{condition}} {{is a major}} impact factor {{on the strength of}} cemented soil. In order to study the relationship between the soil conditions and the strength of cemented soil in deep mixing column under the circumstance of thick soft clay in the Nansha area, the uniaxial and unconfined compressive strength tests were carried out, from which stress-strain curves of the cemented soil and strength-depth curves of column body were obtained under three different soil conditions. Analyzing these curves, conclusions can be made that the strength of different parts of cement soil from deep mixing pile varies greatly in the Nansha area. Among the samples, the <b>cement</b> <b>mixed</b> with silty clay has the highest strength, while the lowest one is the <b>cement</b> <b>mixed</b> with mud. Besides the above results, compressive strength values(fcu) of cement soil is determined, which can be of great significance to calculate the bearing capacity of deep mixing piles...|$|R

Sb and S in the <b>cement</b> raw <b>mix.</b> One reference mixture and four modified mixtures, containing 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 % w/w of the above mineral, were examined. The reactivity of the mixture, the sintering reactions, and the structure of the products were studied. In addition. the hydration rate and some typical properties of cements, produced from the modified clinkers. were measured. It was concluded that the added mineral improves the burnability of the cement raw mixture without affecting significantly the hydration rate and the cement properties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper the ageing singularities of dry <b>cement</b> <b>mixes</b> for finishing purposes and additives for retarding this process has been determinated. Ordinary and quickly hardening Portland cements absorb H 2 O and CO 2 more than white cement â about 70 Â % â 75 Â % and 30 Â % â 38 Â % per month of innitial mass, respectively.
