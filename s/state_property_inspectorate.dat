In the present paper we investigate the relations between classical properties and connectedness for closure spaces.

40|$|We {{introduce}} classical properties {{using the}} concept of super selection rule, i. e. two properties are separated by a superselection rule iff there do not exist 'superposition states' related to these two properties. Then we show that the classical <b>properties</b> of a <b>state</b> <b>property</b> system correspond exactly to the clopen subsets of the corresponding closure space. Thus connected closure spaces correspond precisely to <b>state</b> <b>property</b> systems for which the elements 0 and I are the only classical properties, the so called pure nonclassical <b>state</b> <b>property</b> systems. The main result is a decomposition theorem, which allows us to split a <b>state</b> <b>property</b> system {{into a number of}} 'pure nonclassical <b>state</b> <b>property</b> systems' and a 'totally classical <b>state</b> <b>property</b> system'. This decomposition theorem for a <b>state</b> <b>property</b> system is the translation of a decomposition theorem for the corresponding closure space into its connected components.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the focus}} is on a philosophical and historical reflection on dynamics, in relation to the basic assumptions underlying state-determined systems. A basic assumption of a state-determined system {{is that some of the}} <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> of the previous state in a sense anticipate on the changed <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> in the current state. This idea plays an important role in the analysis of dynamics in history; such anticipatory <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> are often called potentialities. Within Cognitive Science one of the problems identified is the problem of realism, i. e., how do internal mental states relate to the real world. This issue also applies to potentialities as assumed <b>state</b> <b>properties.</b> If there is no relation to the physical world they seem to have a ghost-like character, which is not desirable, especially when it would make their occurrence unpredictable. Potentialities as postulated <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> may have relationships to other <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> of the <b>state</b> in which they occur; they can be said to be realised by these other <b>state</b> <b>properties.</b> One often used way in which it can be specified how potentialities indicating the change of a state relate to other <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> in the same state is by first-order differential equations...|$|R

30|$|To specify <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> for system {{components}} in TTL, ontologies are used which are specified {{by a number}} of sorts, sorted constants, variables, functions and predicates. <b>State</b> <b>properties</b> are specified based on such ontology using a standard multi-sorted first-order predicate language.

That is, the ontologies IntOnt(A), InOnt(A), OutOnt(A), and ExtOnt(A) are used to express respectively internal, input, output, and external <b>state</b> <b>properties</b> of agent A. Input ontologies contain elements for describing perceptions of an agent from the external world (e.g., observed(a) means that a component has an observation of <b>state</b> <b>property</b> a), whereas output ontologies describe actions and communications of agents (e.g., act(b) represents action b performed by an agent in its environment).|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of a <b>state</b> <b>property</b> system was introduced to formalize in a complete way the operational content of the Geneva-Brussels approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics [7, 8, 9], and the category of <b>state</b> <b>property</b> systems was proven to be equivalence to the category of closure spaces [9, 10].
