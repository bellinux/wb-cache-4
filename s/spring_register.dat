This coefficient was counted for composite and steel leaf springs. Basic exploational parameters of leaf springs were compared as well as basic advantages of applying to vehicles building of composite materials were analysed. Analyses lead to conclusion that composite leaf springs in comparison to steel springs: about three times better suppress of tremblings, they are about five times lighter and give smaller dynamic burdens of vehicles body.

40|$|Success of Mediterranean dry areas {{restoration}} with oaks is {{a challenging}} goal. Testing eco-techniques that mimic beneficial effects of natural structures and ameliorate stress contributes to positive solutions to overcoming establishment barriers. We ran a factorial experiment {{in a dry}} area, testing two levels of solid wall transmission of tube shelters (60 and 80 %) plus a control mesh, and two depths (shallow and 15 cm depth) of placing either planted seedlings or acorns of Quercus ilex. Microclimate of the planting or sowing spots was characterized by measuring photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and relative humidity. Plant response was evaluated in terms of survival, phenology, acorn emergence and photochemical efficiency (measured through chlorophyll fluorescence). We hypothesize that tube shelters and deep planting improve Q. ilex post-planting and sowing performance because of the combined effects of reducing excessive radiation and improving access to moist soil horizons. Results show that temperature and PAR was reduced, and relative humidity increased, in deep spots. Midsummer photochemical efficiency indicates highest level of stress for oaks in 80 % light transmission shelter.

All derive from the high style popular at the end of the nineteenth century: Eastlake, Italianate, Shingle, Craftsman, Moorish, and the Classical, Romanesque and Colonial Revivals. Although the high styles are of a purer form in these houses than is usually found in Provo, an eclectic attitude still dominates with several styles often being combined into one residence. Characteristic of all these buildings is a compactness and a low earth-hugging quality, which is typical of Provo's architecture but antithetical to the optimistic verticality of Salt Lake's Victorian buildings. As is true of the majority of Provo's residences, these houses are made primarily of brick, including elaborate ornamental coursing and trim. The Victorian fascination with a variety of rich materials is visible only in the use of masonry in the foundations, lintels and arches of these buildings and in the extensive use of leaded and stained glass in the windows. Some of the most ornate fenestration to be found in Provo is contained in these buildings.

40|$|This comment {{consists}} essentially {{of three}} well defined partes: the is first physical geography, the second hydrogeology {{and the last}} is hydrogeochemistry. The AA., after a preliminary and organic geological investigation which permitted {{the preparation of the}} map (Fig. 3) in which the various geolithologic units are corelated, then made a particular study of the principal geomorphologic structures present in the entire basin. The multiple presence of such structure is justified in the geological difference of the formations present. Among the typical structures of the basic vulcanites was the evidence of cushion lava, block lava and tabularcolumn lava; among the typical acid vulcanites are the stratoid lava and the cave like structures. Also the evidence were the pointed tabular structures, the concave tabular structures and the dip-shop, tabular structures present in the series of lava flows, and of porous stone deposits and sea deposits in alternate stratus. The part relative to the hydrogeology was preceded by an examination of the climatology and the hydrometry of the basinc. Five meteorological rain measuring stations and two thermometeorological rain measuring stations were used for this study and the following information were gathered: - the maximum precipitations were concentrated in the late autumn period, in winter and in the early spring; the maximum aridity was during the summer months; there is a great irregularity in the intensity of the precipitations; within the area of the basin proportional differences of values of precipitation due to altitudes do not exist. The hydrometric characteristics of the basin have been brought to light using the information of hydrometric data given by the station at Reinamare.

40|$|Wave {{storms and}} river inputs {{have been found}} to be the {{dominant}} forcing mechanism of sediment transport in continental shelves dominated by medium to large rivers around the world (e. g. Drake and Cacchione, 1985; Sherwood et al., 1994; Ogston and Stemberg, 1999; Traykovski et al., 2000; Wadman and McNinch, 2008) and in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Jiménez et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2001; Guillén et al., 2002, 2006; Palanques et al., 2002, 2011; Ferré et al., 2005; Roussiez et al., 2005; Ulses et al., 2008). However, the contribution of “small” Mediterranean river systems in fine-grained sediment dynamics is not well known. Flood and storm events redistribute not only sediment but also all the associated matter as well, such a heavy metals, which are indicators of the impact of industrial and urban activities. For these reasons, the present thesis project involves studying the dynamics of sediments and associated heavy metals across the inner continental shelf off the Besòs River (Barcelona), and in particular determining the effect of floods and storms in a littoral system affected by industrial and urban activities. To this end, several oceanographic surveys were carried out between 20 and 40 m water depths in the Barcelona continental shelf to obtain a variety of data: to register vertical hydrographical profiles (temperature, salinity and turbidity); to record time series of physical parameters (currents, salinity, temperature, turbidity and seabed variation) by deploying oceanographic equipment; and to take sediment samples (short cores and Van Veen grabs) and suspended and downward particulate matter from water samples and sediment traps for further sedimentological and geochemical analysis. The time period of the present study comprised three seasons, from autumn 2007 to spring 2008, which showed distinct features between them. The purpose of section 3 was to describe the main hydrographic and hydrodynamic conditions during the study period to support the interpretation of sediment transport processes. Three different periods in terms of storm and river activity matched the natural seasons of the year: The period comprised between end of September 2007 and December 2007 (autumn) was characterized by an intense frequency of northeastern-eastern storms mostly coupled with high but short river discharges and a convergence of the across-shelf current between 20 m and 30 m water depths; between January and early March 2008 (winter), the wave and river activity and frequency were reduced significantly with offshore currents dominating the across component; and finally, from March to mid June 2008 (spring), specially between May and June 2008, river discharges lasted more than one month and occurred under low wave energy conditions or in conjunction with S-SE and SW wave storms. The sediment response to the forcing conditions observed during the study period was analyzed in section 4. The grain size and porosity measurements taken in all the sediment samples collected during the experiment (sediment cores, sediment grabs and sediment traps) showed a high spatial and temporal variability of the bottom sediment properties, downward sediment fluxes and near-bottom sediment concentrations across the inner-shelf. Those changes were associated to periods of high wave shear stress, river and current energy and therefore, were more intense in autumn 2007 and spring 2008. However, an across shelf spatial variability was observed during this period which was associated to the sediment availability (i. e. critical shear stress gradients). As a result, the same storm produced larger nearbottom sediment concentration in deeper waters due to the limitation on the availability of resuspendable sediment in the near-shore. The resultant sediment dynamics across the inner shelf and results in sediment transport modeling during a resuspension event were then addressed in section 5. In the inner shelf off Barcelona, the general circulation of sediment transport was mainly directed towards the southwest (along-shelf) during the study period, however, the seaward component was considerably relevant and favored the segregation of coarse and fine sediment from the nearshore towards deeper areas. Nonetheless, noticeable differences in sediment transport patterns were observed across the inner shelf. Nearbottom sediment transport at 20 m water depth was mainly offshore, while in deeper parts of the inner shelf the along-shelf component dominated the sediment transport. The resulting sediment transport and its variability across the shelf, deposited riverine and storm-derived fine sediment in an along-shelf path towards the southwest between 20 m and 30 m water depth and only under the strong storms were transferred seaward toward the 40 m water depth site and to deeper areas. These differences had in turn a strong seasonal component related to the availability of fine sediments from river inputs and the energy of waves and currents. In this sense, autumn and <b>spring</b> <b>registered</b> events affected mostly at 20 m water depth and autumn and early winter months were more energetic at deeper waters reversing the sing of sediment transport gradients across the shelf. During this event, the sediment transport model captured adequately the transport rates across the inner shelf and allowed the estimation of the integrated vertical sediment flux in 10 meters of the water column above the seabed. Consequently with the observed and modelled pattern of sediment transport, the seabed variation was higher at 30 m than at 20 m water depth, with a total seabed erosion of about 10 cm and 4 cm, respectively. The implications of the sediment dynamics during the study period in the transference of heavy metals from the Besòs River across the shelf was analyzed in section 6. The Besòs River introduced heavy metal pollutants into the nearshore continuously associated with the regular regime and sporadically during increments in river discharge. Only during high wave and current energy the anthropogenic contamination, previously deposited in the shallow inner-shelf, reached deeper areas. As a result, the most contaminated sediment accumulated southwestward from the river and sewer mouths along the inner shelf decreasing offshore. The most affected area associated to the Besòs river influence was located around the tripod sites, especially between 20 m and 30 m water depths decreasing offshore. Finally, the main conclusions and proposals for future research of this thesis are discussed in section 7. In it, the importance of "small" Mediterranean river systems in the transfer of sediment across the continental shelf is highlighted from the sediment transport events observed during the study period. El oleaje durante temporales y los aportes fluviales han sido considerados como los mecanismos de forzamiento dominantes del transporte de sedimento en las plataformas continentales afectadas por ríos medianos y grandes en todo el mundo (por ejemplo, Drake y Cacchione, 1985; Sherwood et al., 1994; Ogston y Stemberg, 1999; Traykovski et al., 2000; Wadman y McNinch, 2008) y en el Mediterráneo noroccidental (Jiménez et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2001; Guillén et al., 2002, 2006; Palanques et al., 2002, 2011; Ferré et al., 2005; Roussiez et al., 2005; Ulses et al., 2008). Sin embargo, la contribución de "pequeños" sistemas fluviales mediterráneos en la dinámica de sedimento está poco estudiada. El oleaje y las tormentas no solo redistribuyen sedimentos si no también toda la materia asociada, así como, metales pesados, que son indicadores del impacto de las actividades industriales y urbanas. Por estas razones, el presente proyecto de tesis implica el estudio de la dinámica de sedimento y metales pesados asociados a través de la plataforma continental del río Besòs (Barcelona), y en particular, determinar el efecto de los temporales y tormentas en un sistema litoral afectado por actividades industriales y urbanas. Para este fin, varias campañas oceanográficas se llevaron a cabo entre 20 y 40 m de profundidad en la plataforma continental de Barcelona donde se tomaron gran variedad de datos y muestras: perfiles verticales hidrográficos (temperatura, salinidad y turbidez); series temporales de parámetros físicos (corrientes, salinidad, temperatura, turbidez y la variación del fondo) mediante el anclaje de equipos oceanográficos, y muestras de sedimento (testigos cortos de sedimento y dragas Van Veen) y de partículas en suspensión (a partir de muestras de agua y trampas de sedimentos) para análisis sedimentológicos y geoquímicos. El período de estudio comprendió tres estaciones, desde otoño de 2007 a primavera de 2008, que mostraron características distintas entre ellas. En la sección 3 se describen las principales condiciones hidrográficas y la hidrodinámica durante el período de estudio para apoyar la interpretación de los procesos de transporte sedimentario. Se identificaron tres periodos diferentes en función de la actividad fluvial y la del oleaje que coincidieron con las estaciones naturales del año: El período comprendido entre finales de septiembre de 2007 y diciembre de 2007 (otoño) se caracterizó por una intensa frecuencia de temporales del noreste-este junto con incrementos en la descarga del río y una convergencia de la componente across-shelf de la corriente entre 20 m y 30 m de profundidad; entre enero y principios de marzo de 2008 (invierno), la actividad y la frecuencia del oleaje y del río se redujeron significativamente con predominio de la componente offshore de la corriente; y, por último, de marzo a mediados de junio de 2008 (primavera), especialmente entre mayo y junio de 2008, las descargas fluviales se intensificaron durante más de un mes produciéndose en condiciones de baja energía del oleaje o en combinación con temporales del S-SE o SW. La respuesta del sedimento del fondo a las condiciones de forzamiento observadas durante el período de estudio se analizó en la sección 4. El tamaño medio de grano y la porosidad de todas las muestras de sedimento recogidas durante el experimento (testigos, dragas y trampas) mostraron una alta variabilidad espacial y temporal. Los flujos verticales de sedimento y la concentración de sedimento en suspensión cerca del fondo también variaron a través de la plataforma interna durante el periodo de estudio. Estos cambios se asociaron a eventos de fuerte oleaje y corrientes y a descargas del río y, por tanto, fueron más intensas en otoño de 2007 y primavera de 2008. Sin embargo, se observó una variabilidad espacial a través de la plataforma interna durante estos eventos que se asoció a la disponibilidad de sedimento (es decir, a gradientes de “critical shear stress”). Como resultado, una misma tormenta produjo una concentración de sedimento cerca del fondo mayor en aguas más profundas debido a que la disponibilidad de sedimento fino era limitada en aguas someras. En la sección 5, se analiza la dinámica de sedimento resultante a través de la plataforma interna y los resultados obtenidos en el modelado del transporte de sedimento durante un evento de resuspensión. En la plataforma interna de Barcelona, la circulación general del transporte sedimentario se dirigió principalmente hacia el suroeste (along-shelf) durante el período de estudio, sin embargo, la componente onshore fue bastante relevante y favoreció la segregación de sedimento grueso y fino desde la costa hacia zonas más profundas. Sin embargo, se observaron diferencias notables en el transporte de sedimento a través de la plataforma interna. A 20 m de profundidad, el transporte de sedimento fue principalmente onshore, mientras que zonas más profundas de la plataforma interna la componente along-shelf dominó el transporte. Este patrón de transporte, depositó sedimentos del río y depositados previamente en una trayectoria along-shelf hacia el suroeste entre 20 m y 30 m de profundidad y sólo durante los temporales más fuertes fueron transportados hacia 40 m de profundidad y probablemente a zonas más profundas de la plataforma continental. Estas diferencias tuvieron a su vez una fuerte componente estacional relacionada con la disponibilidad de sedimentos fluviales finos y la energía del oleaje y las corrientes. En este sentido, en otoño y primavera los eventos registrados afectaron mayormente a 20 m de profundidad y a finales de otoño y comienzos del invierno fueron más activos en aguas profundas, cambiando el gradiente del transporte sedimentario a través de la plataforma. Durante este evento, el modelo de transporte sedimentario capturó adecuadamente las tasas de transporte a través de la plataforma y permitió estimar el flujo vertical integrado de sedimento en 10 metros de columna de agua sobre el fondo marino. En consecuencia con el patrón de transporte de sedimento observado y modelado, la variación del fondo marino fue superior a 30 m que a 20 m de profundidad, con una erosión de alrededor de 10 cm y 4 cm, respectivamente. Las implicaciones de la dinámica sedimentaria durante el período de estudio en la transferencia de metales pesados des del río Besòs a través de la plataforma se analizó en la sección 6. El río Besòs introdujo metales pesados cerca de la costa continuamente durante el régimen de descarga regular y esporádicamente en incrementos de caudal del río. Sólo durante las condiciones más altas de oleaje y corrientes la contaminación antropogénica, previamente depositada en la parte somera de la plataforma, alcanzó zonas más profundas. Como resultado, el sedimento más contaminado se acumuló hacia el suroeste del río y de las desembocaduras de los pluviales. La zona más afectada asociada a la influencia del río Besòs se localizó especialmente entre 20 m y 30 m de profundidad disminuyendo en profundidad. Por último, las principales conclusiones y propuestas de futura investigación de la presente tesis se abordan en la sección 7. En ella, se destaca la importancia de "pequeños" sistemas fluviales mediterráneos en la transferencia de sedimento a través de la plataforma continental que se manifiesta a partir de la secuencia de eventos de transporte sedimentario observada durante el periodo de estudio.
