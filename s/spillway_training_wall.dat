40|$|ABSTRACT. Many aging {{watershed}} dams require hazard classifications changes. As a result, these dams may {{no longer}} meet state and federal dam safety regulations because of inadequate spillway capacity and flood protection. Rehabilitation options for these embankments are often limited due to encroaching urban development. Roller compacted concrete (RCC) stepped spillways are a popular choice in these situations because the spillway capacity can be increased {{with little or no}} additional changes to the embankment dimensions. RCC stepped spillways are also selected because of the cost and time savings in the construction of these structures. Design engineers require more information about the inception point location and the approach velocity and energy dissipation in the spillway chute. These elements are important for properly dimensioning the <b>spillway</b> <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> and stilling basin. Research and more specifically design guidelines for RCC stepped spillways applied to small earthen embankments have been limited. A two‐dimensional, physical model was constructed to evaluate the inception point, velocities, air concentrations, and energy dissipation in a 4 (H) : 1 (V) slope spillway chute having 38 mm (1. 5 in.) high steps. Model unit discharges ranging from 0. 11 m 3 s- 1 m- 1 (1. 2 cfs ft- 1) to 0. 82 m 3 s- 1 m- 1 (8. 8 cfs ft- 1) were tested. The findings from this research show that a relationship developed by H. Chanson can be used to determine the inception point location on stepped chutes with Froude surface roughness (F*) ranging from 10 to 100 for slopes as flat as 4 (H) : 1 (V). Additionally, air concentrations near the inception point are approximately 0 % and rapidly increase to 10 % slightly downstream of the inception point. These air concentrations continue to increase gradually to a constant as the flo...|$|R

40|$|Stepped chutes are {{commonly}} used for overtopping protection for embankment dams. Aerated flow is commonly associated with stepped chutes if the chute has sufficient length. The aeration and turbulence of the flow can create {{a significant amount of}} splash over the <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> if not appropriately accounted for {{in the design of the}} structure. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) -Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Technical Release 60 Earth Dams and Reservoirs, a structural spillway should be designed to pass the freeboard hydrograph such that it does not cause serious damage to the embankment or the structure itself. For stepped spillways, researchers have suggested the <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> height equal a design factor, ranging from 1. 4 to 1. 5, multiplied by the bulked flow depth, y 90. Yet, literature suggest that the design factor is a recommendation with little to no research provided to actually quantify what the design factor should be. Researchers at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Hydraulic Engineering Research Unit (HERU) in Stillwater, OK conducted a series of tests in a near prototype scale stepped chute facility to determine the design factor for <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> necessary to minimize the erosive splash that could result from the aerated flow. Tests were conducted in a stepped chute with a slope of 18. 4 degree for a wide range of skimming flow conditions. Data indicates for a step height, h, to critical flow depth, dc, ratio of less than 0. 4, the design factor for the <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> is 1. 4, thus the <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> height is equal to 1. 4 y 90. For h/dc ≥ 0. 4, the design factor increases from 1. 4 at h/dc = 0. 4 up to 2. 0 for h/dc = 1. 0. These design factors are recommended for use on chute slopes ranging from 10 to 30 degrees. This research is intended to assist design engineers with appropriately designing stepped chute <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> to minimize the erosive splash that can occur as a result of aerated, turbulent flow...|$|R

Work {{on the river}} <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> was concentrated in 1907, following extensive siltation of the river opening. The dredge Antleon was based there during the 1920s, when in 1924, the steamer Benandra was wrecked at the entrance. Work on the break walls was completed in 1925 when huge storms required some repairs to the <b>training</b> <b>walls.</b> The port gained greater significance in 1924 when a stone quarry was opened and used to supply granite for the pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the stone for the Cenotaph in Martin Place. The Public Works Department built a wharf adjacent to the quarry fore ease of use. Extensions to the southern <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> were undertaken between 1931 and 1933, with major additional works from 1946-1954. [...] The bar is dangerous to shipping {{and as a result}} of its hazards for smaller ships and because it prevented access by larger ones, the major settlement in the area was first developed at nearby Broulee. In 1841 a flood cleared the bar and the town of Moruya, now accessible to shipping, developed at the expense of the settlement at Broulee despite later recurring problems with the bar, not least as it was the easist point to access the rich Araluen goldfields from the 1850s.|$|R
40|$|To improve {{navigability}} of {{the major}} access channel into Shanghai Harbor, a large-scale Deep Waterway Project {{was carried out in}} the North Passage (NP) of the Yangtze Estuary. In this paper, we investigate how the navigational works affected morphological changes of this channel, {{as well as those of}} the adjacent North Channel (NC), Hengsha East Shoal (HES), Jiuduansha Shoal (JDS), and the South Passage (SP). Morphological changes were assessed by analyzing digitized bathymetric data of this area prior to and after execution of the engineering works. The qualitative relations between these changes, along with the hydrodynamic changes as a result of the construction of engineering works, were subsequently investigated. The results reveal that the construction of <b>training</b> <b>walls,</b> groins and jetties resulted in decreased ebb transport in the upper reach of the NP and increased ebb transport in the upper reach of the SP. In turn, this led to intensive upstream erosion with large amounts of sediment transported seaward in the SP and associated sedimentation in the downstream area. At the same time, intense siltation occurred in the upper reach of the NP, while the main channel of the NP mainly experienced erosion caused by the construction of <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> and groins that concentrated ebb flow in the main channel. The waterway deepened significantly in previously shallow areas. Small tidal channels in the HES, which used to connect the NP and the NC, were cut off by the northern <b>training</b> <b>wall.</b> Consequently, residual flow in the middle reach of the NC flowed directly toward the northern bank of the HES, leading to local erosion. Flow obstruction by the southern <b>training</b> <b>wall</b> reduced the upstream propagation of the flood tide in the SP. As a result, a collection of small flood channels evolved under the flushing action of flood currents in the JDS, preventing the natural trend of horizontal extension of the JDS.

40|$|The Seaway {{entrance}} is a tidal inlet {{located on the}} Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia). Before the 80 s, the entrance was highly variable in terms of inlet location and sand bar characteristics. The Seaway stabilisation with two <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> combined with an artificial sand bypassing system were completed in 1986 with the aims of fixing the entrance, maintaining a safe navigable channel, preventing shoreline erosion {{to the north and}} a buildup of sand to the south. Despite these training works, the dynamics of the Seaway is still poorly understood: channel infilling problems and navigation issues remain. For these reasons, the present study aims to develop a comprehensive model of the entrance to be used for further dredging and training work issues. The present investigation is carried out in two stages. The first stage is based on historic aerial photograph analysis of the Seaway before training works. It shows that the mouth was periodically driven northward by the longshore drift, with an average cycle time of 10 years. The second stage is based on numerical modelling after training works. Refined Delft 3 D modelling is undertaken with a 2 DH approach on the Seaway area, taking into account the <b>training</b> <b>walls</b> and the sand bypassing system. This local model is coupled with MIKE 21 implemented on a regional scale to provide accurate tide and flow forcing at the boundaries. After calibration, the analysis of flow patterns shows that the Gold Coast Seaway is ebb-dominated and that the more intense flow velocities are observed in the northern channel. Morphological evolution of the inlet is also investigated with a qualitative approach.
