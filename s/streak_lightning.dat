40|$|A ball {{lightning}} {{is a natural}} phenomenon that occurs at a <b>streak</b> <b>lightning</b> stroke with its action by thermal and magnetic energy releasing around the <b>streak</b> <b>lightning</b> channel and transforming, in the end, the surrounding air into a steam cloud that transits into ferroelectric state under the magnetic field action...|$|E
40|$|We {{have gained}} an {{adequate}} understanding of fireball structure basically unavailable to the quantum theory. According {{to the observations}} fireball is a luminous spherical object freely floating in the earth atmosphere and featuring a high sensitivity to external disturbances. External influences lead to an explosive disintegration of fireball. However another, non-explosive variant of fireball disintegration is possible due to its complete “de-excitation”. To date there is {{a variety of different}} hypotheses concerning this phenomenon nature [1 - 7]. During elaboration of such hypotheses there was a number of interesting experimental data obtained. However, an adequate understanding of the essence of this phenomenon has not been gained yet. The majority of current hypotheses for fireball nature are {{based on the fact that}} the observable luminescence is of electromagnetic origin. This topic discussion covers such naturally related phenomena as St. Elmo's fire, crown discharge, atmospheric <b>streak</b> <b>lightning</b> and even Tunguska explosion. What can be common in these phenomena? It is beyond doubt that they have one common factor, that is, luminescence...|$|E

60|$|Another <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> {{followed}} by more thunder interrupted the conversation. Then the wind seemed to veer around, {{and the rain}} came swishing in under the tree where the four lads had been resting.|$|R
60|$|Then came {{a vision}} of Soames' home as it now was, and must be hereafter. The <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> had flashed its clear uncanny gleam on bare bones with {{grinning}} spaces between, the disguising flesh was gone....|$|R
6000|$|... "He be d----d," [...] muttered the plain-speaking Injin, {{as long as}} I {{could hear}} him. As soon as {{released}} from his presence, <b>Streak</b> o' <b>Lightning</b> continued his examination, though a little vexed at the undramatical character of the interruption.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{secret of}} {{painting}} race-horses lies in quickness. Their movements are so alert, {{they are so}} full of nervous energy, that the artist {{has to have a}} hand like a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> to catch the pose while it lasts".|$|R
60|$|He {{disappeared}} like a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> up the gangway, terrified {{lest the}} steward should come and catch {{him at his}} tricks. For later on I saw the steward send other larks flying for demanding more than one-fifty. The brat.|$|R
50|$|Moore's <b>lightning</b> <b>streaks</b> are <b>lightning</b> type <b>streaks</b> (photopsia) (seen to the {{temporal}} side) due to sudden {{movement in the}} dark. They are generally caused by shock waves in the vitreous humor hitting the retina. The implication is that the vitreous is softer than normal, generally {{this is not a}} cause for alarm provided they are momentary, occur only in the dark and are due to sudden head movements (acceleration). Professional advice should be sought in cases of doubt, as retinal detachment, a serious condition, also can cause flashes in the eye.|$|R
60|$|Bumpus {{came out}} like an insane thunderbolt, and Corrie like a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning.</b> Instantaneously {{the flash of}} the pistol, {{accompanied}} by its report and a deep growl from Bumpus, increased the resemblance to these meteorological phenomena, and three savages lay stunned upon the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{threw down}} a biskit so sudden that Joseph, {{thinking}} it was a stone, went off like a <b>streak</b> o' <b>lightning</b> with 'is tail between 'is legs and yelping his 'ardest. Most men would ha' looked a bit foolish, but Bob Pretty didn't turn a hair.|$|R
60|$|The female sheep-dog, almost flat {{with the}} ground from speed, emerged from the dust, wild with hair and anxiety, white on the cheeks and chest and top of the head, and grey {{in the body and}} the very little tail, and passed them like a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning.</b>|$|R

60|$|In {{a twinkle}} the whole {{manner of the}} mustang changed, and, before Ralph could reach his big brother's side, the steed was off like a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning,</b> with Dan {{clinging}} fast to his neck. Over some low brush the pair went, and then under some tall pines and out of sight.|$|R
60|$|The captain {{broke off}} short, for a vivid <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> flared {{all over the}} upper masts of the ship. The thunder-clap was as sharp as it was deafening, and for the moment all on board thought the Columbia had surely been struck. Then came a downpour which made even the boldest of the sailors seek shelter.|$|R
50|$|Sparks {{literally}} fly {{between the}} eyes of two characters when they are fighting, or simply glaring at each other (in this case, their eyes may also be connected by a <b>lightning</b> <b>streak).</b>|$|R

5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} <b>streaks</b> of <b>lightning</b> from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|R
6000|$|The {{speed of}} this train was {{sometimes}} a mile a minute, I think; and I am sure I was never on any railroad in America where I {{was given a}} shorter {{time to get out}} for something to eat than we had at York. Jone and I are generally pretty quick about such things, but we had barely time to get back to our carriage before that [...] "Flying Scotsman" [...] went off like a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning.</b>|$|R
60|$|A wild exultation took him, {{an insane}} desire to laugh. Surely was sword-play the merriest game that was ever devised for man's entertainment. He {{straightened}} his arm, and his steel went {{out like a}} <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning.</b> But for the dagger on which he caught its edge, the blade had assuredly pierced the captain's heart. And now, fighting still, Garnache called to Valerie. He had need of her assistance to make his preparations ere others came.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first seven}} {{cartoons}} originated the classic opening line which was later {{adopted by the}} Superman radio series and in the live-action television series a decade later: [...] "Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!" [...] (The radio series also eventually used the cartoon series' theme music.) However, for the final two Fleischer-produced cartoons and {{the first of the}} eight Famous Studios-produced cartoons, the opening was changed to [...] "Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to soar higher than any plane!". For the remaining Famous Studios-produced cartoons, the opening line was changed again to [...] "Faster than a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning!</b> More powerful than the pounding surf! Mightier than a roaring hurricane!" [...] For international prints of Superman cartoons starting with [...] "Eleventh Hour" [...] the opening line is [...] "Faster than a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning!</b> More powerful than the pounding surf! Mightier than a roaring hurricane!" [...] This series also featured a slight variation of the now-classic exclamation (also from the radio series): [...] "Up in the sky, look! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!".|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{it changed}} its plan, and {{stretched}} out its sinewy length to its longest stride. Pizarro fell in with the idea, encouraged it with his long sharp spurs and heavy lash, and away they went over the mighty plain like a <b>streak</b> of personified <b>lightning.</b>|$|R
40|$|Thunderstorms hold a {{peculiar}} fascination for me. The dark clouds arising suddenly {{out of the}} west; a strange stillness {{in the air as}} if the world had stopped in anticipation of some portentous event; the pale, eerie light in the atmosphere which gradually turns into darkness as the clouds draw near; the rumble of distant thunder and intermittent flashes lightning across the horizon and the consequent climax in wind, rain, and bright, sharp <b>streaks</b> of <b>lightning</b> with crackling thunder, gives to me, instead of fear, a reeling of loneliness, a depressed, awful feeling...|$|R
50|$|That {{night they}} face a storm and have no choice other than taking shelter in the old cottage. They lie down with Timmy {{and in the middle}} of the night Anne sees three or four figures {{outlined}} in the lightning. She tells George but George tells her that they were just trees. But when the next <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> came, they saw a figure of a man which had come close to the cottage, looking through the window. After the storm the girls reach their camp and the next morning they are fresh and happy.|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} go back now; but she wished--how she wished!--that it were over. A heat-drop splashed her glove. She crossed the lane and opened the Firs gate. Throwing frightened glances at the sky, she hastened down the drive. The purple was couched like a pall on the treetops, and these had begun to sway and moan as though {{struggling}} and weeping at their fate. Some splashes of warm rain were falling. A <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> tore the firmament. Mrs. Pendyce rushed into the porch covering her ears with her hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{off like}} a runaway <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> the very instant I had the ground under my paws, and, of course, young Mr. Fox started after me; but I had a good three yards the start of him, and to a rabbit who holds the record for running, as I do, that was a mighty long distance. Then again I knew all the crooks and turns in {{our part of the}} big woods, while Grandfather Fox's {{grandson}} wasn't very well acquainted {{in that part of the}} country.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The affair did {{not come}} to blows,' has said Mr 'Enderson. 'You may trust that bird to take care of himself, my dear. When I came upon the scene the cat was {{crouching}} in a corner, with his fur bristling and his back up, while Polly, standing before 'im, was telling 'im not to move or he would shoot. Nor did he move, till I 'ad seized the parrot and replaced him in the cage, when he shot upstairs like a <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning.</b> By sheer force of character that excellent bird 'ad won the bloodless victory. I drink to 'im!' ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{sufficiently}} awkward; for, by going {{near enough to}} give a warning in a low voice, and have that warning followed by {{a change in the}} discourse, we should be betraying ourselves, and might fall into serious danger. At the very moment the clergyman was thus speaking I saw the masked head of <b>Streak</b> o' <b>Lightning</b> appearing through an opening in some small pines that grew a little {{in the rear of the}} wagon, a position that enabled him to hear every syllable that was uttered. I was afraid to act myself, and trusted to the greater experience of my uncle.|$|R
25|$|In Manila in {{the early}} hours of January 30, 1911, people were awakened out of their sleep by what they at first took for loud thunder. The {{illusion}} was heightened when great <b>streaks</b> of <b>lightning</b> were seen to illumine the southern sky. Those who investigated further, however, soon learned the truth. A huge, fan-shaped cloud of what looked like black smoke rose to a great height. It was crossed and crisscrossed with a brilliant electrical display, which the people of Manila at first took for lightning. This cloud finally shot up in the air, spread, then dissipated, and this marked the culmination of the eruption, at about 2:30 a. m.|$|R
50|$|Apache Cat’s other Group One {{victories}} in this winning <b>streak</b> were <b>Lightning</b> Stakes at Flemington in 2008, Australia Stakes at Moonee Valley in 2008 and T J Smith Stakes at Randwick in 2008. He {{also won the}} 2006 Cadbury Guineas. Apache Cat's Group 1 streak matched the record set by T.J. Smith's champion Tulloch, Who was the last horse to win five majors in succession by claiming the Rosehill Guineas, AJC Derby, Caulfield Guineas, Caulfield Cup and Victoria Derby in 1957. Apache Cat was ridden by jockey Corey Brown in all five Group One victories of 2008, who rated the star sprinter the best he has ridden in his career.|$|R

50|$|Like all flatworms in {{the genus}} Pseudobiceros, they are {{hermaphroditic}} and have two penises. During mating, they fence with one another, using their penises, attempting to stab and inject sperm in their opponent, while avoiding being fertilized by their opponent. They {{are able to}} inseminate their opponent by injecting their sperm into any region of the other's body {{they are able to}} penetrate. After successfully injecting the other, the spermatozoa stream through their partner's body on their way to ovaries, where they will fertilize the eggs. The stream is visible through the body tissue of the worm, appearing as pale <b>streaks,</b> like <b>lightning</b> jags.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, he had {{crystallized}} his public image as [...] "The Man in Black." [...] He regularly performed {{dressed all in}} black, wearing a long black knee-length coat. This outfit stood {{in contrast to the}} costumes worn by most of the major country acts in his day: rhinestone suits and cowboy boots. In 1971, Cash wrote the song [...] "Man in Black," [...] to help explain his dress code: We're doing mighty fine I do supposeIn our <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> cars and fancy clothesBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held backUp front {{there ought to be a}} man in black.|$|R
6000|$|We had {{circles and}} serpents and <b>streaks</b> of <b>lightning</b> all twined and wreathed and tied together, without a break {{throughout}} an area {{more than a}} mile square (that amount of ground was covered, though it was not strictly [...] "square"), and it was with a feeling of placid exultation that we reflected that many years had elapsed since any visitor had seen such a splendid display--since any visitor had seen anything more than the now snubbed and insignificant [...] "North" [...] and [...] "South" [...] lakes in action. We had been reading old files of Hawaiian newspapers and the [...] "Record Book" [...] at the Volcano House, and were posted.|$|R
60|$|Twinkle was too terrified to move. She glared {{upon the}} {{approaching}} monster helplessly, {{and it had}} almost reached her when a black object fell from the skies with the swiftness of a <b>lightning</b> <b>streak</b> and struck the dog's back, tearing the flesh with its powerful talons and driving a stout, merciless beak straight through the skull of the savage brute.|$|R
25|$|The most {{dramatic}} {{depiction of the}} catastrophe was Leon Bakst’s “Ancient Terror” (Terror Antiquus, 1908), although it does not name Atlantis directly. It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A <b>streak</b> of <b>lightning</b> crosses {{the upper half of}} the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts. Vyacheslav Ivanov identified the subject as Atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in 1909, the year it was first exhibited, and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since.|$|R
