Methods:The sample consisted of 151 elderly residents. The data collected from January to April 2010 were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficients and stepwise multiple regression. Using instruments were self-esteem scale (SES) (Rosenberg, 1965), Korean health status measure for the elderly (KoHSME) (Shin et al, 2002), and nursing home adaptation scale (Lee, 2007). Results: The mean scores of self-esteem (2. 90 ± 0. 71), health status (2. 15 ± 0. 53) and adaptation (2. 98 ± 0. 44) of elderly residents in facilities were above the average.

500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1985 Larkin {{instructed}} his companion Monica Jones to burn his diaries. His instructions did not cover other writings, therefore the Coleman material remained in the archives of the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, where Larkin had worked as chief librarian since 1955. The existence of these papers was first made public in 1992, when Larkin's Selected Letters was published. In the following year extensive extracts from the Coleman works appeared in Motion's biography of Larkin, and became the subject of literary analysis by M. W. Rowe, in his 1999 essay [...] "Unreal Girls: Lesbian Fantasy in Early Larkin". Rowe saw Larkin's adoption of a female persona as an outlet, compensating for his sexual awkwardness and lack of success with Oxford women. The punishment scenes, in which women punish women, were a means of subduing Larkin's feelings of anger and frustration with his personal sexual failures. [...] More <b>significantly,</b> <b>according</b> to Rowe, Larkin's invention of Coleman was the catalyst which broke the writing block that had afflicted him for most of his Oxford years. The few months of her creative life in 1943 were, Larkin later acknowledged, the prelude to [...] "the intensest time of my life"; in the three subsequent years his poetry collection The North Ship and his novels Jill and A Girl in Winter were published.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{differences}} in emotional labor strategies, burnout, and work engagement according to general characteristics of school foodservice employees as well as verify differential effects of two emotional labor strategies on burnout and work engagement. Our survey was administered to 400 school foodser-vice employees in Gyeongbuk from March 3 to April 25, 2014. A total of 358 completed questionnaires were returned, and 350 questionnaires were used for final analysis. For verification of mean differences, the mean scores for surface acting, deep acting, burnout, and work engagement were shown to be 2. 38 / 5. 00, 3. 46, 2. 67, and 3. 41, respectively.

Results: The mean scores of knowledge (13. 21 ± 1. 99), self efficacy (2. 23 ± 0. 54), and self care behavior (2. 29 ± 0. 51) regarding foot care were moderate. The level of know-ledge was <b>significantly</b> different <b>according</b> to education about DM (p =. 012) and drinking (p =. 007).
