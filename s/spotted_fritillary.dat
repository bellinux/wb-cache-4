5000|$|The upperside of {{the wings}} is yellow orange with dark spots, lines, and zigzagged bands. The forewing is squared off {{just below the}} apex. A dark border on the hindwing margin is lacking on most individuals. It has long palps. The {{underside}} of the wings are mottled with orange and purplish-brown. There is a yellowish band that runs across {{the center of the}} hindwing. It lacks the silver <b>spots</b> most lesser <b>fritillaries</b> have. The forewing is smudged with orange and brown near the apex. The wingspan of the meadow fritillary is 3.5 - 5.1 cm ( [...] - 2 inches).|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} habitat requirements, population size and {{survival of the}} <b>Spotted</b> <b>Fritillary</b> (Melitaea didyma) in national nature reserve The Mohelno Serpentinite steppe. The estimated population size is about two thousands of individuals, and the individuals frequently migrate between habitat patches. The optimal habitat structure is characterized by grassy pasture steppe with occurrence of larval host plant and abundant nectar plants for adults. The most frequent male behaviour is searching for females, while the females spend most time by nectaring. Caterpillars were found on two species of family Scrophulariaceae...|$|E
