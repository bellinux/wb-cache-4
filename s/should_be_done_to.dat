25|$|Food versus fuel is {{the dilemma}} {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production {{to the detriment of}} the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can or <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.|$|E

25|$|The Endowed School was {{inspected}} by OFSTED in 2003 and 2008. In 2003 the inspectors' overall evaluation was that 'this {{is a very}} good school.' In 2008 the inspectors agreed with the School's own self-evaluation that the School is providing 'a satisfactory standard of education' and that 'many elements are good'. The 2003 OFSTED inspection had identified modern foreign languages as unsatisfactory. However, in 2008 the inspectors noted {{that there had been a}} 'great improvement in the leadership of modern foreign languages since the last inspection.' An OFSTED inspection has recently taken place, the school received a 'satisfactory' in most areas, pupil's behavior being one of the best, rated as 'good', while the maths department was the least achievable. OFSTED stated that the improvement in maths and English was a minor improvement and more work <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> improve.

25|$|One {{recommended}} diagnostic {{approach is}} as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging {{and possibly a}} lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test {{to look for a}} brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person, a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.|$|E
25|$|Cyclone Bebe caused {{severe damage}} to Funafuti during the 1972–73 South Pacific cyclone season. Funafuti’s Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, {{with all its}} {{vegetation}} {{and most of its}} sand swept away during the cyclone. Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996-97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season. Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu in late January and early February 1990. On Vaitupu Island around 85 percent of residential homes, trees and food crops were destroyed, while residential homes were also destroyed on the islands of Niutao, Nui and Nukulaelae. The majority of the islands in Tuvalu reported damage to vegetation and crops especially bananas, coconuts and breadfruit, with the extent of damage ranging from 10 to 40 percent. In Funafuti sea waves flattened the Hurricane Bebe bank {{at the southern end of}} the airstrip, which caused sea flooding and prompted the evacuation of several families from their homes. In Nui and Niulakita there was a minor loss of the landscape because of sea flooding while there were no lives lost. Soon after the systems had impacted Tuvalu, a Disaster Rehabilitation Sub-Committee was appointed to evaluate the damage caused and make recommendations to the National Disaster Committee and to the Cabinet of Tuvalu, on what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> help rehabilitate the affected areas.|$|E

40|$|Media release: A {{majority}} of Victorians think the State Government <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> more <b>to</b> address alcohol-related harms and want party leaders to outline {{their plans to}} address alcohol-related harms prior to the upcoming election.

The polling conducted by Galaxy Research, {{on behalf of the}} Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE), also found that three in four Victorian voters (75 %) would like the party leaders to outline their plan to address alcohol-related harms prior to next month’s State election. However, in an apparent vote of no confidence, Victorians don’t seem to think either of the major parties are up to the task.

As long as inequity exists at the level it does now, exacerbated by economic greed, sexism and xenophobia, cross-cultural contact will yield increased stereotyping and reduced tolerance. At least we should emphasize programs such as student and worker exchange that tend to meet the conditions and actually decrease prejudice.|$|R
500|$|Many {{supporters}} of Native American mascots {{feel that the}} financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate {{millions of dollars in}} sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: [...] "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk {{in one hand and a}} beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us.

40|$|Schools are {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} ideal setting for interventions to tackle childhood obesity. A {{better understanding of the}} views of key stakeholders would help to engage schools and inform the feasibility of such interventions in practice. This meta-synthesis of 18 qualitative studies explores the views of parents, school staff, school governors, school nurses and students {{on the role of the}} primary school in preventing childhood obesity. Six categories emerged: 'School as a key setting'; 'What schools <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> promote healthy eating (HE) '; 'What schools <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> promote physical activity (PA) '; 'General barriers'; 'Barriers to promoting HE at school'; and 'Barriers to promoting PA at school'. Thirty-seven finer-level themes emerged within these categories. Stakeholders agreed on the key role of the primary school as a setting for obesity prevention, the importance of schools providing and promoting opportunities for HE and PA, and the need for schools to work with parents. Some perceived barriers could be overcome at school level, e. g. using unhealthy foods as rewards/fundraisers or withholding PA for bad behaviour. Leadership and guidance from government were considered to be needed to counteract other observed barriers, particularly regarding school canteens, support for parents and time for PA...|$|R
