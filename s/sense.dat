40|$|The {{problem of}} {{spectrum}} <b>sensing</b> in bandwidth-constrained cognitive sensor networks with quantised <b>sensing</b> observation is studied. In particular, the quantisation bit budget for achieving performance {{close to that}} of spectrum <b>sensing</b> with raw <b>sensing</b> observation is investigated. Both single-user spectrum <b>sensing</b> and collaborative spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes are proposed. In single-user spectrum <b>sensing,</b> a sensor quantises its <b>sensing</b> observation and sends the quantised <b>sensing</b> observation to a processing point. The processing point performs spectrum <b>sensing</b> based on the reconstructed <b>sensing</b> observation. In collaborative spectrum <b>sensing,</b> each sensor sends a quantised <b>sensing</b> observation to a processing point and each processing point performs local spectrum <b>sensing</b> based on the reconstructed <b>sensing</b> observation. Then, each processing point sends a binary decision bit to a fusion centre. The fusion centre combines the decision bits by using a counting rule to generate the final spectrum <b>sensing</b> result. The detection probability and the false alarm probability are derived and simulated. The results show that there exists an optimal quantisation bit budget for which the detection probability and the false alarm probability are almost {{the same as those}} in spectrum <b>sensing</b> with raw <b>sensing</b> observation. Compared to existing spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes with quantised <b>sensing</b> observation, the proposed schemes are more suitable for implementation in cognitive sensor networks.

When a cooperative <b>sensing</b> method {{is used in the}} conventional CR system, by combining each SU’s <b>sensing</b> result, it can increase the <b>sensing</b> accuracy and detect hide primary transmitters. Even though the sensor node in the proposed method is the only node that <b>senses</b> the primary signal, by performing consecutive spectrum <b>sensing</b> as a form of sequential chaining of a fixed <b>sensing</b> time, in which the fixed <b>sensing</b> time is determined to satisfy the required minimum primary detection probability, our proposed method also can combine time-domain multiple <b>sensing</b> results.

30|$|Spectrum <b>sensing</b> is {{fundamental}} {{for the successful}} deployment of CRs. The main focus of current spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes for CRs {{is divided into two}} main streams: the first is to improve local <b>sensing</b> performance, and the second is to improve performance by having cooperation between SUs. In local <b>sensing,</b> each SU performs spectrum <b>sensing</b> on the received signal and makes a decision about {{the presence or absence of}} a PU. In cooperative spectrum <b>sensing,</b> SUs perform local <b>sensing</b> and send their <b>sensed</b> information to the fusion center, and a final cooperative decision is taken at the fusion center. Therefore, in order to improve cooperative performance, it is necessary to improve local <b>sensing.</b> Many two-stage spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes are proposed in literature to improve local spectrum <b>sensing.</b>|$|R
