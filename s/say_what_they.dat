5|$|The {{designs were}} {{prepared}} in-house at the Philadelphia Mint by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, {{who designed the}} obverse and his assistant, George T. Morgan, who prepared the reverse. They did not seek outside artists to submit proposals. Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggested that this was because Secretary McAdoo had sought non-employees to propose designs for the five Panama-Pacific coins along with those sketches prepared by Barber and his assistants, and the Mint's engravers had prepared {{only two of the}} five, and that because the artist assigned one, Evelyn Longman, had fallen ill. When the McKinley designs were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts on March 31, 1916, it recommended changes, though Don Taxay, who so stated, does not <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were. In any event, no alteration was made, and the designs were approved.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, {{perhaps because the}} show focused little on cookinga {{major part of the}} Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E
500|$|Lark {{was praised}} for being equally good at {{depicting}} violence and introspection, and Martin {{said it was}} Lark's finest work. According to Lark, the characters in Lazarus rarely <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean, and some vital story beats are depicted by wordless art. Lark's ability to convey Rucka's story without supporting text led Henry Chamberlain, a reviewer for Comics Grinder, to say [...] "you can feel the chemistry" [...] between them. Arcas received notice for adding texture and depth to Lark's art and using pallette changes to help tell the story.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} on Lee and LeFevre's On the Road to Freedom album in November 1973, and as the A-side of a single the following month. The album was critically well received, and Billboard included [...] "So Sad" [...] among its recommended singles for the week of 22 December 1973. Writing in Rolling Stone, Bud Scoppa paired the track with the Wood-composed [...] "Let 'Em <b>Say</b> <b>What</b> <b>They</b> Will" [...] as [...] "two non-originals [...] are beauties", adding: [...] "George Harrison's 'So Sad (No Love of His Own)' {{sounds to me like}} one of his best songs." ...|$|E

'If I had my time again I would have gone back and done the gig. I'd have done that gig and I'd have done the next gig and we'd have all gone away and we could have probably discussed it. We may never have split up.' ...|$|E
500|$|Shearsmith {{identified}} [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] {{as one of}} his two favourite {{episodes of}} the series, along with [...] "The Devil of Christmas". For the writers, the episode was not comedic, and they expressed awareness of the differences between episodes of Inside No. 9 like [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] and the expectations of viewers for television comedies. The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying [...] "If you missed two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' Even I was thinking how are people following this? It's insane." [...] Pemberton also noted that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence [...] "I always hated cryptic crosswords. Why can't people just <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean instead of trying to trick you all the time?" [...] from Shearsmith's Tyler.|$|E

500|$|Joseph Desha, the {{outgoing}} governor, {{refused to believe}} that his party had lost the election. He disliked Metcalfe not only due to his party affiliation, {{but also because of}} his occupation as a stonemason, which he believed was too low a calling for a governor. Metcalfe's opponents made slights on the quality of his stone work and his views on the Old Court-New Court controversy. When told about these charges, Metcalfe remarked [...] "They may <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> like about my views, but the first man that dares to attack my character, I will cleave his skull with my stone hammer, as I would cleave a rock." [...] As word of this remark spread, Metcalfe was given the nickname [...] "Old Stone Hammer." [...] Despite his threats to remain in the governor's mansion until the legislature convened, Desha respected the will of the people, and left the residence on September 2, 1828.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{spoke of}} the fact that he had spent 34 years in the Senate and had been active in many congressional {{committees}} including being the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and formerly holding the post as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. On the campaign trail he touted his years of foreign policy experience particularly in regard to the conflict in Bosnia, which he feels he played a role in ending. Biden stated earlier in his campaign that [...] " [...] truly believe the American public is waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will do to restore America's leadership in the world." [...] At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination, but when Barack Obama's campaign began to surge with the candidate's emphasis on change, Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action. He stated during a November 2007 debate, [...] "This [...] is not about experience. It's not about change. It's about action. Who among us is going to be able to, on Day 1, step in and end the war?" ...|$|E

No doubt, they'll try this stunt again." [...] Likewise, Jean Marbella of The Baltimore Sun said, [...] "It's not even that the terrorists have won, it's that wannabe terrorists have won." [...] Margaret Wente of The Globe and Mail said the censorship of [...] "201" [...] could be [...] "the lowest point {{in the history of}} American TV", and that it represented a gravitation toward fear in a post-September 11 attacks world. Los Angeles Times columnist Patrick Goldstein said there were [...] "no easy answers" [...] and that he was not surprised Comedy Central took the threat seriously, but added, [...] "in a democracy, artists and political satirists should be allowed to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe, even if it offends some of its audience". Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant suggested Comedy Central actually drew more attention to the Muhammad controversy, not less, by censoring the episode.

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

For this execution, Butler was denounced in December 1862 by Confederate President Jefferson Davis in General Order 111 as a felon deserving capital punishment, who if captured should {{be reserved for}} execution. Butler's administration did have benefits to the city, which was kept both orderly and healthy. The Butler occupation was probably best summed up by Admiral Farragut, who stated, [...] "They may <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> please about General Butler, {{but he was the}} right man in the right place in New Orleans." ...|$|E
25|$|The primary {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people will think of a person's behavior.

2500|$|On March 26, 2009, Megan Parris {{argued that}} not only was the show scripted, but that {{producers}} bullied contestants into saying things to the camera that contestants did not want to say.

The latter was {{recorded}} in August 1973, with Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood also participating. The supergroup aspect of the recordings appealed to Lee's management, who had originally been opposed to the project, wanting Lee to instead maintain his lucrative touring schedule with Ten Years After. According to Lee, due to the prohibitive financial terms imposed {{by some of the}} guest artists' record companies, he and LeFevre were unable to acknowledge all of Harrison's contributions to the album, nor those of Mick Jagger.|$|E

After hours of sex with no breaks, attempting to endure the friction of the condom in your vagina or anus is...impossible. And to do this daily amounts to an occupational work hazard.
