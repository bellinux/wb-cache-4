40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] is a {{trace gas}} that {{contributes}} to the greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion. The N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield from nitrification (moles N 2 O-N [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O - N] produced per mole ammonium-N consumed) has been used to estimate marine N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] production rates from measured nitrification rates and global estimates of oceanic export production. However, the N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield from nitrification is not constant. Previous culture-based measurements indicate that N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield increases as oxygen (O 2) [O <b>subscript</b> 2] concentration decreases and as nitrite (NO 2 −) [NO <b>subscript</b> 2 overscore] concentration increases. Here, we have measured yields of N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] from cultures of the marine β-proteobacterium [beta-proteobacterium] Nitrosomonas marina C- 113 a as they grew on low-ammonium (50 μM) [50 mu M] media. These yields, which were typically between 4 × 10 − 4 [10 superscript - 4] and 7 × 10 − 4 [10 superscript - 4] for cultures with cell densities between 2 × 102 [10 super script 2] and 2. 1 × 104 [10 superscript 4] cells ml− 1 [ml superscript - 1], were lower than previous reports for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The observed impact of O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] concentration on yield was also smaller than previously reported under all conditions except at high starting cell densities (1. 5 × 106 cells ml− 1) [1. 5 x 10 superscript 6 cells ml superscript - 1], where 160 -fold higher yields were observed at 0. 5 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2](5. 1 μM [mu M] dissolved O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2]) compared with 20 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] (203 μM [mu M] dissolved O 2 O <b>subscript</b> 2]). At lower cell densities (2 × 102 [10 superscript 2] and 2. 1 × 104 [10 superscript 4] cells ml− 1 [ml superscript - 1]), cultures grown under 0. 5 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] had yields that were only 1. 25 - to 1. 73 -fold higher than cultures grown under 20 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2]. Thus, previously reported many-fold increases in N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield with dropping O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] could be reproduced only at cell densities that far exceeded those of ammonia oxidizers in the ocean. The presence of excess NO 2 − [NO <b>subscript</b> 2 overscore] (up to 1 mM) in the growth medium also increased N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yields by an average of 70 % to 87 % depending on O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] concentration. We made stable isotopic measurements on N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] from these cultures to identify the biochemical mechanisms behind variations in N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield. Based on measurements of δ 15 Nbulk [delta superscript 15 N superscript bulk], site preference (SP = δ 15 Nα−δ 15 Nβ [delta superscript 15 N superscript alpha - delta superscript 15 N superscript beta]), and δ 18 O [delta superscript 18 O] of N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] (δ 18 O-N 2 O [delta superscript 18 O - N <b>subscript</b> 2 O]), we estimate that nitrifier-denitrification produced between 11 % and 26 % of N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] from cultures grown under 20 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] and 43 % to 87 % under 0. 5 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2]. We also demonstrate that a positive correlation between SP and δ 18 O-N 2 O [delta superscript 18 O - N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] is expected when nitrifying bacteria produce N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O]. A positive relationship between SP and δ 18 O-N 2 O [delta superscript 18 O - N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] has been observed in environmental N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] datasets, but until now, explanations for the observation invoked only denitrification.

In addition to the experimental results, two sets of local, nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence simulations that are performed with the GYRO code [J. Candy and R. E. Waltz, J. Comput.

One set, called the pre-experiment simulations, was performed prior to the experiment in order to predict a change in αneTe [alpha n <b>subscript</b> n <b>subscript</b> e T <b>subscript</b> e] given experimentally realizable increases in the electron temperature, Te [T <b>subscript</b> e]. In the experiment the cross-phase angle was measured at three radial locations (ρ = 0. 55, 0. 65, and 0. 75) in both a “Base” case and a “High Te [T <b>subscript</b> e] ” case. The measured cross-phase angle is in good qualitative agreement with the pre-experiment simulations, which predicted that n~e [n cedilla <b>subscript</b> e] and T~e [T cedilla <b>subscript</b> e] would be out of phase. The pre-experiment simulations also predicted a decrease in cross-phase angle as Te [T <b>subscript</b> e] is increased. Experimentally, this trend is observed at the inner two radial locations only. The second set of simulations, the postexperiment simulations, is carried out using local parameters taken from measured experimental profiles as input to GYRO. These postexperiment simulation results are in good quantitative agreement with the measured cross-phase angle, despite disagreements with transport fluxes.
