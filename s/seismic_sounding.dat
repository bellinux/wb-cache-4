This includes McMurdo Station One major effort {{was a series of}} studies conducted in 1957 and 1958, which were continued during the 1960-61 season. The efforts involved an international team of scientists. Some parties explored the glaciers and others the valleys on the ice shelf. [...] From 1967 to 1972 the Scott Polar Research Institute reported extensive observations using radio echo sounding. The technique allowed measurements to be taken from the air; allowing a criss cross track of 35,000 km to be covered; compared with a 3,000 km track from previous <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding</b> on the ground.

50|$|As noted, the Soviet PNE {{program was}} many {{times larger than}} the U.S. Plowshare program in terms of both the number of {{applications}} explored with field experiments {{and the extent to which}} they were introduced into industrial use. Several PNE applications, such as deep <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding</b> and oil stimulation, were explored in depth and appeared to have had a positive cost benefit at minimal public risk. Several others, such as deep void storage, developed significant technical problems that cast a shadow on their general applicability. Some, such as closure of runaway gas wells, demonstrated a unique technology that may yet find application as a last resort. Still others were the subject of one or two tests but were not explored further for reasons that have never been explained. Overall, the program represented a significant technical effort to explore what was seen at the time to be a promising new technology, and it generated a large body of data, although only a small fraction of it has been made public.|$|E

30|$|Projects {{dedicated}} to the exploitation of deep geothermal resources need to probe the upper crustal structure of the targeted area in order to characterize the reservoir {{and its relation to}} pre-existing geological formations. Active <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding</b> is a commonly used approach; its dense spatial and temporal sampling provides high-resolution images of the reflectivity of the subsurface layers and of fault geometry. However, such seismic data are not readily available everywhere, and acquisition of new data, especially in 3 D, is often very expensive compared to the profitability of geothermal resources.

30|$|The present MT study infers that a basin-like {{structure}} with thin trap and buried sediments is identified at shallow crustal depths, confined between the stations 12 (close to the Tapti fault) and 20 (close to the Purna fault) in the geo-electric section. The results clearly infer that the faults {{are close to}} the anomalous conductive features (A, B and C). This is more prominent near the Narmada south fault towards the northern part, as compared with {{the southern part of the}} traverse at mid-lower crustal depths. The conductive features at upper-mid crustal depths obtained from the geo-electric section spatially correlates with the absence of reflections and an indication of low seismic velocity in the Deep <b>Seismic</b> <b>Sounding</b> section (Fig. 4 (c)). The gravity is low near the anomalous conductor A (Fig. 4 (b)). Though the Deep <b>Seismic</b> <b>Sounding</b> study does not provide any suggestions regarding low gravity and high conductivity, it can be assumed to be of low seismic velocity. Together, these three observations suggest that the reasons for the anomalous conductive features (A, B and C) can be attributed to any one of the factors such as graphite, minerals, fluids or partial melt (Patro et al., 2005) as explained below.|$|E
30|$|Images of {{the upper}} crustal {{structure}} can also be obtained from tomographic inversion of arrival times of natural or induced local earthquakes. These inversions can be repeated over time to map velocity changes (e.g., Calò et al. 2011; Calò and Dorbath 2013) much more cheaply than active <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding.</b> Producing good-quality tomographic images of geothermal reservoirs using arrival times requires having induced seismicity around the wells, but geothermal operators need to minimize induced seismicity to reduce the seismic risk associated with their exploitation. The need to minimize seismic risk excludes using time-lapse arrival-time tomography for continuous reservoir imaging.|$|E

The prominent regional gravity low of 20 to 30 mgls over the charnockite terrain of South India, coupled with the correlation of a steep gravity gradient with a prominent shear zone to the north, can be interpreted in terms of increased crustal thickness in the South Indian high-grade terrain. There is some support for this from deep <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding.</b> The magnetic signature of the high-grade terrain is also distinctive, and Mishra argued that the Palghat-Tiruchi line might represent a Precambrian boundary such as a suture between two distinct crustal blocks...|$|E

It follows the basic main part of the Ivrea-Verbano zone and continues to the south. The width of the anomaly is about 10 km, the maximum measures about + 800 gamma. The model interpretation shows that possibly the anomaly belongs to an amphibolitic body, which in connection with the Ivrea-body was found by deep <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding.</b> Therefore, the magnetic anomaly provides further evidence for the conception that the Ivrea-body has to be regarded as a chip of earthmantle material pushed upward by tectonic processes...|$|E

Later the ship will proceeded to Bellingshausen and Amundsen sea for the primary research objectives. The main objective of this leg were marine geophysical research to study the crustal structure at the western margin of the Antarctic continent. This was achieved by combined land-sea deep <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding</b> experiments using recording instruments on the inland ice as well as ocean bottom seismographs. At the same time multichannel seismic reflection lines were observed over the shelf and the adjacent deep sea areas in order to resolve the sedimentary cover and through to gain the understanding of the depositional history especially during the Cenozoic. While the deep <b>seismic</b> <b>sounding</b> experiments were part of the ANTALITH Project the studies of the sedimintary cover also increased our understanding of the history of Antarctic glaciation because the major advance and retreat stages are documented in the sediments. The geophysical studies were supplemented by marine geological sampling of transects perpendicular to the margin from the deep sea to the shelf environment. A link to the deeper sedimentary structures was established through sediment echography using the PARASOUND system. Sampling of the topmost part of the sediments allows the study of recent glacial marine sedimentation processes. Continuous bathymetric measurements generally along the ships tracks or in areal mode within selected areas using the on board HYDROSWEEP multibeam echo sounder enhanced the geophysical component of the cruise.
