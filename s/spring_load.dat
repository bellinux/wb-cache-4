5000|$|In non-MacPherson strut {{automobile}} suspension, the two {{ball joints}} {{are called the}} [...] "upper ball joint" [...] and [...] "lower ball joint". Lower ball joints are sometimes larger and may wear out faster, because the fore and aft loads, primarily due to braking, are higher at the bottom ball joint. (Torque reaction and drag add at the bottom joint, and partly cancel at the top joint.) Also, lateral cornering loads are higher at the bottom joint. Depending on the suspension design, the vertical load from the suspension spring may be handled entirely by the top ball joint, or entirely by the bottom ball joint. The damper load, (which is low in normal conditions, zero when stationary, but in peak bump or rebound rate may be almost {{as large as the}} <b>spring</b> <b>load)</b> is usually, but not always, taken on the same ball joint as the <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> The anti-roll bar loading is often, but not always, taken on the bottom ball joint. It may be taken by the top ball joint, or directly from the steering knuckle by ball-jointed drop links.|$|E

50|$|If one of {{the ball}} joints does not carry <b>spring</b> <b>load,</b> it may be fitted with an {{internal}} anti-rattle spring to keep the ball preferentially in contact with one seat. This {{was the case in}} the BMC Mini of 1959 and its many derivatives, where the lower control arm carried no vertical loading, so the joint needed and anti-rattle spring, while the top joint, comprising identical parts, was always in compression due to spring (rubber cone) and damper loads, and so was not fitted with a spring.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, {{desmodromic}} drive uses two cams per valve, {{each with}} separate rocker arm (lever tappets). Maximum valve acceleration being limited by cam-to-tappet galling stress, {{is governed by}} moving mass and cam contact area. Rigidity and contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat tappets and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force, both occurring at the base circlewhere <b>spring</b> <b>load</b> is minimum and contact radius is largest.Curved (lever) tappetsof desmodromic cams cause higher contact stress than flat tappets for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.|$|E

The engine assembly was different from other traxxas models, having the clutch bell with the pinion facing against the engine, and the flywheel secured with a nut {{at the end of the}} crank with the clutch shoes facing inward. Another particularity was its shoe brake system that applied braking force on the clutch bell itself instead of having a brake disc mounted on the transmission. This truck also featured all-aluminum shocks with collars to adjust <b>spring</b> <b>load</b> and 2.2-inch lite dish wheels with pro trax ribbed tires at the front and spiked ones at the back. Common upgrades were the 360 Stinger exhaust and sturdier shock towers, since the stock fiber ones were soft.First editions had white plastic parts, body and a clear/transparent hard plastic top, purposely to be painted with the hobbyist-preferred color and are the most collectable ones.|$|E

Although the policies have been implemented for many years, their economic effects on truckers remain uncertain. This study {{provides an overview of}} practices around the world and sets up a framework to estimate the benefit–cost of the SLR policy. A freight demand model in Minnesota was built to estimate the impacts of SLR on the freight transportation pattern. The model allows various policy scenarios to be tested before being put into practice. A preliminary result of the freight demand model indicates the SLR policy increased truck vehicle kilometers of travel in Lyon County, Minnesota, by about 13 %. <b>Spring</b> <b>load</b> restrictions (SLR) restrict the axle loading of heavy trucks during the spring thaw.

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> rack and pinion. This <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in <b>spring</b> <b>loading.</b> The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>load</b> {{restrictions}} (SLR) {{regulate the}} {{weight per axle}} carried by heavy trucks during the spring thaw period. This policy aims to reduce pavement damage caused by heavy vehicles and extend the useful life of roads, but it also imposes costs on the trucking industry due to detouring or increased number of truckloads. Although the policies have been implemented for many years, their resulting economic effect has been unclear. The Minnesota Local Road Research Board (LRRB) and the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) sponsored a cost/benefit study of <b>spring</b> <b>load</b> restrictions in Minnesota. The study, {{based on the results}} of surveys of industry costs, a pavement performance model, and a freight demand model, concludes that the benefits of lifting the existing SLR policy outweigh the additional costs. Roadways operating at 5 -tons require additional study; however, current analysis warrants repealing SLR and keeping roadways operating year-round at 9 -tons. The cost of additional damage should be recovered from those who benefit from the change in policy. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method to statically balance a general treestructured,planar revolute-joint linkage loaded with linear springs or {{constant}} forces without using auxiliary links. The balancing methods currently documented in the literature use extra links; some do not apply when there are spring loads and some are restricted to only two-link serial chains. In our method, we suitably combine any non-zero-free-length load spring with another spring to result in an effective zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> If a link has a single joint (with the parent link), we give a procedure to attach extra zero-free-length springs to it so that forces and moments are balanced for the link. Another consequence of this attachment is that the constraint force of the joint on the parent link becomes equivalent to a zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> Hence, conceptually,for the parent link, the joint with its child is removed and replaced with the zero-free-length spring. This feature allows recursive application of this procedure from the end-branches of the tree down to the root, satisfying force and moment balance of all the links in the process. Furthermore, this method can easily be extended to the closed-loop revolute-joint linkages, which is also illustrated in the paper...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{quick-release pin}} mechanism supplants a prior such mechanism {{in which the}} pin bears a shear load to hold two objects together. The prior mechanism, of a ball-locking design, can fail when vibrations cause balls to fall out. The load-bearing pin is an outer tube with a handle at one end (hereafter denoted the near end). Within the outer tube is a spring-loaded inner tube that includes a handle at its near end and a pivoting tab at its far end. The pin is inserted through holes in the objects to be retained and the inner tube is pushed against an offset pivot inside the outer tube to make the tab rotate outward so that it protrudes past the outer diameter of the outer tube, and the <b>spring</b> <b>load</b> maintains this configuration so that the pin cannot be withdrawn through the holes. Pushing the handles together against the <b>spring</b> <b>load</b> moves the locking tab out far enough that the tab becomes free to rotate inward. Then releasing the inner-tube handle causes the tab to be pulled into a resting position inside the outer tube. The pin can then be pulled out through the holes...|$|E

40|$|A linkage of rigid bodies under gravity loads can be statically counter-balanced by add-ing {{compensating}} gravity loads. Similarly, gravity <b>loads</b> or <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> can be counter-balanced {{by adding}} springs. In the current literature, among the techniques that add springs, some achieve perfect static balance while others achieve only approximate bal-ance. Further, {{all of them}} add auxiliary bodies to the linkage in addition to springs. We present a perfect static balancing technique that adds only springs but not auxiliary bodies, {{in contrast to the}} existing techniques. This technique can counter-balance both gravity <b>loads</b> and <b>spring</b> <b>loads.</b> The technique requires that every joint that connects two bodies in the linkage be either a revolute joint or a spherical joint. Apart from this, the linkage can have any number of bodies connected in any manner. In order to achieve perfect balance, this technique requires that all the <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> have the feature of zero-free-length, {{as is the case with}} the existing techniques. This requirement is neither impractical nor restrictive since the feature can be practically incorporated into any normal spring either by modifying the spring or by adding another spring in parallel.
