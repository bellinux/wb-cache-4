50|$|The most {{recognizable}} effect {{of using a}} session manager {{is the possibility of}} logging out from an interactive session and then finding exactly the same windows in the same state when logging in again. For this to work, the session manager program stores the names of applications that are running at logout and starts them again at login. Moreover, for the state of the applications to be restored as well (which is needed to restore the content of windows), the applications must be able to save their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> upon request from the session manager and load it back when started again. In general, a session can be saved or loaded at any time, even if the user is not logging in or out. It is also possible to save a number of different sessions and loading one of them at user's choice. Sessions can also be specified by providing the list of applications that compose the session. As a result, the user has the possibility of saving a set of different sessions, either by storing the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> of the currently running applications or by explicitly listing the applications that compose a session. This way, the user can later decide to load a given session.|$|E

They observed that both the composite and constituent services often constrain the sequences of invoking their operations. As a result, they assigned each <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> an aggregated reliability to measure the probability that the given state will lead to a successful execution in the context where each web service may fail with a certain probability. In our study, to orchestrate a composite web service, we propose two strategies to select web services that are likely to successfully complete the execution of a given sequence of operations.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{information}} management system providing distribution and persistency. By separating context from virtual address space, our system has a uni ed approach for both distribution and persistency. The former is achieved by moving contexts between sites and the latter by moving contexts between virtual address space and persistent storage. Contexts include any information including data, program, and even the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> of a program. Contexts are stored persistently in a logical space termed the distributed shared repository (DSR for short). This paper proposes a programming model for DSR. Using the model, persistency, ne-grain mobility of information, and the passing of various distributed parameters can be obtained. The implementation and experimental performance of the system are also presented. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} exploring polyvariance in ab-bindings as an analysis parameter. This allocation policy is a method for selecting abstract addresses based on the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> As addresses are chosen from a finite set, the allocation policy is responsible for determining the exact degree of merging which occurs between different values at a given point in the analysis. This approach allows us to se-lect any kind of polyvariance desired through the selection of an abstract allocation function. We show how {{this can be done}} for an intermediate representation of Scheme, imple-menting a sound parametric framework for such analyses. We distinguish three disparate interpretations of the k-CFA hierarchy and compare them, instantiating each within our framework and motivating our approach...|$|E

"Black-box" {{services}} are gradually replaced by services where service providers not only expose the underlying processes but also allow some monitoring of their executions. In this paper, we explore {{the next step}} where the consumers can exercise some control over the process execution. We specify a set of control primitives {{that can be used}} to exert control on activities before, during and after their execution and on the complete process itself. Our design approach allows the consumer to observe the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> of the process and its activities, control their execution and decide how to deal with unsuccessful executions. We describe the support that must be provided in the internal process specification of the service provider for the control options. We illustrate our approach with an example from the healthcare domain...|$|E

40|$|In realtime {{planning}} domains, such {{as service}} robot control, an agent receives a task and must minimize the combined cost {{of planning and}} plan execution necessary to complete the task. To reduce the total cost, we examine the feasibil-ity of performing planning continuously, while parts of the intermediate plan are being executed. The main challenges are to guarantee the completeness of the approach {{and make sure that}} planning does concentrate on regions of the state space that are most crucial given the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> Sur-prisingly, simple modifications of existing stochastic planners yield an efficient approach for concurrent planning and plan execution. We formalize this approach and analyze its char-acteristics. Experimental results show that such a continuous planning paradigm offers significant benefits, most notably a significant cost reduction relative to existing realtime plan-ning and execution strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{requirements}} {{for a business}} process depend on the entire workflow environment that includes common data for all the population of processes, state of resources, state of processes, etc. The natural way to specify and implement such requirements is to put them into the process definition. In order to do it, we need: (1) a generalised workflow meta-model that includes data on the workflow environment, process definitions, and the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> of all processes; (2) a powerful and flexible query language addressing the meta-model; (3) integration of a query language with a business process definition language. In this paper the mentioned workflow meta-model together with the business process query language BPQL is presented. BPQL may be integrated with the XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) increasing significantly its expressiveness and flexibility. We also present practical results for application of the proposed language in the OfficeObjects WorkFlow system...|$|E

The protocol is especially useful in massively parallel multi-threaded computations {{as found in}} cluster or grid computing and utilizes the principle of work-stealing to distribute work. By basing the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>executions</b> on a macro dataflow graph, the protocol shows extreme flexibility with respect to rollback. Specifically, it allows local rollback in dynamic heterogeneous systems, even under a different number of processors and processes. To maximize run-time efficiency, the overhead associated with checkpointing is shifted to the rollback operations whenever possible. Experimental results show the overhead induced is very smal...|$|R

Job scheduling and resource prediction are mainly depend on sufficient information of available resources. Job scheduling is used to schedule the applications submitted by the user.

The process of monitoring refers to systematically gather information about present or past status of all resources of interest. Due to the dynamic behaviour of grid systems, the monitoring components are becoming necessary in order to utilize different types of distributed resources and provide consistent and unified services to the user. The monitoring process indicates the response for the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution,</b> distribution of load and prediction and it focus on the running track of grid system.
