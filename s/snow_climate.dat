40|$|ABSTRACT: Existing <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> classifications {{rely heavily}} on {{meteorological}} parameters that de-scribe the average weather during the main winter months. Field experience and measurements, how-ever, show that the character of snowpack weaknesses including their type structure and details of forma-tion are the primary indicators of avalanches that form. Such characteristics are not a formal part of any <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> classification scheme. Therefore, such classifications can only be of limited use for ava-lanche forecasting purposes. The focus {{of this study is}} the analysis of persistent snowpack weaknesses in Western Canada, an area {{with a wide range of}} weather and snow conditions. Observations from the industrial information ex-change (InfoEx) of the Canadian Avalanche Association are used to examine the frequency, sequence and distribution of the most common snowpack weakness types and their related avalanche activity. The results show significant temporal and spatial variations, even in areas with the same <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> charac-teristics. The transitional Columbia Mountains, for example, exhibit snowpack weakness characteristics that clearly go beyond a simple combination of maritime and continental influences. ‘Avalanche winter regime ’ is suggested as a new term to describe and classify local snow and avalanche characteristics that are directly relevant for avalanche forecasting. Three distinct avalanche winter regimes are identified fo...|$|E

It is advertised that Tromsø has a mild coastal climate compared to other destinations at similar latitudes. Existing <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> classes separate covers into a maritime, continental and a transitional class where persistent weak layers are rare in the maritime class. Rain and average air temperatures during snow season are decisive factors whether a snow pack one single winter is classified as maritime or not (Mock & Birkeland, 2000). In total 76 snow profiles from the winter 2016 - 2017, in addition to winter meteorological data from 1957 to 2017, {{have been used to}} classify the snow cover climate in the Tromsø area. During the winter season 2016 – 2017, two study plots approximately 25 and 50 km away from open sea were classified as maritime and continental, respectively. Simultaneously, persistent weak layers were observed and forecasted from February to mid-May in both forecasting regions Lyngen and Tromsø. Thus, an Arctic transitional <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> is defined as having multiple rain-induced crusts in relatively warmer years and extensive depth hoar formation in relatively colder years, where the frequency of constructive metamorphism increase inland. Such a snow cover classification is useful in many ways. Spatial comparison with other areas, both national and international, becomes possible; temporal comparison, making a description of the relation- ship between weak layers and climate, becomes possible; as well as it provides a better data set for Norwegian avalanche forecasters. Also, this thesis provides the Tromsø area with its own snow cover climate describing typical processes influencing snow and snow stability.

40|$|Remote sensing of snow-covered area (SCA) can be binary (indicating the presence/absence of {{snow cover}} at each pixel) or {{fractional}} (indicating {{the fraction of}} each pixel covered by snow). Fractional SCA mapping provides more information than binary SCA, but {{is more difficult to}} implement and may not be feasible with all types of remote sensing data. The utility of fractional SCA mapping relative to binary SCA mapping varies with the intended application as well as by spatial resolution, temporal resolution and period of interest, and climate. We quantified the frequency of occurrence of partially snow-covered (mixed) pixels at spatial resolutions between 1 m and 500 m over five dates at two study areas in the western U. S., using 0. 5 m binary SCA maps derived from high spatial resolution imagery aggregated to fractional SCA at coarser spatial resolutions. In addition, we used in situ monitoring to estimate the frequency of partially snow-covered conditions for the period September 2013 –August 2014 at 10 60 -m grid cell footprints at two study areas with continental snow climates. Results from the image analysis indicate that at 40 m, slightly above the nominal spatial resolution of Landsat, mixed pixels accounted for 25 %– 93 % of total pixels, while at 500 m, the nominal spatial resolution of MODIS bands used for snow cover mapping, mixed pixels accounted for 67 %– 100 % of total pixels. Mixed pixels occurred more commonly at the continental <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> site than at the maritime <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> site. The in situ data indicate that some snow cover was present between 186 and 303 days, and partial snow cover conditions occurred on 10 %– 98 % of days with snow cover. Four sites remained partially snow-free throughout most of the winter and spring, while six sites were entirely snow covered throughout most or all of the winter and spring. Within 60 m grid cells, the late spring/summer transition from snow-covered to snow-free conditions lasted 17 – 56 days and averaged 37 days. Our results suggest that mixed snow-covered snow-free pixels are common at the spatial resolutions imaged by both the Landsat and MODIS sensors. This highlights the additional information available from fractional SCA products and suggests fractional SCA can provide a major advantage for hydrological and climatological monitoring and modeling, particularly when accurate representation of the spatial distribution of snow cover is critical...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the drifting <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> of the Greenland ice sheet, using output from a high-resolution (&sim; 11 km) regional climate model. Because reliable direct observations of drifting snow do not exist, we evaluate the modeled near-surface climate instead, using {{automatic weather station}} (AWS) observations from the K-transect and find that RACMO 2 realistically simulates near-surface wind speed and relative humidity, two variables that are important for drifting snow. Integrated over the ice sheet, drifting snow sublimation (SUds) equals 24 &pm; 3 Gt yr− 1 , and is significantly larger than surface sublimation (SUs, 16 &pm; 2 Gt yr− 1 ). SUds strongly varies between seasons, and is only important in winter, when surface sublimation and runoff are small. A rapid transition exists between the winter season, when snowfall and SUds are important, and the summer season, when snowmelt is significant, which increases surface snow density and thereby limits drifting snow processes. Drifting snow erosion (ERds) is only important on a regional scale. In recent decades, following decreasing wind speed and rising near-surface temperatures, SUds exhibits a negative trend (0. 1 &pm; 0. 1 Gt yr− 1 ), which is compensated {{by an increase in}} SUs of similar magnitude...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The annual spring {{opening of}} the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park {{presents}} a unique avalanche forecasting challenge. The highway traverses dozens of avalanche paths mid-track in a 23 -kilometer section that crosses the Continental Divide. Workers removing seasonal snow and avalanche debris are exposed to paths that can produce avalanches of destructive class 4. The starting zones for most slide paths are within proposed Wilderness, and explosive testing or control are not currently used. Spring weather along the Divide is highly variable; rain-on-snow events are common, storms can bring several feet of new snow as late as June, and temperature swings can be dramatic. Natural avalanches- dry and wet slab, dry and wet loose, and glide avalanches- present {{a wide range of}} hazards and forecasting issues. This paper summarizes the forecasting program instituted in 2002 for the annual snow removal operations. It focuses on tools and techniques for forecasting natural wet snow avalanches by incorporating two case studies, including a widespread climax wet slab cycle in 2003. We examine weather and snowpack conditions conducive to wet snow avalanches, indicators for instability, and suggest a conceptual model for wet snow stability in a northern intermountain <b>snow</b> <b>climate...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{advances}} in computational methods {{and availability of}} digital terrain models allow for improvements in avalanche dynamics models. Such models have been used and calibrated primarily in Europe, but are likely to see increased applications worldwide. This paper describes applications of the Swiss model RAMMS for long-return period avalanches in two distinct North American climates. A mid-latitude continental <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> avalanche in the Elk Mountains near Aspen, Colorado occurred in March 1965. This large avalanche left distinct trim lines in the forest along the track and runout bounda-ries. The track has complex geometry that includes two sharp turns where the flow climbs due to momen-tum. A large avalanche occurred in February, 1986 in an unpopulated area of the Eastern Sierra Nevada range near Bridgeport, California. This mid-latitude maritime climate example was unique due to its long runout zone (1, 030 m) on a 4. 6 ° slope through a mature forest and large-volume release. RAMMS simula-tions produced a runout approximately 300 m short of that observed. In each case, release volumes and friction parameters are described along with adjustments made to ac-count for local climate and to improve model calibration...|$|E

This paper {{compares the}} spatial {{structure}} of the compressive strength of slab and weak layers from two different <b>snow</b> <b>climates.</b> Our data come from arrays of SnowMicroPen (SMP) measurements in southwestern Montana, USA, and near Davos in eastern Switzerland. In both cases, buried surface hoar comprised the critical snowpack weakness. We analyzed the SMP data by manually delineating the surface hoar layers {{and a number of}} layers within the slabs above the weak layers. Using the log- 10 transformed mean of the penetration resistance for our layers of interest, we investigated the spatial {{structure of the}} data by looking for linear slope-scale trends and assessing the residuals of any trends with semivariograms. Our results demonstrate that the layers investigated had variable spatial structures, both in terms of their linear trends and their semivariograms. This suggests that each snowpack layer has a unique spatial structure possibly arising from its depositional pattern and the subsequent changes to the layer when buried. We also demonstrate that the specific layout used for the measurements strongly influences the observed spatial variability. The complicated spatial structures of individual layers, and how they interact, likely contributes to the sometimes confounding overall patterns of spatial variability of stability observed on snow slopes...|$|R

Cold temperatures, hampered food availability and natural perils are just three of many potential threats that mountain ungulates face in winter.

We use population- and habitat-specific data on <b>snow,</b> <b>climate</b> and avalanche danger to identify the key environmental factors that essentially determine the spatio-temporal variations in chamois mortality. Initially, we show that most fatalities occurred in winter, with a peak around March, when typically snow depths were highest. Death causes related to poor general conditions were the major component of seasonal variations. As for the interannual variations in mortality, snow depth and avalanche risk best explained the occurrence of winters with increased numbers of fatalities. Finally, analyzing differences in mortality rates between populations, we identified sun-exposed winter habitats with little snow accumulation as favourable for alpine chamois...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} model resolution on the simulated wind speed, drifting <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> and surface mass balance (SMB) of Terre Ad´elie and its surroundings, East Antarctica. We compare regional climate model simulations at 27 and 5. 5 km resolution for the year 2009. The wind speed maxima in Terre Ad´elie and the narrow glacial valleys of Victoria Land are better represented at 5. 5 km resolution, because the topography is better resolved. Drifting snow sublimation is > 100 mma− 1 in regions with high wind speeds. Our results indicate a strong feedback between topography, wind gradients and drifting snow erosion. As a result, SMB shows much more local spatial variability at 5. 5 km resolution that is controlled by drifting snow erosion, whereas the large-scale SMB gradient is largely determined by precipitation. Drifting snow processes lead to ablation in the narrow glacial valleys of Victoria Land. The integrated SMB equals 86 Gt. Although wind climate, drifting snow processes and SMB variability are better represented at 5. 5 km, the area-integrated SMB is not significantly different between the simulations at 27 and 5. 5 km. A horizontal resolution of 27 km is sufficient to realistically simulate ice-sheet wide SMB...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Debris from {{a recent}} large {{avalanche}} event was observed in the runout zone in Second Creek, Berthoud Pass, Colorado. The debris extent {{and the amount of}} forest destruction were notable with both broken boles and uprooted and transported trees. On-site measurements of the alpha angle were surprisingly low at 17 degrees, based on clinometer measurements from the toe of the runout debris to the obvious crown. While alpha angles as low as 14. 8 o have been reported in Colorado, the mean al-pha angle in this <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> is 22. 1 o. Observers returned to the site during summer months to map ter-rain, core trees, collect thin sections (cookies), and map debris deposition locations. Measurements were analyzed to look at return periods for path locations and to map runout extent in the basin. The basin re-ceives frequent wintertime backcountry use from skiers, snowboarders, and snowshoers. A backcountry hut has recently been constructed in the basin, extending daytime use in the area and increasing multi-day overnight use. Two more large avalanches have been documented in the area close to the hut and informational mapping of hazardous areas and observed runout extents, along with daily avalanche and weather forecasts will be valuable to recreational users...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Extended Column Test (ECT) {{is a new}} {{stability}} test that aims to assess the fracture propagation potential across a 90 cm wide isolated column. Initial results with a dataset consisting of over 300 tests collected by one observer demonstrated the ECT’s effectiveness for differentiating between stable and unstable slopes. Further, we have received positive feedback on the test from a world-wide network of observers. This paper: 1) presents new recording standards for the test, 2) uses the SnowPilot dataset to further assess {{the effectiveness of the}} test by analyzing over 300 tests performed by several observers in different <b>snow</b> <b>climates,</b> 3) looks at the spatial variability of ECT results from several test grids, and 4) compares side-by-side results between the ECT and the Propagation Saw Test on stable and unstable slopes. Our results indicate that the ECT is an effective {{stability test}}, with a false stability ratio generally less than other standard snow stability tests. Results are sometimes quite spatially uniform, though occasionally slopes may exhibit variable ECT results. In comparison to the PST, our data suggest the ECT has a lower false stability rate, but a higher false instability rate. No test is perfect and all tests must be used in conjunction with additional data, but our results show the ECT is valuable additional tool for assessing snow stability...|$|R
40|$|Glide cracks {{can result}} in {{full-depth}} glide avalanche release. Avalanches from glide cracks are notoriously difficult to forecast, but are a reoccurring problem {{in a number of}} different avalanche forecasting programs across a range of <b>snow</b> <b>climates.</b> Despite this, there is no consensus for how to best manage, mitigate, or even observe glide cracks and the potential resultant avalanche activity. It is thought that an increase in the rate of snow gliding occurs prior to full-depth avalanche activity, so frequent measuring of glide crack movement provides an index of instability. Therefore, a comprehensive avalanche program with glide crack avalanche activity, should at the least, undertake some form of direct monitoring of glide crack movement. In this paper we present a simple, cheap and repeatable method to track glide crack activity using a series of stakes, reflectors and a laser rangefinder (LaserTech TruPulse 360 B) linked to a GPS (Trimble Geo XH). We tested the methodology in April 2010, on a glide crack above the Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. This study suggests a new method to better track the development and movement of glide cracks. It is hoped that by introducing a workable method to easily record glide crack movement, avalanche forecasters will improve their understanding of when, or if, avalanche activity will ensue. Our initial results suggest that these new observations, when combined with local micro-meteorological data will result in improved process understanding and forecasting of these phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{occurrence}} of wet-snow avalanches is, in general, poorly understood. For 20 years (winters of 1975 – 1976 to 1994 – 1995), the avalanche activity {{has been observed}} in the Dischma valley near Davos (Eastern Swiss Alps). The study area comprises a large starting zone of north-easterly aspect (2, 300 m a. s. l.) with several avalanche paths. We have analyzed the occurrence data in combination with meteorological and snowpack data collected at an elevation of 2, 090 m a. s. l. During the 20 -year observation period, almost 800 wet-snow avalanches were observed, about 4. 5 times more loose snow avalanches than slab avalanches. Considering both types of avalanches jointly, snow depth, precipi-tation and air temperature showed the highest correlation with avalanche activity. Most loose snow avalanches occurred when air temperature was high and/or after a precipitation period. Slab avalanches occurrence was primarily related to warm air temperatures and snowpack properties such as the isothermal state {{and the existence of}} capillary barriers. Radiation did not show up as a significant variable. The results suggest that in a transitional <b>snow</b> <b>climate</b> wet-snow avalanches are, as dry snow avalanches, often related to precipi-tation events, and that wet slab instability strongly depends on snowpack properties in relation to warming of the snowpack and melt water production...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Snow {{avalanche}} danger {{assessment for}} avalanche paths threatening a highway or a residential area is usually related to new snow depth. Given the extensive protection {{work in the}} Alps, the avalanche control service (also called avalanche commission) responsible for danger assessment will usually monitor the avalanche situation throughout the winter, but only become active {{in case of a}} major snow fall. Related safety concepts describing the procedures and measures to be taken in a given danger situation are therefore typically based on threshold values for new snow. By analysing the avalanche occurrence of a major avalanche path, we show that the return period of an avalanche to, for example, the road is about 5 years, whereas the return period for the corresponding new snow depth is substantially smaller, in our case slightly less than 2 years. Similar proportions were found for a number of other avalanche paths with different <b>snow</b> <b>climate.</b> The return period of the critical new snow depth is typically about 2 - 5 times smaller than the return period of the avalanche. This proportion is expected to increase with increasing return period. Hence, based on the return period of an avalanche path a first estimate for the critical new snow depth can be made. With a return period of the critical new snow depth of 1 - 2 years, avalanche prediction for individual avalanche path becomes very challenging since the false alarm ratio is expected to be high...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{a museum}} of {{avalanche}} phenomena, glide cracks and glide avalanches might be housed in the “strange but true ” section. These oddities are uncommon in most <b>snow</b> <b>climates</b> and tend to be isolated to specific terrain features such as bedrock slabs. Many glide cracks never result in avalanches, and when they do, {{the wide range of}} time between crack formation and slab failure makes them highly unpredictable. Despite their relative rarity, glide cracks and glide avalanches pose a regular threat and complex forecasting challenge during the annual spring opening of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, U. S. A. During the 2006 season, a series of unusual glide cracks delayed snow removal operations by over a week and provided a unique opportunity to record detailed observations of glide avalanches and characterize their occurrence and associated weather conditions. Field observations were from snowpits, crown profiles and where possible, measurements of slab thickness, bed surface slope angle, substrate and other physical characteristics. Weather data were recorded at one SNOTEL site and two automated stations located from 0. 6 - 10 km of observed glide slab avalanches. Nearly half (43 %) of the 35 glide slab avalanches recorded were Class D 2 - 2. 5, with 15 % Class D 3 -D 3. 5. The time between glide crack opening and failure ranged from 2 days to over six weeks, and the avalanches occurred in cycles associated with loss of snow water equivalent and spikes in temperature and radiation.
