50|$|Parapercis alboguttata, the bluenose grubfish, known also as the bluenose sandperch and whitespot <b>sandsmelt,</b> is {{a species}} of marine bony fish in the family Pinguipedidae, native to the western Indo-Pacific Ocean. It was first {{described}} by the German-born, British ichthyologist and zoologist, Albert Günther, in 1872.|$|E
40|$|Desert rivers {{are highly}} dynamic systems in which dry periods, {{frequently}} involving {{the cessation of}} superficial flow, alternate with violent flash floods. In spite of their territorial importance and high functional and biological diversity, desert rivers have received little attention in the scientific literature, especially in Northern Africa. This study investigated the distribution of non-native fish, their relationship with river damming and their potential impacts on native biodiversity in the main river basins draining arid areas of Morocco (Oued Draa, Oued Ziz and Oued Ghir), based on field sampling covering 84 stream reaches. Thirteen fish species were recorded, eight of which are non-native. Two species (stone moroko, Pseudorasbora parva, and bleak, Alburnus alburnus) had not been previously recorded in Morocco, while the native <b>sandsmelt</b> (Atherina boyeri) had not been cited as an invader. Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) was the most widely distributed non-native fish. Non-native fish species were associated with reservoirs, colonizing the regulated downstream reaches. In contrast, unregulated upstream reaches tended {{to be free of}} non-natives. The low abundance of native fish in reservoirs seems to be caused by the impacts of introduced fish species. Management options for environmental flow are limited, owing to reduced water availability. Non-native fish management should thus focus on limiting the spread of species already introduced and avoiding new introductions, especially into reservoirs. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The otter is {{widespread}} {{through all the}} Parque Natural Sierra Norte de Sevilla and surrounding areas. We found that the otter varied its intensity of use of habitat {{in the course of}} the portion of the longitudinal gradient defined as headwaters-middle reaches. The otter tended to use more intensively middle reaches instead of headwaters, related to food sources availability. The otter fed on 20 different preys: 11 different freshwater fish species (The Iberian barbell, calandino, the sun fish, the Iberian <b>sandsmelt,</b> the Iberian chub, the Iberian nase, pardilla and common trout), seven vertebrates (common frogs, common toads, urodels, water snakes, birds y micromamifers) and two invertebrates (the red swamp crayfish and insects). Within all these preys the Iberian barbell (Barbus sclateri), the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and common frog (Rana perezi) stood out in order of preference. 61 % of preys and 84 % of total biomass corresponded to freshwater fish individuals. This fact underlines the high importance that freshwater fish had for the otters´ diet within the study area. However, otter’s diet showed a faithfully pattern in relation to preys availability, since they mainly fed on the most available preys. This general pattern must be specified, as the otter tended to select or reject some fish species and/or fish sizes. Long sized fishes were specially consumed except for the sun fish (Lepomis gibbosus) with which this general pattern appeared inverted. In summary we can say that the Sierra Norte´s otter population is in good or very good health...|$|E
