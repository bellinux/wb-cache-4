It characterizes the relative <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which provide security services, and provides guidance in selecting these mechanisms.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the common {{practice}} of describing the performance of state bureau-cracies primarily {{in terms of their}} central tendencies should be abandoned. Within-country, cross-agency diversity in bureaucratic professionalism often overwhelms the variation encoun-tered across public sectors considered in their entireties, thus placing in doubt the utility of qualitative typologies (’bureaucracies with adjectives’) and quantitative indicators of state ca-pacity based solely on national-level reputations. To develop the claim of relatively greater agency-level diversity than cross-national diversity, the paper draws upon data collected by the author in a large scale survey of public employees conducted in three South American coun-tries with highly distinctive national-level reputations for bureaucratic professionalism: Bolivia, Brazil and Chile. The paper uses the data to juxtapose cross-agency and cross-national perfor-mance on three classic dimensions of bureaucratic professionalism: civil service politicization, the institutionalization of bureaucratic career paths, and the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanisms</b> designed to control corruption. On all three dimensions the evidence points to greater within-country institutional diversity than cross-national diversity...|$|R
40|$|The term “ {{assurance}} ” {{has been}} used for decades in trusted system development as an expression of confidence that one has in the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanisms</b> or countermeasures. One of the unsolved problems of security engineering is the adoption of measures or metrics that can reliably depict the assurance associated with a specific hardware and software system. This paper reports on a recent attempt to focus requirements in this area by examining those currently in use. It then suggests a categorization of Information Assurance (IA) metrics that may be tailored to an organization’s needs 1. We believe that the provision <b>of</b> security <b>mechanisms</b> in systems is a subset of the systems engineering discipline having a large software-engineering correlation. There is general agreement that no single system metric or any “one-prefect ” set of IA metrics applies across all systems or audiences. The set most useful for an organization largely depends on their IA goals, their technical, organizational and operational needs, and the financial, personnel, and technical resources that are available. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{fact that}} users {{struggle}} {{to keep up with}} all their (textual) passwords is no secret. Thus, one could argue that the textual password needs to be replaced. One alternative is graphical authentication. A wide range <b>of</b> graphical <b>mechanisms</b> have been proposed in the research literature. Yet, the industry has not embraced these alternatives. We use nowadays (textual) passwords several times a day to mediate access to protected resources and to ensure that accountability is facilitated. Consequently, the main aspect of interest to decision-makers is the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> an authentication <b>mechanism</b> to resist intrusion attempts.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{explores the}} ethical {{decision}} making of internal auditors {{and the impact}} <b>of</b> corporate governance <b>mechanisms</b> thereon. It also explores whether ethical decision making is influenced by {{years of experience in}} internal auditing. Design/methodology/approach Sixty-six internal auditors were presented with five ethical dilemmas. For each scenario, a key element of corporate governance was manipulated to assess its impact on ethical decision making. These were audit committee support; management integrity regarding accounting policies; management integrity regarding pressure on internal audit; external auditor characteristics; and organisational code of conduct. Findings Participants were generally sensitive to ethical dilemmas but were not always confident that their peers would act ethically. A higher quality external audit function was positively associated with internal auditors’ ethical decision making. However, the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> other governance <b>mechanisms</b> did not appear to influence ethical decision making. Finally, more experienced internal auditors adopted a more ethical stance in some cases. Research limitations/implications Our sample was self-selected and may not be representative of internal auditors in general. Our lack of significant results may be due to insufficient variability in our manipulations and/or an oversimplification of reality in our scenarios. Practical implications The study has implications for the internal audit profession with respect to training and the provision <b>of</b> support <b>mechanisms</b> to strengthen the ability of internal auditors to withstand pressure when dealing with ethical dilemmas. Originality/value This paper is the first to study whether the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> other governance <b>mechanisms</b> influence internal auditors’ ethical decision making...|$|R

Although resource competition is commonly studied, the effects of associational resistance are not as evident if studies are not designed to detect them. Additionally, the relative <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> different ecological <b>mechanisms</b> ought to be measured in studies, rather than the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> singular <b>mechanisms.</b> This permits proper attribution of causes and effects in community structure and detection of higher order interactions in a way that naïve reductionism will not. In a series of experiments, I looked at the effects of large-scale addition and removal of Borrichia frutescens on associational resistance of Iva frutescens to the gallformer Asphondylia borrichiae in order to test the <b>mechanism</b> and <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> associational resistance in the system. Additionally, I measured the effects of relative host abundance and interpatch distance of hosts on associational resistance. Finally, I looked at the effect of the presence of stemborers competing with the gall former for host plant resources on parasitism rate and parasitoid guild composition. I found evidence for a strong effect of associational resistance by natural enemies over short distances, although the phenomenon is likely of minor importance in comparison to other factors known to affect gall former population density, such as environmental effects and host plant genotype. Competitors also had a weak effect, reducing mean gall diameter, but not significantly altering total parasitism rate. However, the presence of stemborer competitors did slightly alter the composition of the parasitoid guild. In sum, both associational resistance and competition from stemborers have detectable effects on A. borrichiae, albeit weak ones. Environmental factors, such as soil nitrogen content, are likely much stronger determinants of gall former population size...|$|R
