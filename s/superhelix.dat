5000|$|In nature, {{circular}} DNA {{is always}} isolated as a higher-order helix-upon-a-helix, {{known as a}} <b>superhelix.</b> In discussions of this subject, the Watson-Crick twist {{is referred to as}} a [...] "secondary" [...] winding, and the superhelices as a [...] "tertiary" [...] winding. The sketch at right indicates a [...] "relaxed", or [...] "open circular" [...] Watson-Crick double-helix, and, next to it, a right-handed <b>superhelix.</b> The [...] "relaxed" [...] structure on the left is not found unless the chromosome is nicked; the <b>superhelix</b> is the form usually found in nature.|$|E

40|$|Reproducible {{images of}} pBR 322 plasmid {{molecules}} {{have been recorded}} by scanning force microscopy under 1 -propanol. Most of the plasmids were found in a coiled state. The supercoiled molecules of our samples look like branched or unbranched interwound <b>superhelixes.</b> This is consistent with available electron microscopy data on circular DNA molecules. By applying a stratigraphic analysis which {{takes advantage of the}} height information contained in the scanning force microscopy images, it is possible to assign the chirality of the local supercoiling of the individual molecules...|$|R
40|$|Herein we {{demonstrate}} that a substitution type of the pyrene in short amphiphilic oligomers determines a morphology of the assemblies formed. Thus, 1. 6 - and 2. 7 -linkages {{lead to a}} formation of micrometer-sized 2 D supromolecular polymers with a constant thickness 2 nm (pictures A and B). These assemblies possess {{a high degree of}} an internal order: the interior consists of hydrophobic pyrenes and alkyl chains, whereas the exterior exists as a net of hydrophilic negatively charged phosphates. Contrary, a 1. 8 -linkage exclusiveley leads to a formation of long nanometer thick helical supramolecular polymers (picturee C). These structures tend to form even more complex assemblies (bundles, <b>superhelixes).</b> Moreover, for all samples the polymerization process occurs via a nucleation-elongation mechanism. To study Py 3 self-assembly, we carried out whole set of spectroscopic (UV/vis, fluorescence, DLS) and microscopic experiments (AFM) ...|$|R
40|$|Very {{important}} aspects of the modern nanotechnology are control and prediction of arraying patterns of opto- and electroactive molecules in discrete objects on nanoscale level both on surface and solution. Consequqntly, a self-assembly of small molucules provides such an opportunity. For example, oligopyrenotides (OPs, short amphiphilic pyrene oligomers) represent a novel class of amphiphilic molecules which tend to aggegate in aqueous phase. As has been already shown, OPs are able to form 1 D supramolecular polymer only under high salt concentration. Since programmed arraying of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in structurally defined objects could offer enhanced performance over the individual components, prediction and controlling of their spatial arrangement remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate that substitution type of the pyrene is crutial, and it determines a morphology of the assemblies. Thus, a 1. 6 -linkage causes a formation of large, free-standing 2 D supromolecular polymers with a thickness 2 nm. These assemblies possess a high degree of an internal order: the interior consists of hydrophobic pyrenes and alkyl chains, whereas the exterior exists as a net of hydrophilic negatively charged phosphates. Contrary, a 1. 8 -linkage exclusiveley leads to a formation of long (up to a few micrometer), nanometer thick helical supramolecular polymers. These structures tend to form even more complex structures (bundles, <b>superhelixes).</b> Moreover for both molecules, the polymerizations occurs via a nucleation-elongation mechanism. To study Py 3 self-assembly, we carried out whole set of spectroscopic (UV/vis, fluorescence, DLS) and microscopic experiments (AFM) ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{purposes}} of mathematical computations, a right-handed <b>superhelix</b> {{is defined as}} having a [...] "negative" [...] number of superhelical turns, and a left-handed <b>superhelix</b> is defined as having a [...] "positive" [...] number of superhelical turns. In the drawing (shown at the right), both the secondary (i.e., [...] "Watson-Crick") winding and the tertiary (i.e., [...] "superhelical") winding are right-handed, hence the supertwists are negative (-3 in this example).|$|E
50|$|The C-terminal domain is {{responsible}} for G-actin-binding. This domain has a superhelical structure, where the <b>superhelix</b> turns are made of two beta-strands each.|$|E
50|$|A <b>superhelix</b> is a {{molecular}} structure {{in which a}} helix is itself coiled into a helix. This is significant to both proteins and genetic material, such as overwound circular DNA.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{canonical}} LRR protein contains approximately one helix for every beta strand, variants that form beta-alpha <b>superhelix</b> folds sometimes have long loops rather than helices linking successive beta strands.|$|E
50|$|Plant lipid {{transfer}} proteins {{consist of}} 4 alpha-helices in a right-handed <b>superhelix</b> with a folded leaf topology. The structure is stabilised by disulfide bonds linking the helices to each other.|$|E
50|$|One leucine-rich repeat variant domain (LRV) has a novel {{repetitive}} structural motif {{consisting of}} alternating alpha- and 3(10)-helices {{arranged in a}} right-handed <b>superhelix,</b> with {{the absence of the}} beta-sheets present in other leucine-rich repeats.|$|E
5000|$|The crotonase family {{comprises}} mechanistically diverse {{proteins that}} share a conserved trimeric quaternary structure (sometimes a hexamer {{consisting of a}} dimer of trimers), the core of which consists of 4 turns of a (beta/beta/alpha)n <b>superhelix.</b>|$|E
50|$|Virions are non-enveloped, {{consisting}} of a tube-like <b>superhelix</b> formed by dsDNA and the major structural protein, with plugs at each end to which three tail fibers are anchored. These tail fibers appear {{to be involved in}} adsorption onto the host cell surface and are formed by one of the minor structural proteins.|$|E
50|$|The 3-dimensional fold of an {{armadillo}} repeat {{was first}} {{observed in the}} crystal structure of beta-catenin, where the 12 repeats form a <b>superhelix</b> of alpha helices with three helices per unit. The cylindrical structure features a positively charged groove, which presumably interacts with the acidic surfaces of the known interaction partners of beta-catenin.|$|E
50|$|Resolution of {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of the VHS domain of Drosophila Hrs and human Tom1 revealed that it consists of eight helices arranged in a double-layer <b>superhelix.</b> The existence of conserved patches of residues on the domain surface suggests that VHS domains {{may be involved in}} protein-protein recognition and docking. Overall, sequence similarity is low (approx 25%) amongst domain family members.|$|E
50|$|Alpha {{solenoids}} have unusual elasticity {{and flexibility}} relative to globular proteins. They are sometimes considered to occupy an intermediate position between globular proteins and fibrous structural proteins, {{distinct from the}} latter {{in part due to}} the alpha solenoids' lack of need for intermolecular interactions to maintain their structure. The extent of the curvature of an alpha solenoid <b>superhelix</b> varies considerably among the class, resulting in the ability of these proteins to form large, extended protein-protein interaction surfaces or to form deep concave areas for binding globular proteins.|$|E
5000|$|A typical TPR {{structure}} {{is characterized by}} interactions between helices A and B of the first motif and helix A’ of the next TPR. Although the nature of such interactions may vary, the first two helices of the TPR motif typically have a packing angle of ~24 degrees within a single motif. Repeats of more than three TPR motifs generate a right handed <b>superhelix</b> characterized by both a concave and a convex face, of which the concave face is usually involved in ligand binding.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "alpha solenoid" [...] {{has been}} used {{somewhat}} inconsistently in the literature. As originally defined, alpha solenoids were composed of helix-turn-helix motifs that stacked into an open <b>superhelix.</b> However, protein structural classification systems have used varying terminology; the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database describes these proteins using the term [...] "alpha alpha superhelix". The CATH database uses the term [...] "alpha horseshoe" [...] for these proteins, and uses [...] "alpha solenoid" [...] for a somewhat different and more compact structure exemplified by the peridinin-chlorophyll binding protein.|$|E
50|$|Vps35 is {{the largest}} subunit of retromer with the {{molecular}} weight of 92-kDa and functions as the central platform for the assembly of Vps26 and Vps29. Vps35 resembles many other helical solenoid proteins including AP adaptor protein complexes that are characterized with repeated structural units in a continuous <b>superhelix</b> arrangement involved in coated vesicle trafficking. The curved surface of the 6 even-numbered helices within solenoid structure with series of ridges separating hydrophobic grooves function as potential cargo binding sites. The C-terminal of Vps35 contains an α-solenoid fold that fits into the metal binding pocket of Vps29.|$|E
50|$|Circular DNA {{are more}} {{strongly}} affected by ethidium bromide concentration than linear DNA if ethidium bromide {{is present in}} the gel during electrophoresis. All naturally occurring DNA circles are underwound, but ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular DNA can change the charge, length, as well as the superhelicity of the DNA molecule, therefore its presence during electrophoresis can affect its movement in gel. Increasing ethidium bromide intercalated into the DNA can change it from a negatively supercoiled molecule into a fully relaxed form, then to positively coiled <b>superhelix</b> at maximum intercalation. Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology.|$|E
50|$|An alpha solenoid (sometimes {{also known}} as an alpha {{horseshoe}} or as stacked pairs of alpha helices, abbreviated SPAH) is a protein fold composed of repeating alpha helix subunits, commonly helix-turn-helix motifs, arranged in antiparallel fashion to form a <b>superhelix.</b> Alpha solenoids {{are known for their}} flexibility and plasticity. Like beta propellers, alpha solenoids are a form of solenoid protein domain commonly found in the proteins comprising the nuclear pore complex. They are also common in membrane coat proteins known as coatomers, such as clathrin, and in regulatory proteins that form extensive protein-protein interactions with their binding partners. Examples of alpha solenoid structures binding RNA and lipids have also been described.|$|E
50|$|Pioneering {{structural}} {{studies in}} the 1980s by Aaron Klug's group provided the first evidence that an octamer of histone proteins wraps DNA around itself in about 1.7 turns of a left-handed <b>superhelix.</b> In 1997 the first near atomic resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome was solved by the Richmond group, showing the most important details of the particle. The human alpha-satellite palindromic DNA critical to achieving the 1997 nucleosome crystal structure {{was developed by the}} Bunick group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The structures of over 20 different nucleosome core particles have been solved to date, including those containing histone variants and histones from different species. The structure of the nucleosome core particle is remarkably conserved, and even a change of over 100 residues between frog and yeast histones results in electron density maps with an overall root mean square deviation of only 1.6Å.|$|E
50|$|In {{collagen}}, the collagen helix, or type-2 helix, {{is a major}} {{shape in}} secondary structure. It consists of a triple helix made of the repetitious amino acid sequence glycine - X - Y, where X and Y are frequently proline or hydroxyproline.A collagen triple helix has 3.3 residues per turn.Each of the three chains is stabilized by the steric repulsion due to the pyrrolidine rings of proline and hydroxyproline residues. The pyrrolidine rings keep out of each other’s way when the polypeptide chain assumes this extended helical form, {{which is much more}} open than the tightly coiled form of the alpha helix.The three chains are hydrogen bonded to each other. The hydrogen bond donors are the peptide NH groups of glycine residues. The hydrogen bond acceptors are the CO groups of residues on the other chains. The OH group of hydroxyproline also participates in hydrogen bonding. The rise of the collagen helix (<b>superhelix)</b> is 2.9 Å (0.29 nm) per residue.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence of two {{reserved}} ARM superfamily domains {{are shown}} in the TMCO6 protein. The ARM domain, Armadillo/ beta-catenin-like-repeat, is about a 40 amino acid long tandem repeat that forms <b>superhelix</b> of helices. Another feature is that TMCO6 has an Arginine rich region that is within the coil-coiled region. This indicates that the Arg rich area might be an important structural feature of the coiled-coil region. There are 17 regions for protein binding, 2 transmembrane domains and an addition of a poly-A tail to the mRNA. An SRP1 is also found from the 23-399 amino acids. The SRP1 domain is Karyopherin(importin) alpha. [...] This {{is involved in the}} exchange of molecules from the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The exchange involves the active transport by a carrier protein called karyopherins. A di-leucine motif is also abundant in TMCO6. This motif is commonly known to be a lysosome targeting motif. A nuclear localization sequence of 5 positive amino acids is found near the 5' end indicating its transport to the nucleus.|$|E
5000|$|TAL effectors {{are found}} in {{bacterial}} plant pathogens of the genus Xanthomonas and are involved in regulating the genes of the host plant {{in order to facilitate}} bacterial virulence, proliferation, and dissemination. [...] They contain a central region of tandem 33-35 residue repeats and each repeat region encodes a single DNA base in the TALE's binding site. Within the repeat it is residue 13 alone that directly contacts the DNA base, determining sequence specificity, while other positions make contacts with the DNA backbone, stabilising the DNA-binding interaction. Each repeat within the array takes the form of paired alpha-helices, while the whole repeat array forms a right-handed <b>superhelix,</b> wrapping around the DNA-double helix. TAL effector repeat arrays have been shown to contract upon DNA binding and a two-state search mechanism has been proposed whereby the elongated TALE begins to contract around the DNA beginning with a successful Thymine recognition from a unique repeat unit N-terminal of the core TAL-effector repeat array.Related proteins {{are found in}} bacterial plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, the fungal endosymbiont Burkholderia rhizoxinica [...] and two as-yet unidentified marine-microorganisms. The DNA binding code and the structure of the repeat array is conserved between these groups, referred to collectively as the TALE-likes.|$|E
40|$|We used Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to investigate}} the conformational and thermodynamic properties of DNA molecules with physiological levels of supercoiling. Three parameters determine the properties of DNA in this model: Kuhn statistical length, torsional rigidity and effective double-helix diameter. The chains in the simulation resemble strongly those observed by electron microscopy and have the conformation of an interwound <b>superhelix</b> whose axis is often branched. We compared the geometry of simulated chains with that determined experimentally by electron microscopy and by topological methods. We found a very close agreement between the Monte Carlo and experimental values for writhe, <b>superhelix</b> axis length {{and the number of}} superhelical turns. The computed number of <b>superhelix</b> branches was found to be dependent on <b>superhelix</b> density, DNA chain length and double-helix diameter. We investigated the thermodynamics of supercoiling and found that at low <b>superhelix</b> density the entropic contribution to <b>superhelix</b> free energy is negligible, whereas at high <b>superhelix</b> density, the entropic and enthalpic contributions are nearly equal. We calculated the effect of supercoiling on the spatial distribution of DNA segments. The probability that a pair of DNA sites separated along the chain contour by a...|$|E
40|$|Closed {{circular}} DNA {{molecules in}} aqueous solution {{take the form of}} interwound superhelices over a wide range of <b>superhelix</b> densities. We describe a very simple model of such a <b>superhelix</b> in which twisting and bending forces are in balance, subject both to topological constraints and to a limitation on the distance of closet approach of the interwound duplexes of the <b>superhelix.</b> The model is consistent with some of the observed physical properties of closed circular DNA, and suggests that there may be severe limits to the range of allowable geometries for the <b>superhelix</b> structure of minimum energy...|$|E
40|$|By {{incubating}} covalently-closed circular DNA in {{the presence}} of calf thymus topoisomerase and unwinding ligands (intercalating drugs and proteins) DNAs of different <b>superhelix</b> density can be produced. These changes in <b>superhelix</b> density can be monitored by an ethidium fluorescence assay, since the level of ethidium binding varies with the <b>superhelix</b> density of a DNA. Thus the equivalence point, in a titration between an unwinding ligand and a supercoiled DNA, can be found. This forms the basis for an extremely rapid method for measuring unwinding angles and <b>superhelix</b> densities. Results are presented which agree well with those reported by previous authors using different techniques. The present method compares very favourably with others when evaluated in terms of rapidity, cost of materials, cost of equipment, accuracy and also applicability...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} {{scanning}} force microscopy (SFM) {{to study the}} conformation of a 1868 base pair plasmid (p 1868) in its open circular form and at a superhelical density of sigma= - 0. 034. The samples were deposited on a mica surface {{in the presence of}} MgCl 2. DNA images were obtained both in air and in aqueous solutions, and the dimensions of the DNA <b>superhelix</b> were analysed. Evaluation of the whole plasmid yielded average <b>superhelix</b> dimensions of 27 +/- 9 nm (outer <b>superhelix</b> diameter D), 107 +/- 51 nm (<b>superhelix</b> pitch P), and 54 +/- 8 degrees (<b>superhelix</b> pitch angle alpha). We also analysed compact superhelical regions within the plasmid separately, and determined values of D = 9. 2 +/- 3. 3 nm, P = 42 +/- 13 nm and alpha= 63 +/- 20 degrees for samples scanned in air or rehydrated in water. These results indicate relatively large conformation changes between superhelical and more open regions of the plasmid. In addition to the analysis of the DNA <b>superhelix</b> dimensions, we have followed the deposition process of open circular p 1868 to mica in real time. These experiments show {{that it is possible to}} image DNA samples by SFM without prior drying, and that the surface bound DNA molecules retain some ability to change their position on the surface...|$|E
40|$|Covalently closed {{intracellular}} and viral {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were separately isolated from infected African green monkey cells (BSC- 1) grown in culture. The two DNA species form overlapping bands centered at different positions in a propidium di-iodide-cesium chloride (PDI-CsCl) buoyant density gradient capable of separating closed DNA species with different <b>superhelix</b> densities. When the dense {{side of a}} 32 P-labeled intracellular DNA band was mixed with the light side of a 3 H-labeled intracellular DNA band and again centrifuged in a PDI-CsCl density gradient, two overlapping bands formed with modes displaced from each other. Similar band-splitting experiments performed with viral DNA always gave superimposable bands. The foregoing experiments demonstrate that the intracellular DNA is heterogeneous in <b>superhelix</b> density, whereas, by the same criteria, the viral DNA is homogeneous. The mean <b>superhelix</b> density of the intracellular closed DNA is approximately three-fourths {{as large as the}} <b>superhelix</b> density of the viral DNA. These results {{rule out the possibility that}} closed SV 40 DNA is drawn randomly from the intracellular pool and assembled without a further nicking-closing step into virions. When the cells were grown and infected in the presence of ethidium bromide (EB), the intracellular closed DNA was found to be homogeneous in <b>superhelix</b> density and to have the same <b>superhelix</b> density as the viral DNA which, in turn, was unaffected by the presence of the drug. The foregoing results were explained by postulating that the intracellular DNA is formed with a homogeneous <b>superhelix</b> density and becomes heterogeneous in the absence of EB as a result of a nicking-closing cycle that occurs in a spacially or temporally heterogeneous environment. The drug EB would inhibit this action by inhibiting the nicking enzyme(s) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} between open and closed circular DNA in buoyant CsCl gradients containing intercalating dyes {{depends on the}} <b>superhelix</b> density of the closed form. These separations are about 1. 8 times larger with propidium iodide than with ethidium bromide. The <b>superhelix</b> densities of mitochondrial DNA from HeLa cells and Lytechinus pictus eggs appear to be about two thirds that of mitochondrial DNA from rat and rabbit liver...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{calculated}} the relaxation {{time of a}} cruciform structure in superhelical DNA {{as a function of}} the <b>superhelix</b> density for palindromic regions of different lengths. The relaxation time has a sharp maximum at the <b>superhelix</b> density which corresponds to the equilibrium transition point between the cruciform structure and the regular double helix. This maximal value is shown to depend dramatically on the length of the palindromic region...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{bodies were}} {{isolated}} from Escherichia coli spheroplasts by two different lysis procedures. Their lipid and protein {{content and the}} <b>superhelix</b> density was measured. The preparations differed mainly in respect {{to the amount of}} the attached membrane material, which seems to be an essential factor in maintaining the stability of the nuclear bodies. The <b>superhelix</b> density was found to be higher than that of naturally occurring, covalently closed, circular deoxyribonucleic acids. The influence of the preparative method on the superhelicity was comparatively small...|$|E
40|$|Nucleosomes were {{assembled}} on a plasmid {{carrying a}} Xenopus somatic 5 S RNA gene prepared at different <b>superhelix</b> densities. The gene was preferentially assembled into a positioned nucleosome which was stable to superhelical stress. No {{evidence for a}} conformational change in the nucleosome was found, even under extreme negative superhelical stress. Transcription in an extract from Xenopus oocyte nuclei was repressed to a degree which depended {{on the number of}} nucleosomes assembled. Topoisomerase activity in the extract was effectively inhibited by camptothecin, which had no effect on transcription. Transcription of reconstitutes remained repressed relative to naked plasmids, and was independent of <b>superhelix</b> density. Transcripts from reconstitutes were derived solely from nucleosome-free genes. Thus, a histone octamer positioned on the gene was sufficient to block its transcription. Tryptic removal of the core histone tail domains had no effect on transcription at any <b>superhelix</b> density. Transcription of reconstitutes containing H 3 /H 4 tetramers was also repressed, but not eliminated (unlike reconstitutes containing octamers), and repression was independent of <b>superhelix</b> density. We suggest that removal of histones H 2 A/H 2 B from the nucleosome facilitates activation of transcription in the extract. We conclude that superhelical stress alone does not activate transcription of a 5 S RNA gene assembled into a nucleosome in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} presented Brownian dynamics {{model for}} superhelical DNA is extended to include local {{curvature of the}} DNA helix axis. Here we analyze {{the effect of a}} permanent bend on the structure and dynamics of an 1870 -bp <b>superhelix</b> with delta Lk = - 10. Furthermore, we define quantitative expressions for computing structural parameters such as loop positions, <b>superhelix</b> diameter, and plectonemic content for trajectories of superhelical DNA, and assess the convergence toward global equilibrium. The structural fluctuations in an interwound <b>superhelix,</b> as reflected in the change in end loop positions, seem to occur by destruction/creation of loops rather than by a sliding motion of the DNA around its contour. Their time scale is on the order of 30 - 100 microseconds. A permanent bend changes the structure and the internal motions of the DNA drastically. The position of the end loop is fixed at the permanent bend, and the local motions of the chain are enhanced near the loops. A displacement of the bend from the end loop to a position inside the plectonemic part of the <b>superhelix</b> results in the formation of a new loop and the disappearance of the old one; we estimate the time involved in this process to be about 0. 5 ms...|$|E
