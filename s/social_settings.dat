25|$|In {{addition}} to expert systems, other researchers developed {{the concept of}} frame based languages in the mid 1980s. A frame is similar to an object class: It is an abstract description of a category describing things in the world, problems, and potential solutions. Frames were originally used on systems geared toward human interaction, e.g. understanding natural language and the <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> in which various default expectations such as ordering food in a restaurant narrow the search space and allow the system to choose appropriate responses to dynamic situations.|$|E

25|$|Beethoven is {{reported}} to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at the interruption of his work—having fallen over, he got up to find himself deaf. His hearing only ever partially recovered and, during its gradual decline, was impeded by a severe form of tinnitus. As early as 1801, he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).|$|E
25|$|The Turkish {{language}} {{is the second}} most spoken language in Germany, after the German language. It was brought to the country by Turkish immigrants who speak it as their first language. These immigrants mainly learned the German language through employment, mass media, and <b>social</b> <b>settings,</b> and it has now become the second language for many of them. Nonetheless, most Turkish immigrants have passed down their mother tongue to their children and descendants. In general, German-born Turks become bilingual at an early age, learning Turkish at home and German in state schools; thereafter, a dialectal variety often remains in their repertoire of both languages.|$|E

25|$|All these African {{cultures}} had musical traditions, which survive erratically to {{the present}} day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In what other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa? They certainly are in Lucumí ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response) and dance in well-defined <b>social</b> <b>settings,</b> {{and the absence of}} melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} microsociology aims {{to focus on}} {{individual}} behavior in <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> One specific researcher in the field, Erving Goffman, claims that humans {{tend to believe that}} they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he is speaking. Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.|$|E
25|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder which has symptoms expressed {{over a wide}} range of settings. Socially, it expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even successful <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder which suggest that their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder, and is suggestive of at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development.|$|E

25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder usually develops in adolescence or during early adulthood. It {{is not uncommon}} for children and adolescents to display some traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences usually are transient, and do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD. True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe to the degree that significantly impairs the person's capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function, either at work, or school, or important <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> The DSM-5 indicates that the traits manifested by the person must substantially differ from cultural norms, in order to qualify as symptoms of NPD.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} body {{satisfaction}} and appearance esteem {{continues to increase}} with the abundance of; billboards, magazines, and conversations, displaying “unrealistic images of beauty” (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices {{brought up in the}} media or <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet. In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability.  This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the mainstream media, whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance. Hence, a women’s attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society’s obsession with thinness.|$|E

We are not aware of any previous methods for inference about network members in observational settings that allow the number of ties per node to increase as the network grows. While previous methods have generally implicitly focused on one of two possible sources of dependence among social network observations, we allow for both dependence due to contagion, or transmission of information across network ties, and for dependence due to latent similarities among nodes sharing ties.

500|$|The fiddle has ancient {{roots in}} Ireland, {{the first report}} of bowed {{instruments}} similar to the violin being in the Book of Leinster (ca. 1160). The modern violin was ubiquitous in Ireland by the early 1700s. However the first mention of the fiddle being in use in Donegal is from the blind harper Arthur O'Neill who in his 1760 memoirs described a wedding in Ardara as having [...] "plenty of pipers and fiddlers". Donegal fiddlers participated {{in the development of}} the Irish music tradition in the 18th century during which jigs and slipjigs and later reels and hornpipes became the dominant musical forms. However, Donegal musicians, many of them being fishermen, also frequently travelled to Scotland, where they acquired tune types from the Scottish repertoire such as the Strathspey which was integrated into the Donegal tradition as [...] "Highland" [...] tunes. The Donegal tradition derives much of its unique character from the synthesis of Irish and Scottish stylistic features and repertoires. Aoidh notes however that while different types of art music were commonly played among the upper classes of Scottish society in the 18th century, the Donegal tradition drew exclusively from the popular types of Scottish music. Like some Scottish fiddlers (who, like Donegal fiddlers, tend to use a short bow and play in a straight-ahead fashion), some Donegal fiddlers worked at imitating the sound of the bagpipes. Workers from Donegal would bring their music to Scotland and also bring back Scottish tunes with them such music of J. Scott Skinner and Mackenzie Murdoch. Lilting, unaccompanied singing of wordless tunes, was also an important part of the Donegal musical tradition often performed by women in <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> Describing the musical life of Arranmore Island in the late 19th century singer Róise Rua Nic Gríanna describes the most popular dances: [...] "The Sets, the Lancers, the Maggie Pickie [...] the Donkey, the Mazurka and the Barn dances". Among the travelling fiddlers of the late 19th century players such as John Mhosaí McGinley, Anthony Hilferty, the McConnells and the Dohertys are best known. As skill levels increased through apprenticeships several fiddle masters appeared such as the Cassidy's, Connie Haughey, Jimmy Lyons and Miock McShane of Teelin and Francie Dearg and Mickey Bán Byrne of Kilcar. These virtuosos played unaccompanied listening pieces in addition to the more common dance music.|$|E
