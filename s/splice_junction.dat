40|$|Protein {{splicing}} is {{a compelling}} chemical reaction in which two proteins are produced posttranslationally from a single precursor polypeptide by excision of the internal protein segment and ligation of the flanking regions. This unique autocatalytic reaction was first discovered in the yeast Vma 1 p protozyme where the 50 -kD site-specific endonuclease (VDE) is excised from the 120 -kD precursor containing the N-and C-terminal regions of the catalytic subunit of the vacuolar H(+) -ATPase. In this work, we randomized the conserved valine triplet residues three amino acids upstream of the C-terminal <b>splicing</b> <b>junction</b> in the Vma 1 protozyme and found that these site-specific random mutations interfere with normal protein splicing to different extents.

This facilitates further studies of gene structure and expression on the genome wide scale. It {{is an important step}} to align reads to the reference genome and call out <b>splicing</b> <b>junctions</b> for the following analysis, such as the analysis of alternative splicing and isoform construction. However, because of the existence of introns, when RNA-seq reads are aligned to the reference genome, reads can not be fully mapped at splicing sites. Thus, it is challenging to align reads and call out <b>splicing</b> <b>junctions</b> accurately.

In this model, a selective pressure existed in the most primitive unicellular eukaryotes to generate longer coding sequences from random DNA sequences that were populated with in-frame nonsense codons, and intervened between short reading frames, started to be excised by an already existing spliceosome.

Software tools that use genome-guided alignment include Bowtie, TopHat (which builds on BowTie results to align splice junctions), Subread, STAR, Sailfish, Kallisto, and GMAP. The quality of a genome guided assembly can be measured with both 1) de novo assembly metrics (e.g., N50) and 2) comparisons to known transcript, <b>splice</b> <b>junction,</b> genome, and protein sequences using precision, recall, or their combination (e.g., F1 score).|$|E

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{mapping of}} reads that span <b>splice</b> <b>junctions</b> {{is a critical}} component of all analytic techniques that work with RNA-seq data. We introduce a second generation splice detection algorithm, MapSplice, whose focus is high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of splices as well as CPU and memory efficiency. MapSplice can be applied to both short (< 75 [*]bp) and long reads (≥ 75 [*]bp). MapSplice is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. MapSplice leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy. We demonstrate that MapSplice achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than TopHat and SpliceMap on a set of simulated RNA-seq data. Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the algorithm. <b>Splice</b> <b>junctions</b> derived from eight breast cancer RNA-seq datasets recapitulated the extensiveness of alternative splicing on a global level as well as the differences between molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

In contrast to previous pattern-based {{approaches to the}} splice site detection problem, the patterns to be matched are unknown in advance and are discovered using a supervised learning approach. We have used a genetic programming based system, PerlGP, to evolve regular expressions and proper length windows for a long sequence in which the evolved regular expressions can effectively characterize and predict the <b>splice</b> <b>junctions.</b> Since the gene splicing process is too complex to be fully understood currently, and the widely accepted consensus sequences only reflect some partial statistical information around splice sites, not to mention defining a splice site. However, our evolved regular expressions may shed {{new light on the}} underlying rules that define splice sites. Experimental results demonstrate that using the evolved regular expressions, <b>splice</b> <b>junctions</b> could be accurately characterized, furthermore, these evolved regular expressions could also be employed as a predictor to detect whether a GT/AG containing sequence is a splice site or not.

50|$|OHS is a milder allelic {{variant of}} Menkes disease, having a later age of onset and being {{associated}} with far less severe central neurodegeneration. The milder nature of OHS is often attributable to ‘leaky’ <b>splice</b> <b>junction</b> mutations that allow 20-30% of ATP7A messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to be correctly processed. As in cases of Menkes disease, individuals with OHS manifest connective tissue abnormalities resulting from deficient activity of lysyl oxidase, a copper-requiring enzyme that normally deaminates lysine and hydroxylysine in {{the first step of}} collagen crosslink formation. Such individuals also often endure inconvenient dysautonomic signs and symptoms related to a partial deficiency in dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) activity. DBH, another copper-dependent enzyme, normally converts dopamine to norepinephrine, a crucial neurotransmitter in norepinephrinergic neurons. A natural mouse model of OHS, the so-called mottled blotchy model, recapitulates the connective tissue abnormalities, DBH deficiency and mild CNS damage seen in humans.|$|E

50|$|During {{the second}} step of {{splicing}} in eukaryotic cells, the EJC is deposited approximately 20-24 nucleotides from the 5’ end upstream of the <b>splice</b> <b>junction</b> (where two exons are joined), when the lariat has formed and the exons are ligated together. The binding of the EJC to the mRNA occurs in a sequence independent manner, to form the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP). The EJC remains stably bound to this mRNP as it is exported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Protein components are either bound to or released by the EJC as it is transported. In order for the translocation of mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex to occur, a heterodimer consisting of NXF1/TAP and NXT1/p15 must bind to the transcripts. NXF1/TAP is a major receptor for the export of mRNAs to the cytoplasm. This is because it interacts with both RNA-binding adapter proteins and components of the nuclear pore complex.|$|E

The presence of tau deposits within glia is also variable in families with mutations outside of exon 10. This disease is now informally designated FTDP-17T.
