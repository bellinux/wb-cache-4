50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, the Heat were the 3rd <b>Seed,</b> <b>trailing</b> only Chicago and Boston. Fueled by a late-season steamroll, the Heat {{finished}} with a 58-24 record, third best in team history putting them up to the second seed, behind the top-seeded, 62-win Bulls, led by MVP Derrick Rose. In the much anticipated 2011 NBA Playoffs, Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, Boston Celtics in the Conference Semifinals, and Bulls in the Conference Finals, all in 5 games. The Heat reached the 2011 NBA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2006, in a rematch against the Dallas Mavericks. After taking a 2-1 series lead,the Heat collapsed, as they would lose the final three games to the Mavericks. The majority of the criticism fell on LeBron James, as the loss was seen as a consequence for his actions during the offseason. James struggled in the Finals, averaged only 3 points in fourth quarters in the series. James' scoring average of 17.8 points per game during the Finals signified an 8.9-point drop from his 26.7 points per game average during the regular season, the lowest such drop-off in league history. He also contributed 6.8 assists and 7.1 rebounds per game, and averaged 23.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game for the postseason as a whole.|$|R

A PCR amplification protocol using the primer set Sph-f 1008 /Sph-r 1243 demonstrated specific amplification of the target 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of strain MJ-PV. A 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) targeted probe, Sph-r 1264, labelled with a rhodamine fluorescent dye was successfully used in whole-cell FISH for the detection of MJ-PV in seeded controls.

In the semifinal she was defeated by eventual champion Ekaterina Makarova, despite leading the first set 3-0 and having a chance to serve for that set at 5-3. With her semifinals appearance in Eastbourne, she attained a new career high of world no. 6. Also, with this appearance, she was ranked no. 1 in the race to the WTA Tour Championships in Doha. Her next tournament was the Wimbledon Championships. As the sixth seed, Stosur fell in the first round to Kaia Kanepi in straight sets, after saving three match points. As the French Open champion Francesca Schiavone also lost in the first round, Stosur and Schiavone were the first two women in history who reached the French Open final, but failed to win a match at Wimbledon.

40|$|The role a small marsupial, the woylie Bettongia penicillata, {{might play}} in the {{recruitment}} and regeneration of Western Australian sandalwood Santalum spicatum through its seed caching behaviour was investigated in this study. To determine {{the fate of the}} seeds, cotton thread was attached to the <b>seeds</b> and the <b>trail</b> followed. A total of 25 seed caches were located. All of the seeds were found in separate caches, which was consistent with scatter-hoarding behaviour. The average distance from the source of the seeds to the cache was 43. 1 m ± 5. 8 m at Dryandra woodland and 29. 1 m ± 3. 8 m at Karakamia sanctuary. The mean cache depth was 4. 3 cm ± 0. 2 cm at Dryandra woodland compared with 4. 6 cm ± 0. 3 cm at Karakamia sanctuary. Significantly more seedlings and saplings grew away from sandalwood trees at sites where woylies were present than at sites with no woylies. In contrast, significantly more seedlings and saplings grew under adult sandalwood trees at the site without woylies than where they were present, although there were significantly lower rates of recruitment and sandalwood regeneration at these sites. In addition, significantly more whole, undisturbed sandalwood seeds were found under the parent trees at the woylie-free site than at the site with woylies. These findings strongly suggest that little seed dispersal or regeneration of sandalwood occurs in the absence of woylies. Through scatter-hoarding, woylies have the potential to disperse and cache sandalwood seeds away from the source and significantly alter the subsequent regeneration of sandalwood. Furthermore, by caching seeds large distances away from a source, woylies could modify the distribution of sandalwood in an area...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{importance}} of soil in forest ecosystem, this study was conducted in Mazandaran Province of Iran to investigate the effects of skidding operation on organic carbon of soil. Therefore, the objective of this research was to compare the rate of soil organic carbon between two areas inside and outside of the skid trails based on its depth. In order to carrying out of field survey, two samples from inside (for different depth of 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 centimeters) and two samples from outside of each 20 meters of skid trail were taken (Totally 80 soil sample). The rate of organic carbon was determined with burning through black&walking method. Results show that in all stations the percentage of organic carbon in soil samples collected from outside of trails was more than that of soil samples collected from inside of skid trail. Result of statistical analysis show that the skidding causes to significant difference between the two treatments for percentage of organic carbon (inside and outside of skid trail) in different depth of soil (P< 0. 05). Moreover, changes in percentage of soil organic carbon in samples measured for inside of skid trail was high and for outside of skid trail was low. The mean of soil organic carbon in layer of 0 - 5 centimeter was more than that of the layer of 5 - 10 centimeter. But, this difference is not significant (P< 0. 05). In order to decrease damage to forest soil it is better that the skid trail is covered by vegetation foliage and wood debris. Moreover, it is recommended that the skid <b>trails</b> <b>seeded</b> after skidding operation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A 1. 5 ha mixed conifer {{stand in}} the Blue Mountains of Oregon was intensively {{examined}} {{to assess the impact}} of logging disturbance on soils and herbaceous vegetation. Sampling was conducted six years after much of the timber overstory was removed in a shelterwood cut and yarded by crawler tractor. A year after harvest slash was machine-piled and burned. Skid trails and other areas of disturbance were seeded with a mixture of perennial grasses. Logging impact was divided into five "disturbance classes'* as treatments: general, berm, slash fire ring, skid trail, and undisturbed. Analysis of variance was used to test treatment differences. Characteristics of skid trails were analyzed separately from those of non-skid trail areas. Soil compaction was evident on skid trails from substantially lower rates of infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC), and a higher average soil strength, relative to undisturbed areas. Skid trail compaction probably resulted from mixing of denser subsoils with the low-density volcanic ash soils at the surface, and from compression by tractor activity. Bulk density of skid trails was not statistically different from that of undisturbed areas. Soil densities of all classes of disturbance were generally lower than 0. 9 g/cm³. Non-skid trail areas were not compacted. Soil water conductance rates markedly differed among disturbance classes, but were considerably higher than storm intensities projected for the region. High sample variability of both infiltration and SHC rates made interpreation of statistical comparisons among treatments difficult. Some watershed protection values were diminished on the disturbed areas. Litter cover of skid trails, general disturbance areas, and berms was 27, 45, and 68 percent lower, respectively, than that of undisturbed areas. Depth of litter decreased correspondingly among the disturbed treatments. Litter was nearly absent on the fire rings. Another agent in soil stabilization, belowground biomass, was two-thirds less on skid trails, in comparision with undisturbed areas. Amounts of soil organic matter in the surface 3 cm were significantly lower for the four types of ground disturbance, relative to undisturbed areas; however, organic matter was higher at some subsurface levels of berms, fire rings, and skid trails. Bulk density of non-skid trail soils was inversely correlated with organic matter content. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for soil water retained at four potentials, for coarse mineral fragment content, or for fine earth particle size distribution. Aboveground vegetation production of the <b>seeded</b> skid <b>trails</b> was 66 percent greater than that of undisturbed areas. Understory plant cover of skid trails and undisturbed areas was equivalent. Correlation between aboveground herbaceous production and soil strength at the 5 - 10 cm depth of skid trails was not statistically significant...|$|R
5000|$|M. capitatus, M. structor, M. aciculatus, and M. chamberlini are all Messor {{species that}} can change between {{individual}} foraging and group foraging when a large supply of food is discovered. [...] This helps the species to forage independently when resources are dispersed over a large area. If {{a large amount of}} resources is found in a concentrated area then these species can change their behavior to recruit other nestmates to help bring back the resources to the nest. The foraging activity of M. capitatus has been studied with respect to how they affect seed dispersal, optimizing their harvest, and patterns of foraging. M.capitatus create long narrow trails that are no more than 10 cm wide and they will drop <b>seeds</b> along these <b>trails.</b> [...] M. capitatus drops 10-15% of the seeds they transport and will redistribute these seeds in bare soil and low sparse vegetation habitats. They rarely disperse the seeds in low, dense and highly vegetated habitats. [...] The effects of seed dispersal by ants is important as it can affect how vegetation will grow and being placed in sparse vegetation means that the seeds have less competition to grow against. M. capitatus is said to optimize their harvest by looking at seed size and determining if the energetic cost of bringing seed back to the nest individually was worth the net benefit to the colony. M. capitatus is a polymorphic species, which means that they have a larger range of size in the species. To optimize their harvest they have the larger ants carry the heavier food back to the nest and have smaller ants carry the lighter food. The ants also had a preference for seeds of a moderate mass of about 400mg when the seed was about 5-5.5mm in diameter. M. capitatus have been found to commit cleptobiosis, steal, seeds from other colonies of ants. M.capitatus will use a variety of interference tactics to affect foraging by congeners, those within the same genus.M.capitatus caused significant seed predation to the rare and endangered plant Erodium paularense. This plant produces few viable seeds in fruit and M.capitatus only harvests the fruit of trees that have fully developed seeds. Predation rates by M.capitatus of E. paularense seeds is about 43.3%. [...] Seed collection by ants is due to preference and the availability of the seeds and other food sources.|$|R
