5|$|Coastal plants {{begin to}} flower at around {{five years from}} seed, but plants in the <b>Stirling</b> Range take much longer to mature. In one <b>Stirling</b> Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night.|$|E
5|$|In April, {{during the}} Revolution of 1848 in Paris, {{he left for}} London, where he {{performed}} at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses. This tour was suggested {{to him by his}} Scottish pupil Jane <b>Stirling</b> and her elder sister. <b>Stirling</b> also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Murray bought Cromlix House hotel near Dunblane, {{where his}} brother Jamie had celebrated his wedding in 2010 but which had since ceased trading, for £1.8 million; the venue re-opened as a 15-room five-star hotel in April 2014.

5|$|<b>Stirling</b> led {{two units}} of Colonel John Haslet's 1st Delaware Regiment under the {{immediate}} command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist; both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind was Parson's Connecticut regiment with 251 men. <b>Stirling</b> led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee {{and stop the}} British advance. <b>Stirling</b> had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stirling</b> {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and <b>Stirling</b> was attacked on his left by the Hessians. <b>Stirling</b> pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E

5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the <b>Stirling</b> Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the <b>Stirling</b> Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare and endangered {{in its natural}} habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E
5|$|B.sphaerocarpa var. sphaerocarpa {{is widely}} {{distributed}} from the Darling Plateau east of Perth to the Whicher Range in the southwest, and southeast to the <b>Stirling</b> Range. Populations north of Perth once referable to it are now classified as var. pumilio.|$|E
5|$|By 1314, Robert the Bruce had recaptured {{most of the}} castles in Scotland {{once held}} by Edward, pushing raiding parties into {{northern}} England as far as Carlisle. In response, Edward planned a major military campaign {{with the support of}} Lancaster and the barons, mustering a large army between 15,000 and 20,000 strong. Meanwhile, Robert had besieged <b>Stirling</b> Castle, a key fortification in Scotland; its English commander had stated that unless Edward arrived by 24 June, he would surrender. News of this reached the King in late May, and he decided to speed up his march north from Berwick to relieve the castle. Robert, with between 5,500 and 6,500 troops, predominantly spearmen, prepared to prevent Edward's forces from reaching <b>Stirling.</b>|$|E

5|$|Take Off (1944) – a {{large and}} complex group {{portrait}} of the four-man crew of a Short <b>Stirling</b> bomber, deep in concentration, preparing for a flight, which Knight painted over several months at RAF Mildenhall.

5|$|The Special Air Service (SAS) is a {{regiment}} of the British Army {{and part}} of the United Kingdom's special forces. The regiment was formed by Colonel David <b>Stirling</b> in Africa in 1941, {{at the height of the}} Second World War. Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory, first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe. <b>Stirling</b> established the principle of using small teams, usually of just four men, to carry out raids, having realised that a four-man team could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers.|$|E

5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the <b>Stirling</b> Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; <b>Stirling</b> Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in gullies.|$|E
5|$|Browne was {{eventually}} exchanged for American general William Alexander (Lord <b>Stirling),</b> and was roundly criticized for {{his handling of}} the whole affair. Nassau remained relatively poorly defended and was again subjected to American rebel threat in January 1778.

5|$|In 1922, a workers' tent {{camp was}} erected {{on the eastern}} side of <b>Stirling</b> Ridge to house the men working on the main intercepting sewer. The {{following}} year saw the start of the construction of 62 small, four-room, unlined timber cottages, to be used as housing for the married tradesmen involved {{in the construction of the}} provisional Parliament House. Other camps were established at the eastern end of <b>Stirling</b> Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie's settlement (1922–30), consisting of 25 timber cottages for his married men and timber barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single men's tent camps were established nearby—Old Tradesmen's Camp (1923–27) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924–27). The men from Howie's worked on the Hotel Canberra and the others on the construction of the provisional Parliament House and nearby administrative buildings.|$|E
