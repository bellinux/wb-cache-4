25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size.

Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a <b>static</b> <b>thrust</b> of 51,000lbf (227kN).

40|$|A {{centrifugal}} particle mass analyzer and {{a modified}} differential mobility spectrometer {{were used to}} measure the mass and mobility of particulate matter emitted by CFM 56 - 5 B 4 / 2 P, CFM 56 - 7 B 26 / 3, and PW 4000 - 100 gas turbine engine sources. The mass-mobility exponent of the particulate matter from the CFM 56 - 5 B 4 / 2 P engine ranged from 2. 68 to 2. 82, whereas the effective particle densities varied from 600 to 1250 [*][*]kg/m 3, depending on the <b>static</b> engine <b>thrust</b> and sampling methodology used. The effective particle densities from the CFM 56 - 7 B 26 / 3 and PW 4000 - 100 engines also fell within this range. The sample was conditioned with or without a catalytic stripper and with or without dilution, which caused the effective density to change, indicating the presence of condensed semivolatile material on the particles. Variability of the determined effective densities across different engine thrusts, based on the scattering about the line of best fit, was lowest for the diluted samples and highest for the undiluted sample without a catalytic stripper. This variability indicates that the relative amount of semivolatile material produced was engine thrust dependent. It was found that the nonvolatile particulate matter, effective particle density (in kilograms per cubic meter) of the CFM 56 - 5 B 4 / 2 P engine at relative thrusts below 30 % could be approximated using the particle mobility diameter (dme in meters) with 11. 92 d(2. 76 − 3) me...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the research at Beihang University {{for developing a}} sub-Newton thruster based on catalytic decomposition of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) for fine attitude control of small spacecrafts. The characteristics of the N 2 O self-pressurization feeding process {{as well as the}} preheating process of a sub-Newton N 2 O thruster were studied. Experimental and simulated results indicated that the tank pressure decreases during the N 2 O self-pressurization process. The influence on the preheating process of the surface emissivity, the preheating power, the thickness of combustor chamber and the insulation material, were compared. N 2 O catalytic decomposition experiments were carried out to evaluate the reaction performance of Iridium impregnated modified alumina catalyst, such as activation temperature and reaction temperature. Successful activation and self-sustaining reaction were achieved at 523 K. It was found that the integral structure of the reactor and the loading factor of the catalyst-bed can influence the reaction effect. Based on further experiments looking for proper catalyst-bed, a thruster with a 4310 mm x 25 mm catalyst-bed was designed and fabricated.

In effect, the ejector shroud is considered to be flying in the velocity field of the jets. The solution is converged by iterating between the rate of entrainment and the strength of the circulation. This approach offers the advantage of including external influences on the flow through the ejector.

Taking into account the engine inertia force and <b>thrust,</b> <b>static</b> aeroelastic deformation of the wing structure and load distributions including shear force, bending moment and torque are studied. Models of the clean wing and the wing/engine system are compared and effects of chordwise and spanwise locations of the wing-mounted engines on the wing's natural vibration and flutter characteristics are analyzed. The research indicates that the bending moment at the root part of the wing is alleviated by the engine, and {{the combination of the}} engine inertia force and thrust will change the torque there remarkably, while not affect the bending and torsion deformations of the wing structure much. The results also show that wing-mounted engines will affect the wing's natural frequency of vibration, consequently having great effects on the flutter characteristics of the wing. Besides the classic wing flutter induced by the coupling of bending and torsion modes, a low-damping flutter type appears from the coupling of engine-pitch mode and the bending and torsion modes of the wing.

We {{have developed a}} preliminary design method for commercial aircraft in academic perspective. There are four main phases in this design method. They are (1) determining design objectives and requirements, (2) statistically estimating of takeoff weight, required sea level <b>static</b> (SLS) <b>thrust,</b> and wing reference area, (3) performing a trade study to locate the optimal design point and the design region, and (4) conceptualizing the model based on the optimal design point. Based on historical data of jet transports and the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) rules, we established a guideline to determine the design objectives and requirements for a commercial aircraft. We also used the historical data to formulate statistical equations to estimate the takeoff weight, the require SLS thrust, and the wing reference area. We utilized the knowledge of aircraft flight mechanics into a comprehensive comparison among the design requirements in order to sketch the design region and to locate the optimal design point. Finally, we used computer aid design (CAD) softwares to conceptualize the model based on the optimal design point. We implemented the method into designing a wide-body commercial aircraft. Inspiring by the blended-wing-body (BWB) concept, we designed jet transport whose fuselage was shaped by the MS(1) - 0317 airfoil and was blended with an Eppler 407 wing. The aircraft was sized for 200 passengers and to cruise at Mach 0. 85 at the initial cruise altitude (ICA) of 38, 000 ft over a 3, 000 -nmi range.
