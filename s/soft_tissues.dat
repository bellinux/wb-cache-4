5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications.

5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them.

While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E

5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens {{though a}} series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} large pressure differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in <b>soft</b> <b>tissues,</b> and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the skeletal component, the <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> {{plays an important role}} in asymmetry and requires further study. A number of studies have used standardized photographs and stereophotogrammetry to assess <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> asymmetry [16, 18, 27]. A hierarchy for anatomic landmarks has been previously established for constructing the <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> midline, with the natural dental midline and the tip of philtrum being most reliable for measuring <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> asymmetries in 2 D [28]. The tip of the nose and <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> nasion have been shown to be less reliable in photographic measurements. The accuracy of <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> measurements with CBCT enables 1 : 1 accuracy and the ability to more clearly define <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> landmarks through superimposition on cranial structures [29]. <b>Soft</b> <b>tissue</b> asymmetry has yet to be measured in class I patients with CBCT, and this would help further understand the soft-tissue compensations that overcome the minor skeletal discrepancies we observed in this study.|$|R

5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain {{of the largest and}} smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed.

Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E

Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects.

5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, <b>soft</b> <b>tissues,</b> and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for <b>soft</b> <b>tissues,</b> and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the outcome of <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> preparation using Osmed® self-inflating <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> expanders with different in situ times in two implantation techniques. Material and methods: Osmed® self-inflating <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> expanders were implanted in goats using a tunnel approach and a flap approach. The animals were sacrificed after 1 h (controls) and 40 days (treated). A tattoo technique for stereographic measurements was used to look for <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> surface gain. Histological and histomorphometric analyses were performed to quantify and compare the changes in <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> volume and bone volume after 1 h and 40 days of implantation. Results: After 40 days, the expansion was visible and none of the goats had shown any inflammation. The space between the <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> and the bone was filled by the completely expanded expander and surrounding connective tissue. Between the test groups and the control groups, there was no histological difference in the structure of the <b>soft</b> <b>tissue.</b> Conclusions: All the tissue expanders expanded to their maximum size (2. 8 times) and were a reliable product for creating a space between <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> and bone.

5|$|Because {{the tail}} {{had at least}} forty caudal vertebrae, it was highly mobile. It could {{possibly}} swing at an arc of 180 degrees, covering the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds {{at the tail end}} may have been as high as 50km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows would have resulted in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled small and medium-sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, to run through attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale.

Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{mackerel}} sharks, common threshers are aplacental viviparous. They {{give birth}} to litters of two to four (rarely six) pups in the eastern Pacific, and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic. They are believed to reproduce throughout their range; one known nursery area is the Southern California Bight. Breeding occurs in the summer, usually July or August, and parturition occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother.

5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
