5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway is {{intended}} to relieve north-south traffic congestion on York Regional Road68 (Main Street, former Highway48) and York Regional Road69 (Ninth Line), with <b>signage</b> suggesting drivers use the parkway as a through route past Markham. As trucks are prohibited along Main Street, <b>signage</b> guides them onto the parkway.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the Church of the FSM {{obtained}} city <b>signage</b> in Templin, Germany, {{announcing the}} time of Friday's weekly Nudelmesse ("pasta mass"), alongside <b>signage</b> for various Catholic and Protestant Sunday services.|$|E
5|$|The Brooklyn Public Library {{announced}} that Macon Library {{would be one}} of the first six libraries in its system to receive exterior digital <b>signage,</b> the first upgrade of exterior <b>signage</b> across the Brooklyn system in over two decades. The project, expected to be completed in summer 2017, will total $35,000.|$|E
5|$|Generally, blue <b>signage</b> {{is used to}} list {{services}} and attractions at upcoming exits, known as Tourism-Oriented Directional Signing.|$|E
5|$|However, several {{exceptions}} exist, notably blue guidance <b>signage</b> for toll highways like Highway407 and Highway412, {{in addition}} to the collector lanes of highways.|$|E
5|$|The mileposts below follow actual <b>signage,</b> where mile 0.00 {{is located}} {{just north of}} the {{overpass}} with I-90.|$|E
5|$|After {{another major}} {{incident}} occurred in 2009, {{it was announced}} that Son of Beast would be closed indefinitely. References to Son of Beast were removed from the park's website and map in early 2010. All <b>signage,</b> including the box at the entrance, was also removed.|$|E
5|$|After its closure in 1917, the bay {{platform}} {{was converted}} into rooms for use, at various times, as offices, air-raid shelters, store rooms, an electrical sub-station and a war-time hostel. Since 1994, the branch's remaining platform at Holborn {{has been used}} to test mock-up designs for new platform <b>signage</b> and advertising systems.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, during the outdoor scene after Alphonse's funeral, a tram stop sign can be seen. This style {{and design of}} tram <b>signage</b> wasn't {{introduced}} {{until well into the}} 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Officially, NY18F {{begins at}} {{the eastern edge of}} the village of Lewiston at an {{interchange}} between NY104 and the Niagara Scenic Parkway. <b>Signage</b> for NY18F, however, exists as far south as the interchange between NY104 and NY18 south of the village. According to <b>signage,</b> NY18F is concurrent to NY104 from NY18 north to the interchange between NY104 and the Moses Parkway, where NY18F and NY104 split at the western extent of the interchange. The Seaway Trail, routed along NY104 from Niagara Falls north to Lewiston, follows NY18F west into Lewiston along the path of Ridge Road, here named Center Street. At 4th Street, NY18F turns northward, following 4th Street for four blocks to Oneida Street. NY18F cuts west on Oneida for two blocks before continuing northward out of the village on 2nd Street.|$|E
5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a {{practical}} matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the <b>signage.</b> Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for <b>signage</b> in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the NTSB issuing {{its report}} MARC had taken steps in that direction, {{including}} {{the installation of}} more emergency windows, the improvement of door release mechanisms, and improved emergency <b>signage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seven {{memorial}} designations {{have been}} applied to sections of US41. Some of these designations follow other highways that run concurrently with US41. Most of the designations {{are no longer in}} use, but the Jacobetti and Veterans memorial highways still have <b>signage</b> posted {{on the side of the}} road.|$|E
5|$|Since then, MDOT {{has used}} the trunkline's {{designation}} on maps and in brochures related to a 2013 reconstruction project on Michigan Avenue in East Lansing. <b>Signage</b> has also been erected, and the highway has been restored to the official state map in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel is {{open for}} public access every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Two sets of public toilets, remodeled in 2016, are placed near two of the tunnel exits. Parts of the {{original}} <b>signage</b> remain, {{but they were not}} fully restored in the 2016 remodeling.|$|E
5|$|WisDOT built a bypass {{around the}} city of Rhinelander in the 1990s and created a {{business}} loop along the old highway through the town. This loop was a locally maintained route through the central business district in Rhinelander. The <b>signage</b> for the loop was removed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|A looser {{interpretation}} of the Griffo designs is Iowan Old Style, designed by John Downer and also released by Bitstream. With a larger x-height (taller lower-case letters) than the print-oriented Bembo and influences of signpainting (Downer's former profession), {{it was intended to}} be particularly clear for reading at distance, in displays and in <b>signage.</b> It is a default font in Apple's iBooks application.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{creation}} of the Capitol Loop, M-143 and Michigan Avenue in Lansing was partially transferred back to local control. The section between Cedar and Larch streets was retained as part of the new Capitol Loop and the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state trunkline highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the <b>signage,</b> creating an unsigned trunkline.|$|E
5|$|First {{unveiled}} {{in a single}} uppercase weight in 1928, Gill Sans achieved national prominence almost immediately, when it was chosen the following year to become the standard typeface for the LNER railway system, soon appearing on every facet of the company's identity, from metal locomotive nameplates and hand-painted station <b>signage</b> to printed restaurant car menus, timetables and advertising posters.|$|E
5|$|From when it opened, {{the tower}} was {{referred}} to as both the Bond Tower and the R Tower, owing to the presence of both logos on the building's exterior. The Bond Corporation logos were later removed from the tower, {{and by the end of}} 1994, the <b>signage</b> on the building was updated to match the new name and logo of its owner and head tenant, Bankwest.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Anuncio Digital Media, {{a locally}} started digital {{advertising}} firm, installed its first mall-based digital <b>signage</b> network, {{which consists of}} a series of twenty plasma screen televisions around the main concourse and in the food court that display six-second sound-free advertisements. Post Oak Mall was the first of four CBL-owned malls to receive this network, with four other CBL malls scheduled to follow. The advertising displays were activated on September 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{there has}} also been {{widespread}} cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network's <b>signage</b> has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.|$|E
5|$|King's Cross is spelled {{both with}} and without an apostrophe. King's Cross is used in <b>signage</b> at the Network Rail and London Underground stations, on the Tube map and on the {{official}} Network Rail webpage. It rarely featured on early Underground maps, but has been consistently used on them since 1951. Kings X, Kings + and London KX are abbreviations used in space-limited contexts. The National Rail station code is KGX.|$|E
5|$|Lakefront Station's lack of {{modernization}} since its opening {{has become more}} noticeable, especially its appearance and lack of adequate <b>signage.</b> In August 2012, when the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland was under construction, a Cuyahoga County official {{expressed a desire to}} keep Lakefront Station out of view. One proposed solution was to build a new station underground, but {{due to a lack of}} funding, the county settled on hiding the station behind trees and shrubs as a short-term solution.|$|E
5|$|The 2015â€“2019 MTA Capital Plan {{called for}} the Queens Boulevard Line's Northern Boulevard, 67th Avenue, and Parsons Boulevard stations, along with 30 others, to undergo a {{complete}} overhaul {{as part of the}} Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, improved <b>signage,</b> and improved station lighting.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike used {{traffic lights}} as {{feedback}} signals for E-ZPass users {{since it was}} launched on the roadway in 2001. On March 17, 2017, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission announced that they would begin removing the feedback signals as part of upgrading the toll equipment; the feedback signals are being removed {{because they do not}} conform to federal <b>signage</b> guidelines.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in British Columbia, with Buntzen Lake {{being used as}} Lake Okobogee. Several crew members became lost in the {{surrounding}} area after the van responsible for installing <b>signage</b> got lost itself. The mural of Ruby made up of binary code was designed by assistant art director Greg Loewen and Vivien Nishi, who hand-wrote all {{the numbers on the}} mural.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{corporate identity}} across the Metrolink system uses a pale yellow and metallic silver colour scheme, with a logotype {{that consists of}} a diamond motif formed from a pattern of repeating circles and the Metrolink name. The logo, <b>signage</b> and publicity use the Pantograph sans regular typeface. Tram livery features yellow at the vehicle ends with grey sides and black doors, and a pattern of circles.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} {{represented}} on maps and <b>signage</b> by a pictogram of a canoe, {{inspired by the}} city's history as a transportation hub {{at the intersection of}} three rivers. It was created by Christian French as part of the Stellar Connections series. Its points represent nearby destinations, including Tukwila City Hall, Fort Dent Park, Foster High School and several community parks.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{was first}} designated in 1956 {{as a business}} route of US112. At that time, US112 and M-60 were transferred to a bypass south of Niles. When US112 was decommissioned in January 1962, Bus. US112 was redesignated Bus. US12 to match the new US12 designation. In 1986, US33 was truncated in Michigan to end at US12. Bus. US12 was rerouted in Niles to replace US33 through town; Bus. US31 was added a year later when the <b>signage</b> was updated in the area. In 1998, US33 was removed from Michigan completely. At this time, M-51 was extended over former US33 and replaced part of the Bus. US31 designation in Niles. On March 5, 2010, the segment of Bus. US12 between Bus. US31 and M-51 {{was turned over to}} local control. In April 2010 the Bus. US12 designation was retired when an extended M-139 replaced it from the local control section southwestward prior to maps and <b>signage</b> being changed. The concurrent segment along M-51 became M-51 only.|$|E
5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on this side {{do not have to}} go through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era <b>signage</b> at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate <b>signage,</b> as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E
5|$|By September 20, 1928, the {{extension}} of US141 northward from Green Bay along WIS57 to the Michigan state line had been approved, and the <b>signage</b> was readied for installation the following month. The US102 designation was decommissioned when US141 was also extended to replace M-57 from the state line, along US2 to Crystal Falls and north to Covington. US8's eastern end was rerouted along a separate bridge over the Menominee River to a new terminus at an intersection with US2 in Norway in 1929. US141 was fully paved in Wisconsin in the early 1930s; the last segment to be completed was between Pound and Abrams.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 {{straddles}} the SchuylerTompkins county line, with the northbound lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving {{the border and}} completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town of}} Ulysses. Here, directional <b>signage</b> along the route switches from eastâ€“west to northâ€“south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant {{opened in}} 1964 after Ron Thomas' family {{purchased}} the business from Bill Blake for $600. Blake had named his lounge Country Bill's in 1960 but {{the business was}} unsuccessful. Thomas {{had been in the}} food service industry in Utah previously and ended up living in Portland after a series of relocations with his family. Though he was not fond of the lounge's name, Thomas was unable to afford new <b>signage</b> and kept the title. Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding east from one space to four. In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the death of their landlord.|$|E
5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant was a family-owned American-style steakhouse {{and seafood}} {{restaurant}} in the Woodstock neighborhood of southeast Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Adjacent to the restaurant was a bar called CB's Lounge. The restaurant opened in 1964 when ownership transferred from Bill Blake to Ron Thomas' family. Though Thomas was not particularly fond {{of the name of}} the business Blake had established in 1960, he was unable to afford new <b>signage</b> and kept the lounge's title. Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding from one space to four. In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the landlord's death.|$|E
