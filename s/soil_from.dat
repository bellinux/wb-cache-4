40|$|Summary: The {{relative}} abundance of entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi was estimated for 10 sites {{in each of}} indigenous forest, pasture, and cropland habitats by baiting soil samples with Galleria larvae. The steinernematid Steinernema feltiae (Filip) was the dominant nematode, occurring in <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> all three habitat types. The heterorhabditid Heterorhabditis zelandica Poinar was recovered only <b>from</b> <b>soils</b> of podocarp (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (A. Rich.)) forests. Galleria infection by nematodes was higher in <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> forest habitat than in <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> pasture and cropland. Among the sampled forests, nematode infection was higher in <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> podocarp stands than those from broadleaf stands. The deuteromycete fungi Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin, and Paecilomyces cf. cicadae (Miquel) Samson, and a Entomophthorales zygomycete, tentatively identified as a Tarchium species, were recovered from the Galleria baits. Infection of Galleria by B. bassiana and M. anisopliae occurred in <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> all habitat types, while that by P. cicadae occurred only in <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> forest habitats. Tarchium was recovered from a single pasture site. The frequency of Galleria infection by these entomopathogenic fungi collectively, and by B. bassiana alone, was higher in pasture soils than in <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> either forest or cropland. These results are discussed in relation to disturbance effects of land use changes and the potential role of generalist entomopathogens as biological indicators of soil health...|$|R

A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E

40|$|In this study, eight {{soil samples}} were {{collected}} from organic and conventional farms in a central area of South Korea. Spore communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AMF, were analyzed. Spores of Glomus clarum, G. etunicatum, G. mosseae, G. sp., Acaulospora longula, A. spinosa, Gigaspora margarita, and Paraglomus occultum were identified at the study sites, based on morphological and molecular characteristics. While Acaulospora longula was the most dominant species in soils at organic farms, Paraglomus occultum was the most dominant species in soils at conventional farms.

5|$|Gert's broad wind {{circulation}} produced {{widespread and}} heavy rainfall across Central America through September15–17. Combined with saturated <b>soil</b> <b>from</b> Tropical Storm Bret's passage a month earlier, the storm triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated numerous communities. In Costa Rica, the blustery weather destroyed {{a national park}} and led to significant losses for the agricultural and tourism sectors. Much of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, with many cities, villages, and crops in those countries left under water. Although Gert's highest winds occurred upon landfall in Mexico, the worst effects in the country were due to an extreme rainfall event in the Huasteca region, where as many as 31.41inches (798mm) of rain fell. As {{an increasing number of}} major rivers burst their banks, catastrophic flooding submerged extensive areas around the Pánuco basin. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, and scores of structures were demolished in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40years.|$|E

Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of <b>soil</b> <b>from</b> his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight.

It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and {{employed}} a pure ring field. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. The injured Ray Lindwall came out to join Hassett at 7/365 without a runner. Hassett—who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the morning—swept Laker for four and then hit {{him for the first}} six of the match. Hassett added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. Australia were unhurried and remained patient in the face of Yardley's defensive tactics because they had bowled England out on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result.

The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and <b>soil</b> <b>from</b> road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean.

5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the <b>soil</b> <b>from</b> destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions.

To investigate those {{factors that may}} preclude hexadecane mineralization activity in long-term hydrocarbon-contaminated <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> the Ross Sea Region, samples were collected from Scott Base, the site of former bases (Cape Evans, Marble Point, Vanda Station), and two oil spill sites in the Wright Valley (Bull Pass and Loop Moraine). The soils had low levels of nitrogen (24) reflecting hydrocarbon contamination. Following soil water adjustment to 10 % (v/w), the influence of nutrient addition (250 mg/kg N added as monoammonium phosphate) and inoculation (spiking with Antarctic soil containing high numbers of hydrocarbon degraders) as required on hexadecane mineralization activity was determined. Hexadecane mineralization activity occurred in contaminated <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> Marble Point, Cape Evans and one sample from Vanda Station without nutrient addition. In contrast <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> Scott Base, Cape Evans, another sample from Vanda Station and Loop Moraine required nutrients, whereas Bull Pass soil required inoculation and nutrients before hexadecane mineralization proceeded. Hydrocarbon degrader numbers were highest in coastal <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> Scott Base and Marble Point (10 ⁷ per gram) and less prevalent in inland <b>soils</b> <b>from</b> Wright Valley (< 10 ⁵ per gram).
