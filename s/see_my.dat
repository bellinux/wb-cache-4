25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To <b>see</b> <b>my</b> officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E

500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you want with a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You <b>See</b> <b>My</b> Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you <b>see</b> <b>my</b> rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you <b>see</b> <b>my</b> little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E

As he finally dies, he is taken before God, who condemns him for his selfish behavior and sends him to Hell.|$|E
