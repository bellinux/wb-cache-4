30|$|Grouted splice sleeves {{are usually}} tested with a tensile load to {{determine}} the feasibility and the characteristic strength. The test is simple, cheap and easy to handle. The relevant standards specify a minimum tensile capacity of 125 % of the nominal yield strength of the spliced bars (ACI- 318 2002; AC- 133 2008). A good grouted <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> generally offers a stiffness about equivalent to a steel bar and undergoes the stages of elastic, yielding and plastic responses when subjected to incremental tensile load (Ling et al. 2012).

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} a new grouted <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> for wall panels, called Welded Bar Sleeve (WBS). The connections were made from steel pipes and tested with incremental tensile, shear and flexural loads until failure.

For this, the connections are evaluated in terms of the load–displacement responses, ultimate capacities, ductility responses and some feasibility assessment criteria. WBS was found to provide sufficient strength at the bar embedded length of 8, 8 and 11 times the bar diameter under tensile, shear and flexural loads, respectively. It is effective under tension, but could only service up to 1 / 3 of its ultimate shear capacity. Flexural load is the most critical load case for the connection.

40|$|The {{growth of}} world {{population}} {{will be the}} challenge of the century regarding the carbon footprints. The human activities produce both direct and indirect carbon emission that is contributing to the climate change. The construction industry itself contributes around 30 percent of total carbon emissions in the world. Thus, the challenge is {{to solve the problem of}} meeting the increasing needs and expectations of a growing population while at the same time modifying the current production and consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable development model. Based on this, the need for the sustainable structural element is inevitable. Extending the exploitation life of the structural element is one of the solutions that should be looked. Reusing instead of recycling the structural element is one of the ways to extend the exploitation life which can reduce the carbon emission. Therefore the innovation in the structural design to reduce the carbon emission is important. The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of a conceptual design of demountable structural system. On the first part of the thesis, it investigated the structural behaviour of a composite floor beam that consists of steel beam, prefabricated concrete deck and a single embedded nut bolt shear connector in the SLS condition. To accommodate fabrication tolerance and construction process, the bolt shear connector must have enough clearance. Various bolt-hole gap in bolt shear connector is applied to see the effect on structural performance of composite floor beam in SLS. The study of demountable composite floor beam is performed by mean of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that the bolt-hole gap clearance influences the deflection of composite floor beam due to partial interaction between prefabricated concrete deck and steel beam which leads to incomplete interaction of composite floor beam. The bigger hole clearance, the higher deflection occurs on composite floor beam. The second part of the thesis explores the conceptual design of plug and play beam-column connection. The purpose of developing a plug and play beam-column connection is to reduce the construction time so that it is easy to be mounted and demounted. Two conceptual designs have been developed and were evaluated through FEA. The resistance of those two conceptual designs is found to be higher than fin-plate connection while the rotational stiffness of this plug-play connection can be classified as a nominally pinned joint. The last part of the thesis aims to see the possibility of having a non-symmetrical column <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> on the column. This is interesting for the architect as it provides aesthetic benefit for the façade. The non-symmetrical column <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> located on the corner is evaluated by FEA.

Due to unsymmetrical nature of the connection, the resistance and failure mode of the connection is different in a different orientation of the loading...|$|E

This connection consists of a plate, called finger plate with characteristic shape of holes, called long open slotted holes. A column splice with long open holes {{is a type of}} friction connection, where finger plate transfer load between bottom of one column and top of a second part and preloaded bolts are used to clamp segments together. In this work, the behaviour of the connection is investigated. Moreover, general information about column splices, friction connection and loss of pretension are introduced in literature review. A recommendations, for the preloaded bolts are investigated in accordance with European standard EN 1993 - 1 - 8. An experimental static compression tests are performed in order to observe the real behaviour of the column splice with long open slotted holes. Several number of numerical tests are performed to predict behaviour of the connection by use of Abaqus software. The Numerical model is validated against experimental results. Further tests are performed in order to check an influence of other important factors on the behaviour of connection system.
