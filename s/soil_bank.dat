50|$|The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Act of 1956 {{was part}} of the Agricultural Act of 1956. This act created the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Program, which removed {{farmland}} from production in an effort to reduce large crop surpluses after World War II. Land deposited into the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> was then converted into conservation use. The idea for the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> was taken from legislation from the 1930s dust bowl and was similar to many depression-era solutions to lower crop prices. Eventually, the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> act of 1956 was overturned by the Food and Agriculture Act of 1965.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Program is {{a federal}} program (authorized by the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Act, P.L. 84-540, Title I) of the late 1950s and early 1960s that paid farmers to retire land from {{production}} for 10 years. The predecessor to today’s Conservation Reserve Program. The maximum enrollment was 28700000 acre in 1960. Some elements in the CRP, such as a limit on CRP acres per county, were {{a response to the}} <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> experience.|$|E
50|$|By {{reducing}} the amount of land that was actually producing crops, the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> act hoped to reduce the supply of certain crops. Due to this decrease in the supply, many food prices would rise, which was the government solution to the large surpluses. In 1957, J. Carol Bottum found that the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> program was unsuccessful in the Wisconsin corn and dairy area because it failed to materially reduce agricultural output. However, some benefits of the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> or found including that increased mobility of farmers by “making it possible to reduce farm operations without loss of income and still retain the security of the farm case of layoff.” One negative effect of the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> with that also shrunk the amount of land farmers were able to rent out to others or rent for themselves. This made it difficult for some small farmers to expand their operations. The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> act was repealed by the Food and Agriculture Act of 1965.|$|E
30|$|These were {{consistent}} with the composition of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> In <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> A. scoparia had the biggest density of 6 888.7 seed m- 2, which could take approximately 84.8 % of the total seed in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> A. gmelinii with lower density of approximately 297.5 seed m- 2 accounted for 2 % of the total seed in <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> and A. giraldii with density of approximately 103.3 seed m- 2 only accounted for 0.7 % of the total seed in <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> [26].|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> are a {{vital part}} of {{ecosystems}} and influence community dynamics and regeneration. Although <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> in different habitats have been reported, how <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> vary with elevational gradients in different climatic zones is still unknown. This paper investigates seed density, species composition and nonconstituent species of forest <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> in Yunnan Province, southwest China. Similarity between the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and standing vegetation was also examined. We collected soil samples from sites spanning 12 elevations in tropical rain forests, subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests and subalpine coniferous forests, and transported them to a glasshouse for germination trials for species identification. The <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> of tropical and subtropical forests had much higher seed densities and species richness than those of subalpine forests. Seeds of woody species dominated the <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> of tropical and subtropical forests, while herbs dominated those of subalpine forests. The nonconstituent species in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> were all herbs and were most abundant in tropical forests, followed by subtropical forests but were completely absent from subalpine forests...|$|R
30|$|The <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> may {{contribute}} to plant community dynamics following disturbance (Plassmann et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2009). The seasonal flooding caused the degradation of <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and vegetation on the river bank in the TGRR. Most perennials and woody plants disappeared from seed bank and vegetation, and the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> was mainly composed of annuals and a few flooding-tolerant perennials. Lu et al. (2010 b) investigated the effects of initial impoundment on the riparian <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and suggested that low species compositional similarity to established vegetation and the dominance of annual plants limited {{the efficacy of the}} <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> to restore pre-dam vegetation in the drawdown zone of the TGRR. Our study indicates that the differences in species composition and dominant species between the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and surrounding vegetation decreased, implying the vegetation composition and structure gradually stabilized after a long period of water-level fluctuation. The composition of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and vegetation included annuals, perennials and shrubs and vines that differed from the pre-dam riparian <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and vegetation. The dominant species of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> including selected annuals and several submersion-tolerant perennials, such as C. dactylon and P. paspaloides, was related to the standing vegetation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> act of 1956 {{created the}} <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Program. This act was devised to reduce {{supplies}} of basic commodities by achieving a 10 to 17% reduction in plowland through payments to farmers who shift {{and went out}} of production into the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank.</b> The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> converted 80% {{of the cost of}} converting from crop the conservation land. Annual payments were also provided to participating states. The payments were based on base price per commodity in the amount of land surrendered. In the south, these annual payments varied from about $8.68 per acre in 1956 to about $11.85 per acre in 1960. From 1956 to 1960, the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> converted 28,700,000 acres nationwide from crop production to conservation uses. 2.2 million of these acres were used for tree planting, of which 1,922,604 were planted in the southern states of Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma.|$|E
5000|$|The Agricultural Act of 1956 (P.L. 84-540) {{created the}} <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Program (Title I {{was called the}} <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Act), {{addressed}} the disposal of Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) inventories of surplus stocks, contained commodity support program provisions, and contained forestry provisions. [...] The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Act authorized short- and long-term removal of land from production with annual rental payments to participants (Acreage Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Program, respectively). The Acreage Reserve Program, for wheat, corn, rice, cotton, peanuts, and several types of tobacco, allowed producers to retire land {{on an annual basis}} in crop years 1956 through 1959 in return for payments. The Conservation Reserve Program allowed producers to retire cropland under contracts of 3, 5, or 10 years in return for annual payments. The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Act was repealed by Section 601 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-321). The Conservation Reserve portion of the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> was a model for the subsequent Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), enacted in 1985.|$|E
50|$|The program {{originally}} {{began in}} the 1950s as the conservation branch of the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Program which was enacted by the Agriculture Act of 1956. The theory behind this branch of the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Program was to focus on lands that were {{at high risk of}} erosion, remove them from agricultural production, and establish native or alternative permanent vegetative cover in an effort to counteract actual or potential erosion. This was considered by proponents to be beneficial to sustainable agriculture generally, by lessening the effects of erosion. Originally, the program called for three-year contracts in which the government would pay for land improvements that increased soil, water, forestry, or wildlife quality if the farmer would agree not to harvest or graze contracted land.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the characteristics of}} a <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> in a temperate forest, the composition, population density, and diversity of plant species in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> the similarity between the standing vegetation and the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and the correlation between the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and <b>soil</b> environmental factors (geographic and soil characteristics) that affect the species characteristics of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> were investigated in Korean red pine (coniferous) and Mongolian oak (deciduous) forests, which represent the types of forests in Korea. There was no statistically significant difference in the population density and diversity of the species of <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> between the two types of forests. A similarity in the species composition between the standing vegetation and the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> was found and was higher in the shrub layer than in the canopy and understory layers. The species characteristics of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> such as the species composition and the species diversity, seemed to be more relevant for the herbaceous plants in the shrub layer than for the dominant tree species in the canopy layer. The number of plant species and the population density of the species of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> were considered to be affected by the organic content in the surface soil of the forests...|$|R
50|$|<b>Soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> play an {{important}} role in the natural environment of many ecosystems. For example, the rapid re-vegetation of sites disturbed by wildfire, catastrophic weather, agricultural operations, and timber harvesting is largely due to the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> Forest ecosystems and wetlands contain a number of specialized plant species forming persistent <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{change of}} species {{composition}} in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> differed among different impoundment periods in the TGRR. During the primary impoundment, species composition in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> was relatively complex and included the seeds produced by standing vegetation. The survival of seeds produced by vegetation before impoundment {{was dominated by}} annuals and the dominant species in this vegetation included perennials, annuals and shrubs (Wang et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2010 b). Our results indicated that species composition of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> was further simplified after {{a long period of}} water level fluctuation. Many pre-dam riparian shrub and perennial species disappeared from the riparian <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> The <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> was dominated by some annuals and a few flooding-tolerant perennials.|$|R
50|$|As {{the sandy}} soil was {{marginal}} farmland, twelve landowners took advantage the federal <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Program between the mid-1950s and early 70s. This erosion-control program paid farmers to plant trees, and 205 acre here were planted with red pines. Today these trees still flank the park road near the campground.|$|E
50|$|Studies on {{the effects}} of the <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> has shown that in Georgia after 18 years, 83.1% of the land {{dedicated}} to trees remain forest. The national study showed that after 33 years 80% remain forested. The same study found that only 2.5% of the land dedicated the trees have been re-converted back to cropland.|$|E
50|$|Following World War II, the {{government}} struggled {{with how to}} deal with the large farm surpluses that have been created by price supports. The first proposed solution to the problem was the Brannan Plan proposed by Secretary of Agriculture, C. F. Brannan, in 1949. The Brannan plan allowed for the treasury to pay farmers the difference between market prices and a modernized parity price. The Brannan plan was praised because it would eliminate the need to store surpluses and is also beneficial to the American for the goodbye across the low prices. However, the Brannan plan was never instituted. Many labor consumer groups supported plan as well as the Americans for Democratic action, and the NFU. However, most labor economist opposed the plan “for its failure to make provisions for the adjustment for support levels in light of demand and supply and for setting these levels and excessive 100% parity.” The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> act fall of the Brannan plan and was a less radical solution to the problem of crop surpluses. The <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> act was similar to many Depression-era solutions.|$|E
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{efficacy}} of smokewater to determine the potential germination from <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> in three management sites of the same National Park: a forest site prior to restoration, an ex-pine plantation site and an ex-mine site. This will provide further information to land managers so that more accurate planning can occur. Results showed that smokewater significantly increased the germination from the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> and {{significant differences in the}} level of germination of weed species from the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> were seen between the three management sites. This use of smokewater may be a useful tool to help predict differences in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> compared with predicting <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> based on land-use history and recent condition...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> flora of the Sisangan Box tree (Buxus hyrcanus Pojark) reserve by using seedling emergence method. 150 soil {{samples were collected}} during late June and early November by hammering a hollow metal frame 400 cm 2 {{to a depth of}} 5 cm. Results showed 67 species, representing 63 genera and 38 families germinated from <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> 45 species belonging to 28 families and 59 species belonging to 32 families were recorded in June and November <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> respectively. The largest families were Asteraceae (7 species, 10. 5 %), Lamiaceae (6 species, 9 %), Poaceae (5 species, 7. 5 %) and Rosaceae (4 species, 6 %) which compromised 32. 8 % percent of the total species in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> Results also showed that Hemicrptophytes (28. 4 %) and Euro-Sibria elements (23 / 9 %) were the most important biological spectrum and phytochorion respectivly in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> of Sisangan forest. From the total number of species recorded in seed bank, 30 species (44. 6 %) were found only in the seed bank and never observed in above-ground vegetation. In this regard, seeds of 10 woody species including Albizia julibrissin, Ficus carica, Morus alba, Diospyrus lotus, Celtis australis, Gleditsia caspica, Buxus hyrcana, Ulmus minor, Zelkova carpinifolia and Carpinus betulus were found in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> from which only 6 species were able to produce persistent <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> This condition confirmed low similarity between above-ground vegetation and persistent <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and it also reiterated the importance of <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> study for introducing more accurate capacity of plant biodiversity...|$|R
5000|$|Over time, {{a variety}} of related topics began to be {{addressed}} by agricultural policy: soil conservation (1956 <b>Soil</b> <b>Bank</b> Act), surplus crops as food aid (National School Lunch Act of 1946, Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, the 1964 Food Stamp Act), and much later wetlands and habitat conservation (Food Security Act of 1985, 1990 Wetlands Reserve Program, 1996 Wildlife Habitat and Environmental Quality Incentive Programs and 2002 Grassland Reserve Program) and organic food labeling (Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990).|$|E
50|$|The USDA {{reorganization}} of 1953 also saw {{changes to the}} FHA, including renaming it the Commodity Stabilization Service. As part of the changes, the organization {{began to focus on}} the preservation of farm income. As part of their new goals, the Commodity Stabilization Service began conservation programs such as the <b>soil</b> <b>bank.</b> The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committees were also formed out from community, county and state committees focused around conservation. By 1961, the CCS was renamed the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, as the agency had become more focused on conservation efforts. The ASCS remained active in assisting with their previous programs and the network of field offices.|$|E
5000|$|Prunus serotina is {{a pioneer}} species. In the Midwest, {{it is seen}} growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight-loving species, such as black walnut, black locust, and hackberry. Gleason and Cronquist (1991) {{describe}} P. serotina as [...] "formerly a forest tree, now abundant as a weed-tree of roadsides, waste land, and forest-margins". It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage, with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting, however, only progresses slowly. Seed production begins around 10 years of age, but does not become heavy until 30 years and continues up to 100 years or more. Germination rates are high, and the seeds are widely dispersed by birds who eat the fruit and then excrete them. Some seeds however may remain in the <b>soil</b> <b>bank</b> and not germinate {{for as long as}} three years. All Prunus species have hard seeds that benefit from scarification to germinate (which in nature is produced by passing through an animal's digestive tract).|$|E
30|$|We {{hypothesized}} that increased flooding reshaped <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and caused its differentiation among sites with different elevations (flood depth and duration) in the drawdown zone of TGRR.

40|$|In arid rangelands, <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> {{characteristics}} {{vary with}} rainfall patterns, livestock pressure and habitat heterogeneity. We investigated this issue by assessing spatio-temporal patterns in <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> density and richness in a degraded (heavy grazing) and non-degraded (light grazing) Nama Karoo ecosystem. To account for variation in seed distribution, different microsites were compared, {{and the effect}} of diaspore size on the patterning analyzed. Long-term heavy grazing increased seed densities and species richness of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> by favoring small-seeded and tiny-seeded annual species. The spatial patterning of the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> was, however, similar to that found under sustainable grazing. The overall seed distribution was dictated by the small-scale environmental heterogeneity, which interacted with diaspore size.

40|$|Management regimes for {{vegetation}} {{restoration of}} degraded grasslands can significantly affect {{the process of}} ecological succession. However, few {{studies have focused on}} variation in the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> during vegetation restoration under different management regimes, especially in saline-alkaline grassland habitats. Our aim was to provide insights into the ecological effects of grassland management regimes on <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> composition and vegetation establishment in mown, fenced, transplanted and natural grassland sites, all dominated by the perennial rhizomatous grass Leymus chinensis. We studied species composition and diversity in both the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and aboveground vegetation in differently managed grasslands in Northeast China. An NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) was used to evaluate the relationship between species composition, <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks,</b> aboveground vegetation and soil properties. Fenced and mown grassland sites had high density and species richness in both the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and aboveground vegetation. The Transplanted treatment exhibited the highest vegetation growth and seed production of the target species L. chinensis. Seeds of L. chinensis in the soil occurred only in transplanted and natural grassland. Based on the NMDS analysis, the number of species in both the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> and aboveground vegetation were significantly related to soil Na+, Cl-, RSC (residual sodium carbonate), alkalinity, ESP (exchangeable sodium percentage) and AP (available phosphorus). <b>Soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> composition and diversity in the saline-alkaline grassland were significantly affected by the management regimes implemented, and were also significantly related to the aboveground vegetation and several soil properties. Based on vegetative growth, reproductive output and maintenance of <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> the transplanting was identified as the most effective method for relatively rapid restoration of the target species L. chinensis.

Relationships between fragmentation (connectivity, fragment size, time since isolation) and urban disturbances (weed invasion, human disturbance, rubbish) relative to the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> of {{a representative sample of}} Perth’s urban woodland fragments (N= 36) were examined. In total, 182 seedling types comprising 57 invasive, 105 native and 20 unknowns were identified. Approximately 65 % of the 21, 770 seedlings counted were native, 33 % invasive and 2 % unidentified. The average <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> seedling density was 2, 787 germinates per m 2. Community analysis (ordination) showed that the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank</b> composition correlated with fragment age. Subsequent quantitative analysis (linear regression) did not find evidence for species or functional trait groups being vulnerable to decline due to isolation or fragment age, indicating that species extinction is not evident within Perth’s urban fragments. More invasive annual herbs were found within older fragments and the <b>soil</b> seed <b>banks</b> of smaller fragments were found to have lower native species abundance compared to larger fragments. A positive relationship was found between the number of footpaths within a fragment and the abundance of annual invasive herbs within the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> High weed cover in a fragment resulted in high weed presence within the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank.</b> It was also found that high weed cover did not necessarily indicate low native species diversity or abundance within the <b>soil</b> seed <b>bank,</b> suggesting caution in using weed cover to classify sites as suitable/unsuitable for topsoil transfer in restoration activities.
