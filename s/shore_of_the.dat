5|$|A 16th-century water gate in {{the eastern}} wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to the <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loch. The {{adjacent}} buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is {{the base of a}} doocot (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.|$|E
5|$|A second attack, {{simultaneous}} {{with the}} crossing at Kehl, occurred at Hüningen near Basel. After crossing unopposed, Ferino advanced in a dual-prong east along the German <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhine with the 16th and 50th demi-brigades, the 68th and 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry {{that included the}} 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons.|$|E

50|$|The city's {{location}} on the Rio Paraguay provides a prime location for boating and fishing. There are walking paths, pavilions, and parks located on <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. <b>The</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calmer Arroyo Ñeembucú provide the city's residents with a beach to enjoy on hot December days.|$|R
50|$|Human {{presence}} along <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay can {{be traced}} back to <b>the</b> retreat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glaciers at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last ice age around 8,150 years ago. Since contact with Europeans, the indigenous peoples along both <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay were ethnically Cree peoples.|$|R
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|As the {{district}} is on the <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabian sea, fishing {{is one of the}} major occupation of many people. The major fishing places are Bunder (Old harbour), Panambur, Surathkal, Kotekar and Sasihitlu.|$|E
5|$|Being a Hindu pilgrimage centre, Hindus {{form the}} visitor {{base of the}} city. There is a {{minority}} of Christians belonging to the fishing community. C.S.I island mission church and St Antony's Church at Oriyur on the eastern <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island are prominent Churches in the island.|$|E

50|$|The {{lake and}} the {{recreation}} area on <b>the</b> southern <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake are approached by road along the Lukat-Chilkot River Roads (also {{popularly known as}} Bear Highway as brown bears frequent this road in search of salmon) only up to <b>the</b> southern <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lake. The lake is 10 mi away from <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Heines.|$|R
5|$|Crater Lake {{features}} {{two small}} islands. Wizard Island, {{located near the}} western <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake, is a cinder cone approximately 316 acres (128 ha) in size. Phantom Ship, a natural rock pillar, is located near the southern shore.|$|E
5|$|Early records {{mention a}} west gate in 1180, a south gate in 1214, and the Netherbow Port in 1369. In 1362 the Wellhouse Tower was built beneath the north {{wall of the}} castle, {{protecting}} the castle's water supply, and defending the approach along the south <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nor Loch.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 2/9th {{advanced}} {{a further}} , reaching Sanderson's Bay, {{before deciding to}} set up their night location.

Like <b>the</b> {{nations on}} <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean, they too became famous navigators; but, unlike them, war and piracy were their chief objects of pursuit.

5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery, an outwork of Fort Manoel, {{was built}} on the {{northern}} <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. A bastioned entrenchment was proposed in the early 1760s, but it was never built.|$|E
5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. The river of Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stjørdalshalsen, on the north <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, {{but the cost of}} the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line. With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan {{sits in a}} {{relatively}} flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by the <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built on a long ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill {{is the site of}} Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park.|$|E
50|$|The Split Channel (Splitski kanal), is {{a channel}} in the Adriatic Sea, off <b>the</b> coast <b>of</b> {{mainland}} Dalmatia, defined by <b>the</b> southern <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island <b>of</b> Čiovo, <b>the</b> northern <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island <b>of</b> Šolta and <b>the</b> western <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island <b>of</b> Brač. It is accessible {{from the open}} sea through the Drvenik Channel or Šolta Channel from the west, and through the Split Gates (Splitska vrata) straits—narrow passage between Šolta and Brač to <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Split Channel. To the east, the Split Channel {{is connected to the}} Brač Channel. All the access routes accommodate capesize ships.|$|R

5|$|Numerous {{supporters}} of the usurper—800 according to the Life of Euthymius, over 3,000 according to the Life of Basil the Younger—were harshly punished; some were blinded and exiled, while others—including those who had sought sanctuary in the Hagia Sophia—were tonsured and confined to monasteries, {{while many of the}} common folk were affixed to stakes on the eastern <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bosporus.|$|E
5|$|On the Cayman Islands, the {{hurricane}} caused strong waves, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall at times. Damage was relatively minimal, amounting to blown out windows and beach erosion. Strong waves {{damaged or destroyed}} many docks on the south <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands, and also sank one dive ship near Grand Cayman. In addition, numerous incoming and outgoing flights were cancelled.|$|E
