50|$|The RD500LC uses twin {{ventilated}} disc brakes {{for the front}} wheel with a single {{ventilated disc}} at the rear. A <b>solo</b> <b>seat</b> cowl was originally provided to cover the pillion seat when not in use. The Japanese market RZV500R differs from the RD500 by not having a rear-mounted pillion grab handle fitted (which gives a cleaner, more race-oriented look to the motorcycle).|$|E
50|$|The Honda VFR750R, frame {{designation}} ''''RC30'''', was a fully faired <b>solo</b> <b>seat</b> only racing motorcycle {{created for}} homologation purposes for the World Superbike Championship by Honda Racing Corporation (HRC). It was first {{released to the}} Japanese market in 1987, 1988 released in Europe then the United States in 1990. There were only 3,000 ever made and sold for $15,000 US a very large amount for a production bike at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The early XBR500 {{was fitted}} with Comstar wheels and {{tubeless}} tyres. Later models {{were provided with}} spoked wheels and tubed tyres. A removable seat cover was also fitted in order to simulate a cafe-racer look. Honda subsequently released a café racer version of the XBR500, the Honda GB500 TT, which featured some [...] "classic British qualities", such as a <b>solo</b> <b>seat,</b> seat hump, wire wheels, and a fuel-tank with pinstriping.|$|E
25|$|From {{the inaugural}} episode, {{the show is}} shot in a set {{resembling}} a house created at Kanteerava Studios at Bengaluru. The set depicts a typical living area of a modern house complete with luxury seating for guests, a wall of the room which {{is said to be}} Rani's, through the door of which she usually enters the hall, a kitchen, a staircase connecting to {{the upper part of the}} house where Rajini is shown to be living in. Multiple ways exist to enter the hall; including the back hallway behind the seating through which Srujan usually enters. An area beside kitchen is reserved for the band and a <b>solo</b> <b>seating</b> is placed for Indrajith Lankesh to the opposite of the main set.|$|R

50|$|Each {{body has}} four instead of three doors. The rear seats are wider {{incorporating}} the space above the wheel arches, the mudguards built {{closer to the}} wheels to reduce mud splashing. The saloon landaulette's <b>solo</b> occasional <b>seat</b> is now a pair and they fold into the partition below the glass division.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{complete}} the endurance racer appearance of the bike, a removable <b>solo</b> <b>seat</b> cowl was included as were dual round endurance racer headlights and taillights. The dual headlight was changed to a single square light with white and black plastic surround on the initial US release models {{in order to satisfy}} what most major manufacturers thought would be a requirement of USA street legal vehicles in the near future. The legislation never passed and Honda included the very desirable dual round headlight on the 1986 USA models.|$|E
5000|$|Available to order, a {{standard}} Black Lightning was supplied in racing trim with magnesium alloy components, special racing tyres on alloy rims, rear-set foot controls, a <b>solo</b> <b>seat</b> and aluminium mudguards. This reduced the Lightning's weight to 380 lb. The [...] air-cooled OHV pushrod V-twin specifications were always based on standard parts but upgraded with higher-performance racing equipment. The Black Lightning had higher-strength connecting rods, larger inlet ports, polished rocker gear, steel idler gears, racing carburettors, and a manual-advance magneto, and was available with compression ratios between 6.8:1 and 12.5:1. This resulted in [...] {{and a top}} speed of 150 mph. Only 31 Black Lightnings were ever built before production ended in 1952 because of Vincent's financial problems.|$|E
5000|$|The GB500's {{engine was}} derived from the Honda XL600 engine, a dry-sump {{four-stroke}} dirt bike. The four-valve single cylinder engine featured a radial four-valve combustion chamber, along with a tubular frame, wire-spoked wheels with alloy rims, clip-on handlebars, <b>solo</b> <b>seat,</b> seat hump, and pin-striped fuel tank. The styling resembled TT single-cylinder racing bikes (such as the Manx Norton, the BSA Gold Star and the AJS 7R) that were prominent in the TT until the 1960s. The GB500 was a fine-handling machine: by contrast, its sibling, the XBR500, had a 10mm shorter wheelbase which [...] "made the steering very edgy". [...] Although sales of the TT were initially sluggish, today GB500s in good condition command premium prices.|$|E

5000|$|In the 2010 model year, Harley-Davidson {{introduced}} the XL1200X [...] "Forty-Eight" [...] model. It {{is similar to}} the [...] "Dark" [...] Nightster style but has the classic 1948 style small peanut tank, wire wheels, forward-controls, a wider front tire with a fat front end and chopped front fender, a slammed speedo with under mount mirrors, low <b>solo</b> single <b>seat,</b> and low suspension.|$|R

5000|$|The model designations are CB1100RB (1981), CB1100RC (1982), and CB1100RD (1983). In 1981, 1050 {{units were}} sold, {{followed}} by 1500 {{per year in}} 1982 and 1983. The 1981 'RB' was half faired with a <b>solo</b> <b>seat</b> only. The 82 and 83 models have different bodywork including a full fairing, aluminium fuel tank, and pillion seat covered with a removable seat cowl. The 82 (RC) and 83 (RD) (pictured) were largely similar with differences in paint scheme, rear swing arm and front fork design. In 1983 the Honda CB1100F was launched that essentially was a blend of the CB1100R and the CB900F, for a broader market. The 1981 CB1100RB had a claimed [...] @ 9000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Japanese and non-US export models had {{the tank}} and side panels painted in dark maroon with a Honda wing decal on the tank. It was {{available}} with either a single seat with no cowl or a dual seat, the latter version having a longer footrest carrier on the left to carry a pillion footrest. It featured clip-on handlebars and the instruments featured a black background with white lettering. US-model production was for model years 1989 and 1990 and featured black-green paint with gold pin-striping and lettering, as well as chrome wire wheels. Like the Japan-market model, it had steel-braided oil lines, steel side covers (i.e., not plastic), fork gaiters, non-adjustable fork with hydraulic damping and 18-inch wheels with tube-type tires. However, its round gauges have matte silver faces and its <b>solo</b> <b>seat</b> has a painted rear cowling.|$|E
5000|$|By 1978 {{the bike}} looked identical, but several {{significant}} improvements {{had made their}} way into the motor making them more reliable and solving problems with engine cranks breaking. The electronics also improved as well as some minor timing tweaks making the bike run more efficiently. Most notable was a majorly redesigned gear shifter that made the bike a lot easier for owners to live with the bike. Most 1978 900 Super Sports also came with a dual seat and lockable tool box. The <b>solo</b> <b>seat</b> was available as an option. The 1978 model bike is considered to be the finest iteration of the bevel drive square case Super Sports. The 1978 900 and 1979 750s were the last to retain close links with the Imola racers and the last to come with the [...] "old fashioned" [...] spoke wheels. it was also in 1978 that the Isle of Man TT Formula 1 race was won by a 900 Super Sport, ridden by former World Champion Mike Hailwood in a popular comeback race.|$|E
50|$|Air New Zealand's and Qantas' Premium Economy and Virgin America's First include {{amenities}} such as prioritized check-in, large customized seats (some for couples, others targeting <b>solo</b> travelers), <b>seat</b> {{pitch up}} to 41 inch cm with 50% more recline, premium meals, a self-service bar for drinks and snacks, a personal in-flight entertainment center with remote control, noise-cancelling headphones and choices in games and movies {{for children and}} adults, skin care products in the lavatory, and an amenities pouch containing items such as socks, sleep masks, earplugs, and toothbrushes.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2012 model year, Harley-Davidson {{introduced}} the XL1200V [...] "Seventy-Two" [...] model. It has the classic styling {{of the early}} '70s chopper/bobbers that were prevalent during this time. It has the peanut gas tank, wire wheels, white-wall tires, forward-controls, a bit of extra rake and slightly longer front forks, a chopped (bobbed) rear fender, side-mounted license plate, low <b>solo</b> single <b>seat,</b> mini-ape hanger handlebars, and low suspension. The bike has a measured HP of [...] (rear wheel) and [...] (rear wheel) and {{a top speed of}} 108 mph with a wet weight of 559.5 lb.|$|R
25|$|Designed by Air New Zealand in {{consultation}} with US design studio IDEO, the new Premium Economy cabin uses a 2-2-2 seating configuration. The central pair of Spaceseats are slightly angled for those travelling with a colleague or partner, and the two arm rests can form a single table for shared in-flight dining. The pairs of outboard Spaceseats on either side are angled to enhance privacy for <b>solo</b> flyers. The <b>seats</b> are built around a hard shell so the passenger in front cannot recline into {{the space of the}} person sitting behind. Instead, the seat slides forward and angles up as it reclines into the shell, similar to an armchair.|$|R
5000|$|The R80G/S (G for Gelände [...] "offroad" [...] in German S for Strasse [...] "street") was {{the first}} large {{displacement}} multisport bike on the market. The G/S was fitted with a [...] BMW type 247 engine, which is a flat-twin (boxer) sometimes known as an airhead. The engine, which was fitted into an R65 frame, was {{a modified version of}} that fitted to the R80/7, featuring Nikasil cylinders, electronic ignition and a lighter flywheel. At the rear the bike had the new [...] "monolever," [...] a combined single-sided swingarm and drive shaft, with the rear damping provided by a single shock absorber. The monolever was stiffer and lighter than the design fitted to previous models, and was subsequently fitted to other BMW motorcycles. It was a sealed suspension lever with the driveline inside the lever filled with oil to lubricate the shaft and parts. The single sided swing arm enabled the rear wheel to be removed easily with the bike on the center stand.It differs from other BMW road bikes of the same era due to its lighter weight, longer suspension travel, and large 21 inch front wheel.The bike gained popularity with adventure-seeking travellers after having won the Paris-Dakar ralley several times. BMW offered numerous optional parts including a 32 L fuel tank with Gaston Rahier's signature, a <b>solo</b> <b>seat,</b> stainless exhaust and a larger battery meaning {{that for the first time}} a true adventure travel motorcycle could be purchased directly from a manufacturer. The market it created spawned many aftermarket motorcycle accessories, such as larger fuel tanks and panniers.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1978 Cotton {{returned}} to Australia, signed with Oz Records and, in August, released a solo single, [...] "Dont Let It Get to You", which later appeared on his <b>solo</b> album Best <b>Seat</b> in the House (1980). From January 1979 Cotton hosted a TV music series, Summer Rock, on Adelaides Nine Network. Other solo singles followed, [...] "I Dont Want to Lose You" [...] (February 1979) and [...] "Glamour Girl" [...] (July). At {{about that time}} Cotton acted on the Australian soap opera The Young Doctors for one season and followed with another series of Summer Rock in early 1980. In February 1980, he released his most successful solo single, [...] "Same Old Girl", which reached top ten on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart. [...] "Same Old Girl" [...] was co-written with former band mate Christian. Cottons work in 1980 earned him an award for Best Solo Male Performance, 10 years after Zoot had won a similar award for a group. Best Seat in the House was issued on EMI Records and was produced by Christian. Cotton formed a backing band, The Charts, with Joey Amenta on lead guitar (ex-Taste, Redhouse, Russell Morris Band), Andy Buchanan on drums, Randy Bulpin on guitar (Mondo Rock), Terry Davidson on keyboards and Simon Gyllies on bass guitar (Mondo Rock). They toured the pub and club circuit and by 1981 were retitled as The Divers with Amenta, Davidson, Spiro Philipas on bass guitar and Robert Ross on drums. From May 1980 to November 1981 Cotton issued three more singles but none charted. In 1983 Cotton appeared in the lead role of the Australian stage production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rices Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. In 1984 he released his second solo album, Its Rock n Good Fun on Hammard Records.|$|R
