40|$|Consequence {{analysis}} to support documented safety analysis requires {{the use of}} one or more years of representative meteorological data for atmospheric transport and dispersion calculations. At minimum, the needed meteorological data for most atmospheric transport and dispersion models consist of hourly samples of wind speed and atmospheric <b>stability</b> <b>class.</b> Atmospheric stability is inferred from measured and/or observed meteorological data. Several methods exist to convert measured and observed meteorological data into atmospheric <b>stability</b> <b>class</b> data. In this paper, one year of meteorological data from a western Department of Energy (DOE) site is processed to determine atmospheric <b>stability</b> <b>class</b> using two methods. The method that is prescribed by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for supporting licensing of nuclear power plants makes use of measurements of vertical temperature difference to determine atmospheric stability. Another method that is preferred by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relies upon measurements of incoming solar radiation, vertical temperature gradient, and wind speed.

At moderate winds (2 <U< 10 m/s) wind speed and direction between the two sets of sensors were strongly correlated. At low winds (U< 2 m/s), the two sets produced small discrepancies due to different thresholds and calibration methods for the wind speed sensors. <b>Stability</b> <b>class</b> (Modified Sigma Theta method) was the same for each sensor package for 76 % of the study period and within one <b>stability</b> <b>class</b> for 94 % of the time.

40|$|While ANSI/ANS 3. 11 - 2000 {{does not}} specify {{a method for}} {{computing}} σθ, it suggests one-pass methods in Appendix E, including the Yamartino method. For the suggested methods, it also recommends deriving the hourly value of σθ by computing the Root Sum Squared (RSS) of the 10 or 15 -minute averages {{in order to minimize}} inflation of the 60 -minute σθ due to the effects of plume meander. This inflation effect was observed while developing a utility to compute missing 60 -minute σθ’s from partial data or to re-compute this value after portions of the underlying data had been edited. Re-computed σθ’s generally are lower than the original values, frequently reducing the associated <b>stability</b> <b>class</b> to a more stable value. This presentation reviews σθ computation, then details the observed differences between 60 -minute σθ’s computed from the original sensor data using the one-pass Yamartino method and values computed by RSS-ing the 15 -minute values.

40|$|As {{changes are}} made to an {{object-oriented}} design, its structure and/or behavior may be affected. Modifications made to one class can have ripple effects on other classes in the design. The stability of an object-oriented design indicates its resistance to interclass propagation of changes that the design would have when it is modified. There are two aspects of design stability: logical stability and performance stability. Logical stability is concerned with design structure, whereas performance stability is concerned with design behavior. In this study, the object-oriented design metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer were adopted as candidate indicators of the logical stability of object-oriented designs. The objective was to investigate {{whether or not there}} are correlations between these metrics and the logical <b>stability</b> of <b>classes.</b> The experimental results indicated that WMC, DIT, CBO, RFC, and LCOM metrics are negatively correlated with the logical <b>stability</b> of <b>classes.</b> However, no correlation was found between NOC metric and the logical <b>stability</b> of <b>classes...</b>|$|R

GPS-determined orthometric heights {{were determined by}} subtracting geoid undulations from ellipsoid heights obtained from a network least-squares adjustment of GPS occupations in 2007 and 2008. A total of 73 markers were occupied in these stability classes: 25 class A, 11 class B, 12 class C, 2 class D bench marks, and 23 temporary marks with transferred elevations.
