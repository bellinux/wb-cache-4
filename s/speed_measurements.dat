5|$|The {{definition}} of sustained winds {{recommended by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and used by most weather agencies {{is that of a}} 10-minute average at a height of 10m (33ft). However, the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> averaged over a 1-minute period, at 10m (33ft) above the surface. The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period, and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval. These make direct comparisons between basins difficult.|$|E
25|$|If the transmitter's {{output is}} {{coherent}} (phase synchronized), {{there is another}} effect {{that can be used}} to make almost instant <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> (no memory is required), known as the Doppler effect. Most modern radar systems use this principle into Doppler radar and pulse-Doppler radar systems (weather radar, military radar). The Doppler effect is only able to determine the relative speed of the target along the line of sight from the radar to the target. Any component of target velocity perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be determined by using the Doppler effect alone, but it can be determined by tracking the target's azimuth over time.|$|E
25|$|Sami is {{regarded}} as one of the fastest bowlers in cricket and has the ability to swing the cricket ball at high pace. He has unofficially bowled the fastest delivery in cricket when he clocked at 164km/ph (101.9mph) during a One Day International match. However, it was revoked by cricket officials after it found faulty <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> on the speed meter. He also once bowled a ball that clocked in at 162.3km/ph (100.8mph) against India, which would be the 'fastest ball' in the history of cricket. But despite his speed, he has been in and out of the national side for several times. However he has received support from former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram & Waqar Younis, who sees Sami's speed and wicket taking ability as an important skill for the Pakistan team.|$|E
40|$|Above-The-Road (AbTR) radar is a {{new type}} of <b>speed</b> <b>measurement</b> device used in China for traffic speed enforcement. The antenna beamwidths in {{vertical}} and horizontal directions are critical parameters for AbTR radar because <b>speed</b> <b>measurement</b> accuracy partly depends on vertical beamwidth and <b>speed</b> <b>measurement</b> interference from adjacent lanes can be effectively minimized by appropriate choice of horizontal beamwidth. In this paper, the <b>speed</b> <b>measurement</b> principle of AbTR radar is introduced and the reason for field <b>speed</b> <b>measurement</b> error is presented. The <b>speed</b> <b>measurement</b> error is theoretically calculated in various combinations of different vertical beamwidths and possible installation angles. The requirement for horizontal beamwidth to operate with less interference from adjacent lanes is also theoretically laid down with different installation heights and angles. Field tests with three equal-distanced piezosensors each lane as triggering references have been performed on an AbTR radar sample with vertical beamwidth 5. 1 ° and horizontal beamwidth 5. 2 °. The results of theoretical analysis and field tests validate that the requirement of less than 6 ° for AbTR radar antenna beamwidths in vertical and horizontal directions is a precondition for accurate and reliable field measurements, which has been added to the China’s pattern approval regulation for AbTR radar devices newly published...|$|R

However, the maximum sustained wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> that the JTWC uses {{are based on a}} 1-minute averaging period, akin to the U.S.' National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center. As a result, the JTWC's wind reports are higher than JMA's measurements, as the latter are based on a 10-minute averaging interval.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the forces}} that affect {{tropical}} cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during {{the life of a}} tropical system. The deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth of the troposphere, is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared, use of wind <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> at a lower altitude, such as at the 70kPa pressure surface ( [...] above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term [...] of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory. High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with increased understanding {{of the forces}} that act on tropical cyclones, as well as with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades. However, scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones. The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development. [...] New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.|$|E

2500|$|Imagine a {{forensics}} lab {{that has}} some apparatus to measure {{the speed of a}} bullet fired from a gun. Under carefully controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, pressure and so on the same gun is fired repeatedly and <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> taken. This produces some distribution of speeds. Though we will not get exactly the same value for each individual measurement, for each cluster of measurements, we would expect the experiment to lead to the same distribution of speeds. In particular, we can expect to assign probability distributions to propositions such as {a ≤ speed ≤ b}. [...] This leads naturally to propose that under controlled conditions of preparation, the measurement of a classical system can be described by a probability measure on the state space. [...] This same statistical structure is also present in quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{angular speed}} of the prism changes with {{the range of the}} target: {{consider}} the reverse situation, the apparent high angular speed of an aircraft passing overhead compared to its apparent speed when it is seen at a longer distance. In order to properly account for this non-linear effect, the Norden used a system of slip-disks similar to those used in differential analysers. However, this slow change at long distances made it difficult to fine-tune the drift early in the bomb run. In practice, bombardiers would often set up their ground <b>speed</b> <b>measurements</b> in advance of approaching the target area by selecting a convenient [...] "target" [...] on the ground that was closer to the bomber and thus had more obvious motion in the sight.
