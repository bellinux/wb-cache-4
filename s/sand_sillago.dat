40|$|Two {{methods of}} otolith {{increment}} analysis {{were used to}} describe spatial, temporal and gender vari- ation in growth of <b>sand</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> ciliata (Cuvier), in four south-east Australian estuaries. Mean annual standardised otolith increment widths were used as indices of individual lifetime growth rates, while raw otolith increment widths were used to describe variation in growth throughout the life of S. ciliata. Temporal variation in growth was observed at an annual scale, while spatial variation in growth was observed between estuaries. Growth rates increased significantly with decreasing latitude and greater mean sea surface temperatures. A divergence in growth rates between sexes was detected, with females growing faster than males after sexual maturity. This study highlights how otolith increment analyses can: (1) be used to analyse temporal trends in growth from a single sample and (2) provide insight into juvenile growth when samples have an absence of undersized fish...|$|R

Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves {{as a source of}} food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), semaphore crab (Heloecius cordiformis), blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus sinuatus) also call the mangroves home. A more casual visitor to the mangroves at high tide is the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis) which scoots around just an inch from the surface and is virtually invisible unless viewed through a snorkel.|$|R

Two possible methods of mass marking; oxytetracycline (OTC) marking of otoliths, and scale pattern analysis (SPA) were investigated. A range of OTC trials was conducted, with limited success. High concentrations (1000 mg L 1) of OTC and low salinities (9 °/ 00) produced acceptable marks on the otoliths of both species, but {{at the expense of}} fingerling survival and environmental health risks. SPA provided better results, with wild to hatchery misclassification rates of 25 and 11 %, respectively, for P. fuscus and S. ciliata. The reverse misclassification rate of hatchery to wild was equal or better for both species. Field trials demonstrated that SPA was able to differentiate between the two sources of fingerlings (wild and hatchery). These results indicated that OTC was impractical, while SPA was acceptable for this {{pilot programme}}. The implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Major rivers produce large plumes which subsidize benthic marine food webs. Because most plumes are smaller, {{we tested}} whether these also can link marine food webs with {{riverine}} discharges. We used stable isotopes to detect assimilation of terrestrial organic matter by fish, {{crustaceans and cephalopods}} harvested from plume areas off two small estuaries in eastern Australia, contrasted with values from marine reference sites. A terrestrial signal was evident in most marine consumers as shifts in carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. The strongest signal for terrestrial carbon uptake was found in two species harvested commercially, the portunid crab, Portunus sanguinolentus, and the flounder, Pseudorhombus arsius, demonstrating a link between river discharge and fisheries productivity in coastal seas. Against a backdrop of the general presence of a trophic signal imparted by small plumes, absolute contributions of these subsidies were, however, smaller than in larger systems. Also, for the species occurring in both coastal and estuarine waters (<b>sand</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> ciliata), isotopic variation was considerably smaller in marine waters than across the estuarine gradient. Overall, small plumes can make contributions to the energy requirements of coastal fisheries species, but their ephemeral nature and small physical dimensions set limits {{to the degree of}} land-water ecotonal coupling...|$|R
40|$|Lesions {{typical of}} {{epizootic}} ulcerative syndrome (EUS) were induced in three-spot gourami, Trichogaster trichopterus, and <b>sand</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> ciliata, injected intramuscularly with controlled doses of Aphanomyces invadans zoospores, the fungal pathogen associated with the disease. Both species of fish exhibited chronic granulomatous response and inflammatory cells, predominantly macrophages and lymphocytes, infiltrated the muscle and skin tissues, at days 6 â€“ 8 post-inoculation of 65 to 85 spores/fish. Based on the comparative granuloma counts and percentage of cellular infiltration in a sampled lesion area using image analysis, it was shown that the three-spot gouramis mounted a more vigorous response than the sand whiting. It was also observed that lesions in three-spot gouramis exhibited early signs of resolution than those in sand whiting. However, fish mortality was greater in EUS-affected three-spot gourami than in EUS-affected sand whiting. With this technique, {{we were able to}} describe and compare the sequential histopathology of EUS lesions in a freshwater (three-spot gourami) and an estuarine (sand whiting) fish species.

40|$|Commercial and {{recreational}} harvests of fish from two eastern Australian coastal rivers, the Richmond and the Clarence, have been compared {{for the period}} from March 1988 to May 1989, using commercial fisheries statistics and a roving creel census of daytime recreational anglers. For both rivers, sea mullet (Mugil cephalus) made up about 70 % of the commercial catch by weight but was not caught in significant numbers by anglers. Fish species harvested in large numbers by both sectors were yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), dusky flathead (Platycephalus fiscus), luderick (Girella tricuspidata), <b>sand</b> whiting (<b>Sillago</b> ciliata), mulloway (Argyrosomus hololepidotus) and tailor (Pomatomus saltatrix). For the Richmond River, yellowfin bream, dusky flathead and tailor were harvested principally by recreational anglers; sand whiting were equally shared between fishing sectors, and harvests of luderick and mulloway were dominated by commercial fishers. For the Clarence River, which supports {{one of the largest}} estuarine-based commercial fisheries in Australia, tailor were harvested principally by recreational anglers; yellowfin bream, dusky flathead and mulloway were equally shared between fishing sectors, and sand whiting and luderick were taken predominantly by commercial fishers. Although data on recreational fishing throughout Australia are limited, anglers now appear to be the dominant harvesters of several estuarine fish species. As {{in other parts of the}} world, the numbers of recreational anglers in Australian waters appear to be increasing, and this situation is likely to lead to both heightened conflict between the user groups and increased exploitation of a limited resource. The need for sustained and cost-effective monitoring of recreational angler effort and harvests is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Utilisation by fish of {{different}} estuarine habitats {{is known to}} vary at many different temporal scales, however no study to date has examined how utilisation varies at all the relevant times scales simultaneously. Here, we compare the utilisation by fish of sandy, intertidal foreshore habitats in a subtropical estuary at four temporal scales: between major spawning periods (spring/ summer and winter), among months within spawning periods, between the full and new moon each month, and between night and day within those lunar phases. Comparisons of assemblage composition, abundance of individuals and of fish in seven different,ecological guilds 2 ̆ 7 were used to identify the temporal scales at which fish varied their use of unvegetated sandy habitats in the lower Noosa Estuary, Queensland, Australia. Fish assemblages were sampled with a seine net at three different regions. The most numerically dominant species caught were southern herring (Herklotsichthys castelnaui: Clupeidae), <b>sand</b> whiting (<b>Sillago</b> ciliata: Sillaginidae), weeping toadfish (Torquigener pleurogramma: Tetraodomidae), and silver biddy (Gerres subfasciatus: Gerreidae). Considerable variation at a range of temporal scales from short term (day versus night) to longer term (spawning periods) was detected for {{all but one of}} the variables examined. The clearest patterns were observed for diurnal effects, where generally abundance was greater at night than during the day. There were also strong lunar effects, although there were no consistent patterns between full moon and new moon periods. Significant differences among months within spawning periods were more common than differences between the actual spawning periods. The results clearly indicate that utilisation of sandy, unvegetated estuarine habitats is very dynamic and highly variable in space and time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Carbon and {{nitrogen}} stable isotopes {{were used to}} determine the ultimate autotrophic sources supporting production of three commercially important fish species over unvegetated mudflats in a subtropical estuary. Mean isotope values over the whole estuary for fish and autotroph sources were modeled to indicate feasible combinations of sources. Variability in isotope values among nine locations (separated by 3 - 10 km) was then used as a further test of the likelihood that sources were involved in fish nutrition. A positive spatial correlation between isotope values of a fish species and an autotroph indicates a substantial contribution from the autotroph. Spatial correlations were tested with a newly developed randomization procedure using differences between fish and autotroph values at each location, based on carbon {{and nitrogen}} isotopes combined in two-dimensional space. Both whole estuary modeling and spatial analysis showed that seagrass, epiphytic algae and particulate organic matter in the water column, including phytoplankton, are likely contributors to bream (Acanthopagrus australis) nutrition. However, spatial analysis also showed that mangroves were involved (up to 33 % contribution), despite a very low contribution from whole estuary modeling. Spatial analysis on <b>sand</b> whiting (<b>Sillago</b> ciliata) demonstrated the importance of two sources, mangroves (up to 25 %) and microalgae on the mudflats, considered unimportant based on whole estuary modeling. No spatial correlations were found between winter whiting (Sillago maculata) and autotrophs, either because fish moved among locations or relied on different autotrophs at different locations. Spatial correlations between consumer and source isotope values provide a useful analytical tool for identifying the role of autotrophs in foodwebs, and demonstrated here that both in situ production of microalgae and organic matter from adjacent habitats were important to fish over mudflats.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to gather data on certain {{reproductive}} traits of the <b>sand</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> sihama (family: Sillaginidae). The maximum weight recorded for male and female was 77. 65 and 76. 9 g respectively, while the maximum length obtained was 21. 70 and 21. 96 cm respectively. The highest percent of gravid females was found during September-October. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) of females was marginally higher (3. 84 ± 5. 8) than that of males (2. 09 ± 0. 2); {{there was no significant difference}} in GSI of male and female (p> 0. 05), except in the months of April and July. The highest percentage of mature fish was recorded in June. The results confirm that S. sihama is a continuous breeder with two peak breeding seasons, one during May- June and the other during August- December. The absolute fecundity varied between 24, 439 and 59, 372 eggs/female, whereas the relative fecundity was observed to be between 4, 29, 953 and 8, 66, 968 eggs/kg body weight. The ova-diameter showed very little variation (0. 32 - 0. 46 mm) between individual females. Higher spermatozoa motility (97 %) and duration (164 s) were observed in the month of July and higher level was maintained through November at 25 and 28 ppt saline water. The spermatozoa density (9. 28 × 106 – 10. 18 × 106 nos. ml- 1) and spermatocrit (44. 83 – 46. 15 %) were high during the same period.

40|$|In {{order to}} show that {{dolphins}} use estuary habitats differently {{depending on the season}} and tidal state, possibly in response to prey distribution, temperature, risk of stranding and accessibility, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) were observed year-round during a 3 -year study in the Clarence River estuary (CR) and Richmond River estuary (RR) in northern New South Wales, Australia. Peak dolphin sightings occurred during the spring season and one or 2 h prior to high tide. The spatial distribution of the dolphins in each estuary was analysed using the distance in kilometres that the dolphins travelled upstream with seasons and tidal phase as determinants. A General Linear Model showed that in the CR the dolphin spatial distribution in the estuary was not determined by season (F = 0. 434, df = 3, P = 0. 729) but was by tidal phase (F = 9. 943, df = 3, P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and the interaction between season and tidal phase (F = 3. 398, df = 9, P 3 ̆c 0. 002). However, in the RR the spatial distribution of the dolphin use of the estuary was not determined by either season (F = 1. 647, df = 3, P = 0. 194) or tidal phase (F = 0. 302, df = 3, P = 0. 824). In the CR, the spatial distribution of the dolphins was largest on high and flood tides. This pattern of spatial distribution may occur because the CR is a relatively shallow estuary and this increased spatial distribution may reflect a lower stranding risk and an increase in accessibility of shallow areas during periods of higher tide.

40|$|Since 1989, {{researchers}} with the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) in Queensland, Australia, have successfully used controlled low-water exchange green-water cultures to rear the larvae of estuarine fishes and crustaceans through to metamorphosis. High survivals and excellent fry condition {{have been achieved}} for several commercially important endemic species produced for various projects. They include barramundi or sea bass, Lates calcarifer, Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, dusky flathead, Platycephalus fuscus, <b>sand</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> ciliata, red sea bream or snapper, Pagrus auratus, banana prawn, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, and others. The consistent success of our standardised and relatively simple approach at different localities has led to it being incorporated into general fingerling production practices at several establishments in Australia. Although post-metamorphosis rearing methods have differed for each species investigated, due to various biological and behavioural traits and project requirements, these larval rearing methods have been successful with few species-specific modifications. Initially modelled on the Taiwanese approach to rearing Penaeids in aerated low-water exchange cultures, the approach similarly appears {{to rely on a}} beneficial assemblage of micro-organisms. Conceptually, these micro-organisms may include a mixture of the air-borne primary invaders of pure phytoplankton cultures when exposed to outdoor conditions. Whilst this would vary with different sites, our experiences with these methods have consistently been favourable. Mass microalgal cultures with eco-physiological youth are used to regularly augment larval fish cultures so that rearing conditions simulate an exponential growth-phase microalgal bloom. Moderate to heavy aeration prevents settlement of particulate matter and encourages aerobic bacterial decomposition of wastes. The green-water larval rearing approach described herein has demonstrated high practical utility in research and commercial applications, and has greatly simplified marine finfish hatchery operations whilst generally lifting production capacities for metamorphosed fry in Australia.

None of the fish species differed in their isotope values between artificial waterways. In contrast, isotopic signatures of snub-nosed garfish (Arrhamphus sclerolepis; Hemiramphidae) varied greatly between natural and artificial waterways, having highly enriched d 13 C values (- 10. 5 驠in natural wetlands, demonstrating reliance on seagrass (- 11. 4 马 and significantly less enriched values (- 19. 0 驠in artificial waterways, consistent with either local algal sources (- 19. 8 to - 20. 4 驠or a mixture of seagrass and other less enriched autotrophs from adjacent natural wetlands. Isotopic signatures of <b>sand</b> whiting (<b>Sillago</b> ciliata; Sillaginidae) were also significantly more enriched in natural (- 18. 2 驠than artificial (- 21. 0 驠habitats, but means were not far enough apart to distinguish between different sources of nutrition. d 13 C values of yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis; Sparidae) did not differ between artificial and natural habitats (about - 20 頩n both). d 15 N values of fish varied among habitats only for A. sclerolepis, which in artificial waterways had values enriched by 2 頯ver those in natural waterways. This was consistent with a shift from seagrass (relatively depleted d 15 N) as a source in natural habitat to algal sources (relatively enriched d 15 N) in artificial habitats.

40|$|Henneguya lesteri n. sp, (Myxosporea) is {{described}} from <b>sand</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> analis, {{from the southern}} Queensland coast of Australia. H. lesteri displays a preference for the pseudobranchs and is typically positioned along the afferent blood vessels, displacing the adjoining lamellae and disrupting their normal array, The plasmodia appeared as whitish-hyaline, elliptical cysts (mean dimensions 230 x 410 mum) attached to the oral mucosa lining of the hyoid arch on the inner surface of the operculum. Infections of the gills were also found, in which the plasmodia were spherical, averaged 240 x 240 mum in size and were located on the inner hemibranch margin. The parasites lodged in the gill filament crypts and generated a mild hyperplastic response of the branchial epithelium, In histological sections, the plasmodium wall and adjoining ectoplasm appeared as a finely granulated, weakly eosinophilic layer, Ultrastructurally, {{this section of the}} host-parasite interface contained an intricate complex of pinocytotic channels. H. lesteri is polysporic, disporoblastic and pansporoblast forming. Sporogenesis is asynchronous, with the earliest developmental stages aligned predominantly along the plasmodium periphery, and maturing sporoblasts and spores toward the center. Ultrastructural details of sporoblast and spore development are in agreement with previously described myxosporeans. The mature spore is drop-shaped, length (mean) 9. 1 mum, width 4. 7 mum, thickness 2. 5 mum, and comprises 2 polar capsules positioned closely together, a binucleated sporoplasm and a caudal process of 12. 6 mum.

Also, the influence of water temperature variations on the nonspecific immune responses of a fish exposed to Aphanomyces invadans was determined. Moreover, the efficacy of four therapeutic substances to enhance the defense mechanisms of susceptible fish against EUS was assessed. A model of the sequential pathology of EUS was developed and described in three spot gourami Trichogaster trichopterus and <b>sand</b> whiting <b>Sillago</b> ciliata. Both species of fish exhibited histopathological changes typical of EUS, such as chronic granulomatous response and inflammatory cell infiltration in the muscle and skin tissues, at day 8 post-inoculation of 55 to 70 spores/fish. From the results of comparative granuloma counts and percentage of cellular infiltration in a sampled lesion area using image analysis, it was shown that the three-spot gouramis developed a more vigorous response than the sand whiting. Based on the EUS model, the effects of either rapid or gradual decrease in temperature on the histopathology of EUS in sand whiting was documented. Qualitative and quantitative histopathological examinations revealed a marked delay in the inflammatory response of fish maintained at low temperature. EUS lesions were also induced in skin-abraded three-spot gouramis exposed to motile A. invadans zoospores, with higher mortality in fish subjected to daily temperature variations (26 °C to 19 °C) than in fish held at 26 °C. Histopathological examination also revealed minimal inflammatory cell infiltration and delayed mycotic granuloma formation with extensive tissue damage in temperature-stressed fish. Fish oil, L-cysteine ethyl ester, yeast glucans and levamisole were trialled as prophylactics against EUS. Only yeast glucans and levamisole gave encouraging results.

Sato et al. and Kiyono et al. reported on the artificial fertilization and the breeding of the sand borer, its parent fish were spawned by mainly hormone treatments. Our examinations, however, were made by using the eggs which were obtained from natural spawning fish. The present paper reports the resalt of some approaches on the natural spawning of the sand borer. On June 2, 1975, one female and three male adult fishes, caught by hooking in Uragami Bay, Wakayama Pref., were placed in a 0. 5 t plastic water tank and were bred during the spawning period. The results of investigation on the natural spawning were as follows: 1) One female fish of 201 mm in fork length spawned 65 times repeatedly during 108 days from June 17 to October 2. 2) The highest and lowest egg numbers per one spawning were 59, 600 and 1, 100, respectively, and the total ones amounted to 1, 800, 750. 3) The water temperatures during the spawning period were ranged from 21. 0 ℃ to 30. 5 ℃, but the optimum temperature for spawning appeared to be restricted from 26. 0 ℃ to 29. 0 ℃. 4) It was supposed that the optimum spawning time was centered between about P.

Wild-caught broodstock were induced to spawn using hormones (hCG, LHRHa, Ovaprim) and either spawned naturally or were stripped. Pagrus auratus and S. ciliate {{were found to be}} multiple spawners with asynchronous ovaries. Conversely, M. novemaculeata and A. hololepidotus were found to be highly fecund single spawners having group synchronous ovaries. All four species were successfully induced to ovulate after periods in captivity ranging from one to five years. Species specific differences in hormone induction were determined, particularly in relation to the overripening of eggs and the optimum time between treatment and stripping. Commercial scale batches of larvae were reared in 2000 L conical tanks and replicated experiments were conducted in aquaria ranging in size from 2 to 70 L. Larval development for all four species was described and egg size, time to hatch, size at hatch, yolk size, oil globule size, and beginning of exogenous feeding were compared among species. First feeding larvae were reared on rotifers Brachionus plicatilis and then brine shrimp Artemia sp [...] Survival, growth and weaning of larvae at metamorphosis were compared. Factors affecting larval survival, particularly those influencing initial swim bladder development were tested in replicated laboratory experiments. The timing of swim bladder inflation was found to coincide with the start of exogenous feeding but feeding was not required for initial swim bladder inflation. Larvae that failed to inflate their swim bladder grew poorly and were susceptible to stress induced mortality. Light intensity, was shown to be an important factor influencing swim bladder inflation in cultured larvae. The effect of light intensity on inflation in M. novemaculeata and S. ciliate was quantified. Exposure to continuous light (100 - 200 Lux) inhibited inflation in M. novemaculeata. In contrast, S. ciliate were shown to have a diel pattern of nocturnal inflation and required higher light intensities to feed (1000 Lux). Manipulative experiments with S. ciliate larvae showed that they responded to darkness by inflating their swim bladders. Other abiotic factors such as surface access, low salinity and high aeration were shown to reduce inflation in larvae. Initial swim bladder inflation strategies are discussed and recommendations made regarding the importance of maximising inflation. The results of the study were used to assess the relative difficulty of intensive commercial production of each species for aquaculture...|$|R
