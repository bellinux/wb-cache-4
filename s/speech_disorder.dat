5|$|Developmental verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor <b>speech</b> <b>disorder</b> involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. The speech {{of a child with}} developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a <b>speech</b> <b>disorder</b> in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor <b>speech</b> <b>disorder</b> characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
40|$|Motor <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{a common}} accompaniment of {{a whole range of}} {{neurological}} conditions, from stroke, brain injury and Parkinson’s disease through to many rarer conditions. This book aims to aid {{understanding of the nature of}} motor <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> from a cross-language perspective, in contrast to the largely English-centric nature of research and practice recommendations to date. The book looks not just at how these motor <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> are assessed and treated in other countries, but also examines how underlying speech impairments differ according to the language someone speaks. The book studies the underlying neurological, neurophysiological and neurophonetic characteristics of motor <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> in different language contexts, and discusses the implications these have for clinical rehabilitation. This significantly adds to debates around the theoretical understanding and clinical management of motor <b>speech</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Prevalence of <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> in {{schoolchildren}} and {{its associated}} factors OBJECTIVE: To assess prevalence of <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> in schoolchildren {{and its associated}} factors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study comprising {{a random sample of}} 1, 810 schoolchildren attending the fi rst grade in public schools in a city of Southern Brazil, in 2001. Schoolchildren aged between fi ve and 11 years were evaluated using a previously validated speech screening test for phonetic and/or phonologic disorders. Data on school failure, gender, age and maternal and paternal schooling were collected to test associations. Associations between variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: The prevalence of <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> in the children studied was 24. 6 % and they were more prevalent in younger children aged fi ve and six compared to children aged ten or more. <b>Speech</b> <b>disorders</b> prevalence around fi ve years old was 57 % and between eight and ten years old was 42 %. <b>Speech</b> <b>disorders</b> frequency was similar in both sexes. The prevalence of disorders was associated to maternal and paternal schooling, 79. 5 % and 78. 6 %, respectively, when parents had less then one year of study. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> among schoolchildren studied was higher than that described in the literature. Parental schooling was a major factor associated to these disorders. KEY WORDS: Child. <b>Speech</b> <b>disorders,</b> epidemiology. Risk factors. Socioeconomic factors.

5|$|Sigi Schmid {{was born}} in Tübingen, West Germany, on March 20, 1953. At the age of four, he moved {{with his family to}} the United States; they took up {{residence}} in Torrance, California, in 1962. Schmid's father, Fritz, who had been a prisoner of war during World War II, worked at Pabst Brewing; his mother, Doris, ran a Los Angeles-based German deli, where Schmid worked on weekends. Schmid's family spoke German at home, making him feel German despite spending so much of his life in America. He began school in the United States with little understanding of English and a stuttering <b>speech</b> <b>disorder</b> he did not overcome until high school. In his youth, Schmid visited Germany every summer, playing soccer with the local children and watching Bundesliga clubs play exhibition matches in neighboring towns. In 1964, Schmid played for the inaugural American Youth Soccer Organization team, an achievement for which he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E

40|$|Background: Speech is {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of development that related to central nervous system maturation in cognitive sensory motor domain. <b>Disorders</b> of <b>speech</b> may disrupt other aspects of development. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> among primary schoolchildren in Kermanshah during 2008 - 9. Methods: Six hundred schoolchildren from three educational regions of the city were selected using multi-stage cluster sampling method. In an hour assessment session, an expert Speech-Language pathologist evaluated the spontaneous speech of children by phonetic test and specialist judgment. Results: 39. 5 % of cases were female and 60. 5 % male. Mean age of students was 9. 12 ± 1. 52 years. 67 out of 600 studied schoolchildren (11. 2 %) were diagnosed as <b>speech</b> <b>disordered.</b> Prevalence of <b>speech</b> <b>disorders</b> among boys and girls was 11 and 11. 3 percent respectively.

25|$|Stuttering is {{generally}} not {{a problem with the}} physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress do not cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the <b>speech</b> <b>disorder,</b> and living with a stigmatized disability can result in anxiety and high allostatic stress load (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem {{in the manner of a}} positive feedback system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition. Neither acute nor chronic stress, however, itself creates any predisposition to stuttering.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of TTP is variable.

Cerebral symptoms of various degree are present in many patients, including headache, paresis, <b>speech</b> <b>disorder,</b> visual problems, seizures and disturbance of consciousness up to coma. The symptoms can fluctuate so that they may only be temporarily present but may reappear again later in the TTP episode.

500|$|Cerebral palsy {{is a term}} {{referring}} to a non-progressive developmental neuromotor disorder with an upper motor neuron lesion origin. Depending on {{the location of the}} brain lesion, individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and fine motor challenges, including different forms and areas of the body affected. Fine motor planning, control and coordination are often affected. Dysarthria, a <b>speech</b> <b>disorder</b> resulting from neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication. Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment, and visual and hearing problems are also common. [...] Gross and fine motor challenges are often of particular concern in accessing an AAC device. Appropriate seating and positioning are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement. Extensive motor training and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use. [...] The trend towards custom-placed sensors and personalized signal processing may assist in facilitating communication for those who are incapable of using other AAC technologies.|$|E
