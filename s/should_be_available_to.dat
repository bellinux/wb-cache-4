5|$|Pietrangeli, in his {{foreword}} to The Sistine Chapel, written {{after the}} restoration of the lunettes, but prior to {{the restoration of}} the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E

25|$|A 2003 {{study of}} canine {{diabetes}} caregivers who were new to testing blood glucose at home found 85% {{of them were}} able to both succeed at testing and to continue it on a long-term basis. Using only one blood glucose reading {{as the reason for}} an insulin dose increase is to be avoided; while the results may be higher than desired, further information, such as the lowest blood glucose reading or nadir, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> prevent possible hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Technoliberalism is a {{political}} philosophy founded on ideas of liberty, individuality, responsibility, decentralization, and self-awareness. It also highlights an idea that technology <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> everyone without controls. Its core beliefs fit under five main interests that include Construction of the Government, Economics, Civil Liberties, Education and Science, and Environment. Technoliberals support such ideas as balance of powers in the government, decentralization, affordable education, the protection of our planet, Fine Arts, and {{the freedom of speech}} and communication technologies.|$|E

25|$|As Van Slyck (1991) showed, {{the last}} years of the 19th century saw {{acceptance}} of the idea that free libraries <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the American public. But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two.|$|E
25|$|Democrats favor {{improving}} {{public education}} by raising school standards and reforming {{the head start}} program. They also support universal preschool and expanding access to primary education, including through charter schools. They call for slashes in student loan debt and support reforms to force down tuition fees. Other proposed reforms have included nationwide universal preschool education, tuition-free college, and reform of standardized testing. Democrats have the long-term aim of having low-cost, publicly funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of Europe and Canada), which <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> every eligible American student. Alternatively, they encourage expanding access to post-secondary education by increasing state funding for student financial aid such as Pell Grants and college tuition tax deductions.|$|E
25|$|As VanSlyck (1989) shows, {{the last}} years of the 19th century saw {{acceptance}} of the idea that libraries <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the American public free of charge. However the design of the idealized free library {{was at the center of}} a prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, wealthy philanthropists favored grandiose monuments that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. They wanted a grandiose showcase that created a grand vista through a double-height, alcoved bookhall with domestically-scaled reading rooms, perhaps dominated by the donor's portrait over the fireplace. Typical examples were the New York Public Library and the Chicago Public Library. Librarians considered that grand design inefficient, and too expensive to maintain.|$|E

5000|$|That {{the lower}} {{taxation}} applied to large companies <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> small companies, {{which are in}} reality one person as income earner (and perhaps a wife/husband handling the paperwork).|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} University College, Bristol and {{ultimately}} the University of Bristol can be traced {{as far back as}} 1872 and the attempts of John Percival, a local educationalist and headmaster of Clifton College, to press {{for the creation of a}} college. Percival was a supporter of the education of women, having founded an Association for the Promotion of the Higher Education of Women in 1868, and an Association for the Promotion of Evening Classes a year later. Percival's strong Christian religious views (he later became a Bishop) influenced his views on education, in that he believed that opportunities <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> both males and females irrespective of their declared faith. He is credited with the initial idea that there should be a University in Bristol. Lewis Fry, a later influence on the College and the subsequent University, is quoted as saying that it was to Pervical that they owed the foundation of the College.|$|E
500|$|... "Anarchy & Beauty"'s {{arts and}} crafts section {{featured}} Morris' own copy of the French edition of Karl Marx's Das Kapital handbound in a gold-tooled leather binding that MacCarthy describes as [...] "the ultimate example of Morris's conviction that perfectionism of design and craftsmanship <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1894, Parry and {{his wife}} hoped {{a trip to the}} US would help ease some of the sadness over the deaths of their two sons. [...] Parry had last visited the United States on a vocal concert tour in 1880. Though the Parrys would be visiting family, he {{believed}} he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the public during the visit since many people in the US had helped him financially when he was studying music in England.|$|E

500|$|The {{issue was}} {{revisited}} {{in the subsequent}} case of R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal (2011). The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom disapproved of certain pronouncements by the lower courts which appeared to signal {{a return to the}} pre-Anisminic position. According to Lord Dyson, this was not justified as [...] "the importance of Anisminic is that it showed that a material error of law renders a decision a 'nullity' so that the decision is in principle judicially reviewable". He went on to state that [...] "as a matter of principle, there is no justification for drawing the line at jurisdictional error". In his opinion, any restrictions on judicial review require justification and, prima facie, such review <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> challenge the legality of decisions of public bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Although by {{the terms}} used in the Court's holdings, they were {{apparently}} limited to [...] "citizen-detainees," [...] the last paragraph of section III, D of the O'Connor plurality (four justices: O'Connor, Rehnquist, Kennedy, and Breyer) relies on the Geneva Convention and states that habeas corpus <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> an [...] "alleged enemy combatant." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, Vilsack joined three midwest {{governors}} in {{a campaign}} to defend {{the use of a}} processed beef product made from trimmings left after beef carcasses are butchered, dubbed [...] "pink slime" [...] by its critics. He said that [...] "it's safe, it contains less fat and historically it's been less expensive" [...] and that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> consumers and school districts that want to buy it.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{we do not}} consider, {{despite the}} {{repeated}} assertions of the KGB and the USSR court instances, that A Chronicle of Current Events is an illegal or libelous publication, we regard it as our duty to facilitate as wide a circulation for it as possible. [...] We believe {{it is essential that}} truthful information about violations of basic human rights in the Soviet Union <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> all who are interested in it.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the high}} {{importance}} of the caregiver burden {{with regard to the}} care giving process, it is necessary to develop interventions to reduce this burden and to examine their effectiveness. Successful interventions <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> as many caregivers as possible. [...] "The usefulness of an intervention is the multiplication of effectiveness and usage.” (Elmar Gräßel) It is therefore both necessary to develop interventions and to improve and to find ways to strengthen the awareness and use of these interventions.|$|E
2500|$|In this {{difficult}} situation, the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church received help {{and support from}} the Finnish Orthodox Church, especially from Archbishop Johannes (Rinne) of the Archdiocese of Karelia and All Finland and Auxiliary Bishop Ambrosius (Risto Jääskeläinen) of Joensuu. The Ecumenical Patriarchate decided that Archbishop Johannes and Bishop Ambrosius as well as pastor Heikki Huttunen from Espoo <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> give help in {{the reconstruction of the}} newly restored church. Archbishop Johannes would temporarily act as a deputy metropolitan (1996–1999) of the Estonian Autonomous Church.|$|E
