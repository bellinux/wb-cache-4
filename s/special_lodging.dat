5000|$|The new {{station was}} finally ready to open on 27 June 1859 {{and was named}} [...] "Bodmin Road". Because of its remote location, the station master was paid five pounds by the Post Office {{to carry out the}} duties of postmaster. He also {{received}} a <b>special</b> <b>lodging</b> allowance until a house could be provided for him two years later. A goods shed was built in 1860 at the east end of the station, behind the platform for trains to Plymouth and cattle pens were added the following year. A footbridge across the line was built by Mr Robartes in 1860 to enable visitors to reach Lanhydrock more easily. This was later replaced by a passage beneath the tracks. This path is still used by those visitors to this National Trust property who arrive by train.|$|E
40|$|The {{world has}} {{witnessed}} substantial growth of China's hotel industry {{for over three}} decades. Since the birth of China's modern hotel industry in the late 1970 s, state-owned hotels have dominated the industry throughout the country {{in terms of the}} total number of rooms. As state-owned assets, the evolution of this <b>special</b> <b>lodging</b> sector has been significantly affected by Chinese government policies. This study first provides a comprehensive review of how government policies have affected China's state-owned hotels in the past and then discusses the most recent hotel-related government policies and their impact on a number of critical strategic issues, including ownership shifting, growth of domestic groups and brand development. The future development trends of China's state-owned hotels are also provided. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|E
40|$|Ion {{nitriding}} and ion carburising by plasma discharges {{are promising}} techniques {{in order to}} modify the surface of austenitic steels. Plasma treatments improve mechanical properties, e. g., hardness and wear resistance. Indeed, these techniques do not change the natural austenitic properties, like corrosion resistance. Hidden parameters of the system are very important {{in order to do}} a good characterization and a good experimental reproducibility. In this work a new cathode design has been done and it is placed in a new plasma reactor. The electric field edge effect has been discarded in the austenitic samples thanks to a <b>special</b> <b>lodging</b> procedure. After an experimental validation of this new set-up, a numerical simulation has been carried out. Temperature distribution has been analyzed using the cathode-molecular nitrogen collision method. Under these assumptions, reactor cooling is a key issue. This simulation has been done after the resolution of the Laplace equation with the parallel Jacobi method. Finally, using optical emission spectroscopy it has been verified that the heat transfer mechanism is the conduction and the experimental data have been compared with simulation data.

50|$|On Saturday 21 August 1535, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn visited Nicholas Poyntz at Acton Court, Iron Acton, Gloucestershire. Poyntz {{had built}} a <b>special</b> new <b>lodging</b> for his royal guests which still survives.

These state rooms connected to the older house by a covered walkway called a 'pentice.' Archaeological excavations found fragments of precious Venetian glass and maiolica which Nicholas probably bought for the visit. The evidence of lengthy preparations by Nicholas at Acton shows that Henry's progress in the west of England was planned in advance.|$|R

5000|$|In January 2007, UniCredit Group {{announced}} {{its intention to}} carry out a sqeeze-out at Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank. The price in this respect was established at €38.26 per share. [...] A decision on the squeeze-out was taken at the Shareholders Meeting on 26 June 2007. Following the Shareholders Meeting, over 100 actions to set aside a shareholders' resolution by free HVB shareholders took place; this represents a record for Germany. At the Shareholders Meeting, the Bonn-based lawyer Thomas Heidel was selected as special representative pursuant to § 147 German Stock Corporation Act, who, amongst other things, was to look into possible claims for damages in conjunction with the sale of the Bank Austria shareholding UniCredit, for its part, lodged an action to set aside a shareholders' resolution in turn. During the subsequent period, the <b>special</b> representative <b>lodged</b> complaints that his work was being obstructed. On 15 September 2008, the squeeze-out adopted by the Shareholders Meeting in June 2007 was entered into the commercial register at the Register of Companies in Munich. As such, all the shares of Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank were transferred to UniCredit by force of law. The listing of shares on the stock exchanges was discontinued at short notice.|$|R
6000|$|Concluding Remarks.--The males {{from the}} absence of a mouth (and no doubt of a stomach), must {{necessarily}} be short-lived, and, I suppose, are periodically replaced by fresh males.[57] In one instance, the remnants of the two great compound eyes of the larva, could be seen {{at the end of the}} pouch, opposite the orifice. The larvæ, I conclude, crawl in at the orifice, one side of which is formed, as we have seen, of yielding membrane, and scratch out the dead exuviæ of the former occupant: certainly, the males are less firmly attached to their pouches, though some small quantity of cement is excreted, than are other Cirripedes to the objects to which they are attached. The small size of the female, and her valves not being thickly edged with chitine, accounts for the males having pouches specially formed for them, instead of being, as in S. vulgare, laterally imbedded in the chitine-border of the scuta. In hereafter weighing the evidence on the nature of the parasites in Ibla and in Scalpellum, the fact of the valves of the supposed female being here modified for the <b>special</b> purpose of <b>lodging</b> the males, will be seen to be important. If we imagine the male parasites to be extraneous animals, and that by adhering to the sack of the Scalpellum, they injure the corium and thus prevent the growth of the shell over an area exactly corresponding to their own size, and so form for themselves cavities; yet what can be said regarding the preparatory furrows? surely these narrow lines cannot have been produced by the pressure of the much broader parasites. Must we not see in the furrows, the first marking out, if such an expression may be used, of the habitation for the male, which has to be specially formed by the independent laws of growth of the female? ...|$|R
