The 19 moons that are large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity are listed in bold. The seven largest moons, which are larger than any of the known dwarf planets, are listed in bold and italic. <b>Sidereal</b> <b>period</b> differs from semi-major axis because it depends on the mass of the primary as well as the satellite's distance from it.|$|E
5|$|The Moon makes a {{complete}} orbit around Earth {{with respect to}} the fixed stars about once every 27.3days (its <b>sidereal</b> <b>period).</b> However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5days (its synodic period). Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{inclination}} of the moon's orbit, {{the moon is}} above the horizon at the North and South Pole for almost two weeks every month, even though the sun is below the horizon for six months at a time. The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is quite close to the <b>sidereal</b> <b>period,</b> or 27.3 days. When the sun is the furthest below the horizon (winter solstice), the moon will be full when it is at its highest point.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} periods {{associated with the}} lunar orbit. The sidereal month is {{the time it takes}} to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year, but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the <b>sidereal</b> <b>period</b> because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{if another}} similar planet orbited at 0.71AU from Alpha CentauriB (so {{that in turn}} Alpha Centauri B {{appeared}} as bright as the Sun seen from the Earth), this hypothetical planet would receive slightly more light from the more luminous Alpha CentauriA, which would shine 4.7 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer than Alpha CentauriB (or the Sun seen from the Earth), ranging in apparent magnitude between −19.4 (dimmest) and −22.1 (brightest). Thus Alpha CentauriA would appear between 830 and 70 times dimmer than the Sun but some 580 to 6900 times brighter than the full Moon. During the orbital period of such a planet of 0.6(3) a, an observer on the planet would see this intensely bright companion star circle the sky just as humans see with the Solar System's planets. Furthermore, Alpha CentauriA's <b>sidereal</b> <b>period</b> of approximately eighty years means that this star would move through the local ecliptic as slowly as Uranus with its eighty-four year period, but as the orbit of Alpha CentauriA is more elliptical, its apparent magnitude will be far more variable. Although intensely bright to the eye, the overall illumination would not significantly affect climate nor influence normal plant photosynthesis.|$|E
500|$|According {{to current}} definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any {{potential}} [...] "rogue planets" [...] are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun {{in the same}} direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its <b>sidereal</b> <b>period</b> or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.|$|E
50|$|Richard Christopher Carrington {{determined}} the solar rotation rate from low latitude sunspots in the 1850s {{and arrived at}} 25.38 days for the <b>sidereal</b> rotation <b>period.</b> <b>Sidereal</b> rotation is measured relative to the stars, but because the Earth is orbiting the Sun, we see this period as 27.2753 days.|$|R

2500|$|The {{orbital motion}} of Phobos has been intensively studied, making it [...] "the best studied natural {{satellite}} in the Solar System" [...] {{in terms of}} orbits completed. [...] Its close orbit around Mars produces some unusual effects. With an altitude of , Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. Therefore, {{from the point of}} view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an equatorial orbit, it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4°. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14° wide; at zenith it is 0.20°, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. By comparison, the Sun has an apparent size of about 0.35° in the Martian sky. Phobos's phases, inasmuch as they can be observed from Mars, take 0.3191 days (Phobos's synodic period) to run their course, a mere 13 seconds longer than Phobos's <b>sidereal</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{slightly}} longer [...] "true" [...] <b>sidereal</b> <b>period</b> {{is called a}} stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

50|$|For {{objects in}} the Solar System, this is often {{referred}} to as the <b>sidereal</b> <b>period,</b> determined by a 360° revolution of one celestial body around another, e.g. the Earth orbiting the Sun. The name sidereal is added as it implies that the object returns to the same position relative to the fixed stars projected in the sky. When describing orbits of binary stars, the orbital period is usually referred to as just the period. For example, Jupiter has a <b>sidereal</b> <b>period</b> of 11.86 years while the main binary star Alpha Centauri AB has a period of about 79.91 years.|$|E
50|$|A {{planetary}} mnemonic {{refers to}} a phrase used to remember the planets and dwarf planets of the Solar System, with the order of words corresponding to increasing <b>sidereal</b> <b>periods</b> of the bodies. One simple visual mnemonic is to hold out both hands side-by-side with fingers spread and thumbs in the same direction, with the fingers of one hand representing the terrestrial planets, and the other hand the gas giants. The first thumb represents the Sun and asteroid belt, including Ceres, and the second thumb represents the asteroid belt and trans-Neptunian objects, including Pluto.|$|R
50|$|Published in 2016, two {{additional}} lightcurves {{were derived from}} modeled photometric data using various sources.

40|$|In the Solar system, a quasi-satellite is {{an object}} that follows a heliocentric path with an orbital period that matches almost exactly {{with that of a}} host body (planetary or not). The {{trajectory}} is of such nature that, without being gravitationally attached, the value of the angular separation between host and quasi-satellite as seen from the Sun remains confined within relatively narrow limits for time-spans that exceed the length of the host's <b>sidereal</b> orbital <b>period.</b> Here, we show that under these conditions, a quasi-satellite traces an analemma in the sky as observed from the host {{in a manner similar to}} that found for geosynchronous orbits. The analemmatic curve (figure-eight-, teardrop-, ellipse-shaped) results from the interplay between the tilt of the rotational axis of the host and the properties of the orbit of the quasi-satellite. The analemma criterion can be applied to identify true quasi-satellite dynamical behaviour using observational or synthetic astrometry and it is tested for several well-documented quasi-satellites. For the particular case of 15810 (1994 JR 1), a putative accidental quasi-satellite of dwarf planet Pluto, we show explicitly that this object describes a complex analemmatic curve for several Plutonian <b>sidereal</b> <b>periods,</b> confirming its transient quasi-satellite status.

50|$|For example, Venus's year (<b>sidereal</b> <b>period)</b> is 225 days, and Earth's is 365 days. Thus Venus's synodic period, {{which gives}} the time between two {{subsequent}} eastern (or western) greatest elongations, is 584 days.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{resonance}} {{structure of the}} planets {{in the solar system}} yields resonance periods of 11. 08 and 180 years. The 11. 08 year period is due to resonance of the <b>sidereal</b> <b>periods</b> of the three inner planets. The 180 -year period is due to synodic resonances of the four major planets. These periods are also observed in the sunspot time series. The 11 -year sunspot cycles from 1 to 19 are separated into categories of positive and negative cycles, Mode 1 and Mode 2 cycles, and typical and anomalous cycles. Each category has a characteristic shape, magnitude, or duration, so that statistical prediction techniques are improved when a cycle can be classified in a given category. These categories provide evidence for bistable modes of solar oscillation. The next minimum is expected in 1977 and the next maximum in 1981 or later.

40|$|Here {{we report}} in depth reanalysis {{of a paper}} by Vats et al. (2001) [Astrophys. J. 548, L 87] based on the {{measurements}} of differential rotation with altitude {{as a function of}} observing frequencies (as lower and higher frequencies indicate higher and lower heights, respectively) in the solar corona. The radial differential rotation of the solar corona is estimated from daily measurements of the disc-integrated solar radio flux at 11 frequencies: (275, 405, 670, 810, 925, 1080, 1215, 1350, 1620, 1755 MHz and 2800 MHz). We use the same data as were used in Vats et al. (2001), but instead of the 12 th maxima of autocorrelograms used there, we use the 1 st secondary maxima to derive the synodic rotation period. We estimate synodic rotation by Gaussian fit of the 1 st secondary maxima. Vats et al. (2001) reported that the <b>sidereal</b> rotation <b>period</b> increases with increasing frequency. The variation found by them was from 23. 6 to 24. 15 days in this frequency range with a difference of only 0. 55 days. The present study finds that <b>sidereal</b> rotation <b>period</b> increases with decreasing frequency. The variation range is from 24. 4 to 22. 5 days and difference is about three times larger (1. 9 days). However, at 925 MHz both studies give similar rotation period. In Vats et al. (2001) the Pearson factor with trend line was 0. 86 whereas present analysis obtained a ~ 0. 97 Pearson factor with the trend line. Our study shows that the solar corona rotates slower at higher altitudes, which is in contradiction to the findings reported in Vats et al. (2001).

5|$|After Herschel {{discovered}} Titania and Oberon on January 11, 1787, he subsequently {{believed that}} he had observed four other moons: two on January 18 and February 9, 1790, and two more on February 28 and March 26, 1794. It was thus believed for many decades thereafter that Uranus had a system of six satellites, though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer. Lassell's observations of 1851, in which he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, however, failed to support Herschel's observations; Ariel and Umbriel, which Herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any satellites beside Titania and Oberon, did not correspond to any of Herschel's four additional satellites in orbital characteristics. Herschel's four spurious satellites were thought to have <b>sidereal</b> <b>periods</b> of 5.89 days (interior to Titania), 10.96 days (between Titania and Oberon), 38.08 days, and 107.69 days (exterior to Oberon).

We find evidence for statistically significant modulations with the solar diurnal and the <b>sidereal</b> <b>periods.</b> The amplitudes of these modulations are < 0. 1 %, and are at the limit of the detector statistics. The pseudo-sidereal modulation is not statistically significant.

The sidereal modulation is in addition to the expected Compton-Getting modulation due to solar system motion relative to the Local Standard of Rest; it represents motion of the solar system with respect to the galactic cosmic rays toward the Perseus spiral arm.

50|$|In {{the case}} of a planet's moon, the synodic period usually means the Sun-synodic period, namely, the time it takes the moon to {{complete}} its illumination phases, completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planet's surface. The Earth's motion does not determine this value for other planets because an Earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question.

The synodic period is longer because the Sun must rotate for a <b>sidereal</b> <b>period</b> plus an extra amount due to the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun. Note that astrophysical literature does not typically use the equatorial rotation period, but instead often uses the definition of a Carrington rotation: a synodic rotation period of 27.2753 days (or a <b>sidereal</b> <b>period</b> of 25.38 days). This chosen period roughly corresponds to rotation at a latitude of 26 deg, which is consistent with the typical latitude of sunspots and corresponding periodic solar activity.
