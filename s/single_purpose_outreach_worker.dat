40|$|<b>Outreach</b> <b>workers</b> (OW) {{have been}} the focal point for the success and failure of the Needle Syringe Exchange Program (NSEP program) in Malaysia. If the <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> remain to be the {{backbone}} of the NSEP program, it is necessary to know how well they can cope with the work and {{what are some of the}} challenges they have faced in delivering services to the PWID. We also need to assure the quality of services that the <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> have provided to their clients. This study focuses on factors influencing the quality of services provided to the PWID by the <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> through the NSEP. Qualitative research was employed in order to explore a very wide expression of information that can be obtained from the stakeholders or informants, particularly from <b>outreach</b> <b>workers,</b> PWID and organizations that are providing NSEP. Stakeholders or informants for this study consist of <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> who were currently involved in the three sites of NSEP in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in Penang, Perak, and Kedah.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite having high smoking rates, {{there have}} been few {{tailored}} cessation programmes for male Bangladeshi and Pakistani smokers in the UK. We report on a qualitative evaluation of a community-based, <b>outreach</b> <b>worker</b> delivered, intervention that aimed to increase uptake of NHS smoking cessation services and tailor services {{to meet the needs of}} Bangladeshi and Pakistani men. Methods This was a longitudinal, qualitative study, nested within a phase II cluster randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention. We explored the perspectives and experiences of five <b>outreach</b> <b>workers,</b> two stop smoking service managers and a specialist stop smoking advisor. Data were collected through focus group discussions, weekly diaries, observations of management meetings, shadowing of <b>outreach</b> <b>workers,</b> and one-to-one interviews with <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> and their managers. Analysis was undertaken using a modified Framework approach. Results <b>Outreach</b> <b>workers</b> promoted cessation services by word of mouth on the streets, in health service premises, in local businesses and at a wide range of community events. They emphasised the reasons for cessation, especially health effects, financial implications, and the impact of smoking on the family. Many smokers agreed to be referred to cessation services, but few attended, this in part being explained by concerns about the relative inflexibility of existing service provision. Although <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> successfully expanded service reach, they faced the challenges of perceived lack of awareness of the health risks associated with smoking in older smokers and apathy in younger smokers. These were compounded by perceptions of "lip service" being given to their role by community organisations and tensions both amongst the <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> and with the wider management team. Conclusions <b>Outreach</b> <b>workers</b> expanded reach of the service through taking it to diverse locations of relevance to Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The optimum method of outreach to retain and treat Bangladeshi and Pakistani smokers effectively in cessation programmes needs further development. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives  Keep Well, an anticipatory care {{programme}} which commenced in Scotland in 2006, aims {{to reduce}} health inequalities through holistic health checks {{in primary care}} in deprived communities. A new, non-clinical <b>outreach</b> <b>worker</b> role was created to provide support and signposting to Keep Well patients following their health check. There is currently little evidence regarding how the role is perceived. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand how staff and patients view the Keep Well <b>outreach</b> <b>worker</b> role.   Study design  A qualitative interview-based study was carried out between July and October 2010.   Methods  One-to-one interviews were conducted with 12 Keep Well staff and four patients. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed using a thematic analysis approach.   Results  The <b>outreach</b> <b>worker</b> role was viewed positively, particularly in terms of partnership working with practices and local services, and the benefits of support to patients. Referring patients to <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> reduced pressure on staff, who were able to spend more time on patients' physical health rather than mental health or lifestyle support. Support from an <b>outreach</b> <b>worker</b> enabled patients to make changes to their life and their health. Concerns were about staff turnover, poor referral rates, set-up of the project and misinterpretation of the role.   Conclusion  Patients and staff perceive benefits from the <b>outreach</b> <b>worker</b> role in providing motivational support to patients from deprived areas...|$|R

40|$|A {{special program}} of {{outreach}} services was implemented to assist a poverty population to appropriately use health {{services in the}} Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program. A {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of outreach workers' intervention on the use of preventive services by this population. Intially, families were divided into two groups, one with and one without <b>outreach</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Outreach</b> <b>workers</b> (neighborhood health coordinators) were trained in prevention and health education. They were then assigned to specific subgroups of the poverty population to teach the importance of preventive services and to motivate persons to use these services. This paper focuses on the effect of outreach workers' services on the use of selected preventive care services (immunizations and tine test) by preschool children from poverty families. Preschool children in families with coordinator services had higher use rates for preventive care. The sub-group for which <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> were specially trained to focus on preventive procedures for the pre-school group had markedly higher use rates for preventive care. The findings suggest that special intervention programs, using indigenous and nonprofessional <b>outreach</b> <b>workers,</b> can increase preventive service utilization by poverty groups...|$|R

This study identified the benefits and challenges of outreach provision as identified by a group of volunteer <b>outreach</b> <b>workers.</b> One on one semi-structured interviews were carried out with twelve members trained as peer outreach volunteers. Interview transcripts were analysed using a consensual qualitative research approach. <b>Outreach</b> <b>workers</b> typically experienced peer outreach as a positive experience both for themselves and for the recipients.

Nonetheless, peer <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> did encounter difficulties and sometimes felt need for more training and support. The findings have implications for the development of future peer outreach programs. There is scope for enhanced training and/or supervision and a need for further research to investigate ways to optimise peer outreach. ...|$|R

40|$|Poster PresentationPoster Session-This poster {{presentation}} summarizes a Participatory Action Research (PAR) project that involved helping 50 students {{identified as being}} academically at-risk in each of 12 middle schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This PAR project emerged from Milwaukee’s 21 st Century Community Learning Centers (CLC) Initiative, which provides after school programs for students, families and community residents. The CLC Initiative has documented that after school programs help students academically. The challenge is to identify, recruit and retain students in after school programs that {{are at risk of}} failing academically. This is a particular challenge for middle school students. Accordingly, {{at the beginning of the}} 2001 - 2002 academic year, a group of 12 middle school principals with CLC programs were asked to select 50 students who were at risk academically. Parents, retired teachers, and local community residents were recruited to fill positions as half-time <b>outreach</b> <b>workers.</b> The <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> were charged with building and sustaining personal relationships with these students, their families and their teachers. The task was simple but challenging: Create a personal relationship that is based on trust, support and improved communication between the students, parents, and teachers. It was assumed that through this supportive relationship students would improve academically in terms of grades, attendance and overall attitude toward school. The focus of this {{poster presentation}} is on the activities and learning that occurred among the <b>Outreach</b> <b>Workers</b> as they implemented the project. The display highlights the array of practices that the <b>outreach</b> <b>workers</b> implemented, the challenges and barriers they encountered, the success they enjoyed, and the results they produced in student academic achievement. Representatives from the project are available to discuss the learning that occurred not only among the select 50 students but more importantly, from an adult education perspective, among the teachers, administrators, parents and community volunteers who work with at-risk students. The implementation of the project evolved over three phases: Phase I involved gaining entry into the schools and establishing connections between the <b>outreach</b> <b>workers,</b> teachers, principals and the CLC after school programs. This phase also included identifying the pool of students who were at risk of academic failure and recruiting students into the program. Phase II involved establishing connections with the students and building a relationship of support and trust between the students and the <b>outreach</b> <b>worker.</b> This phase also included building similar relationships of trust and support between the <b>outreach</b> <b>workers,</b> teachers and the parents of the select 50 students. Phase III involved the on-going work with the select 50 students with emphasis on helping them remain focused on their studies as well as maintaining the web of support among the teachers, parents, CLC staff and other caring adults...|$|R
