25|$|A senior {{sergeant}} {{oversees the}} sergeants and traditionally performs more administrative work and middle management duties, for example coordination of policing operations, or specialist work other than active patrol duties. General-duties senior sergeants are traditionally {{in charge of}} most police stations or can be a <b>sub-charge</b> (or second in charge) of larger (usually 24-hour) police stations. In each division, or group of divisions on a night shift, a senior sergeant is the division supervisor for a shift and is responsible for managing and overseeing incidents in their area. Detective senior sergeants are usually the officer in charge of crime investigation units.|$|E
50|$|According to a July 9, 1992 {{newsletter}} {{from the}} Electronic Frontier Foundation, the defendants faced a maximum term of 50 {{years in prison}} and fines of $2.5 million if found guilty on all counts. Despite the fact that Abene was a minor at the time the crimes were allegedly committed, was only involved in {{a small fraction of the}} <b>sub-charges,</b> and often in a passive way, a plea arrangement resulted in by far the harshest sentence: 12 months imprisonment, three years probation and 600 hours of community service.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{considers a}} platform target {{subjected to a}} normal impact of explosive products generated by detonating a bare charge in space. It is suggested that the loading impulse may be approximated by the total momentum of {{that portion of the}} fluid which impacts at the target. Assuming impulsive dynamic response, and assuming that the ensuing damage is proportional to the kinetic energy imparted to the structure by the blast, we get a particularly simple law; Damage similar to W to the 2 nd power/R to the 4 th power (W is charge mass, R is range). This model is an idealization of a solar panel (or antenna) extended in a paddle-like fashion from a relatively rigid and massive core structure. It is also shown that this law implies that no advantage can be realized by re-arranging the mass of a single bare charge in a cluster configuration of smaller <b>sub-charges,</b> which would be dispersed and detonated via an idealized 'isotropic' scheme.
