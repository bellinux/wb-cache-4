25|$|There were {{precursors}} to the triumphal arch {{within the}} Roman world; in Italy, the Etruscans used elaborately decorated single bay arches as gates or portals to their cities. Surviving examples of Etruscan arches {{can still be}} seen at Perugia and Volterra. The two key elements of the triumphal arch – a round-topped arch and a square entablature – had long been in use as separate architectural elements in ancient Greece. The Greeks made comparatively little or no use of the arch, confining it to structures such as tombs and sewers that were under external pressure, but made extensive use of entablatures in their temples. Entablatures were {{an essential part of}} the <b>structural</b> <b>fabric</b> of such buildings, as they were used to hold up the roofs. The great innovation of the Romans was to combine a round arch and a square entablature in a single free-standing structure. The columns became purely decorative elements on the outer face of arch, while the entablature, liberated from its role as a building support, became the frame for the civic and religious messages that the arch builders wished to convey.|$|E

The faulting and thrusting disrupted not only the Mesozoic and Paleogene sedimentary cover, but also large parts of the Variscan basement.

The Southern Granulite Terrane of India is a {{generally}} well-exposed, exhumed, Gondwana-forming orogen that preserves {{a record of the}} tectonic evolution of the eastern margin of the East African Orogen during the Ediacaran-Cambrian (circa 600 – 500 Ma) as central Gondwana formed. The deformation associated with the closure of the Mozambique Ocean and collision of the Indian and East African/Madagascan cratonic domains is believed to have taken place along the southern margin of the Salem Block (the Palghat-Cauvery Shear System, PCSS) in the Southern Granulite Terrane. Investigation of the <b>structural</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the geochronology of the high-grade shear zones within the PCSS system shows that the Moyar-Salem-Attur shear zone {{to the north of the}} PCSS system is early Paleoproterozoic in age and associated with dextral strike-slip motion, while the Cauvery shear zone (CSZ) to the south of the PCSS system can be loosely constrained to circa 740 – 550 Ma and is associated with dip-slip dextral transpression and north side-up motion. To the south of the proposed suture zone (the Cauvery shear zone), the <b>structural</b> <b>fabrics</b> of the Northern Madurai Block suggest four deformational events (D 1 –D 4), some of which are likely to be contemporaneous. The timing of high pressure-ultrahigh temperature metamorphism and deformation (D 1 –D 3) in the Madurai Block (here interpreted as the southern extension of Azania) is constrained to circa 550 – 500 Ma and interpreted as representing collisional orogeny and subsequent orogenic collapse of the eastern margin of the East African Orogen. The disparity in the nature of the <b>structural</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the timing of the deformation in the Salem and the Madurai Blocks suggest that the two experienced distinct tectonothermal events prior to their amalgamation along the Cauvery shear zone during the Ediacaran/Cambrian.

We have collected data on the distribution and orientation of structural features in all DSDP cores recovered to date in forearcs, and have carried out topical studies on selected fabrics. Graphic struc-tural logs, compiled from a consistently acquired data set, show the distribution of structural features margin by margin, and allow comparisons to be drawn between margins. Most sediments cored in forearcs are in situ slope deposits, and bedding dips constitute a fundamental strain indicator.

The only constitutive law used in practice describes orthotropic linear-elastic stress-strain relations in the two principal directions. The elastic constants are “tensile modulus” and “Poisson's ratio”. In contrast, the actual stiffness behaviour of architectural textiles is nonlinear and nonelastic. Moreover, the potential high orthotropy of textiles is often not sufficiently covered by the test and evaluation methods available. This paper presents principles for refined biaxial test procedures that fit to the requirements of <b>structural</b> <b>fabrics.</b> As a result, sets of elastic constants for design purposes can be determined which ensure a very good correlation between measured and calculated strain on a specific stress level for all common PVC-coated polyester fabrics and PTFE-coated glass fibre fabrics.

The Sarnu-Dandali alkaline complex, near the northwestern limit of the Deccan Traps continental flood basalt province, contains mafic to felsic alkaline volcano-plutonic rocks and carbonatites. The complex is situated near {{the northern end of}} the 600  km long, NNW–SSE-trending Barmer-Cambay rift. Mafic enclave swarms in the syenites suggest synplutonic mafic dykes injected into a largely liquid felsic magma chamber. Later coherent dykes in the complex, of all compositions and sizes, dominantly strike NNW–SSE, parallel to the Barmer-Cambay rift. The rift formed during two distinct episodes of extension, NW–SE in the early Cretaceous and NE–SW in the late Cretaceous. Control of the southern Indian Dharwar <b>structural</b> <b>fabric</b> on the rift trend, as speculated previously, is untenable, whereas the regional Precambrian basement trends (Aravalli and Malani) run NE–SW and NNE–SSW.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to better understand the relation between plate kinematics and <b>structural</b> <b>fabrics</b> at the Paleogene convergent plate margin of SW Japan. Relating plate kinematics to ancient deformation fabrics at convergent margins has historically been difficult for two reasons. First, much of the record of convergence is subducted and second, the perception that deformation partitioning often renders <b>structural</b> <b>fabrics</b> too complex to be related to past plate motions has deterred detailed investigation. The research presented here exploits the Paleogene Shimanto belt of SW Japan because the deformation history of these rocks is relatively straightforward and evidence for deformation partitioning is limited. ^ Chapter one focuses on the role of diagenesis in controlling the deformation of poorly consolidated sediments which are commonly found at active convergent margins. Examination of disaggregated sandstone blocks in an ancient mud diapir suggests that redox potential gradients drove diagenetic reactions which contributed to the development of overpressures in the blocks. The envisioned process provides a mechanism for the maintenance of elevated pore-fluid pressures in mud diapirs and suggests a role for syn-deformation diagenesis in controlling deformation during the formation of tectonic melange. ^ Chapter two presents relative age relations, kinematic data and pressure-temperature constraints for outcrop-scale brittle faults in Paleogene strata. Cross-cutting relations reveal populations of early- and late-stage faults, and kinematic analyses indicate that these two populations reflect different kinematic regimes {{in the history of the}} accretionary prism. Microthermometric and microchemical analyses of fluid inclusions in syn-kinematic quartz suggest that late-stage faulting was accompanied by elevated geothermal gradients, which suggests the subduction of relatively young crust. ^ Chapter three reexamines plate configurations and kinematics in the west-central Pacific basin during the Paleogene. The kinematic data presented in Chapter two provide new constraints on relative motion between the Kula and Eurasia plates. The results of this reexamination have implications for the formation of the Philippine Sea plate, and help account for (1) thermal and age-lithology data from SW Japan that suggest the subduction of young crust and (2) evidence for a transition from sinistral to dextral obliquity along the Tertiary SW Japan margin. ...|$|R
