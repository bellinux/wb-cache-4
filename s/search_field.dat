40|$|Data {{contained}} in a 1982 paper were analyzed in terms of relevance odds of common items retrieved by searching any two content-bearing <b>search</b> <b>fields.</b> While the 1982 study compared the relative retrieval performance of 7 <b>search</b> <b>fields,</b> the present study shows that duplicate documents retrieved {{by the use of}} terms from any two of the fields would have higher odds of being judged relevant than those retrieved by only one of the fields. Sixty-three relevance odds were computed using the log cross product technique. The highest relevance odds were associated with common items retrieved from assigned descriptors and from truncated free-text terms from either the title or abstract fields; their relevance odds were 19 to 2 in favor of overlaps. Overlap retrieval could be considered a strategy for high precision searching...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the search behaviour of users. Undergraduate and postgraduate users from the Department of Archives and Library Sciences, Ionian University, were invited to indicate the way they formulate and reformulate their queries. Students were asked to formulate queries and complete a questionnaire. Responses from the questionnaires and data collected from log files provided us with valuable information concerning the number of terms users type in the <b>searching</b> <b>field,</b> the type of failed queries users make and whether users reformulate their queries by using terms provided in the retrieved results. Results revealed that users mainly type in the <b>searching</b> <b>field</b> one term per query. Furthermore typographical errors, and specifically the substitution of a character with another, appeared to be the main reason for failed queries. Additionally, the vast majority of respondents declared that they used a term from the retrieved results. And finally, it is worth mentioning that users have equal chances to direct their queries in either a more specified or generalised term, whereas their choice of submitting parallel terms outweighed all other strategies...|$|R

50|$|Information seeking {{behavior}} {{refers to}} the way people search for and utilize information. The term was coined by Thomas D.

However, there is increasing work in the information <b>searching</b> <b>field</b> that is relating behaviors to underlying needs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Life science {{researchers}} want biological {{information in}} their interest to become available to them as soon as possible. A monitoring system is a solution that relieves biologists from periodic exploration of databases. In particular, it allows them to express their interest in certain data by means of queries/constraints; they are then notified when new data arrives satisfying these queries/constraints. We describe a sequence monitoring system XSeqM where users can combine meta data queries on sequence records with constraints on an alignment against a given source sequence. The system is an XML-based solution where constraints are specified through <b>search</b> <b>fields</b> in a user-friendly web interface and which are then translated to corresponding XPath-expressions. The system is easily extensible as addition of new databases to the system then only amounts to the specification of new mappings from <b>search</b> <b>fields</b> to XPath-expressions. To protect private source sequences obtained in labs, it is imperative that researchers do not have to upload their sequences to a general untrusted system, but that they can run XSeqM locally. To keep the system light-weight, we therefore introduce an optimization technique based on query containment {{to reduce the number of}} XPath-evaluations which constitutes the bottleneck of the system. We experimentally validate this technique and show that it can drastically improve the running time. ...|$|R
