50|$|Before {{attending}} University College, London Arber {{spent the}} summer of 1897 working with Ethel Sargant in her private laboratory in Reigate, where Sargant instructed her on microtechniques used to prepare plant <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> Arber returned to work in Sargents laboratory at least once during the summer holidays while she was studying at University College London. Sargant employed Arber between 1902 and 1903 as a research assistant working on seedling structures, during which time in 1903 she published her first paper Notes on the anatomy of Macrozamia heteromera in Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Whilst at University College London Arber conducted research on the gymnosperm group of plants, producing several papers on their morphology and anatomy. The study and philosophy of plant morphology would become the central focus of her later work.|$|R
40|$|The use of lyphogel to {{concentrate}} {{the number of}} virus particles in <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> electron <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> was studied in parallel with ultracentrifugation. One hundred faecal and urine samples were compared. Both methods had a similar sensitivity. Lyphogel was economical, simple, and rapid in use; in contrast to ultracentrifugation, it required relatively little material. The procedure could be done within a safety cabinet, and virus particles were morphologically undamaged by the process...|$|R

40|$|Optical Tomography (OT) {{is a form}} of {{computed}} tomography using a digital model of the volume of an object by reconstructing an image of the light transmitted and scattered by the object. OT is used mostly as a form of research in medical imaging. OT depends on the reference object being at least partially light transmitting or translucent, so it works best on soft tissue, such as breast and brain tissue. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a new technology for performing high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. OCT is similar to ultrasound imaging, but uses different types of light instead of sound. OCT can provide cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micrometer scale and in real time. OCT serves as a kind of optical biopsy and is used as a medical diagnostic imaging technology because, unlike conventional histopathology, it does not require the removal and processing of tissue <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> The study was carried out to see how the two types of optical imaging and the use of concepts and components used in the system. The light source is used to show different levels of penetration and resolution for both methods is used. The use of an interferometer in optical imaging applications is discussed along with examples of commonly used methods. The optical imaging method contributes significantly to the diversity of tomography systems...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an emerging}} technology for performing high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. OCT {{is analogous to}} ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound. OCT can provide cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale in situ and in real time. Using OCT in combination with catheters and endoscopes enables high-resolution intraluminal imaging of organ systems. OCT can function {{as a type of}} optical biopsy and is a powerful imaging technology for medical diagnostics because unlike conventional histopathology which requires removal of a tissue <b>specimen</b> and processing <b>for</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination,</b> OCT can provide images of tissue in situ and in real time. OCT can be used where standard excisional biopsy is hazardous or impossible, to reduce sampling errors associated with excisional biopsy, and to guide interventional procedures. In this paper, we review OCT technology and describe its potential biomedical and clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Prescreening {{of urine}} {{specimens}} by teststrips {{is a valuable}} procedure for reducing the work load of the urine analysis iaboratory: positive results for leukocytes, erythrocytes (haemoglobin), protein, and/or nitrite are widely used to select pathological <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> subsequent <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> By stand-ardization of the measurement conditions, mechanized teststrip reading is claimed to give more reproducible results than conventional techniques. To assess their ability to improve urine prescreening, {{especially with regard to}} the comparability of the results, the practical and analytical performance of three commercially available analysers (Rapimat ® II/T from Behringwerke AG, Urotron ® RL 9 from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, and Clinitek ® 200 from Ames/Bayer Diagnostic) was compared with visual reading. Analytical criteria were assessed using routine urine samples, while reproducibility was tested by repeated analysis of three different commercial control urines (Kova®Trol from Madaus). A mean imprecision between 3 % and 11. 9 % was found for the mechanized dipstick reading which was comparable to that found with visual examination (4. 5 % with Combur 9 -teststrips, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH). Due to the crude classification of the results, the different analysers äs well äs the visual technique gave quite different distributions for each of the semiquantitative parameters in the same urine samples. Even if statistical analysis was restricted to the frequency of positive results oniy, significant differences (% 2 -test, p < 0. 001 — 0. 05) between methods wer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. More {{and more}} breast lumpectomies are being {{performed}} due to mammographic screening, and both in situ and invasive breast carcinomas are being detected earlier and smaller in size. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the presence of incidental microscopic breast carcinoma in mammography-guided lumpectomy specimens. A prospective study was carried out by processing in surgical pathology approximately 9, 000 breast lumpectomy specimens during a 2. 5 -yr period so that the entire <b>specimens</b> were embedded <b>for</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> Excluded from the study were cases with grossly or microscopically identified carcinomas greater than 10 mm 2, and non-invasive carcinomas diagnosed in association with invasive carcinoma. Cases with multifocal carcinomas, prior diagnosis of breast cancer, or prior history of breast biopsy were also excluded. Carcinomas present in the same tissue blocks as the clinically suspected lesions such as palpable nodules, microcalcification, or other mammographic abnormalities were excluded as well. Fifty cases of incidental microscopic mammary carcinoma were found including 8 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC), 2 infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC), 21 intraductal carcinomas (DCIS), and 19 lobular carcinomas in situ (LCIS). All of the lesions were solitary, located in indistinct loosely arranged fibrous and adipose stromal tissues, and the majority of them were near or at the inked excisional margins. Physicians who care for patients with breast cancer should be aware of the existence of these minute breast carcinomas that are often near or at the surgical margins. The significance of these <b>microscopic</b> findings <b>for</b> therapeutic strategy and prognosis should be determined by long-term follow-up...|$|R

30|$|The {{stroke of}} the needles {{used in this}} study was 22 mm long. Therefore, non-tumorous tissues were often {{included}} when performing CNB of small lesions.
