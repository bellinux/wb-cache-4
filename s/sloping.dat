40|$|This {{research}} {{introduces the}} georisk and reliability design approach {{to predict the}} sustainability of development on or near mountainous terrains. A field study was conducted on fifty two <b>slopes</b> to identify the most frequent factor that trigger <b>slope</b> instability in sedimentary <b>slope</b> formation. The classification level of risk also identified in this study. Parameters such as <b>slope</b> geology, mode of <b>slope</b> failure, <b>slope</b> geometry, <b>slope</b> distress, rainfall, and drainage system and <b>slope</b> stabilization technique <b>slope</b> were studied. Further parametric study was carried out using SLOPE/W to determine the internal instability factor of <b>slope</b> failure. The results from <b>slopes</b> assessment show that the weathering Grade V and Grade VI become the most favorable georisk factor of <b>slope</b> instability that effect {{the reliability of the}} <b>slope.</b> While, for the reliability of <b>slope</b> design, <b>slope</b> height, <b>slope</b> angle and factor of safety become the main factor that contributed to low reliability of <b>slope.</b> In addition, further statistical analysis found that drainage structure contributed to major instability factor of <b>slope</b> stability.

40|$|Continental <b>slope</b> {{sedimentation}} is in generally {{driven by}} climate and the oceanographic setting along a margin. This work compares <b>slope</b> {{architecture of the}} glaciated Scotian <b>Slope</b> to the nonglaciated northern Argentine <b>slope.</b> On the Scotian <b>Slope,</b> a new seismic stratigraphy was used to identify variations in patterns of <b>slope</b> sedimentation. The Early Quaternary is characterized by few mass transport deposits (MTDs) and deposition occurs at the lower <b>slope,</b> whereas towards the younger glaciated sequence, much larger MTDs characterize <b>slope</b> sedimentation. On the Argentine <b>Slope,</b> sedimentation patterns are driven by along- and downslope processes. At times of large Pleistocene storm events at the shelf break, sediment may be supplied to the <b>slope</b> from the shelf. By comparing these <b>slope</b> systems, general ideas of <b>slope</b> deposition were developed.

40|$|Failure {{mechanisms}} in large scale open pit <b>slopes</b> {{are more complex}} than could be considered through conventional <b>slope</b> design methods. Pit <b>slope</b> behaviour must be predicted accurately, because for very deep open pits, a small change of <b>slope</b> angle can have serious technical and economic consequences. Failure of hard rock <b>slopes</b> often involves both failure along naturally existing weakness planes and failure of intact rock. Without an advanced understanding of combined rock <b>slope</b> failure mechanisms, the validity of commonly applied methods of large scale <b>slope</b> analysis is questionable. The problem was investigated {{by means of a}} toolbox approach, in which a wide range of <b>slope</b> stability analysis methods were used and compared to address specific problems arising during <b>slope</b> design optimisation of the Cadia Hill Open Pit, NSW. In particular, numerical modelling is an advanced tool to obtain insight into potential failure mechanisms and to assist the <b>slope</b> design process. The distinct element method was employed to simulate complex rock <b>slope</b> failure, including fracture extension, progressive step-path failure and brittle failure propagation, which were previously often considered unimportant or too difficult to model. A new, failure-scale-dependent concept for the categorisation of <b>slope</b> failures with six categories ranging from 0 (stable) to 5 (overall <b>slope</b> failure) was suggested to assist risk-based <b>slope</b> design. Parametric <b>slope</b> modelling was conducted to determine the interrelationship between proposed categories and critical slope/discontinuity parameters. Initiation and progression of complex <b>slope</b> failure were simulated and described, which resulted in an advanced understanding of combined <b>slope</b> failure mechanisms and the important role of rock bridges in large scale <b>slope</b> stability. A graphical presentation of the suggested <b>slope</b> failure categories demonstrated their interrelationship to varied slope/discontinuity parameters. Although large scale <b>slope</b> analyses will always involve data-limited systems, this investigation shows that comprehensive, conceptual modelling of <b>slope</b> failure mechanisms can deliver a significantly improved insight into <b>slope</b> behaviour, so that associated <b>slope</b> failure risks can be judged with more confidence. The consideration of combined <b>slope</b> failure {{mechanisms in}} the analysis of large scale open pit <b>slopes</b> is essential if <b>slope</b> behaviour is to be realistically modelled...|$|R
40|$|Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer a {{cost-effective}} way {{to analyze and}} inventory land and environmental resources. There are many attributes that can be displayed and analyzed in GIS. One of these attributes is <b>slope,</b> which can be calculated from a digital elevation model (DEM). <b>Slope</b> {{is an important factor}} in a variety of models used in land analysis as well as land use and management. There are several different mathematical computational algorithms used to calculate <b>slope</b> within a GIS. Eight different <b>slope</b> calculation methods were investigated in this study. These methods were used to calculate <b>slope</b> using 10 -m, 30 -m, and 100 -m DEMs. There were two phases of analysis in this study. The first phase was a cell-by-cell comparison of the eight <b>slope</b> algorithms for all three DEMs to obtain an understanding of differences between the calculated <b>slope</b> methods. The second phase was to determine the method that calculated the most accurate <b>slope</b> from a 10 - m, 30 -m, and 100 -m DEM, by comparing calculated <b>slope</b> to actual <b>slope</b> value. All methods underestimated <b>slope</b> for the 100 -m DEM with a mean <b>slope</b> difference ranging from 9. 28 % to 11. 085 %. For the 30 -meter DEMs all the <b>slope</b> methods underestimated <b>slope,</b> with a mean <b>slope</b> difference range from 0. 21 % to 4. 18 %. The 10 -meter DEM mean <b>slope</b> difference ranged from - 2. 63 % to 1. 82 % for the cell <b>slope</b> methods.

30|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} and total {{nitrogen}} were significantly (P[*]<[*]. 05) influenced with <b>slope</b> positions, the highest amount {{was found at}} gentle <b>slope</b> and lowest at steep <b>slope.</b> This {{could be due to}} the removal of organic matter through erosion and surface runoff from steep <b>slope</b> and deposition in gentle <b>slope,</b> and presence of better soil moisture at gentle <b>slope.</b> Earlier study show, soil organic carbon content increases with moisture content and clay deposition at lower <b>slope</b> position (Hailu et al. 2012). Aytenew (2015) reported, soil nitrogen content decrease with increasing slope; the content is low at steep <b>slopes</b> and high at gentle <b>slope</b> position. In case of soil cation exchange capacity, significant (P[*]<[*]. 05) difference was observed along <b>slope</b> positions, the highest amount was found at gentle <b>slope</b> and lowest at steep <b>slope</b> (Table  4). The highest CEC at gentle <b>slope</b> was associated with high soil clay and organic carbon content. Former studies show, high soil CEC at gentle <b>slope</b> is related with the deposition of clay minerals and organic matter into lower slope positions, and CEC decreases as clay and organic matter content of soil decrease (Aytenew 2015; Bekele et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Risk-based <b>slope</b> {{stabilization}} planning integrates {{the failure}} probability {{and the failure}} consequence systematically and shows promise {{for use in the}} practice. This paper attempts to develop a risk-based methodology for stabilization planning for deteriorating soil cut <b>slopes.</b> First, a framework of risk-based stabilization planning for <b>slopes</b> is proposed. Then the time-dependent reliability of deteriorating <b>slopes</b> is analyzed based on observed performance. Thereafter, the <b>slope</b> failure consequence is assessed in terms of expected numbers of fatality. After obtaining the time-dependent risk of <b>slope</b> failure, the time for <b>slope</b> stabilization is determined according to selected risk criteria. Finally, the effect of <b>slope</b> maintenance on the reliability of <b>slopes</b> is evaluated. Based on the analyses, the annual probability of failure of soil cut <b>slopes</b> would increase exponentially in the early stage of service if no maintenance were implemented. As a <b>slope</b> deteriorates, the risk of <b>slope</b> failure increases with time and may reach an intolerable level at a certain time. The risk of <b>slope</b> failure may also reach an intolerable level due to a change of elements at risk. The derived stabilization time depends on the factors that cause the <b>slopes</b> to deteriorate, consequence of <b>slope</b> failure, selected risk criteria, and vulnerability of the affected population...|$|R
