5|$|Despite the series' {{success on}} Fox Kids, Animaniacs on Kids' WB was only {{successful}} in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children.

Slowly, orders from the WB for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs had a couple more short seasons, relying on leftover <b>scripts</b> <b>and</b> storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with Animaniacs. The 99th and final Animaniacs episode was aired on November 14, 1998.|$|E
