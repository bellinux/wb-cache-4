5000|$|Writing {{about the}} rediscovery, Prof. Finlayson {{and his wife}} Dr. Geraldine Finlayson stated: [...] "Getting to the site was not easy even though we started with the {{advantage}} of being able to drive to a middle height on the Rock. This we did by obtaining permission to enter via the Waterworks. Mr Manolo Perez and his deputy, Mr Derek Cano, and their staff have always been most helpful to the Gibraltar Museum and this time was no exception. Having left the car {{on the west side of}} the Rock we walked the long and straight tunnel which leads to the huge reservoirs which hold Gibraltar's water supply. Some are the size of two football pitches and during the Second World War one of them housed the Blackwatch Regiment! The moment you enter this quarter-mile long tunnel you literally see the light at the other end. As you walk along it, on the tracks of a small railway system, the opening gets larger and the light brighter. Having got used to the darkness of the inner depths of the Rock you are suddenly confronted with the bright blue of the Mediterranean on the other side.The other side of the Rock is literally another world. Having got there the early morning sun, contrasting with the deep shade of the west side, is then quite warm and agreeable. You look around and you see Catalan Bay below you and the slopes around are covered in a curious mix of introduced caHottentot Figs from South Africa used to stabilise the loose sands, Canary Palms, Tamarisks and native matorral dominated by Lentisc and Olive. The old corrugated sheets of the watercatchments were still prevalent in those early days of 1992.From the exit to the tunnel we walked south along a passage on the side of which was the channel which used to carry the rainwater into the reservoirs. Throughout the walk we would hear the rattle of stones as they fell onto the sheets from the cliffs above, perhaps disturbed by a gull landing, perhaps accomplices in the millennial process of erosion which, one day, will reduce the Rock to a flat land. We reached a point where we had to abandon the luxury of the passage and start to climb towards the cliff face. The steps here were narrow and a railing to hold onto was not always there. In fact, when there was it was so precarious that it was best not to hold on to it at all! The situation was not for one who suffered from vertigo. The higher we went the smaller Catalan Bay became below us. On either side of us we had corrugated iron sheets so to stumble would have meant a long fall down. A large Tamarisk half-way up right across the steps did little to help as we had to struggle through its branches to get to the other side.Eventually we conquered the 700 or so steps and reached a sandy platform which had been created by the workers as they removed the sand. We peered over the top and the view was surreal. We can only describe it as a small forest of tobacco plants that had spread and grown here. In the centre of this, then was a bulldozer, apparently taken up there in parts and assembled on site! There were lots of boulders. In many ways getting from here to the cave was the most dangerous part. The boulders were left-overs of the <b>sand</b> <b>removal.</b> Among them were remnants of rusty sheets so there was no guarantee of stability. The cave was a small opening on the cliff side. When we got to it we soon found some prehistoric stone tools and more bones on the surface and we were convinced that this was just the tip of the iceberg. It was at that moment that we knew we had to excavate here.The cave needed a name. No matter how much we debated we could not reach agreement. Our son, Stewart, then nine years old, stated the obvious - we had found the complete skull of an Ibex (wild mountain goat) so it should be called Ibex Cave. As parents we were not sure. Months later Andy Currant, in his inimical style settled it for us - Stewart named it Ibex Cave, here is the Ibex skull, therefore you must call it Ibex Cave! Who would argue?

Approach: Removal efficiency of Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II) and Ni(II) from aqueous solution by white, {{yellow and red}} UAE sand was investigated at 25. 0 °C using the methods of batch equilibrium adsorption and column filtration. In each case, a mixture containing 20 ppm of each ion was employed. In the equilibrium study, the effect of sand dosage was measured for mixtures containing 20 ppm of each ion. In the column filtration study, the mixture was added to a column packed with yellow sand and {{the composition of the}} effluent was measured for each 0. 050 dm 3 portion. Concentrations were measured on an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer ICP-AES. Results: <b>Removal</b> efficiency by <b>sand</b> type was found to follow the order yellow>white>red. At low <b>sand</b> dosages, <b>removal</b> efficiencies of Pb(II) and Cu(II) were much higher than those for Ni(II) and Cd(II).

Under an electric field, generation of hydrogen and oxygen gases, and hydroxyl and hydrogen ions, occurs at the electrodes.

Three sets of experiments were performed to explore the ability of this oxygen flow to encourage removal of dissolved-phase toluene by both sparging and biosparging.

These, in turn, were found to stimulate more rapid growth of bacteria (Pseudomonas putida mt- 2) in uncontaminated aqueous media with and without the presence of gravel.

40|$|Pyrite {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be an excellent absorbent in removing mercury in many studies. Most of them used natural pyrites that were ground to micro-scale size or even larger. This study investigated methods to produce nano-scale pyrite particles. FeCl 3 and NaSH were used as the source chemicals to synthesize pyrite. Several aging methods, including hydrothermal, ultrasonic and microwave irradiation, were studied {{in order to reduce}} the particle size. Surface analysis showed that microwave irradiation was the most effective way to produce near nano-scale pyrite crystals (100 - 200 nm). Several experimental variables were investigated in a batch reactor system for mercury removal, including pyrite dose, mercury concentration, and impact of salts and humic acids (HAs). Results of batch experiments revealed an initially fast adsorption kinetics, followed by a release and resorption of mercury behavior. The presence of salts decreased the removal efficiency by about 20 %. The mercury loading tests showed that the maximum uptake Hg(II) onto pyrite could reach 900 ?mol Hg(II) / g FeS 2. Both salts and HAs inhibit the removal of Hg(II) by pyrite. But mercury removal increased at higher HAs concentrations. The XPS analysis revealed the presence of HgS on the surface. A column system was employed to conduct experiments under different pH and hydraulic retention time, in the presence or absence of salts or HAs. The system consists of pyrite-coated sand that was formed by electrostatic attraction or polymers. For electrostatic attraction/pyrite-coated <b>sand,</b> the <b>removal</b> capacity of mercury decreased at lower influent pH or at lower HRT or in the presence of salts, but faster removal kinetics were observed.

Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 367 (1606), 3076 - 3086 Biological soil crusts (BSCs) {{are an important}} source of organic carbon, and affect a range of ecosystem functions in arid and semiarid environments. Yet the impact of grazing disturbance on crust properties and soil CO 2 efflux remain poorly studied, particularly in African ecosystems. The effects of burial under wind-blown <b>sand,</b> disaggregation and <b>removal</b> of BSCs on seasonal variations in soil CO 2 efflux, soil organic carbon, chlorophyll a and scytonemin were investigated at two sites in the Kalahari of southern Botswana. Field experiments were employed to isolate CO 2 efflux originating from BSCs in order to estimate the C exchange within the crust. Organic carbon was not evenly distributed through the soil profile but concentrated in the BSC. Soil CO 2 efflux was higher in Kalahari Sand than in calcrete soils, but rates varied significantly with seasonal changes in moisture and temperature. BSCs at both sites were a small net sink of C to the soil. Soil CO 2 efflux was significantly higher in sand soils where the BSC was removed, and on calcrete where the BSC was buried under <b>sand.</b> The BSC <b>removal</b> and burial under sand also significantly reduced chlorophyll a, organic carbon and scytonemin. Disaggregation of the soil crust, however, led to increases in chlorophyll a and organic carbon. The data confirm the importance of BSCs for C cycling in drylands and indicate intensive grazing, which destroys BSCs through trampling and burial, will adversely affect C sequestration and storage. Managed grazing, where soil surfaces are only lightly disturbed, would help maintain a positive carbon balance in African drylands. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
