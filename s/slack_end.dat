50|$|The first live LAN {{event was}} {{announced}} on November 11, 2015. It was the Totino's Invitational 2015 {{and it would}} be a one-day event that would be streamed on Twitch and hosted on November 14. The team traveled to Columbus, Ohio, and their first match was against the former Team Revenge, now playing under Team eLevate. OpTic took the Hardpoint on Breach with ease, winning with a score of 250-148, then lost the Uplink on Evac 6-13, and finally took the Search and Destroy 6-3 to take the series 2-1. They then advanced to the semi-finals to play the returning organization of compLexity. The Hardpoint on Fringe was a little bit closer with OG winning 250-185, lost Stronghold CTF 1-2, and then winning the Search and Destroy in a dominating fashion with a score of 6-1. With the 2-1 victory over coL, OpTic Gaming advanced to another grand finals with their opponent being Rise Nation this time. Rise put up a fight that most people didn't see coming, they dominated OpTic on Combine Hardpoint with a score of 250-136. OG bounced right back by taking both the Search and Destroy on Evac and the Uplink on Stronghold with scores of 6-1 and 9-4 before dropping the Capture The Flag on Fringe 1-3. The game 5, Breach Search and Destroy went the distance as the two teams battle back and forth to round 11. <b>Slacked</b> <b>ended</b> up getting a very important 2 piece with his specialist that ultimately left Karma in a tough situation. The clock ended up running out, thus meaning that Rise Nation were victorious and giving OpTic their first second-place finish in the Call of Duty: Black Ops III season.|$|R

But the next moment a larger skiff had splashed {{over the side}} of the Frenchman, and no less than four seamen were hard at work under her bows. If the Marie Rose advanced a yard the Frenchman was going two. Again Cock Badding raved and shook his fist. He clambered aboard, his face wet with sweat and dark with anger.|$|E

60|$|Now {{and then}} Mr. Bixby called my {{attention}} to certain things. Said he, 'This is Six-Mile Point.' I assented. It was pleasant enough information, but I {{could not see the}} bearing of it. I was not conscious that {{it was a matter of}} any interest to me. Another time he said, 'This is Nine-Mile Point.' Later he said, 'This is Twelve-Mile Point.' They were all about level with the water's edge; they all looked about alike to me; they were monotonously unpicturesque. I hoped Mr. Bixby would change the subject. But no; he would crowd up around a point, hugging the shore with affection, and then say: 'The <b>slack</b> water <b>ends</b> here, abreast this bunch of China-trees; now we cross over.' So he crossed over. He gave me the wheel once or twice, but I had no luck. I either came near chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation, or I yawed too far from shore, and so dropped back into disgrace again and got abused.|$|R

25|$|Installing {{a barrage}} {{may change the}} {{shoreline}} within the bay or estuary, affecting a large ecosystem that depends on tidal flats. Inhibiting {{the flow of water}} {{in and out of the}} bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional turbidity (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary. In August 2004, a humpback whale swam through the open sluice gate of the Annapolis Royal Generating Station at <b>slack</b> tide, <b>ending</b> up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the Annapolis Basin.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the night}} raid of Nisus and Euryalus has a {{discrete}} narrative unity, it {{is closely related}} to major themes of the epic, such as the transition from boyhood to manhood, also present in the characters of Ascanius, Pallas, and Lausus, and the waste of young lives in war. Nisus and Euryalus's killing spree through the camp of the Rutuli is one of Virgil's most brutal descriptions of combat (especially when Nisus beheads the chief Remus with his warriors Lamyrus, Lamus and Serranus). The poetry of Euryalus's death—"as when a richly hued flower is cut down by the plough and withers as it dies, or when the rains beat down the poppy's head, weighed down on <b>slack</b> neck"—recalls the <b>ending</b> of Catullus's Carmen 11, a poem about bitterly disillusioned love.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} uses {{structural equation}} modelling {{to investigate a}} comprehensive model {{of the relationships between}} budget participation, procedural fairness, distributive fairness, trust, goal commitment and managers' propensity to create <b>slack.</b> To this <b>end,</b> data from 163 U. S. individual managers were used for the study. The results show that budget participation impacts both procedural fairness and distributive fairness which, in turn, affect trust. Also, both procedural fairness and trust are found to {{have a significant impact on}} budget goal commitment which, in turn, negatively influences managers' propensity to create slack. Further analyses indicate that the direct relationship between budget participation and manager's propensity to create slack was insignificant, which suggests that fairness and goal commitment mediate the relationship between budget participation and manager's propensity to create slack. The applied implications of this study, especially in relation to individual reactions to being ‘laid-off', are also discussed. Godkänd; 2007; 20071203 (keni...|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Paul as Todd Chavez, an {{unemployed}} but well-meaning and friendly 24-year-old human <b>slacker</b> who <b>ended</b> up at BoJack's {{house for a}} party five years {{before the beginning of}} the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese; entrepreneurial know-how, having allied with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas; and writing and composing his own rock opera- Newtopia Rising, Book I: The Search for a New Utopia. His rock opera was eventually sabotaged by BoJack, who took advantage of his former addiction to video games. Todd puts the pieces together of what BoJack did string map style and begins to question his friendship with Bojack. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places Prince and the Pauper-style with a Cordovian dictator. Todd's friendship with Mr. Peanutbutter landed him various jobs creating seemingly useless products. He sees the best in BoJack, despite his multitude of problems. He's usually happy, even when being insulted by BoJack. Catch Phrases include shouting [...] "hooray!". He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In the 2000s he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. It is revealed in the season 3 finale [...] "That Went Well" [...] that he is asexual.|$|R
40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{activities}} of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) for calendar year 1998 -a year of sharp contrasts and significant successes at NASA. The year opened with the announcement of large workforce cutbacks. The slip in the schedule for launching the International Space Station (ISS) created a 5 -month hiatus in Space Shuttle launches. This <b>slack</b> period <b>ended</b> with the successful and highly publicized launch of the STS- 95 mission. As the year closed, ISS assembly began with the successful orbiting and joining of the Functional Cargo Block (FGB), Zarya, from Russia and the Unity Node from the United States. Throughout the year, the Panel maintained its scrutiny of NASAs safety processes. Of particular interest were the potential effects on safety of workforce reductions and the continued transition of functions to the Space Flight Operations Contractor. Attention was also given to the risk management plans of the Aero-Space Technology programs, including the X- 33, X- 34, and X- 38. Overall, the Panel concluded that safety is well served for the present. The picture is not as clear for the future. Cutbacks have limited the depth of talent available. In many cases, technical specialties are "one deep. " The extended hiring freeze has resulted in an older workforce that will inevitably suffer significant departures from retirements in the near future. The resulting "brain drain" could represent a future safety risk unless appropriate succession planning is started expeditiously. This and other topics are covered in the section addressing workforce. In the case of the Space Shuttle, beneficial and mandatory safety and operational upgrades are being delayed {{because of a lack of}} sufficient present funding. Likewise, the ISS has little flexibility to begin long lead-time items for upgrades or contingency planning...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to create an}} exact {{mathematical}} tool that allows {{to solve the problem of}} vessels scheduling to o shore platforms with multiple time windows. The tool has been tested with several instances and some extended experiments have been carried out with the use of real data. The problem can be summarized as a number of platforms that need to be supplied frequently via sea from a single base. What we want to obtain is an assignation of vessels and times to visit those platforms. At the same time, it is needed to verify a number of constraints such as: opening times, maximum duration of the voyages or frequency of the visits. The solution model consists of 2 parts. In the rst part we have to generate a number of possible voyages and in the second part we have to choose some of those voyages and assign them to vessels and times under some restrictions and preferences. It has been validated with two data sets: one small and one medium. The experiments and the results has been done with a large data set. The tool has been proved functional, although not fast. To reduce the number of voyages and accelerate the process a procedure has been applied and suggested. Furthermore, some experiments on the data has been undergone and one of the conclusions is that the <b>slacks</b> at the <b>end</b> of the voyages are less costly than to distribute them along the voyages...|$|R
40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of <b>slack</b> pile <b>ends</b> will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R
