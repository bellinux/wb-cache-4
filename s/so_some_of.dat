5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even <b>so,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović {{strove to}} make The Takovo Uprising as {{historically}} accurate as possible. He studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time}} of the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović led the people to revolt. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and <b>so</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their faces appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris over the course of several months in 1894. It was first exhibited the following year at his brother Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace. The exhibition coincided with the uprising's 80th anniversary.|$|E

5|$|Krueger {{retired to}} San Antonio, Texas, where, in February 1946, {{he bought a}} house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill {{left over from the}} war, he was unable to buy it {{outright}} and <b>so</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his friends established the Krueger Fund Committee, which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.|$|E
5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, <b>so</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E

The second, measuring , was composed specifically for King Alexander, {{who had also}} commissioned the first version. As part of his preparations, Jovanović studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time of}} the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović incited the people. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and <b>so</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their faces appear in the painting.|$|E

5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and <b>so</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> what were Blue Line trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E
5|$|While {{three of}} the four Ju 87 groups reached and bombed their targets without interception, the 28 Stukas of I./StG 77 were {{attacked}} by No. 43 and 601 Squadron sporting a force of 18 Hurricanes. The escorting Bf 109s from II./JG 27 were flying too far away and could not stop the Hurricanes making an attack before the Ju 87s made their dives. Three Ju 87s were shot down in exchange for a damaged Hurricane, hit by return fire. The Bf 109s soon came under attack themselves and could not assist the dive-bombers effectively. Still, some Ju 87s made attacks. While they were doing <b>so,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the German crews saw No. 235 Blenheims taking off to defend their base. Some hangars were hit by the Ju 87s and much damage done. As the Bf 109 escorts turned to meet the two engaging RAF Squadrons, around 300 aircraft filled a patch of sky 25 miles long, from Gosport to Bognor Regis. No. 152, 235 Squadrons engaged the Germans over Thorney Island. No. 602 engaged the Ju 87s that attacked Ford but III./JG 27 bounced No. 602 Squadron, claiming four Spitfires destroyed. Spitfires from No. 234 and Hurricanes from 213 Squadron each destroyed one Bf 109.|$|E

25|$|Eight {{locomotives}} (class M-3) {{were built}} by Baldwin in 1941. The Yellowstones met or exceeded the DM specifications, so 10 more were ordered (class M-4).

On most days a green-liveried, two-car British Rail Class 101 DMU runs from Loughborough to Leicester.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuous, flirtatious, {{and openly}} flaunting her body, Mata Hari captivated her audiences {{and was an}} {{overnight}} success from the debut of her act at the Musée Guimet on 13 March 1905. She became the long-time mistress of the millionaire Lyon industrialist Émile Étienne Guimet, who had founded the Musée. She posed as a Javanese princess of priestly Hindu birth, {{pretending to have been}} immersed in the art of sacred Indian dance since childhood. She was photographed numerous times during this period, nude or nearly <b>so.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> these pictures were obtained by MacLeod and strengthened his case in keeping custody of their daughter.|$|E
25|$|In 1292 Edward I called Abbot William of Bridgnorth {{to account}} for {{exceeding}} his privileges in numerous instances.

Moreover, he was holding fairs, markets and claiming free warren across his estates, although he had only limited rights to do <b>so.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> this the abbot sought to justify by reference to extant charters, some he denied, and some he sought to evade by claiming that the villages stipulated in the charges did not exist – apparently an attempt to exploit the loose spelling of the period. The outcome of the case is unknown.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a private}} {{controversy}} regarding {{the publication of the}} map of the Commissioners' Plan. Randel had begun to prepare a map to go to the engraver, using his original papers, when he found out that the council had given William Bridges, another of the handful of city-recognized surveyors, the right to do so. Bridges simply copied one of Randel's previously published maps, which were in the public domain, without access to the supporting material Randel had accumulated, introducing errors as he did <b>so,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them possibly intentional, since he was legally bound not to copy the map exactly. Bridges published and copyrighted the resulting map as a private venture, leaving Randel out in the cold: his name did not appear anywhere on Bridges' map.|$|E
25|$|Cecil Rhodes’ British South Africa Company (BSAC) and Belgian King Leopold II’s Congo Free State (CFS) both {{wanted to}} sign {{treaties}} with Msiri to fulfil their colonial ambitions and competed to do <b>so.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> Msiri's subordinate chiefs and trading competitors {{took the opportunity}} of the arrival of new powers {{in the region to}} start rebellions against his authority. In November 1890 Alfred Sharpe arrived in Bunkeya from Nyasaland on behalf of the BSAC and the British Commissioner in Central Africa/Nyasaland, Sir Harry Johnston with a mineral rights concession and a British Protectorate treaty for signature. The explorer Joseph Thomson was sent by the BSAC to meet up with and reinforce Sharpe's mission in Bunkeya, but its route was blocked by a smallpox epidemic and could not continue.|$|E
25|$|Naive {{set theory}} (the axiom schema of {{unrestricted}} comprehension and the axiom of extensionality) is inconsistent due to Russell's paradox. In early formalizations of sets, mathematicians and logicians have avoided that contradiction by replacing the axiom schema of comprehension with the much weaker axiom schema of separation. However, this step alone takes one to theories of sets which are considered too weak. <b>So</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the power of}} comprehension was added back via the other existence axioms of ZF set theory (pairing, union, powerset, replacement, and infinity) which may be regarded as special cases of comprehension. So far, these axioms {{do not seem to}} lead to any contradiction. Subsequently, the axiom of choice and the axiom of regularity were added to exclude models with some undesirable properties. These two axioms are known to be relatively consistent.|$|E
