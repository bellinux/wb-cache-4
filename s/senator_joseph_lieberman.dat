Concern about Night Trap and several other games such as Mortal Kombat helped to bring about the creation of the ESRB video game rating system.|$|R
500|$|In November 1997, {{the band}} found itself {{the target of}} congressional hearings, led by <b>Senator</b> <b>Joseph</b> <b>Lieberman</b> and Representative Sam Brownback, to {{determine}} the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. This hearing was held by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and was titled [...] "Music Violence: How Does It Affect Our Children". At this subcommittee, Lieberman once again criticized the band's music, calling it [...] "vile, hateful, nihilistic and damaging", and repeated his request that Seagram—then-owner of MCA—"start (...) disassociating itself from Marilyn Manson." [...] Lieberman {{would go on to}} refer to the band as [...] "perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company." [...] The subcommittee also heard from Raymond Kuntz, of Burlington, North Dakota, who blamed his son Richard's suicide on Antichrist Superstar—specifically the song [...] "The Reflecting God".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the year}} and a half between 1999 and 2000, the IDF, {{seconded}} by the Shin Bet and the Israeli Border Police, had asked the government to evacuate the tomb. [...] In September 2000, in the wake of Ariel Sharon’s controversial visit to the Temple Mount, [...] the Al-Aqsa Intifada broke out, and Nablus turned into conflict zone, in part after its governor’s son was shot dead during a clash with Israeli soldiers. The Palestinians targeted the site, reportedly {{on the grounds that it}} was better for the shrine to belong to no one than to be appropriated by just one religion, burning the yeshiva to the ground, incinerating its books and painting the dome green, an act which led to retaliation with Jewish vandalism of three mosques in Tiberias and Jaffa. After the death of an Israeli border policeman [...] the head of the IDF’s southern command, Brigadier-General Yom-Tov Samia, threatened to resign if the government kept control of the tomb, since retaining control of it was ‘patently illegal.’ Prime Minister Ehud Barak [...] eventually complied with the request and the site was handed over to the Palestinian police on October 7, 2000. [...] Israeli newspapers framed the return of the site as a humiliating defeat for the nation. The tomb was pillaged and torched by Palestinian protesters hours after its evacuation. The next morning, the bullet-riddled body of rabbi Hillel Lieberman of Elon Moreh, a cousin of <b>Senator</b> <b>Joseph</b> <b>Lieberman,</b> was found on the outskirts of Nablus, where he had gone to check damage to the tomb. Joseph’s Tomb embodied a key Zionist theme: the return from exile to one’s homeland, and the Palestinian assault has been interpreted as challenging the credibility of claims to the site. The PA began to repair it the next day. Palestinian spokesperson Hanan Ashrawi claimed that Judaism's connection with the tomb was 'fabricated'. The mayor of Nablus Ghassan Shakaa was reported as saying Jewish worshippers would not be permitted to pray there until an international organization or third party determines whether the site is holy to Moslems or Jews.|$|E

2500|$|The rule, {{named for}} Lyndon B. Johnson, allows a {{candidate}} to seek the presidency or the vice presidency and another office in the same election cycle.

The Johnson rule was since used by former U.S. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., who ran for reelection in 1988 and was also the 1988 Democratic nominee for vice president. [...] Several other states, including Connecticut with <b>Senator</b> <b>Joseph</b> <b>Lieberman</b> in 2000 and Delaware with Senator Joseph Biden in 2008, also permit presidential and vice presidential candidates to seek other offices at the same time, usually the U.S. Senate being the preferred choice.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Beautiful People" [...] was {{released}} as the album's lead single, {{and made a}} fairly major impact on the alternative rock charts.

5000|$|As the 16-bit era {{of video}} games {{began in the}} late 1980s, their content became more realistic. The {{increased}} graphical and audio fidelity of the products made violent scenes appear more explicit, especially those containing blood. As controversy stemmed around the realism of this violence, 1992 games Mortal Kombat and Night Trap entered the limelight. Mortal Kombat is a [...] "brutal" [...] fighting game and Night Trap is a full-motion video Sega CD game where players protect a slumber party from vampires. The games were at the center of federal hearings held from December 9, 1993 to March 4, 1994 by United States <b>Senators</b> <b>Joseph</b> <b>Lieberman</b> and Herbert Kohl.

50|$|Mortal Kombat {{was one of}} many violent {{video games}} that came into {{prominence}} between 1992 and 1993, generating controversy among parents and public officials. Hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society, headed by <b>Senators</b> <b>Joseph</b> <b>Lieberman</b> and Herb Kohl, were held in late 1992 to 1993. The legislators were especially concerned with the realistic replica of human figures in games, such as Mortal Kombat, Night Trap and Lethal Enforcers, as opposed to cartoonish characters in other violent games such as Eternal Champions, Time Killers, etc. The result of the hearings was that the entertainment software industry was given one year to form a working rating system or the federal government would intervene and create its own system. Eventually, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was conceived, requiring all video games to be rated and for these ratings to be placed on the games' packaging.|$|R

In the late 1990s, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. He was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95–0) the Byrd–Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which stated the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing as well as industrialized nations or [...] "would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States". On November 12, 1998, Gore symbolically signed the protocol. Both Gore and <b>Senator</b> <b>Joseph</b> <b>Lieberman</b> indicated that the protocol would not be acted upon in the Senate until there was participation by the developing nations. The Clinton Administration never submitted the protocol to the Senate for ratification.
