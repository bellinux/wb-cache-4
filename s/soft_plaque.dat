25|$|The sudden {{nature of}} the {{complications}} of pre-existing atheroma, vulnerable plaque (non-occlusive or <b>soft</b> <b>plaque),</b> have led, since the 1950s, {{to the development of}} intensive care units and complex medical and surgical interventions.

25|$|Apart from thromboembolism, chronically {{expanding}} atherosclerotic lesions {{can cause}} complete {{closure of the}} lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in ischemia. These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque), causing {{the formation of a}} thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE(S) : We {{hypothesized}} that {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) may exert {{a role in}} carotid plaque instability by regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). METHODS: Plaques obtained from 40 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were preoperatively classified as soft or hard. Serum bFGF was pre- and postoperatively measured. The release of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 in the blood serum, and the activity, production and expression in the carotid specimens was analyzed. Specific anti-bFGF inhibition tests were performed in vitro on human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) to evaluate the role of bFGF in the activity, production and expression of MMP- 2 and - 9. RESULTS: Twenty-one (53 %) patients had a <b>soft</b> carotid <b>plaque</b> and 19 (48 %) a hard plaque. Preoperative bFGF serum levels were higher in patients with <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> [soft= 34 (28 - 39) pg/mL and hard= 20 (17 - 22) pg/mL-p 0. 001] and postoperatively returned to normal values (when compared to 10 healthy volunteers). The serum levels of MMP- 2 in patients' with <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> were higher than those in patients' with hard plaques [soft= 1222 (1190 - 1252) ng/mL and hard= 748 (656 - 793) ng/mL-p 0. 0001]. MMP- 9 serum values were 26 (22 - 29) ng/mL for <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> and 18 (15 - 21) ng/mL for hard plaques (p 0. 0001). We found increased activity, production and expression of MMP- 2 and - 9 in <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> compared to hard plaques (p 0. 001). In vitro inhibition tests on HUASMC showed the direct influence of bFGF on the activity, production and expression of MMP- 2 and - 9 (p 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: bFGF seems to exert a key role in carotid plaque instability regulating the activity, production and expression of MMP thus altering the physiologic homeostasis of the carotid plaque...|$|R
40|$|Detection of non-calcified plaques in the {{coronary}} tree is a challenging problem {{due to the}} nature of comprising substances. Hard plaques are easily discernible in CTA data cloud due to apparent bright behaviour, therefore many approaches have been proposed for automatic segmentation of calcified <b>plaques.</b> In contrast <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> show very small difference in intensity with respect to surrounding heart tissues & blood voxels. This similarity in intensity makes the isolation and detection of <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> very difficult. This work aims to develop framework for segmentation of vulnerable plaques with minimal user dependency. In first step automatic seed point has been established based on the fact that coronary artery behaves as tubular structure through axial slices. In the following step the behaviour of contrast agent has been modelled mathematically to reflect the dye diffusion in respective CTA volume. Consequently based on detected seed point & intensity behaviour, localized active contour segmentation has been applied to extract complete {{coronary tree}}. Bidirectional segmentation has been applied to avoid loss of coronary information due to the seed point location whereas auto adjustment feature of contour grabs new emerging branches. Medial axis for extracted coronary tree is generated using fast marching method for obtaining curve planar reformation for validation of contrast agent behaviour. Obtained coronary tree is to be evaluated for <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> in second phase of this research...|$|R
40|$|Presented at PMMIA 2009 : Probabilistic Models For Medical Image Analysis: A MICCAI 2009 Workshop, September 20 th, 2009 Imperial College, London, UKThe {{ability to}} detect and measure non-calcified plaques (also known as <b>soft</b> <b>plaques)</b> may improve physicians’ ability to predict cardiac events. This is a {{particularly}} challenging problem in computed tomography angiography (CTA) imagery because plaques may have similar appearance to nearby blood and muscle tissue. This paper presents an effective technique for automatically detecting <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> in CTA imagery using active contours driven by spatially localized probabilistic models. The proposed method identifies plaques that exist within the vessel wall by simultaneously segmenting the vessel from the inside-out and the outside-in using carefully chosen localized energies that allow the complex appearances of plaques and vessels to be modeled with simple statistics. This method is shown {{to be an effective}} way to detect the minute variations that distinguish plaques from healthy tissue. Experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm are performed on eight datasets, and results are compared with detections provided by an expert cardiologist...|$|R

The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke. Another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs. Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree, but mostly larger, high-pressure vessels such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{higher rate}} of {{embolization}} is considered a disadvantage of carotid stenting (CAS), when compared with carotid endarterectomy. Plaques in the aortic arch (AA) and the common carotid artery (CCA) may be additional sources of embolization to stented internal carotid plaques during CAS. In this study, we aimed to investigate {{the relationship between these}} plaques and intracerebral embolization. METHODS: We analyzed the occurrence and composition of plaques in the AA and CCA by computed tomography angiography (CTA) in 101 consecutive cases of CAS. Cases of peri-procedural embolization were detected on diffusion-weighted imaging as lesions demonstrating diffusion restriction. We applied the chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests, as well as logistic regression models. RESULTS: The occurrence of plaques in the AA and CCA was significantly related to the appearance of new diffusion-weighted imaging lesions (p = 0. 013 and p = 0. 004, respectively). Patients with <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> in the AA or CCA had a significantly higher risk of embolization than those without plaques (p = 0. 012 and p = 0. 006, respectively). In contrast, homogeneously calcified plaques did not pose significantly higher risks.

40|$|This thesis explores two {{possible}} ways of detecting <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> {{present in the}} coronary arteries, using CTA imagery. The coronary arteries are vessels that supply oxidized blood to the cardiac muscle and are thus important for the proper functioning of heart. Cholesterol or reactive oxygen species from cigarette smoke and other toxins may get adhered to the walls of coronary arteries and trigger chronic inflammation that leads to formation of the <b>soft</b> <b>plaque.</b> When the <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> grows bigger in volume, it occludes the {{blood flow to the}} cardiac muscle and finally results in ischemic heart attack. Moreover, smaller plaque can easily rupture due to the blood flow in arteries and can result in complications such as stroke. Hence {{there is a need to}} detect the <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> using non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques. In CTA imagery, the cardiac muscle appears as a dark gray color, while the blood appears as dull white color and the the calcified plaque appears as bright white. The <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> has an intensity which falls between the intensity level of the blood and cardiac muscle, making it difficult to directly segment the <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> using standard segmentation methods. <b>Soft</b> <b>plaque</b> in its advanced stages forms a concavity in the blood lumen. A watershed based segmentation method was used to detect the presence of this concavity which in turn identifies the location of the <b>soft</b> <b>plaque.</b> For segmenting the <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> at its earlier stages, a novel segmentation technique was used. In this technique the surface is evolved based on a region-based energy calculated in the local neighborhood around each point on the evolving surface. This method seems to be superior to the watershed based segmentation method in detecting smaller plaque deposits. M. S.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy in determining coronary lesion configuration by multislice computed tomography (MSCT). The results were compared with the findings of intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS). BACKGROUNDThe risk of acute coronary syndromes caused by plaque disruption and thrombosis depends on plaque composition rather than stenosis severity. Thus, the reliable noninvasive assessment of plaque configuration would constitute an important step forward for risk stratification in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Just recently, MSCT scanners became available for general purpose scanning. Due to improved spatial and temporal resolution, this new technology holds promise to allow for differentiation of coronary lesion configuration. METHODSThe ICUS and MSCT scans (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) were performed in 15 patients. Plaque composition was analyzed according to ICUS (<b>plaque</b> echogenity: <b>soft,</b> intermediate, calcified) and MSCT criteria (plaque density expressed by Hounsfield units [HU]). RESULTSThirty-four plaques were analyzed. With ICUS, the plaques were classified as soft (n = 12), intermediate (n = 5) and calcified (n = 17). Using MSCT, <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> had a density of 14 ± 26 HU (range − 42 to + 47 HU), intermediate plaques of 91 ± 21 HU (61 to 112 HU) and calcified plaques of 419 ± 194 HU (126 to 736 HU). Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference of plaque density among the three groups (p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONSOur results indicate that coronary lesion configuration might be correctly differentiated by MSCT. Since also rupture-prone <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> can be detected by MSCT, this noninvasive method might become an important diagnostic tool for risk stratification in the near future...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the {{treatment}} of carotid atherosclerosis, the rate of stenosis and characteristics of plaque should be assessed to diagnose vulnerable plaques that increase the risk for cerebral infarction. We performed carotid black-blood (BB) MR imaging to diagnose plaque compo-nents and assess plaque hardness based on MR signals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three images of BB-MR imaging per plaque were obtained from 70 consecutive patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to generate T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. To evaluate the relative signal intensity (rSI) of plaque components {{and the relationship between}} histologic findings and symptoms, we prepared sections at 2 -mm intervals from 34 intact plaques. We then calculated the relative overall signal intensity (roSI) of 70 plaques to assess the relationship between MR signal intensity and plaque hardness and symptoms. RESULTS: The characteristics of rSI values on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images of fibrous cap (FC), fibrosis, calcification, myxomatous tissue, lipid core (LC) with intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), and LC without IPH differed. Symptomatic plaques were associated with FC disruption (P. 001) and LC with IPH (P. 05).

40|$|A typical MR imaging {{protocol}} {{to study the}} status of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery consists of the application of multiple MR sequences. Since scanner time is limited, a balance has to be reached between {{the duration of the}} applied MR protocol and {{the quantity and quality of}} the resulting images which are needed to assess the disease. In this study an objective method to optimize the MR sequence set for classification of <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> in vessel wall images of the carotid artery using automated image segmentation was developed. The automated method employs statistical pattern recognition techniques and was developed based on an extensive set of MR contrast weightings and corresponding manual segmentations of the vessel wall and <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> components, which were validated by histological sections. Evaluation of the results from nine contrast weightings showed the tradeoff between scan duration and automated image segmentation performance. For our dataset the best segmentation performance was achieved by selecting five contrast weightings. Similar performance was achieved with a set of three contrast weightings, which resulted in a reduction of scan time by more than 60 %.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{variability}} in attenuation of coronary plaques with multislice CT-angiography (MSCT-CA) in an ex-vivo model with varying convolution kernels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSCT-CA (Sensation 16, Siemens) was performed in three ex-vivo left coronary arteries after instillation of contrast material solution (Iomeprol 400 mgI/ml, dilution: 1 / 80). The specimens were placed in oil to simulate epicardial fat. Scan parameters: slices 16 / 0. 75 mm, rotation time 375 ms, feed/rotation 3. 0 mm, mAs 500, slice thickness 1 mm, and FOV 50 mm. Datasets were reconstructed using 4 different kernels (B 30 f-smooth, B 36 f-medium smooth, B 46 f-medium, and B 60 f-sharp). Each scan was scored {{for the presence of}} plaques. Once a plaque was detected, the operator performed attenuation measurements (HU) in coronary lumen, oil, calcified and <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> tissue using the same settings in all datasets. The results were compared with T-test and correlated with Pearson's test. RESULTS: Overall, 464 measurements were performed. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) were found for the mean attenuation of lumen (B 30 f/B 36 f, B 30 f/B 60 f, B 36 f/B 46 f, B 36 f/B 60 f, and B 46 f/B 60 f), oil (B 30 f/B 36 f, B 30 f/B 46 f, B 30 f/B 60 f, B 36 f/B 46 f, and B 46 f/B 60 f), calcium (all kernels), and plaque (B 30 f/B 36 f, B 30 f/B 46 f, B 30 f/B 60 f, and B 46 f/B 60 f) using 4 different kernels. The attenuation values (mean+/-SD) within the lumen (246 +/- 6, 215 +/- 13, 248 +/- 5, and 270 +/- 7), oil (- 123 +/- 3, - 127 +/- 1, - 121 +/- 6, and - 127 +/- 4), calcified plaque tissue (703 +/- 334, 739 +/- 364, 817 +/- 381, and 1181 +/- 503), and <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> tissue (134 +/- 56, 111 +/- 49, 120 +/- 56, and 102 +/- 41) showed high correlation (p< 0. 001) when attenuation of all structures were compared in different kernels.

40|$|Iron-mediated {{oxidation}} of {{low-density lipoprotein}} has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis. The present investigations were performed to test whether hydrophobic fungal siderophores – hexadentate trihydroxamates desferricoprogen, desferrichrome, desferrirubin, and desferrichrysin – might suppress heme-catalyzed LDL oxidation and the toxic effects of heme-treated LDL on vascular endothelium. Indeed, two of these – desferricoprogen and desferrichrome – markedly increased the resistance of LDL to heme-catalyzed oxidation. In similar dose–response fashion, these siderophores also inhibited the generation of LDL products cytotoxic to human vascular endothelium. When iron-free fungal siderophores were added to LDL/heme oxidation reactions, the product failed to induce heme oxygenase- 1, a surrogate marker for the noncytocidal effects of oxidized LDL (not {{in the case of}} desferrichrysin).

Renal malakoplakia is rare in children and generally has a good outcome. In the case presented, however, it caused end stage renal failure in a 5 year old girl. The management dilemmas surrounding renal trans-plantation are highlighted. M alakoplakia, meaning <b>soft</b> <b>plaque,</b> is an uncommon chronic granulomatous inflammatory disorder pri-marily affecting the urinary collecting system in immunocompromised or debilitated adults.

40|$|International audienceMechanical {{response}} and {{properties of the}} arterial wall {{can be used to}} identify the biomechanical instability of plaques and predict their vulnerability to rupture. Shear strain elastography (SSE) is proposed to identify vulnerable plaque features attributed to mechanical structural heterogeneities. The aims of this study were: 1) to report on the potential of SSE to identify atherosclerotic plaques; and 2) to use SSE maps to highlight biomechanical changes in lesion characteristics after directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) interventions. For this purpose, SSE was imaged using in vivo intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) radio-frequency data collected from 12 atherosclerotic patients before and after DCA intervention. Coronary atherosclerotic plaques (pre-DCA) showed high SSE magnitudes with large affected areas. There were good correlations between SSE levels and <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> content (i. e., cellular fibrosis, thrombosis and fibrin) (mean |SSE| vs. <b>soft</b> <b>plaque</b> content: r =  0. 82, p <  0. 01). Significant differences were noticed between SSE images before and after DCA. Stable arteries (post-DCA) exhibited lower values than pre-DCA vessels (e. g., pre-DCA: mean |SSE| =  3. 9  ±  0. 2 % vs. 1. 1  ±  0. 2 % post-DCA, p <  0. 001). Furthermore, SSE magnitude was statistically higher in plaques {{with a high level of}} inflammation (e. g., mean |SSE| had values of 4. 8  ±  0. 4 % in plaques with high inflammation, whereas it was reduced to 1. 8  ±  0. 2 % with no inflammation, p <  0. 01). This study demonstrates the potential of the IVUS-based SSE technique to detect vulnerable plaques in vivo...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{deployment}} of a self-expanding stent in a stenosed artery was evaluated through finite element analysis. The three-layered structure of the artery and their material properties were measured and implemented in our computational models. The instant outcomes, including lumen gain, tissue prolapse, and stress distribution, were quantified, {{and the effect of}} plaque calcification was evaluated. Results showed that the peak wall stress occurred on the media layer regardless of plaque calcification. The calcified plaque mitigated the tissue prolapse and arterial wall stresses in general, compared with the <b>soft</b> <b>plaque.</b> However, the lesion calcification led to a more severe residual stenosis, dogboning effect, and corresponding edge stress concentrations after stenting, which requires pre- and/or post-surgical management...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Polymorphonuclear {{neutrophils}} (PMN) in atherosclerotic plaques {{have been}} identified only recently, and their contribution to plaque development is not yet fully understood. In this study, production of elastase, interleukin (IL) - 8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by PMN was investigated in subjects with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS: The study enrolled 50 patients (Pts) and 10 healthy subjects (HS). Circulating PMN (cPMN) isolated from venous blood (in both Pts and HS) and from plaques (pPMN, in Pts) were cultured, alone or with 0. 1 μM fMLP. Elastase, IL- 8 and VEGF mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR. In CEA specimens, PMN were localized by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In both Pts cPMN and pPMN, IL- 8 mRNA was higher at rest but lower after fMLP (P< 0. 01 vs HS), and VEGF mRNA was higher both at rest and after fMLP (P< 0. 01 vs HS), while elastase mRNA was not significantly different. On the contrary, protein production was always higher in cPMN of HS with respect to values measured in cells of Pts. In CEA specimens, CD 66 b+ cells localized to areas with massive plaque formation close to neovessels. Pts with <b>soft</b> and mix <b>plaques,</b> as defined by computed tomography, {{did not differ in}} cPMN or pPMN IL- 8, VEGF or elastase mRNA, or in intraplaque CD 66 b+ cell density. However, Pts with <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> had higher white blood cell count due to increased PMN. CONCLUSIONS: In Pts with carotid plaques, both circulating and intraplaque PMN produce IL- 8, VEGF and elastase, which are crucial for plaque development and progression. These findings suggest mechanistic explanations to the reported correlation between PMN count and cardiovascular mortality in carotid ATH...|$|R
30|$|Attenuation of the {{abdominal}} aorta was recorded {{from a single}} ROI (mean area, 183  cm 2; range, 77 – 260) that was relatively {{the same size as}} the vessel lumen at the level of the celiac trunk. Calcifications and <b>soft</b> <b>plaques</b> were carefully avoided for each ROI. Attenuation of the portal vein was also recorded from a single ROI (mean area, 93  cm 2; range, 40 – 197) at the level of the main portal vein. ROIs as large as the vessel were carefully placed to reduce the effect of inhomogeneous attenuation of the vessel. Attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma was recorded as the average of the CT values of 3 ROIs (mean area, 400  cm 2; range, 384 – 414) placed on the anterior and posterior segment and on the left lobe of the liver. Areas containing hepatic tumors and focal changes in the liver, large vessels and prominent artifacts were also avoided. Attenuation of the paraspinal muscle was recorded from a single ROI (mean area, 196  cm 2; range, 118 – 220) without including the macroscopic area of fat infiltration. Image noises were measured for each image set as standard deviations of pixel values from ovoid ROIs (mean area, 201  cm 2; range, 180 – 209) drawn on the homogenous region of subcutaneous fat tissue in the anterior abdominal wall.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the native coronary artery (CA), coronary atherosclerotic plaque, coronary by-pass grafts and coronary stents with 128 -slice CT, comparison of findings with literature and technical optimization. In one hundred fifty patients who had undergone coronary computerized tomography angiography using 128 -slice CT (CCTA), CAs were examined in terms of visibility, atherosclerotic plaque characteristics, by-pass graft and stent patency. In each case, CAs were divided into fifteen segments according to the American Heart Association (AHA) classification and then evaluated. Out of one hundred and fifty (150) cases, 2250 CA segments were examined according to AHA classification. A total of 1045 segments below 2 mm were examined for visibility. Fifty segments could not be visualized. <b>Soft</b> <b>plaques</b> were observed in 97 cases (4 cases with calcium load = 0). Atherosclerotic plaques were observed in 450 segments. By-pass grafts were observed in ten cases while 28 stents were observed in fifteen cases. In cases with by-pass graft, artifacts due to clips did not hinder the examination. In conjunction with technological advances, CAs can be non-invasively examined using new generation multi-dimensional computerized tomography. Clips artifacts in coronary stents and by-pass grafts do not hinder CA examination due to high spatial and temporal resolution of MDCT devices.
