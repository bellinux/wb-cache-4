5|$|Central Independent Television had {{confidence}} in the project, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it very expensive compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E

Similarly, the site at Forteviot, in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral {{and has an}} axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and a carved wooden bowl.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

5|$|Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based {{systematics}} {{have usually}} given the Hexapoda {{the rank of}} superclass, and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha {{on the basis of}} internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was {{not a member of the}} group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group).

5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} {{determined}} by two factors: first, the Crown wanted to protect the settlement from being destroyed by rebels like the Munster plantation. <b>So</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> settling the planters in isolated pockets of land confiscated from convicted rebels, they confiscated all {{of the land and}} redistributed it, creating concentrations of British settlers around new towns and garrisons. The new landowners were explicitly banned from taking on Irish tenants, and had to import their tenant farmers from England and Scotland. The remaining Irish landowners were granted one quarter of the land in Ulster. The common Irish residents were to be relocated to live near garrisons and Protestant churches, the more ready for Protestant control. The Planters were barred from selling their lands to any Irishman.|$|E

The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing too rich or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for {{the rise and fall of}} governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash. To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee.|$|E

25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development.

It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, <b>so,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E

25|$|<b>So</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> {{treat the}} issue as a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of {{variation}} selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but {{also in terms of}} underlying meaning {{as in the case of}} a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle Sulla erected a trophy which he dedicated to the Roman gods Mars, for delivering victory to Rome, and also to Venus, in the spirit of fortune for the luck granted to the Romans. Further, he held victory games at Thebes, during which he may have been made aware of the approach of Valerius Flaccus who had recently landed in Epirus. Flaccus and Sulla met in Thessaly, though neither army made a move, both armies set up camp and waited for the other to attack. No attack came, and after some time Flaccus' soldiers began to desert in favour of Sulla, at first slowly but with time in increasing numbers, eventually Flaccus had to break camp or lose his entire army. During this time, Archelaus, who had wintered on the Island of Euboea, was reinforced by a large army of Mithridates at Chalcis and decided to move back into Boeotia. Both Sulla and Flaccus were aware of these developments, <b>so,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> waste Roman troops to fight each other, Flaccus took his soldiers and headed for Asia Minor while Sulla turned back to face Archelaus once again. Sulla moved his army a few miles to the east of Chaeronea and into position near Orchomenos, a place he chose for its natural entrenchment. Here, Sulla once more, and once again outnumbered, faced off against Archelaus at the Battle of Orchomenus.|$|E

500|$|The walls, {{known as}} Changcheng (長城) – {{literally}} [...] "long walls", but often translated as [...] "Great Wall" [...] – were mostly constructed of tamped earth, with some parts built with stones. Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence, {{the walls were}} erected sparingly, but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist. Often {{in addition to the}} wall, the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall, and watchtowers outside at regular intervals. In terms of defence, the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics, but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature. Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands, and <b>so</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> being defensive, the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions. This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls, suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies. It is entirely possible, as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest, that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period.|$|E
