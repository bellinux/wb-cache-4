30|$|Noise and {{vibration}} reductions {{are attractive}} topics in planetary gear trains (PGT), {{especially for those}} induced by the mesh and planet-pass excitations. The typical vibrations of a <b>spur</b> <b>ring</b> gear were analytically examined, and the relationships between mesh phase and in-plane elastic vibrations were identified based on symmetry [1]. While similar symmetry is held in helical PGT, the elastic vibration can be more complex to analyze. A question that can possibly be encountered during analysis is how the vibrations change.|$|E
30|$|Alternatively, Wang et al. [1] {{used the}} {{response}} {{instead of the}} excitation superposition to predict vibration of an elastic <b>spur</b> <b>ring</b> gear and found the phasing effect of basic parameters on typical flexural-extensional vibrations. The results imply that if the wavenumber is zero or unity, the rigid vibration modes are identical with those in Ref. [25]. While {{the responses of the}} helical ring gear can be more complex, typical vibrations could remain due to the mechanics similarities in their common symmetries, and the correspondence between the rigid and elastic vibrations could exist in helical PGT. These are the primary concerns of this work.|$|E

A little distance from the house were the kitchen, bakery, dairy, huge barns for storing the produce, and wood-piles big as houses, the wood being nothing but stalks of the cardoon thistle or wild artichoke, which burns like paper, so that immense quantities had to be collected to supply fuel for a large establishment.|$|R

The ring was a slanted cylinder where the front, which contained a groove for holding the bow string, was higher than the back. An excavation of the Marquis of Jin's tomb in Quwo County, Shanxi revealed a Western Zhou jade thumb ring, which had a lipped design but featured taotie decorations similar to the Shang dynasty Fu Hao ring. From the Warring States period through the Han dynasty (475 BCE-220 CE), excavated rings typically had a lipped design with a distinctive spur on the side (there exist several theories about the <b>spur's</b> function). <b>Rings</b> from the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) were round cylinders or D-shaped cylinders.|$|R

30|$|A {{statistically}} significant difference in cylindrical axis and scleral rigidity coefficient was found during the active and inactive inflammation phases. Our {{findings suggest that the}} modification of the scleral rigidity induces an alteration in the stability of the corneal contour at the limbus. This scleral–corneal interaction was reported by Newton and Meek in 1998 [9]. They described that at the limbus, the deep fibers of the sclera tighten to form the scleral <b>spur,</b> a rigid <b>ring</b> structure that together with the corneal annulus (which is formed by a circumferential swath of limbal fibrils originating in the cornea) probably accounts for the stability of the corneal contour.|$|R
30|$|Mesh {{vibrations}} {{have been}} studied by previous researchers with various methods. Wu and Parker [11] and Parker and Wu [12] built up an elastic-discrete model and examined the rigid-elastic vibration of spur PGT, and they proved the rotational, translational, planet, and purely ring modes, {{each of which has}} specific ring gear wavenumber. Authors of this work obtained the first three elastic modes by using the superposition method [1, 52]. Since only the ring gear and ring-planet mesh are included there, the purely ring modes in Ref. [11] cannot be found. Similar vibration modes have been found for <b>spur</b> and helical <b>ring</b> gears, though the wavenumber links more deformations. The reason behind this is that the methods focus on the deformation’s period instead of its amplitude such that they have general meaning. This has been verified by the comparison between the results in this work and those in Ref. [1].|$|R

Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Part K, Journal of Multi-body Dynamics, 231 (3), pp. 504 - 518. Copyright © 2017 Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Reprinted by permission of SAGE Publications. A planetary gearbox model comprising five <b>spur</b> gears (sun, <b>ring</b> and three planets) and the carrier has been developed and analysed. The influence of gear teeth backlash and friction during mixed regime of lubrication has been taken into consideration. Greenwood and Tripp model is employed, while viscous friction is calculated analytically using the functions of Evans and Johnson. A combined tribodynamics modeling approach has been implemented and modal analysis is performed in order to predict the coupled mechanism of tribological and dynamic behavior, subjected to backlash and excited at the gear meshing frequency. The software used for the simulations is ADAMS MSc (Student Edition), where the model variables (concerning gear geometry and forcing functions) have been added in a parametric way. The results showed that small variations of the dynamic transmission error affect notably the viscous friction through changing the contact load between the engaged teeth pairs. Also, higher values of the Stribeck oil parameter due to higher film thickness or lower surface roughness in the mixed lubrication regime lead to reduction of the boundary friction, whereas a reduction of the total generated friction occurs when increasing the angular velocity of the input gear body (due to higher film thickness and smaller asperity interactions). The above lead to reduced power loss of the mechanism. Finally, a characterization of the system dynamics is presented using the calculated eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the corresponding linearized system. Potential interactions with the gear meshing frequency of the system are also examined...|$|R

40|$|Fourteen {{steps of}} {{spermatid}} {{development in the}} tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), from the newly formed spermatid {{to the release of}} the spermatozoon into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, were recognised at the ultrastructural level using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. This study confirmed that although the main events are generally similar, the process of the differentiation of the spermatid in marsupials is notably different and relatively more complex than that in most studied eutherian mammals and birds. For example, the sperm head rotated twice in the late stage of spermiogenesis: the shape of the spermatid changed from a T-shape at step 10 into a streamlined shape in step 14, and then back to T-shape in the testicular spermatozoa. Some unique figures occurring during the spermiogenesis in other marsupial species, such as the presence of Sertoli cell <b>spurs,</b> the nuclear <b>ring</b> and the subacrosomal space, were also found in the tammar wallaby. However, an important new finding of this study was the development of the postacrosome complex (PAC), a special structure that was first evident as a line of electron dense material on the nuclear membrane of the step 7 spermatid. Subsequently it became a discontinuous line of electron particles, and migrated from the ventral side of the nucleus to the area just behind the posterior end of the acrosome, which was closely located to the sperm–egg fusion site proposed for Monodelphis domestica (Taggart et al. 1993). The PAC and its possible role in both American and Australian marsupials requires detailed examination. Distinct immature features were discovered in the wallaby testicular spermatozoa. A scoop shape of the acrosome was found on the testicular spermatozoa of the tammar wallaby, which was completely different to the compact button shape of acrosome in ejaculated spermatozoa. The fibre network found beneath the cytoplasm membrane of the midpiece of the ejaculated sperm also did not occur in the testicular spermatozoa, although the structure of the principal piece was fully formed and had no obvious morphological difference from that of the epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa. The time frame of the formation of morphologically mature spermatozoa in the epididymis of the tammar wallaby needs to be determined by further studies...|$|R
