A United States consul ought to be of some use to his fellow-citizens abroad; and if he allows them to walk their legs off hunting up a hotel which he could have found at the first police-station if he had {{happened}} to think of it, he won't be very anxious to tell the joke, I suppose?" ...|$|R

50|$|The next morning, {{after the}} news of the robbery has spread, Davis quickly looks for a lead on the missing statuette, desperate to acquire it at any cost. He meets Simon, who says he will give the Venus to him, but that he can never mention the statue to anyone, or see Nicole again. He <b>says</b> <b>Davis</b> will be {{contacted}} later about payment. Later, Nicole joins Simon at his table to celebrate the robbery. Simon finally reveals to Nicole that he is not a professional burglar, but an expert investigator hired by major art galleries to strengthen security and uncover forgeries. The Cellini Venus was, in fact, his first heist.|$|E
5000|$|According to Otis Davis, {{a student}} athlete whom Bowerman coached at the University of Oregon, who later {{went on to}} win two gold medals at the 1960 Summer Olympics, Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting a claim that they were made for Phil Knight. <b>Says</b> <b>Davis,</b> [...] "I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first.

And in August, he will prove it again, not only to Astros fans, but across America, when he belts a homer in the upcoming movie, Night Game. Parts of the movie were filmed in the Astrodome last year and director Peter Masterson <b>says</b> <b>Davis</b> proved to be the man he needed for a tricky plot twist. We needed an Astro to hit a home run and Davis was the one that hit it, so he got in the movie, laughed Masterson in a call from his New York home." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ads {{featuring}} barely clad or naked {{women have}} been criticized by some feminist animal rights advocates. When Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis posed naked for Playboy, donating half her $100,000 fee to PETA, the group issued a press release <b>saying</b> <b>Davis</b> [...] "turns the other cheek in an eye-opening spread," [...] then announced she had been photographed naked with Hugh Hefner's dog for an anti-fur ad. In 1995, PETA formed a partnership with Playboy to promote human organ donation, with the caption [...] "Some People Need You Inside Them" [...] on a photograph of Hefner's wife. The long-standing campaign, [...] "I'd rather go naked than wear fur," [...] in which celebrities and supermodels strip for the camera, generated particular concern.|$|R

To give form to this diversity, the 26 papers are organized into sections dealing with the current state of gender and women's studies, cultural representations and critiques, knowledge, globalization and the state, work and family, intimate relationships and sexualities, embodiment in a technological world, and making change. The contributions primarily consist of reviews of the literature in various subdivisions of the field, but authors also offer thoughts on future directions for research...|$|R

5000|$|At age 13, Brown was {{discovered}} by Hitmission Records, a local production team that visited his father's gas station while searching for new talent. Hitmission's Lamont Fleming provided voice coaching for Brown, and the team helped to arrange a demo package and approached contacts in New York to seek a record deal. [...] Tina Davis, senior A&R executive at Def Jam Recordings, was impressed when Brown auditioned in her New York office, and she immediately took him to meet {{the former president of}} the Island Def Jam Music Group, Antonio [...] "L.A."

5000|$|Not {{only can}} Davis put on silk topper and cloak and pass for Mandrake, but Mrs. Davis can slip {{into one of}} the fashionable frocks of Narda, the heroine, and Mandrake fans would see the resemblance. Mrs. Davis, as a matter of fact, often draws Narda. An artist in her own right, and a fashion {{illustrator}} for a St. Louis department store until early in War II, Martha Davis got in the habit of drawing Narda—and sometimes the entire strip—when her husband was working with the Curtiss-Wright Corp., illustrating Air Force manuals. [...] "Without her help," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Davis,</b> [...] "Mandrake probably would have folded." [...] Mrs. Davis enjoyed her work on the strip so much she stayed on after the War. Now the couple produce it as a joint effort, but Phil usually does Mandrake and Martha usually does Narda. They work in a studio in downtown St. Louis, move out into the Ozarks in the summer. Mandrake is another strip with double-appeal—to the men for adventure action, and to the women because of the accurate modishness of Narda's wardrobe. Davis denies any resemblance, especially Mandrake's lust for strenuous exercise. [...] "When I get the desire to exercise," [...] he says, [...] "I just lie down for awhile [...] until it passes." ...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{the book}} {{demonstrates}} how there are continuities from colonial policies to UN institutions today. For instance, the UN absorbed European understandings of arid lands and desertification, and UN agencies largely replaced colonial institutions {{as the main}} actors in supporting and reproducing the desertification narrative. In fact, after the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{was established in the}} 1970 s, the first international conference that UNEP organised was on desertification as a global problem in 1977. The solution to the problem, as it had been during the colonial period, was seen to be expert-led, top-down initiatives totally neglecting the knowledge held by dryland peoples themselves. This approach also explains why {{there have been so many}} development failures in the drylands, <b>says</b> <b>Davis.</b>|$|E

40|$|John Davis {{has written}} this book because {{individuals}} are important. This is obvious, some will say. But {{not necessarily to}} economists, <b>says</b> <b>Davis.</b> Equipped with a respectable knowledge of relevant psychological, sociological, and philosophical theories, Davis examines in depth various representations of the individual in economics. He presents a useful, insightful and interesting picture of the various influences from other social sciences on the current characterisation of individuals that may {{be considered as a}} recent history of the representation of the economic agent. Davis also proposes other theories from philosophy and the social sciences that economists should incorporate to pay justice to what individuals are. He thus continues an analysis of the economic agent that he started in his previous book (Davis 2003). Whereas in his first book he was primarily concerned with explaining his methodology and considering what he calls “orthodox ” and “heterodox” representations of the economic agent, this time he is focusing on wha...|$|E

Pinky was seen by many as the [...] "Father of Modern Athletic Training".|$|R
50|$|Perhaps the {{heaviest}} point of controversy {{is the question}} of blame for the California electricity crisis. Former Governor Gray Davis's critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis to the power trading fraud and corporate accounting scandals and <b>say</b> that <b>Davis</b> did all he could considering the fact that the federal government, not states, regulate interstate power commerce.|$|R
5000|$|On June 25, 2013, {{she held}} an eleven hour long {{filibuster}} to block Senate Bill 5, a measure which included more restrictive abortion regulations for Texas. The filibuster {{played a major}} role in Senate Democrats' efforts to delay passage of the bill beyond the midnight deadline for the end of the legislative session, though it ultimately passed in a second session. On August 5, 2013, when asked about what legal limits on abortion she would support, she replied, [...] "You know, the Supreme Court has made that decision. And it’s one of the protected liberties under our Constitution. And I respect the constitutional protections that are in place today." [...] In October 2013, campaign spokesman Bo Delp told Politifact by email it’s incorrect to <b>say</b> <b>Davis</b> opposes any limits. [...] "Like most Texans, Sen. Davis opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered, in cases of rape or incest or in the case of severe and irreversible fetal abnormalities," [...] Delp said. Also in October 2013, EMILY's List endorsed Wendy Davis for governor in 2014.|$|R
