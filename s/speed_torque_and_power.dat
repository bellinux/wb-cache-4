Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for <b>speed,</b> <b>torque,</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{with the performance}} of the travelling wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM). The performance of TWUSM is mainly constraint by the quality of the piezoceramic material, the electrical driving signal synchronisation and optimization, the heat dissipation system during the operation and the stator-roto interface designed. One of the factors in the stator-rotor interface design is the deflection amplifier mechanism. Under travelling wave electrical excitation, the piezoceramic layer of the stator vibrates by expanding and compressing. The amplitude of the vibration is amplified by the metal attached {{on the top of the}} piezoceramic layer. The metal vibration is in contact with the rotor and through a frictional layer, torque is generated and the rotor rotates. This mechanism of transferring the piezoceramic vibration to the rotor motion is called deflection amplifier. Current TWUSM utilises the comb-teeth structure as the deflection amplifier. One of the factors that influence the deflection amplifier is the position of the stator neutral axis to the contact surface of the stator. Thus, the objective of this thesis is to modify the design of the comb-teeth stator so that the neutral axis position is further distance from the stator top contact surface. The proposed solution is to remove selected mass element from the combteeth structure. Modelling and simulation of the proposed concept were carried out under Marc Mentat FEM software utilising Shinsei USR 60 as the chosen TWUSM. Results from the modal, harmonic, transient and stress analyses indicate that the modified comb-teeth stator increases the position of the neutral axis from the stator top surface. Due to the neutral axis shifting, simulation results also confirm that the stator speed increases for the modified stator. To observe the performance of the modified stator, experiments were conducted using Shinsei USR 60 as the test platform. One set of Shinsei USR 60 motor was modified by drilling hole to the comb-teeth structure. Results from experiments confirm that the motor with the modified stator produced better <b>speed,</b> <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> consumption...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{model scale}} tests of ships {{are carried out}} without {{taking into account the}} {{dynamics}} of the shipboard systems that are involved in the operation under consideration. An example of this is the way that model scale free sailing tests in waves are carried out. The ship model is mounted with an electric motor, shaft and propeller and subsequently tests are carried out with constant propeller speed. In some cases constant shaft torque or constant power are employed. However, neither of these options reflects realistic behaviour of the drive system, because in waves and during manoeuvres the propeller <b>speed,</b> <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> are in fact variable and their dynamic behaviour is governed by the drive train characteristics. The question arises to what extent, and in which cases, the dynamics of the shipboard systems affect the overall system behaviour. In this paper the application of Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation in a ship model basin or towing tank is explored as a means to answering that question. The ambition is to develop an instrumented model scale ship of which the components of the drive train and its control are included by means of a correctly scaled time domain computer simulation model of the propulsion system. This simulation model is to run on a real-time processor which, via IO cards, provides electric power to an electric motor on-board the instrumented model scale ship, which in turn drives one or multiple shafts and propulsors. In this paper the role of scale effects on the test set-up is discussed. It is also shown that, in order to simulate realistic drive train dynamics in waves and during manoeuvres, it must be ensured that the combination of partial simulated drive train {{on the one hand and}} electric motor dynamics plus shaft and propeller inertia on the other hand should, as a total, represent the real dynamics of the drive train system. </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the accuracy}} of the estimated mechanical speed and electromagnetic torque in a Direct Torque Controlled (DTC) induction motor drive with no speed measurement. A literature study has been performed in order to reveal new areas where the DTC technology can expand to, and this knowledge was compared with the accuracy data to determine the most feasible areas of expansion. The most promising new technique is to combine the DTC technique, with its estimation of <b>speed,</b> <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>power,</b> with a model based method of estimating load state variables. If the load is observable using the DTC estimates, and the estimates are considered accurate enough for control purposes, this could potentially replace load process measurements such as mass flow or process pressure. A model based method could also increase the knowledge available about the load, leading to more efficient control methods and reduced energy consumption. A MATLAB Simulink model of the DTC drive was implemented using a DTC drive block from the SimPowerSystems library as basis. The original block speed controller relied on a speed measurement feedback, but a new speed, torque and flux estimator using only current and voltage measurements was implemented, and the speed measurement feedback replaced with a speed estimate feedback. Lab measurements from a preliminary project were analyzed and compared to the simulation setup results. A simplified transfer function from measured speed to DTC estimated speed is suggested. It is equal to the speed estimate low pass filter transfer function. Several analyses show this to be a good approximation. The unfiltered speed estimation is shown to have a very high accuracy of better than 0. 3 % error for applied load torque frequencies of up to 10 Hz, when the estimated data is used as input to frequency analyses. But the unfiltered speed signal also has a very high ripple, explaining the need for the low pass speed filter. The filtered speed estimate has some measurement errors, due to the damping in the speed filter. The estimated electromagnetic torque is very accurate, {{which is one of the}} strengths of DTC. The different parameters in the DTC setup, and their impact on the speed and torque estimates, were analyzed. The speed filter setting and the DTC speed sampling time was found to be the most important settings considering {{the accuracy of}} the speed estimation. Some improvements in the speed estimate calculation in the simulation model are suggested to improve the speed estimate. Improvements are also suggested for the ACS 800 DTC drive in the lab setup. Where increasing the memory available for sampling would significantly improve the frequency analyses...|$|E

The EDV is a small one-seater vehicle with mass of approximately ~ 400 kg and {{is equipped with a}} steer-by-wire system.

Conclusion: This model {{could be used as}} a tool in neuromuscular disorders for enhancing the functionality of robot assisted upper limb therapy and data from model could help the therapist to know about actual resistance force at each joint and quality of exercise trajectory achieved by each subject...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} a {{proof of concept}} for a torsional inchworm type motor. The prototype motor has shown that piezoelectric stack actuators {{can be used for}} rotary inchworm motor. The discrete linear motion of piezoelectric stacks can be converted into rotary stepping motion. The stacks with its high force and displacement output are suitable actuators for use in piezoelectric motor. The designed motor is capable of delivering high <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>speed.</b> Critical issues involving the design and operation of piezoelectric motors were studied. The tolerance between the contact shoes and the rotor has proved to be very critical to the performance of the motor. Based on the prototype motor, a waveform optimization scheme was proposed and implemented to improve the performance of the motor. The motor was successfully modeled in MATLAB. The model closely represents the behavior of the prototype motor. Using the motor model, the input waveforms were successfully optimized to improve the performance of the motor in term of <b>speed,</b> <b>torque,</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> precision. These optimized waveforms drastically improve the speed of the motor at different frequencies and loading conditions experimentally. The optimized waveforms also increase the level of precision of the motor. The use of the optimized waveform is a break-away from the traditional use of sinusoidal and square waves as the driving signals. This waveform optimization scheme can be applied to any inchworm motors to improve their performance. The prototype motor in this dissertation as a proof of concept was designed to be robust and large. Future motor can be designed much smaller and more efficient with lessons learned from the prototype motor...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{systems in}} modern diesel engines are {{designed and built}} to comply with very stringent environmental standards. They should also meet {{the highest level of}} fuel economy. Drivability, rapid response and easy and accurate control are a common demand. Changing the fuel characteristics could affect the performance of the fuel injection system. This study focuses on the evaluation of fuel spray characteristics of straight used cooking oil (SUCO) and its blends with petroleum diesel (PD) as a surrogate for pure PD. Used cooking oil blends have quite different physical properties from those of pure PD. Data for the lower heating value (LHV), density and viscosity were obtained from laboratory analysis. These data were merged with the physical and thermodynamic conditions of the diesel engine of interest to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the fuel jet in 360 ° of crank rotation namely, the compression stroke, <b>and</b> the <b>power</b> stroke including the injection process. Engine operational conditions were calculated using a diesel dual thermodynamic cycle taking into account fuel injection adjustment at three different speeds, namely, idle <b>speed,</b> maximum <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> rated <b>power</b> speed. The results showed that fuel jet characteristics vary with SUCO content in the fuel blend. Two ranges of SUCO content in the blends were distinguished, 0 – 80 % SUCO content and 80 – 100 % SUCO content. Both showed a constant rate of change of jet characters per 10 % increase in SUCO content in the fuel blend. Lower rates of change of fuel characters were observed at 0 - 80 % SUCO content. The higher the temperature, the lower the rate of change of fuel jet characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the dynamic {{response}} of the induction machine to low-frequency perturbations in the shaft <b>torque,</b> supply voltage <b>and</b> supply frequency. Also the response of a two-machine group connected to a weak grid is investigated. The results predicted by various induction machine models are compared with measurements performed on a laboratory set-up. Furthermore, the influence of machine and grid parameters, machine temperature, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect, saturation level and operating points is studied. The results predicted by the fifth-order non-linear Park model agree well with the measured induction machine responses to shaft <b>torque,</b> supply frequency <b>and</b> voltage magnitude perturbations. To determine the electric power response to very low-frequency perturbations in {{the magnitude of the}} supply voltage, the Park model must be modified to take varying iron losses into account. The temperature and supply frequency affect the low-frequency dynamics of the induction machine significantly while the influence of saturation, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect <b>and</b> static shaft <b>torque</b> is of less importance to an ordinary industrial machine. The static shaft torque is, however, of importance for determining the responses to voltage magnitude perturbations. The performance of reduced-order induction machine models depends on the type of induction machine investigated. Best suited to be represented by reduced-order models are high-slip machines as well as machines that have a low ratio between the stator resistance and leakage reactances. A first-order model can predict the rotor <b>speed,</b> electrodynamic <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> electric <b>power</b> responses to shaft <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> supply frequency perturbations up to a perturbation frequency of at least 1 Hz. A second-order model can determine the same responses also for higher perturbation frequencies, at least up to 3 Hz. Using a third-order model, all the responses to <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> frequency perturbations as well as the reactive power response to voltage magnitude perturbations can be determined up to at least 10 Hz...|$|R
40|$|The global {{electrical}} energy consumption is rising {{and there is}} a steady increase in the demand of power generation. So, in addition to conventional power generation units a large no. of renewable energy units are being integrated into the power system. A wind electrical generation system is the most cost competitive, environmentally clean and safe out of all the renewable energy sources. The recent evolution of <b>power</b> semiconductors <b>and</b> variable frequency drive technology has aided the acceptance of variable speed generation systems. Slip ring induction motor in the variable speed double fed induction generator mode is largely used in wind turbine generation technology. Therefore, a detailed model of induction generator is presented in the thesis. Then the induction generator is operated at different operating conditions and the results are presented in the thesis. A hardware set up is build up to estimate the different circuit parameter under different operating conditions. <b>Speed,</b> <b>torque,</b> Active <b>and</b> reactive <b>power</b> estimation are proposed in the thesis with the help of hardware set-up. Because these are the controllable parameter and they determine the machine performance. So, by estimating these parameter our future aim is to manipulate those parameter and to design a closed loop controller for DFIG. This study is relevant as DFIG-wind turbines are an integrated part of Distributed generation system. Any abnormalities associated with grid are going to affect the system performance considerably. Taking this into account, the performance of double fed induction generator (DFIG) variable speed wind turbine under network fault or under dynamic loading is studied. The significant result of the analysis is also shown and being compared with the existing literature to validate the approach. ...|$|R
