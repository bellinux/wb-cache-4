25|$|In this novel, Glasgow {{felt she}} had {{successfully}} reversed the traditional seduction plot by producing a heroine completely freed from the southern patriarchal influence. She believed that writing Barren Ground, a “tragedy,” also freed her for her comedies of manners The Romantic Comedians (1926), They <b>Stooped</b> <b>to</b> Folly (1929), and The Sheltered Life (1932). These late works are considered the most artful criticism of romantic illusion in her career.|$|E
25|$|Hrólfr took a fond {{farewell}} of {{his mother}} and departed over the Fyrisvellir. When they saw Aðils and his warriors in pursuit, they spread the gold behind themselves. Aðils saw his precious Svíagris on the ground and <b>stooped</b> <b>to</b> pick it up with his spear, whereupon Hrólf cut his back with his sword and screamed in triumph that he had bent the back of {{the most powerful man in}} Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Cabell {{maintained}} {{a close and}} lifelong friendship with well-known Richmond writer Ellen Glasgow, whose house on West Main Street {{was only a few}} blocks from Cabell's family home on East Franklin Street. They corresponded extensively between 1923 and Glasgow's death in 1945 and over 200 of their letters survive. Cabell dedicated his 1927 novel Something About Eve to her, and she in turn dedicated her book They <b>Stooped</b> <b>to</b> Folly: A Comedy of Morals (1929) to Cabell. In her autobiography, Glasgow also gave considerable thanks to Cabell for his help in the editing of her Pulitzer Prize-winning book In This Our Life (1941). However, late in their lives, friction developed between the two writers as a result of Cabell's critical 1943 review of Glasgow's novel A Certain Measure.|$|E

25|$|The return {{game against}} was played {{a week later}} on 17 March 2016 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. Defender Adil Rami opened the scoring as he <b>stooped</b> <b>to</b> head a José Antonio Reyes corner in off the post. The match then slipped out of Basel's reach inside two minutes {{at the end of}} the first half. Reyes danced through the Basel defence and his low cross gave Kévin Gameiro an easy finish from close range. A minute later, Michael Krohn-Dehli {{advanced}} with a quick run and was the provider of the cross that found Gameiro. The striker's header came back off the underside of the crossbar and bounced in off his leg to make it 3–0 at half-time. Basel showed only small signs of a fightback. Luca Zuffi's effort from 25 yards out was still rising as it flew over the crossbar. Breel Embolo missed two chances late in the game as the Swiss side were dumped out of the competition. The result extended Sevilla's run of Europa League home wins to 11 – the longest in the competition's history and put a dent in Basel's impressive away record in Europe this season.|$|E
500|$|In {{the events}} leading up to her marriage, Louise's arrival in Berlin, the Prussian capital, caused quite a sensation, and she was greeted with a grand {{reception}} by the city's joyful citizens. When she broke protocol and <b>stooped</b> <b>to</b> pick up and kiss a child, Prussian writer Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué remarked that [...] "The arrival of the angelic Princess spreads over these days a noble splendor. All hearts go out to meet her, and her grace and goodness leaves no one unblessed." [...] Another wrote [...] "The more perfectly one becomes acquainted with the Princess the more one is captivated by the inner nobility, and the angelic goodness of her heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Carte's children's {{production}} earned enthusiastic {{reviews from}} the critic Clement Scott {{and the other}} London critics, {{as well as the}} audiences, including children. However, Captain Corcoran's curse [...] "Damme!" [...] was uncensored, shocking such prominent audience members as Lewis Carroll, who later wrote: [...] "a bevy of sweet innocent-looking girls sing, with bright and happy looks, the chorus 'He said, Damn me! He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning... How Mr. Gilbert could have <b>stooped</b> <b>to</b> write, or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand".|$|E

500|$|During the 2001–02 {{television}} season, the Parents Television Council (PTC), {{a watchdog}} media group, named SpongeBob SquarePants {{among the best}} programs on cable television. However, {{according to a report}} titled Wolves in Sheep's Clothing, which documents the increase in potentially violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming, the PTC and fans believed the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", which originally aired during the 2001–02 season, was an implicit attempt to promote and satirize use of profanity among children. The report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of profanity among children. In a later report, several members of the PTC listed [...] "Sailor Mouth" [...] {{as an example of how}} levels of profane, sexual, and violent activity has increased in children's television programming. Nickelodeon, in response to the incident, said [...] "It's sad and a little desperate that they <b>stooped</b> <b>to</b> literally putting profane language in the mouths of our characters to make a point. Has the FCC looked at this?" [...] Richard Huff of the New York Daily News criticized the report for misinterpreting the episode over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{death warrant}} for Charles was {{eventually}} signed by 59 of the trying court's members, including Cromwell (who {{was the third}} to sign it). Though it was not unprecedented, execution of the king, or [...] "regicide", was controversial, {{if for no other}} reason due to the doctrine of the divine right of kings. Thus, even after a trial, it was difficult to get ordinary men to go along with it: [...] "None of the officers charged with supervising the execution wanted to sign the order for the actual beheading, so they brought their dispute to Cromwell...Oliver seized a pen and scribbled out the order, and handed the pen to the second officer, Colonel Hacker who <b>stooped</b> <b>to</b> sign it. The execution could now proceed." [...] Although Fairfax conspicuously refused to sign, Charles I was executed on 30 January 1649.|$|E

2500|$|Blackie was HMS Prince of Wales's ship's cat. During the Second World War, he {{achieved}} worldwide fame after Prince of Wales carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic to NS Argentia, Newfoundland in August 1941, where he secretly {{met with the}} United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt for several days in a secure anchorage. This meeting resulted in the declaration of the Atlantic Charter, but as Churchill prepared to step off Prince of Wales, Blackie approached. Churchill <b>stooped</b> <b>to</b> bid farewell to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour {{of the success of}} the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill. Blackie survived the sinking of Prince of Wales by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service later that year, and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. [...] He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and his fate is unknown.|$|E
