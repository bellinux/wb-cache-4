Generalized LDPC (G-LDPC) decoders are presented in [7], these aim {{to mitigate the effect}} of prominent trapping sets by combining associated check nodes into “super nodes.” The non-uniqueness of the code’s parity-check matrix (and hence its graph) is utilized in [8] where BP is employed in parallel on a set of equivalent graphs. Backtracking was proposed in [9], which involves the iterative <b>sign</b> <b>flipping</b> of a BP message associated with a non-satisfied check node. Limiting the magnitudes of messages passed in BP can also successfully reduce the error floor [10]. If the BP messages are limited to a small number of bits, then modifying the quantization scheme can improve the performance [11]. The scheduling of message passing in a BP decoder can also be altered, giving rise to serial decoders [12 – 14]. It is also possible to identify particular trapping sets and apply an appropriate perturbation if a known trapping set is present [15].|$|E

40|$|Abstract-One-bit {{compressive}} sensing (CS) {{is known}} to be particularly suited for resource-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we consider 1 -bit CS over noisy WSNs subject to channel-induced bit flipping errors, and propose an amplitude-aided signal reconstruction scheme, by which (i) the representation points of local binary quantizers are designed to minimize the loss of data fidelity caused by local sensing noise, quantization, and bit <b>sign</b> <b>flipping,</b> and (ii) the fusion center adopts the conventional minimization method for sparse signal recovery using the decoded and de-mapped binary data. The representation points of binary quantizers are designed by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the net data mismatch, taking into account the distributions of the nonzero signal entries, local sensing noise, quantization error, and bit flipping; a simple closed-form solution is then obtained. Numerical simulations show that our method improves the estimation accuracy when SNR is low or the number of sensors is small, as compared to state-of-the-art 1 -bit CS algorithms relying solely on the sign message for signal recovery.

40|$|The {{functionality}} of biomolecules {{depends on}} their flexible structures, which can be characterized by their surface shapes. Tracking the deformation and comparing biomolecular shapes are essential in understanding their mechanisms. In this paper, a new spectral shape correspondence analysis method is introduced for biomolecules based on volumetric eigenfunctions. The eigenfunctions are computed from the joint graph of two given shapes, avoiding the <b>sign</b> <b>flipping</b> and confusion {{in the order of}} modes. An initial correspondence is built based on the distribution of a shape diameter, which matches similar surface features in different shapes and guides the eigenfunction computation. A two-step scheme is developed to determine the final correspondence. The first step utilizes volumetric eigenfunctions to correct the assignment of boundary nodes that disobeys the main structures. The second step minimizes the distortion induced by deforming one shape to the other. As a result, a dense point correspondence is constructed between the two given shapes, based on which we approximate and predict the shape deformation, as well as quantitatively measure the detailed shape differences...|$|E
40|$|Based on α-stable random {{projections}} {{with small}} α, we develop a simple algorithm for compressed sensing (sparse signal recovery) by utilizing only the signs (i. e., 1 -bit) of the measurements. Using only 1 -bit information of the measurements results in substantial cost reduction in collection, storage, communication, and decoding for compressed sensing. The proposed algorithm is efficient {{in that the}} decoding procedure requires only one scan of the coordinates. Our analysis can precisely show that, for a K-sparse signal of length N, 12. 3 K N/δ measurements (where δ is the confidence) would be sufficient for recovering the support and {{the signs of the}} signal. While the method is very robust against typical measurement noises, we also provide the analysis of the scheme under random flipping of the signs of the measurements. Compared to the well-known work on 1 -bit marginal regression (which can also be viewed as a one-scan method), the proposed algorithm requires orders of magnitude fewer measurements. Compared to 1 -bit Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) (which is not a one-scan algorithm), our method is still significantly more accurate. Furthermore, the proposed method is reasonably robust against random <b>sign</b> <b>flipping</b> while IHT is known to be very sensitive to this type of noise...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{compressive}} sensing (CS), {{the goal}} is to recover signals at reduced sample rate compared to the classic Shannon-Nyquist rate. However, the classic CS theory assumes the measurements to be real-valued and have infinite bit precision. The quantization of CS measurements has been studied recently and {{it has been shown that}} accurate and stable signal acquisition is possible even when each measurement is quantized to only one single bit. There are many algorithms proposed for 1 -bit compressive sensing and they work well when there is no noise in the measurements, e. g., there are no <b>sign</b> <b>flips,</b> while the performance is worsened when there are a lot of <b>sign</b> <b>flips</b> in the measurements. In this paper, we propose a robust method for recovering signals from 1 -bit measurements using adaptive outlier pursuit. This method will detect the positions where <b>sign</b> <b>flips</b> happen and recover the signals using “correct” measurements.

40|$|Cosmology plays a {{fundamental}} role {{to determine the}} neutrino mass, therefore also to determine its mass hierarchy, since the massive neutrino contributes to the total matter density in the Universe at the background and perturbation levels, once it becomes non-relativistic. After the non-relativistic transition the fluctuations are smashed out at the scales k≫ k_fs. Therefore, the missing fluctuation in the total matter is imprinted on the large scale structure, say {{the suppression of the}} matter power spectrum Δ P/P≈ - 8 f_ν at the scales k≫ k_fs. In this paper, instead of considering the linear perturbation theory, which is well understood in the presence of neutrino, we propose to use the cross correlation between the Rees-Sciama effect and weak lensing to probe the neutrino mass. At the small scales, the density contrast grows faster than the background scale factor δ∼ a, that makes a <b>sign</b> <b>flipping</b> on Φ' ∝Hδ d (δ/a) /d a, which happens only in the non-linear regime. We show that the flipping scale in the cross power spectrum between the Rees-Sciama effect and weak lensing depends on the neutrino mass by assuming the shallow and deep weak lensing surveys. Our analysis shows that the Deep survey has larger signal-to-noise ratio S/N∼ 160. Finally, we use the Fisher information matrix to forecast constraint on the neutrino mass.

30|$|Three electrodeless plasma thrusters, {{in which}} the radio {{frequency}} (rf) electric field penetration is essential, are the Lissajous Helicon Plasma Accelerator (LHPA) (Matsuoka et al. 2012; Nakamura et al. 2012; Nishida et al. 2012), the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) (Ando et al. 2005, 2006; Bering III et al. 2010), and the Ponderomotive Acceleration/Ion Cyclotron Resonance (PA/ICR) (Otsuka et al. 2013 a, 2013 b). First, the LHPA uses a Lorentz force which {{is a product of}} an azimuthal electron current and a radial magnetic field. In the LHPA, two sets of planar antennas are used to electrostatically excite a rotating electric field (REF), which produces the azimuthal electron current (Matsuoka et al. 2012). Second, the VASIMR uses the ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) for the ion acceleration (Bering III et al. 2010). In the VASIMR-type experiment, a helically wound antenna is used to electromagnetically excite an ion cyclotron wave propagating along the magnetic field line (Ando et al. 2005, 2006). Third, the ponderomotive acceleration (PA) uses a <b>sign</b> <b>flipping</b> of a ponderomotive potential near ion gyroresonance, leading to a unidirectional acceleration of ions (Dodin et al. 2004). We examined the PA combined with the ICR using the test particle simulations (Otsuka et al. 2013 a, 2013 b). In our test particle simulations, the rf electromagnetic fields are assumed to be present inside the plasma. This may well be an optimistic simplification because the plasma in general acts to shield the external waves from penetrating inside. Further, in the various experiments on the thrusters, it is difficult to observe the efficiency of the wave penetration, although it {{is directly related to the}} thruster’s performance. In this paper, for applications to various types of electrodeless plasma thrusters in general, we investigate the rf electric field penetration by performing one-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of in depth study of spin structure of magnetoelectric Y-type hexaferrite Ba 2 −xSrxZn 2 Fe 12 O 22 system. Magnetoelectric and multiferroic materials are of high interest from information technology point of view, but traditional mechanism of magnetism and ferroelectricity makes it rare to observe both in single phase materials. One {{of the most}} widely studied non conventional mechanism where cross coupling of magnetism and ferroelectricity takes place in non-collinear spin systems is spin driven ferroelectricity by in-verse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (IDM) mechanism or spin currect mechanism (SC). The spin frustration leading to non-collinear spin arrangements also leads to low magnetic ordering temperature hinders room temperature realization of magnetoelectric coupling effect. Hexaferrite systems are an answer to high temperature magnetoelectric behavior in single phase materials. Y-type hexaferrite with composition Ba 2 −xSrxZn 2 Fe 12 O 22 was the first hexaferrite to show magnetoelectric behavior, where a 2 -fan planar spin structure was proposed, notcompatible with the magnetic field (H) induced ferroelectricity by IDM/SC mechanism. In depth investigation of the spin structure and its relationship with macroscopic field driven ferroelectricity was the central point of this thesis. The widely accepted spin structure of Y-type hexaferrite is a spin block model with large (L) and small (S) spin blocks, collinear in spin arrangements inside the blocks but between the blocks arrangements changes from collinear to spiral depending upon the chemical composition. With change in the Sr content in the composition Ba 2 −xSrxZn 2 Fe 12 O 22 spin structure was reported to change from collinear to in plane spiral in earlier studies. The change in surements in small horizontal applied field perpendicular to (0 0 1) in horizontal scattering geometry. The zero and very low field a helical incommensurate phase with circular dichroism in the diffraction conditions in the magnetic satellite was found. First metamagnetic transition took place from incommensurate to commensurate spin structure when a small magnetic field (< 100 mT) was applied, characterized by (0 0 3 / 2) and (0 0 3 / 4) propagation. Equal intensity for incoming σ and π polarization for (0 0 3 / 2) reflection and absence of circular dichroism in both the satellite reflections leads to a non-chiral 4 -fan structure as reported earlier. By fitting our calculated intensity ratios for linear and circular polarized x-ray shows coexistence of the 4 -fan structure coexisting with the incommensurate low field phase and high field phase in some field ranges. The high field phase, i. e. the ferroelectric phase was a commensurate phase characterized by presence of only (0 0 3 / 2) magnetic satellite. Difference in intensity for (0 0 3 / 2) reflection with incoming σ and π polarization singles out this phase from the low field 4 -fan phase and circular dichroism in the same satellite reveals vector spin chirality in thescattering plane. Maps to circular dichroism produces some spin chiral domains with both chirality, which get inverted upon application of magnetic field in reverse direction. In ver- tical field perpendicular to scattering plane in horizontal scattering geometry the circular dichroism disappears establishing the direction of vector spin chirality. In addition a new phenomena, position dependent linear dichroism appears, which gives same domain config-uration as that was observed in circular dichroism. For the high field phase already proposed 2 -fan model is non chiral and can neither give ferroelectric polarization by IDM/SC mechanism nor circular dichroism and new model is required. Numerical calculations on various probable models to fit our experimental data established the spin structure is a transverse conical structure with both in-plane and out of plane components for both the L and S spin blocks. This transverse conical spin structure with spin chirality in the direction of H can give ferroelectric polarization by IDM/SC mechanism in the direction perpendicular to c and H. Unpolarized neutron diffraction experiments in our sample in vertical magnetic field are also consistent with the proposed model. The ferroelectric chiral phase is separated from the chiral zero field phase by a non chiral 4 -fan phase in the magnetization process. The inversion of chirality by reverse magnetic field can be explained on the basis of absence of non chiral phase in the demagnetization process, facilitating the linkage between the chiral helical phase and the transverse conical phases. Inversion of chirality implies the flip of sign of polarization upon reversing magnetic field direction. Macroscopically no <b>sign</b> <b>flipping</b> was observed in previous reports which we attribute to the difference in composition of our samples. Spin structures were easily visible in magnetization curves, when magnetic field was applied perpendicular to c-axis. In three samples with x = 1. 4, 1. 18 and 0. 72 grown by flux methods, our refinement of single crystal x-ray diffraction data shows that Sr substitution causes local distortion and change in occupancies of Zn in the tetrahedral site which happens to be in the spin block boundary, accompanying a change in the Zn/Fe-O bond length. We speculate that the cumulative effect of local distortion, change in occupations of Zn and bond length change changes the superexchange interaction near the block boundary changing the spin structure. The chiral transverse conical spin structure was found from low field close to 80 mT at 100 K predicting H induced ferroelectricity from this field, considerably lower than that reported by macroscopic measurements. At 300 K similar shape of spin chiral domains with circular dichroism as well as with linear dichroism also found, suggesting transverse conical spin structure at room temperature (RT). Presence of (0 0 3 / 2) propagation was also verified by in field unpolarized neutron diffraction at 300 K. With input from all the scattering experiments and macroscopic magnetization measurements a new phase diagram was constructed which suggested field induced ferroelectricity in this transverse conical spin structure can be realized at very low H and RT in highly resistive samples. As a whole this thesis concludes that magnetic field induced ferroelectricity in y-typehexaferrite of composition Ba 2 −xSrxZn 2 Fe 12 O 22 is by IDM/SC mechanism in a transverse conical spin structure available at very low H and up to RT...|$|E
