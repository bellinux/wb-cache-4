5000|$|He {{was born}} in 1708 and {{admitted}} to Clare College, Cambridge in 1728. From {{a very early age}} he had shown a passion for the natural world. In later life, he owned a modest sized country estate in Stratton <b>Strawless,</b> Norfolk and became friendly with the naturalist Gilbert White, with whom he carried on a lengthy correspondence and who described him as a 'painful and accurate naturalist' (by [...] "painful" [...] he would have meant [...] "painstaking").|$|E

5000|$|From the 14th {{century to}} the end of the 19th century Stratton <b>Strawless</b> hall was the home of the Marsham family which {{included}} Robert Marsham (1707 - 97), the phenologist. Marsham is believed to have planted two million trees on the estate. Most of the plantings were cleared for much-needed timber for the First and Second World War. A few ancient trees remain, and in particular The Great Cedar (planted in 1747). The current hall (then 3 storeys) was completed c. 1800; in 1960 the top storey was removed. During the Second World War the hall housed an operations room for RAF Coltishall. [...] Today, the Grade II listed hall has been converted into residential flats and part of the grounds have been turned into a caravan park.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Marsham is the {{founding}} father of modern phenological recording. Marsham was a wealthy landowner who kept systematic records of [...] "Indications of spring" [...] on his estate at Stratton <b>Strawless,</b> Norfolk, from 1736. These {{were in the}} form of dates of the first occurrence of events such as flowering, bud burst, emergence or flight of an insect. Consistent records of the same events or [...] "phenophases" [...] were maintained by generations of the same family over unprecedentedly long periods of time, eventually ending with the death of Mary Marsham in 1958, so that trends can be observed and related to long-term climate records. The data show significant variation in dates which broadly correspond with warm and cold years. Between 1850 and 1950 a long-term trend of gradual climate warming is observable, and during this same period the Marsham record of oak leafing dates tended to become earlier.|$|E

40|$|In Japan as in Belgium the {{cow house}} should be {{constructed}} as a single-floor-building. As well {{from the point}} of view of labour requirement;and animal health as construction costs the loose house with_ cubicles and concrete slatted floors between the cubicle rows, must be preferred above the stanchion barn, when the size of the herd is 25 or more cows. In Hokkaido the loose house and the stanchion barn should be insulated, the latter more than the former; in Honshu only the stanchion barn and the roof of the loose house must de insulated (K≦ 1). Natural ventilation can give complete satisfaction, when it is well regulated. When constructing a stanchion barn, one should build the <b>strawless</b> type in order to reduce labour requirement. Full attention should be given to all construction details in order to avoid injuries with the cows and save labour...|$|E
