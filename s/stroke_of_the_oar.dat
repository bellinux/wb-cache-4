6000|$|... [205] {247} By night, {{particularly}} in a warm latitude, every <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> every motion of the boat or ship, {{is followed by a}} slight flash like sheet lightning from the water.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{would have}} found keen {{enjoyment}} in the situation, {{had it not been}} for his horse, Lance. The thoroughbred was difficult to hold. As Bill was making strenuous efforts to get in a lucky <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> he failed to see a long length of grapevine floating like a brown snake of the water below. In the excitement they heeded not the barking of Mose. Nor did they see the grapevine straighten and become taut just as they drifted upon it; but they felt the raft strike and hold on some submerged object. It creaked and groaned and the foamy water surged, gurgling, between the logs.|$|E
60|$|The old man whistled {{the younger}} dog to the land; {{and then he}} {{proceeded}} to the final adieus. Little was said on either side. The trapper took each person solemnly by the hand, and uttered something friendly and kind to all. Middleton was perfectly speechless, and was driven to affect busying himself among the baggage. Paul whistled with all his might, and even Obed took his leave with an effort that bore the appearance of desperate philosophical resolution. When {{he had made the}} circuit of the whole, the old man, with his own hands, shoved the boat into the current, wishing God to speed them. Not a word was spoken, nor a <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> given, until the travellers bad floated past a knoll that hid the trapper from their view. He was last seen standing on the low point, leaning on his rifle, with Hector crouched at his feet, and the younger dog frisking along the sands, in the playfulness of youth and vigour.|$|E
60|$|Every <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> {{took them}} {{farther away from}} the fair grounds, and each puff <b>of</b> wind carried <b>the</b> evidences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoner's death nearer the only ones who might take the trouble to search for him.|$|R
60|$|Under <b>the</b> regular <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> <b>the</b> boat {{advanced}} steadily, {{straight out}} to sea. At first the mirror over which they skimmed was grey, and the foam at the cutwater leaden-coloured. By degrees they rowed, as it were, into a brighter region. The sea ahead lightened up, became pale yellow, then warmed into saffron, and, {{when the sun}} rose, blazed into liquid gold.|$|R
60|$|As {{the course}} to {{be taken by the}} barge was {{diagonal}} rather than direct, a few powerful <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> brought it so near the skiff, that Ludlow, by placing his hand on <b>the</b> gunwale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter, could arrest its progress.|$|R
60|$|From {{this moment}} all {{interest}} {{in those who}} formed the vulgar mass was lost. Every eye was turned towards the front, where the strife increased at each <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> and where the issue began to assume a new and doubtful character. The exertions of the waterman of Fusina were seemingly redoubled, though his boat went no faster. The gondola of Bartolomeo shot past him; {{it was followed by}} those of Gino and the masked gondolier, while not a cry betrayed the breathless interest of the multitude. But when the boat of Antonio also swept ahead, there arose such a hum of voices as escapes a throng when a sudden and violent change of feeling is produced in their wayward sentiments. Enrico was frantic with the disgrace. He urged every power of his frame to avert the dishonor, with the desperate energy of an Italian, and then he cast himself {{into the bottom of the}} gondola, tearing his hair and weeping in agony. His example was followed by those in the rear, though with more governed feelings, for they shot aside among the boats which lined the canal, and were lost to view.|$|E
6000|$|... "The cannons {{give the}} signal of departure. The boats dart {{over the water}} with the rapidity of lightning.... They advance and fall behind alternately. One {{champion}} who seems to yield {{the way to a}} rival suddenly leaves him in the rear. The shouts of his friends and kinsmen hail his advantage, while others already passing him, force him to redouble his efforts. Some weaker ones succumb midway, exhausted.... They withdraw, and the kindly Venetian populace will not aggravate their shame with jeers; the spectators glance at them compassionately, and turn again to those still in the lists. Here and there they encourage them by waving handkerchiefs, and the women toss their shawls in the air. Each patrician following close upon his gondolier's boat, incites him with his voice, salutes him by name, and flatters his pride and spirit.... The water foams under the repeated strokes of the oars; it leaps up in spray and falls in showers {{on the backs of the}} rowers already dripping with their own sweat.... At last behold the dauntless mortal who seizes the red banner! His rival had almost clutched it, but one mighty <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> gave him the victory.... The air reverberates with a clapping of hands so loud that at the remotest point on the canal the moment of triumph is known. The victors plant on their agile boat the conquered flag, and instead of thinking to rest their weary arms, take up the oars again and retrace their course to receive congratulations and applause." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ยง VI. We push our way {{on between}} large barges laden with fresh water from Fusina, in round white tubs seven feet across, and {{complicated}} boats full of {{all manner of}} nets that {{look as if they}} could never be disentangled, hanging from their masts and over their sides; and presently pass under a bridge with the lion of St. Mark on its archivolt, and another on a pillar {{at the end of the}} parapet, a small red lion with much of the puppy in his face, looking vacantly up into the air (in passing we may note that, instead of feathers, his wings are covered with hair, and in several other points the manner of his sculpture is not uninteresting). Presently the canal turns a little to the left, and thereupon becomes more quiet, the main bustle of the water-street being usually confined to the first straight reach of it, some quarter of a mile long, the Cheapside of Murano. We pass a considerable church on the left, St. Pietro, and a little square opposite to it with a few acacia trees, and then find our boat suddenly seized by a strong green eddy, and whirled into the tide-way of one of the main channels of the lagoon, which divides the town of Murano into two parts by a deep stream some fifty yards over, crossed only by one wooden bridge. We let ourselves drift some way down the current, looking at the low line of cottages on the other side of it, hardly knowing if there be more cheerfulness or melancholy in the way the sunshine glows on their ruinous but whitewashed walls, and sparkles on the rushing of the green water by the grass-grown quay. It needs a strong <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> to bring us into the mouth of another quiet canal on the farther side of the tide-way, and we are still somewhat giddy when we run the head of the gondola into the sand on the left-hand side of this more sluggish stream, and land under the east end of the Church of San Donato, the [...] "Matrice" [...] or [...] "Mother" [...] Church of Murano.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can take}} place in the rear," [...] meekly {{observed}} Antonio. [...] "There may be those in the line it doth not become one like me to crowd, and a few <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> more or less, can differ but little in so long; a strife." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> moving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parting gondola was {{accompanied}} by no other sound than <b>the</b> usual washing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. In speechless agony Don Camillo saw the boat glide, swifter and swifter at each <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> along <b>the</b> canal, and then whirling round <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> a palace, disappear.|$|R
60|$|In feverish haste Dave {{sent the}} {{flat-bottomed}} boat {{out into the}} creek once more. Roger assisted him, and a few <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> brought <b>the</b> craft alongside <b>of</b> that which had {{been used by the}} Porton party. Then the chums leaped ashore, threw all <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> into <b>the</b> water, and set both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rowboats adrift.|$|R
60|$|The narrowness {{of most of}} {{the canals}} of Venice, with the innumerable angles and the {{constant}} passing, have given rise to a fashion of construction and of rowing that are so peculiar to that city and its immediate dependencies as to require some explanation. The reader has doubtless already understood that a gondola is a long, narrow, and light boat, adapted to the uses of the place, and distinct from the wherries of all other towns. The distance between the dwellings on most of the canals is so small, that the width of the latter does not admit of the use of oars on both sides, at the same time. The necessity of constantly turning aside to give room for others, and the frequency of the bridges and the corners, have suggested the expediency of placing the face of the waterman in the direction in which the boat is steering, and, of course, of keeping him on his feet. As every gondola, when fully equipped, has its pavilion in the centre, the height of the latter renders it necessary to place him who steers on such an elevation as will enable him to overlook it. From these several causes a one-oared boat in Venice is propelled by a gondolier, who stands on a little angular deck in its stern, formed like the low roof of a house, and the <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> is given by a push, instead of a pull, as is common elsewhere. This habit of rowing erect, however, which is usually done by a forward, instead of a backward movement of the body, is not unfrequent in all the ports of the Mediterranean, though in no other is there a boat which resembles the gondola in all its properties or uses. The upright position of the gondolier requires that the pivot on which the oar rests should have a corresponding elevation; and there is, consequently, a species of bumkin raised {{from the side of the}} boat to the desired height, and which, being formed of a crooked and very irregular knee of wood, has two or three row-locks, one above the other, to suit the stature of different individuals, or to give a broader or a narrower sweep of the blade as the movement shall require. As there is frequent occasion to cast the oar from one of these row-locks to the other, and not unfrequently to change its side, it rests in a very open bed; and the instrument is kept in its place by great dexterity alone, and by a perfect knowledge of the means of accommodating the force and the rapidity of the effort to the forward movement of the boat and the resistance of the water. All these difficulties united render skill in a gondolier one of the most delicate branches of a waterman's art, as it is clear that muscular strength alone, though of great aid, can avail but little in such a practice.|$|E
60|$|When Barnstable {{had entered}} his boat, a few <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> sent it, dancing over the waves, to <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. The little vessel was then veered {{off to a}} distance, where it rode in safety under <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> a boat-keeper, and the officer and his men ascended <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lofty frigate.|$|R
60|$|The boat now {{came under}} a shore where the trees fringed the very water, {{frequently}} overhanging the element that mirrored their fantastic forms. At this point, a light skiff was moving leisurely along {{in their own}} direction, but a short distance in advance. On a hint from John Effingham, a few vigorous <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> brought <b>the</b> two boats near each other.|$|R
60|$|Fid and {{the black}} {{promptly}} complied; and the boat was soon skimming the water between the little island and what might, by comparison, be called the main. As they approached <b>the</b> vessel, <b>the</b> <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> were moderated, and finally abandoned altogether, Wilder preferring to let the skiff drop down with the tide upon the object he wished well to examine before venturing to board.|$|R
60|$|They broke {{their way}} through the thin ice in the little harbor, and came out on the lake, where the water, heavy and glassy, froze on their oars with every stroke. The water soon became like mush, {{clogging}} <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> and freezing in the air even as it dripped. Later the surface began to form a skin, and the boat proceeded slower and slower.|$|R
60|$|And so, when Mister Haggin, or God, or call it {{what one}} will with <b>the</b> {{limitations}} <b>of</b> language, picked Jerry up with imperative abruptness, tucked him under his arm, {{and stepped into the}} whaleboat, whose black crew immediately bent to <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> Jerry was instantly and nervously aware that the unusual had begun to happen. Never before had he gone out on board the Arangi, which he could see growing larger and closer to each lip-hissing <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blacks.|$|R
60|$|As she hove to, a {{cable length}} away, <b>the</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Francis Spaight bestirred himself {{and ordered a}} {{tarpaulin}} to be thrown over O'Brien's corpse. A boat was lowered from the stranger's side and began to pull toward them. John Gorman laughed. He laughed softly at first, but he accompanied each <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> with spasmodically increasing glee. It was this maniacal laughter that greeted the rescue boat as it hauled alongside and the first officer clambered on board.|$|R
60|$|While the {{midshipman}} {{was gone}} {{to look for}} the boat, the two admirals walked the cliff, side by side, discussing their future movements; and when all was ready, Sir Gervaise descended to the shore, using the very path by which he had ascended the previous day; and, pushing through the throng that crowded the landing, almost too much engaged to heed even his approach, he entered his barge. In another minute, <b>the</b> measured <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> urged him swiftly towards the Plantagenet.|$|R
60|$|In place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falling net {{were now}} to be heard <b>the</b> quick <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> and <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rope running out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat. Presently the batteau shot into <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> light, and in an instant she was pulled to the shore. Several eager hands were {{extended}} to receive the line, and, both ropes being equally well manned, the fishermen commenced hauling in with slow, and steady drags, Richard standing to the centre, giving orders, first to one party, {{and then to the}} other, to increase or slacken their efforts, as occasion required. The visitors were posted near him, and enjoyed a fair view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole operation. which was slowly advancing to an end.|$|R
60|$|The {{twilight}} was now quite pronounced {{enough for}} his purpose; and as, rather sad at heart, {{he was about to}} move on, a little boat containing two persons glided up <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour with <b>the</b> lightness <b>of</b> a shadow. <b>The</b> boat came opposite him, passed on, and touched the landing-steps at the further end. One of its occupants was a man, as Stephen had known by <b>the</b> easy <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars.</b> When <b>the</b> pair ascended the steps, and came into greater prominence, he was enabled to discern that the second personage was a woman; also that she wore a white decoration--apparently a feather--in her hat or bonnet, which spot <b>of</b> white was <b>the</b> only distinctly visible portion of her clothing.|$|R
60|$|Nearly an hour passed. The calashes {{stretched}} forward {{head first}} and lay back with their faces to the sky, alternately, {{in a regular}} swing that sent the boat flying through the water; and the two sitters, very upright in the stern sheets, swayed rhythmically a little at every <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>oars</b> plied vigorously.|$|R
60|$|I {{was hunting}} for it when <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> {{rowlocks}} {{came to my}} ears. At first, of course, I thought of Charley; but on second thought I knew Charley would be calling out as he rowed along. A sudden premonition of danger seized me. The Marin Islands are lonely places; chance visitors in <b>the</b> dead <b>of</b> night are hardly to be expected. What if it were Yellow Handkerchief? The sound made by the rowlocks grew more distinct. I crouched {{in the sand and}} listened intently. The boat, which I judged a small skiff from <b>the</b> quick <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> was landing in the mud about fifty yards up the beach. I heard a raspy, hacking cough, and my heart stood still. It was Yellow Handkerchief. Not to be robbed of his revenge by his more cautious companions, he had stolen away from the village and come back alone.|$|R
60|$|Then {{followed}} a long, detailed discourse, {{on the subject}} before them, in which Greenly joined; the latter making several useful suggestions to <b>the</b> veteran commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carnatic. After passing quite an hour in <b>the</b> cabin <b>of</b> Parker, Sir Gervaise took his leave and re-entered his barge. It was now so dark that small objects could not be distinguished a hundred yards, and <b>the</b> piles <b>of</b> ships, as <b>the</b> boat glided past them, resembled black hillocks, with clouds floating among their tree-like and waving spars. No captain presumed to hail the commander-in-chief, as he rowed down the line, again, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> realm. He indeed had always something to say; and, {{as he had been}} conjecturing what could induce the vice-admiral to pay so long a visit to the Carnatic, he could not refrain from uttering as much aloud, when he heard <b>the</b> measured <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> from <b>the</b> returning barge.|$|R
60|$|A few <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> soon {{placed them}} on <b>the</b> deck <b>of</b> a large clumsy vessel which lay {{anchored}} off {{the entrance to}} the harbour. This was the diver's barge, which exhibited a ponderous crane with a pendulous hook and chain in the place where its fore-mast should have been. Several men were busied about <b>the</b> deck, one <b>of</b> whom sat clothed in <b>the</b> full dress <b>of</b> a diver, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet, which was unscrewed and lay on the deck near his heavily-weighted feet. The dress was wet, and the man was enjoying a quiet pipe, from all which Edgar judged that he was resting after a dive. Near to the plank on which the diver was seated there stood the chest containing the air-pumps. It was open, the pumps were in working order, with two men standing by to work them. Coils of india-rubber tubing lay beside it. Elsewhere were strewn about stones for repairing the pier, and various building tools.|$|R
60|$|In {{the applause}} that followed, and <b>the</b> {{clicking}} <b>of</b> glasses, Senor Perkins slipped away. He mingled {{a moment with}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other guests who had already withdrawn to the corridor, lit a cigar, and then passed through a narrow doorway on to the ramparts. Here he strolled to some distance, as if in deep thought, until he reached a spot where the crumbling wall and its fallen debris afforded an easy descent into the ditch. Following the ditch, he turned an angle, and came upon the beach, and <b>the</b> low sound <b>of</b> <b>oars</b> in <b>the</b> invisible offing. A whistle brought the boat to his feet, and without a word {{he stepped into the}} stern sheets. A few <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> showed him that the fog had lifted slightly from the water, and a green light hanging from <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Excelsior could be plainly seen. Ten minutes' more steady pulling placed him on her deck, where the second officer stood with a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sailors listlessly grouped around him.|$|R
60|$|That breeze blowing stiffly {{from the}} desert was Lionel's friend that day. Without it his career at <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> might have been short indeed. He was chained, like the rest, stark naked, save for a loincloth, in the place nearest the gangway on the first {{starboard}} bench abaft the narrow waist-deck, and ere the galeasse had made the short distance between the mole and the island at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> it, <b>the</b> boatswain's whip had coiled itself about his white shoulders to urge him to better exertion than he was putting forth. He had screamed under the cruel cut, but none had heeded him. Lest the punishment should be repeated, he had thrown all his weight into <b>the</b> next <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar,</b> until by <b>the</b> time the Peรฑon was reached the sweat was running down his body and his heart was thudding against his ribs. It was not possible {{that it could have}} lasted, and his main agony lay in that he realized it, and saw himself face to face with horrors inconceivable that must await <b>the</b> exhaustion <b>of</b> his strength. He was not naturally robust, and he had led a soft and pampered life that was very far from equipping him for such a test as this.|$|R
60|$|But {{for this}} range <b>of</b> windows, <b>the</b> little piazza SS. Apostoli {{would be one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least picturesque in Venice; to those, however, who seek it on foot, it becomes {{geographically}} interesting from <b>the</b> extraordinary involution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alleys leading to it from the Rialto. In Venice, the straight road is usually by water, and the long road by land; but <b>the</b> difference <b>of</b> distance appears, in this case, altogether inexplicable. Twenty or thirty <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oar</b> will bring a gondola from <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rialto to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ponte SS. Apostoli; but the unwise pedestrian, who has not noticed the white clue beneath his feet,[87] may think himself fortunate, if, after {{a quarter of an}} hour's wandering among the houses behind the Fondaco de' Tedeschi, he finds himself anywhere in <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> point he seeks. With much patience, however, and modest following <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guidance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marble thread, he will at last emerge over a steep bridge into <b>the</b> open space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Piazza, rendered cheerful in autumn by a perpetual market of pomegranates, and purple gourds, like enormous black figs; while the canal, at its extremity, is half-blocked up by barges laden with vast baskets of grapes as black as charcoal, thatched over with their own leaves.|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} to vary <b>the</b> monotony <b>of</b> such a scene, for an hour, but <b>the</b> regular rolling <b>of</b> a sea that was but little agitated, a few {{occasional}} <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars,</b> that were given {{in order to keep}} the barge in its place, or <b>the</b> heavy breathing <b>of</b> some smaller fish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cetaceous kind, as it rose to the surface to inhale the atmosphere. In no quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavens was any thing visible; not even a star was peeping out, to cheer the solitude and silence of that solitary place. The men were nodding on the thwarts and our young sailor was about to relinquish his design as fruitless, when suddenly a noise was heard, at no great distance from the spot where they lay. It was one of those sounds which would have been inexplicable to any but a seaman, but which conveyed a meaning to <b>the</b> ears <b>of</b> Ludlow, as plain as that which could be imparted by speech to a landsman. A moaning creak was followed by <b>the</b> low rumbling <b>of</b> a rope, as it rubbed on some hard or distended substance; and then succeeded <b>the</b> heavy flap <b>of</b> canvas, that, yielding first to a powerful impulse, was suddenly checked.|$|R
60|$|The exploits, {{the mysterious}} character, and <b>the</b> daring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Water-Witch, and <b>of</b> him who sailed her, were, in that day, <b>the</b> {{frequent}} subjects <b>of</b> anger, admiration, and surprise. Those who found {{pleasure in the}} marvellous, listened to the wonders that were recounted of her speed and boldness, with pleasure; they who had been so often foiled {{in their attempts to}} arrest the hardy dealers in contraband, reddened at her name; and all wondered at the success and intelligence with which her movements were controlled. It will, therefore, create no astonishment when we say, that Ludlow and the Patroon drew near to the light and graceful fabric with an interest that deepened at each <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars.</b> So much <b>of</b> a profession which, in that age, was particularly marked and apart from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> mankind in habits and opinions, had been interwoven into <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former, that he could not see the just proportions, <b>the</b> graceful outlines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull, or the exquisite symmetry and neatness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spars and rigging, without experiencing a feeling somewhat allied to that which undeniable superiority ecites in <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> even a rival. There was also a taste in <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merely ornamental parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delicate machine, which caused as much surprise as her model and rig.|$|R
60|$|The sun had set {{behind a}} bank of cloud, and only a faint yellow light was giving its {{farewell}} kisses to the waves, which were agitated by an active breeze. Deronda, sauntering slowly within sight of what {{took place on the}} strand, observed the groups there concentrating their attention on a sailing-boat which was advancing swiftly landward, being rowed by two men. Amidst the clamorous talk in various languages, Deronda held it <b>the</b> surer means <b>of</b> getting information not to ask questions, but to elbow his way to the foreground and be an unobstructed witness of what was occurring. Telescopes were being used, and loud statements made that the boat held somebody who had been drowned. One said it was the milord who had gone out in a sailing boat; another maintained that the prostrate figure he discerned was miladi; a Frenchman who had no glass would rather say that it was milord who had probably taken his wife out to drown her, according to the national practice--a remark which an English skipper immediately commented on in our native idiom (as nonsense which--had undergone a mining operation), and further dismissed by the decision that the reclining figure was a woman. For Deronda, terribly excited by fluctuating fears, <b>the</b> <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> as he watched them were divided by swift visions of events, possible and impossible, which might have brought about this issue, or this broken-off fragment of an issue, with a worse half undisclosed--if this woman apparently snatched from the waters were really Mrs. Grandcourt.|$|R
6000|$|The {{morning after}} our arrival {{we took a}} walk, and, {{following}} <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> a church-bell, entered {{what appeared to be}} a park, and, passing along a road at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> a line of crags, soon came in sight of a beautiful church. I rather imagine it to be <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> worship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arkwright family, whose seat is in this vicinity,--the descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous Arkwright who contributed so much towards turning England into a cotton manufactory. We did not enter the church, but passed beyond it, and over a bridge, and along a road that ascended among the hills and finally brought us out by a circuit to <b>the</b> other end <b>of</b> Matlock village, after a walk of three or four miles. In the afternoon we took a boat across the Derwent,--a passage which half a dozen <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> accomplished, --and reached a very pleasant seclusion called [...] "The Lovers' Walk." [...] A ferriage of twopence pays for the transit across the river, and gives <b>the</b> freedom <b>of</b> these grounds, which are threaded with paths that meander and zigzag to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitous ridge, amid trees and shrubbery, and <b>the</b> occasional ease <b>of</b> rustic seats. It is a sweet walk for lovers, and was so for us; although J-----, with his scramblings and disappearances, and shouts from above, and headlong scamperings down the precipitous paths, occasionally frightened his mother. After gaining the heights, the path skirts along the precipice, allowing us to see down into the village street, and, nearer, the Derwent winding through the valley so close beneath us that we might have flung a stone into it. These crags would be very rude and harsh if left to themselves, but they are quite softened and made sweet and tender by <b>the</b> great deal <b>of</b> foliage that clothes their sides, and creeps and clambers over them, only letting a stern face of rock be seen here and there, and with a smile rather than a frown.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{crowds of}} men, {{and even some}} women and boys, stood ready at the launching-ropes. The word was given. There was a strong and a long pull altogether, and the {{lifeboat}} sprang into the sea {{as if it had}} been alive, with her crew seated and <b>the</b> <b>oars</b> out. A huge wave caught her bow and raised her up almost perpendicular. She seemed as if about to dance a reel upon her rudder. Our man-of-war's man had rode in many a wild sea, but never before had he seen <b>the</b> like <b>of</b> that. Nevertheless, he clung to his seat like a limpet, and pulled at his oar with all his might. The others were more accustomed to that special work. Just as she seemed about to topple over, the boat dropped forward and plunged out to sea. The next wave caught her in the same way, but with less power. Another <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short, stout <b>oars,</b> and they had got fairly off into deep water.|$|R
6000|$|The {{boats were}} soon held in command. <b>The</b> <b>oars</b> got their justest poise and widest sweep, and <b>the</b> wrists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men {{accustomed}} to their play. The line began to waver, It undulated, <b>the</b> glittering prow <b>of</b> one protruding beyond the others; {{and then it}} changed its form. Enrico of Fusina shot ahead, and, privileged by success, he insensibly sheered more into <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal, avoiding by the change the eddies, and <b>the</b> other obstructions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shore. This manoeuvre which, in <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course, would have been called [...] "taking the track," [...] had <b>the</b> additional advantage <b>of</b> throwing upon those who followed some trifling impediment from the back-water. The sturdy and practised Bartolomeo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lido, as his companions usually called him, came next, occupying the space on his leader's quarter, where he suffered least from the reaction caused by <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> his <b>oar.</b> <b>The</b> gondolier <b>of</b> Don Camillo, also, soon shot out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd, and was seen plying his arms vigorously still farther to the right, and a little in <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> Bartolomeo. Then came in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal, and near as might be in <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triumphant waterman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main, a dense body, with little order and varying positions, compelling each other to give way, and otherwise increasing <b>the</b> difficulties <b>of</b> their struggle. More to the left, and so near to the palaces as barely to allow room for <b>the</b> sweep <b>of</b> his <b>oar,</b> was <b>the</b> masked competitor, whose progress seemed retarded by some unseen cause, for he gradually fell behind all the others, until several boats' lengths of open water lay between him and even <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> his nameless opponents. Still he plied his arms steadily, and with sufficient skill. As <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> mystery had been excited in his favor, a rumor passed up the canal, that the young cavalier had been little favored by fortune in <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> a boat. Others, who reflected more deeply on causes, whispered <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folly <b>of</b> one of his habits taking <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> mortification by a competition with men whose daily labor had hardened their sinews, and whose practice enabled them to judge closely of every chance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race. But when <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multitude turned from <b>the</b> cluster <b>of</b> passing boats to <b>the</b> solitary barge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fisherman, who came singly on in the rear, admiration was again turned to derision.|$|R
