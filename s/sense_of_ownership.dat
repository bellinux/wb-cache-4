25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to understanding the}} neuroscientific underpinnings {{of the sense of}} agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs without an associated sense of agency.

To test whether a right-hemispheric dominance for <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> body <b>ownership</b> could also be observed in healthy adults, the rubber hand illusion was elicited on both hands of 21 left-handers and 22 righthanders. In this illusion, a participant’s real hand is stroked while hidden from view behind an occluder, and a nearby visible hand prosthesis is repeatedly stroked in synchrony. Most participants experience the illusionary perception of touch sensations arising from the prosthesis. The vividness of the illusion was measured by subjective self-reports {{as well as by}} skin conductance responses to watching the rubber hand being harmed. Handedness did not affect the vividness of the illusion, but a stronger skin conductance response was observed, when the illusion was elicited on the left hand.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{two issues}} about the subjective experience of one’s body: first, is {{the experience of}} owning a full-body fundamentally different {{from the experience of}} owning a body-part? Second, when I experience a bodily sensation, does it guarantee that I cannot be wrong about whether it is me who feels it? To address these issues, we conducted a series of experiments that combined the rubber hand illusion (RHI) and the body swap illusion. The subject wore a head mounted display (HMD) connected with a stereo camera set on the experimenter’s head. Sitting face to face, they used their right hand holding a paintbrush to brush each other’s left hand. Through the HMD, the subject adopted the experimenter’s first-person perspective (1 PP) as if it was his/her own 1 PP: the subject watched either the experimenter’s hand from the adopted 1 PP, and/or the subject’s own hand from the adopted third-person perspective (3 PP) in the opposite direction (180 °), or the subject’s full body from the adopted 3 PP (180 °, with or without face). The synchronous full-body conditions generate a self-touching illusion: many participants felt that I was brushing my own hand! We found that (1) the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> body-part <b>ownership</b> and the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> full-body <b>ownership</b> are not fundamentally different from each other; and (2) our data present a strong case against the mainstream philosophical view called the immunity principle (IEM).

40|$|International audienceWith the {{increasing}} demand in virtual reality applications and games, the {{need to understand how}} users perceive their virtual representation (avatar) {{is becoming more and more}} important. In particular, with the potential of virtual reality to alter and control avatars in different ways, the user representation in the virtual world does not always necessarily match the user body structure. In this context, this paper explores how users would accept as their own a six-digit realistic virtual hand. By measuring participants' <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> (i. e., the impression that the virtual hand is actually our own hand) and agency (i. e., the impression to be able to control the actions of the virtual hand), we somehow evaluate the possibility of creating a Six-Finger Illusion in VR. We measured these two dimensions of virtual embodiment in a virtual reality experiment where participants performed two tasks successively: 1) a self-manipulation task inducing visuomotor feedback, where participants mimicked finger movements presented in the virtual scene, and 2) a visuotactile task inspired by Rubber Hand Illusion protocols, where an experimenter stroked the hand of the user with a brush. The real and virtual brushes were synchronously stroking the participants' real and virtual hand, and in the case when the virtual brush was stroking the additional virtual digit the real ring finger was also synchronously stroked to provide consistent tactile stimulation and elicit a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> embodiment. Results of the experiment show that participants did experience high levels <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and agency <b>of</b> the six-digit virtual hand as a whole. We found higher levels <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and agency for the additional finger when the hand was fully animated, compared to a control group where the additional digit was not animated. Through the presented experiment, we found that participants responded positively to the possibility of controlling the six-digit hand despite the structural difference, and accepted the six-digit virtual hand and individual digits as their own to some extent. These results bring preliminary insights about how avatar with structural differences can affect the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and agency experienced by users in VR...|$|R

40|$|Informal {{settlement}} sanitation {{service delivery}} continues as one the most urgent, imposing challenges of contemporary basic service provision in South Africa. Municipal, provincial and national sanitation and political authorities expect informal settlement residents to take <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> {{and responsibility for}} state-installed toilet facilities, with municipally-managed janitorial services also in operation in many settlements countrywide. Yet resident-driven sanitation management practices and the site-specific realities of informal settlements have not been adequately understood nor have they informed basic service delivery development.

Based on fieldwork in the Masiphumelele Wetlands informal settlement and temporary relocation area on Cape Town's southern peninsula, this dissertation describes a range of communally-managed sanitation systems that operate alongside municipally-managed janitorial services and which demonstrate varying degrees <b>of</b> local <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> responsibility for municipally-provided flush toilet facilities.

[...] Ellert Nijenhuis and colleagues suggest a distinction between personalities responsible for day-to-day functioning (associated with blunted physiological responses and reduced emotional reactivity, {{referred to as the}} [...] "apparently normal part of the personality" [...] or ANP) and those emerging in survival situations (involving fight-or-flight responses, vivid traumatic memories and strong, painful emotions, the [...] "emotional part of the personality" [...] or EP).

2500|$|In alien hand syndrome, {{the afflicted}} individual's limb will produce unintentional {{movements}} without {{the will of}} the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The sense of agency does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed. The sense of agency thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using functional magnetic resonance imaging, alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the concomitant activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process. The clinical definition requires [...] "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a will of its own, together with observable involuntary motor activity" [...] (emphasis in original). This syndrome is often a result of damage to the corpus callosum, either when it is severed to treat intractable epilepsy or due to a stroke. The standard neurological explanation is that the felt will reported by the speaking left hemisphere does not correspond with the actions performed by the non-speaking right hemisphere, thus suggesting that the two hemispheres may have independent senses of will.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> {{owning a}} body and being {{localized}} somewhere in space are two {{key components of}} human self-consciousness. Despite a wealth of neurophysiological and neuroimaging research on the representations of the spatial environment in the parietal and medial temporal cortices, the relationship between body ownership and self-location remains unexplored. To investigate this relationship, we used a multisensory out-of-body illusion to manipulate healthy participants’ perceived self-location, head direction, and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> body <b>ownership</b> during high-resolution fMRI. Activity patterns in the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, and intraparietal cortices reflected the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self-location, whereas the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> body <b>ownership</b> was associated with premotor-intraparietal activity. The functional interplay between these two sets of areas was mediated by the posterior cingulate cortex. These results extend {{our understanding of the}} role of the posterior parietal and medial temporal cortices in spatial cognition by demonstrating that these areas not only are important for ecological behaviors, such as navigation and perspective taking, but also support the perceptual representation of the bodily self in space. Our results further suggest that the posterior cingulate cortex has a key role in integrating the neural representations of self-location and body ownership...|$|R
