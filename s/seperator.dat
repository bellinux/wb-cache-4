50|$|The Accuflow Multiphase Metering System is {{an example}} of advance test separator. It {{separates}} gas from liquid for 2 Phase measurement. The main principle of the Accuflow is to effectively separate the free gas from the liquid phase and to measure each phase independently, but with more automation than a conventional <b>seperator.</b> With complete separation, the measurement equipment used in each phase can be utilized to their maximum effectiveness and potential.The separation of gas and liquid occurs in the Accuflow in 2 stages. Stage 1, the liquid enters a vertical pipe at a downward tangential angle creating a cyclonic action in the pipe. This cyclonic action pushes the liquid towards the pipe wall and enables the majority of the gas to release {{to the center of the}} pipe and travel up to the gas run. The liquid with some remaining gas is carried into a secondary stage of separation.|$|E
40|$|Given a graph G = (V, E) and {{an integer}} k, we study k-Vertex <b>Seperator</b> (resp. k-Edge Separator), where {{the goal is}} to remove the minimum number of {{vertices}} (resp. edges) such that each connected component in the resulting graph has at most k vertices. Our primary focus is on the case where k is either a constant or a slowly growing function of n (e. g. O(n) or n^o(1)). Our problems can be interpreted as a special case of three general classes of problems that have been studied separately (balanced graph partitioning, Hypergraph Vertex Cover (HVC), and fixed parameter tractability (FPT)). Our main result is an O(k) -approximation algorithm for k-Vertex <b>Seperator</b> that runs in time 2 ^O(k) n^O(1), and an O(k) -approximation algorithm for k-Edge Separator that runs in time n^O(1). Our result on k-Edge <b>Seperator</b> improves the best previous graph partitioning algorithm for small k. Our result on k-Vertex <b>Seperator</b> improves the simple (k+ 1) -approximation from HVC. When OPT > k, the running time 2 ^O(k) n^O(1) is faster than the lower bound k^Ω(OPT) n^Ω(1) for exact algorithms assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. While the running time of 2 ^O(k) n^O(1) for k-Vertex Separator seems unsatisfactory, we show that the superpolynomial dependence on k may be needed to achieve a polylogarithmic approximation ratio, based on hardness of Densest k-Subgraph. We also study k-Path Transversal, where {{the goal is to}} remove the minimum number of vertices such that there is no simple path of length k. With additional ideas from FPT algorithms and graph theory, we present an O(k) -approximation algorithm for k-Path Transversal that runs in time 2 ^O(k^ 3 k) n^O(1). Previously, the existence of even (1 - δ) k-approximation algorithm for fixed δ > 0 was open. Comment: 21 page...|$|E

5000|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} began to be interested in developing MPFMs in the early 1980's, as measurement technology improved, and wellhead <b>seperators</b> were costly. Depleting oil reserves, (More water and gas in the produced oil) along with smaller, deeper wells with higher water contents, saw the advent of increasingly frequent occurrences of multiphase flow where the single-phase meters were unable to provide accurate answers. After a lengthy gestation period, MPFMs capable of performing the required measurements became commercially available. Much of the early research was done at the Christian Michelsen research center in Bergen, Norway, [...] and this work spawned a number of spin off companies leading to the Roxar / Emerson, Schlumberger, Framo and MPM meters. Haimo introduced a meter with partial seperation, making accurate measurement simpler. Since 1994, MPFM installation numbers have steadily increased as technology in the field has advanced, with substantial growth witnessed from 1999 onwards. A recent study estimated that there were approximately 2,700 MPFM applications including field allocation, production optimisation and mobile well testing in 2006.|$|R

Nowadays, separator devices play {{an important}} role in the quality of agricultural products. In this study, the separation of stigma from other components is analysed in oscillating separator, wind tunnel and combination of two states for determining their transposition. Oscillating separator experiments were performed based on completely randomized factorial design with 3 treatment of slope, amplitude, frequency and 3 replicates that each treatment is carried out at two levels. Considering that saffron components terminal velocities were different therefore wind tunnel experiments were done at different speeds within the range of saffron components terminal velocities. The results show that the combination of “wind tunnel-oscillating seperator” had the best seperation. In the oscillating <b>seperator,</b> the frequency of 35 Hz, amplitude of 7 ? and slope of 10 ? in comparison with other states had the optimum seperation.

The asymmetric charecteristics of the flow field are analyzed in this paper. The {{results indicate that the}} gas phase flow field is slightly asymmetic in the tube and the cone spaces' but remarkably asymmetric in the annular space. Meanwhile ' {{it can be seen that}} the axial center of the gas flow vortex deviates from the geometric center of the cyclone. Thios swirling eccentricity results from the asymmetrical inlet structure and the instability of the swirling flow. The deviated distance' and direction varies with the axial position and the maximal deviated distance is approximately 0. 07 R. The offset of two centers makes the radial velocity of the gas -phase flow field have a remarkable asymmetrical profile. The asymmetric charecteristics of the radial velocity distribution are first explained in thi study. The above results are in fair aggrement with the experimental data from the literature.

40|$|Abstract. At the {{new high}} flux reactor FRM-II in Munich the {{accelerator}} MAFF (Munich accel-erator for fission fragments) is under design. In the high neutron flux of 1014 n/cm 2 s up to 1014 neutron-rich fission fragments per second are {{produced in the}} 1 g U- 235 target. Ions with an energy of 30 keV are extracted from the ion source. In the mass <b>seperator</b> two isotopes can be selected. One of the beams is used for low energy experiments, {{the other one is}} injected into an ECRIS (or EBIS) for charge breeding to a q=A 0 : 16. A gas filled RFQ cooler is used for emittance improvement. The subsequent LINAC delivers beams with an energy ranging from 3. 7 MeV/u to 5. 9 MeV/u. New IH structures are being developed at the Munich tandem laboratory. A small storage ring is planned in a further stage to recycle the fission fragments. A thin target foil can be placed into this ring, e. g., for synthesis of super-heavy elements. The through-going beam tube has been installed in the heavy water tank of the reactor. Tests of the target ion source in a special oven to test long term stability and safety tests were in progress...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} section we saw that the planar separator theorem provides us with a procedure to separate the vertices of a planar graph G = (V,E), |V | = n, into three sets A,B,C, where |A|, |B | ≤ 2 n/ 3, |C | ≤ 4 √n, and there exists no edge between A and B. In this section we will consider several generalizations of this theorem. 0. 1. 1 Weighted Separators In our version of the planar separator theorem we considered all vertices to be equal. However, a common variant permits vertices to be weighted such that {{the sum of all}} weights is equal to 1 (any other set of non-negative weights can be trivially mapped to one like this). The only difference is that instead of bounding the sizes of the the sets A and B to be ≤ 2 n/ 3, we bound their weights to be ≤ 2 / 3. The separating set C however is still bounded {{in terms of the number}} of vertices it contains, and may therefore have arbitrary weight. To prove the weighted planar <b>seperator</b> theorem, our proof from {{the previous}} section is sufficient. We need only change certain references to the sizes of sets to refer to the weight of the sets. The rest of the analysis largely follows unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Fuel cells, {{as a kind}} {{of highly}} {{efficient}} and environment-friendly energy conversion system, have been considered as alternative powers sources for transportation and electric devices. Due to the worldwide efforts paid on fuel cells R&D during recent decades, the commercialization of several kinds of fuel cells has been put on agenda. In our institute, the research mainly focus on three kinds of fuel cells, namely, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), direct alcohol fuel cell (DAFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The recent advancements in terms of electrocatalysts, polymer electrolyte membranes, membrane and electrode assemblies (MEAs), stacks and systems of different types of fuel cells were presented. Some of strategies to prepare Pt-based electrocatalysts with desired crystal facets, binary and ternary alloyed electrocatalysts with high activity and stability as well as non Pt electrocatalysts like MoN/C and FeN/C with promising activities were developed. Novel multi-layer structured MEAs were designed and fabricated to overcome the issue of fuel crossover and to further improve the performance, stability and durability of the fuel cells. In addition, by means of modularization in system, a series of components, such as methanol sensor, gas/liquid <b>seperator,</b> electronic controller and technologies including assembly of stacks with high consistency, feeding with high concentration methanol, water balance, heat management, intelligent power management, etc. were developed. And a number of compact systems of PEMFC, SOFC and DAFC ranging from sub-watts to hundred kilowatts in power were demonstrated. The remained issues for mass commercialization of the fuel cells in technology are primarily discussed such as stability, reliability, durability and cost etc. 北京大...|$|E
