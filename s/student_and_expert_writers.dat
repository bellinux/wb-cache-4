40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of a new rhetorical {{problem-solving}} model for writing instruction to create opportunities for abstract thinking and extend the transfer of rhetorical knowledge. The author conducts a qualitative research study on the transfer of rhetorical knowledge by interviewing former <b>students</b> <b>and</b> evaluating their writing samples written in their courses beyond composition. By revisiting the early cognitive writing process research of Linda Flower and John R. Hayes, evaluating the differences between novice <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> <b>writers,</b> <b>and</b> creating corollaries with David Perkins and Gavriel Salomon’s theories on transfer, the author identifies markers for transfer within the rhetorical situation and suggests teaching writing as rhetorical problem solving to extend this transfer to new contexts...|$|R

40|$|Cognitively-based writing {{instruction}} for educationally disadvantaged students is examined, focusing on epistemic writing. The object of epistemic writing is to inquire into a particular topic and to familiarize/persuade {{the reader with}} {{the fruits of the}} investigation. In reviewing the distinctions between novice <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> <b>writers,</b> two models of competence in written composition are apparent: the knowledge-telling approach of novice writers, and the knowledge-transforming strategies of <b>expert</b> <b>writers.</b> To foster a shift from the novice to expert, research suggests that the higher order thinking skills that underlie epistemic writing must be fostered. A specific writing environment, Monitoring Instruction plus Strategic Execution (MUSE), was designed for 31 tenth-graders in Canadian classes for normally achieving <b>and</b> learning-disabled <b>students.</b> Specific portions of instructional time were spent i...|$|R

40|$|Based on the EU LLP-Project SeCom 2. 0, {{this work}} will mainly analyse the Serious Game SeCom-V (which is {{embedded}} in the Learning- and Collaborationplatform SeCom-P) and answer the question whether it is an adequate game to support the next and current generation of water engineers in education, vocational training, knowledge sharing and collaboration. The work presents the development of the platform, the pedagogical design as the foundation of the platform as well as the game design including game mechanics and game patterns. It will evaluate if SeCom-V is able to increase the attractiveness and motivation of the learning content to the learners. The evaluation of the <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> will target the game and the platform, of being an added value to the <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> with respect to learning and motivation. An evaluation of an improved learning ability of the target groups is explicitly left out of the research, as this is dependent, among other things, on the learner type, which could not be investigated here. The work presents the evaluation of the game, based on assessments by <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> in qualitative as well as quantitative values. On this basis conclusions will be drawn and recommendations will be made for an upgrade of SeCom 2. 0 or the development of further Serious Games in Flood Risk Management...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLearning to {{read and}} {{understand}} research articles (primary literature) {{is an important step}} in the enculturation of higher education students into the scientific community. We presume, based on ideas from the field of genre analysis, that {{it is important for the}} development of reading skills to become conscious of the rhetorical structures in research articles. So, we determined how well science students are able to identify two important elements of this rhetorical structure: conclusions and grounds. First-year undergraduate life science students who followed a course called 'Biomedical Research' made assignments in which they had to identify these two elements. We analysed the answers of 20 <b>students</b> in detail <b>and</b> compared their answers with two expert readers. Furthermore, we conducted task-based interviews with four students to gain more insight in their reading strategies and to determine how they identify conclusions and grounds. Our results show that <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> defined conclusions <b>and</b> grounds in different ways. <b>Students</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> agreed on the most important conclusion of the articles. However, students identified a wide range of sentences which were not seen as conclusions by the experts. The grounds students mentioned mostly matched with their conclusions. Students sometimes failed to mention important grounds for a particular conclusion. In conclusion, our study shows the differences between <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> readers of primary literature. Based on our results, we formulated criteria for the design of a teaching strategy that aims to improve students' skills for reading primary literature...|$|R

40|$|We {{would like}} to thank LL. M. Peter Slangen for his {{judicial}} input and Dr. Lars van Vliet for the practical facilitation of this study. Conceptual Knowledge Differences 2 Little research has been conducted on expertise-related differences in conceptual and ontological knowledge in law, even though this type of knowledge is prerequisite for correctly interpreting and reasoning about legal cases, and differences in conceptual and ontological knowledge structures between <b>students</b> <b>and</b> between <b>students</b> <b>and</b> teachers, might lead to miscommunication. This study investigated the extent and organization of conceptual and ontological knowledge of novices, advanced <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> in law, using a card-sorting task and a concept-elaboration task. The results showed that novices used more everyday examples and were less accurate in their elaborations of concepts than advanced <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts,</b> on top of that, the organization of their knowledge did not overlap within their group (i. e., no “shared ” ontology). Experts gave more judicial examples based on the lawbook and were more accurate in their elaborations than advanced <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> their knowledge was strongly overlapping within thei...|$|R
