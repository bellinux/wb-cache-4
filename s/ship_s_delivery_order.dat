This stands in marked contrast to the rigid FIFO (first-in-first-out) <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> of communication with a FIFO channel. The more restrictive the <b>delivery</b> <b>order,</b> the less concurrency possible to exploit in message transmissions over a multi-path system. This paper investigates the possible gain in effective network bandwidth when a large amount of information, such as the transmission of image data, is transmitted over a multi-path flush channel as compared to a multi-path FIFO channel. Analytical and simulation results illustrate that the relaxed <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> restrictions of the flush channel may reduce the mean message response time by a factor of the number of message fragments. This difference may be critical in meeting real-time requirements of an application...|$|R

But, the problem is people are too busy and having limited time to go to buy food and taking clothes to the laundry place. From the existing problem above, food stalls and laundry places invent a solution by providing <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> service. The <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> service is effective and efficient. It can send ordered food and take-dropping laundry to the customer. Most food stalls and laundry places that use already the <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> service use the systems that are via phone calls and sending short messages.

The process of delivering food and laundry is done manually by couriers who are in duties. Thus, the customers who use this system will more easily do the delivering process and can save energy and costs...|$|R
