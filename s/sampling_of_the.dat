The sound effects were created by Mike Gollum, Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears of Universal Sound Studios. Clancy Brown voiced the dual role of Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, while Brendan O'Brien voiced the dual role of Doctor N. Gin and Tiny the Tiger. Additionally, Michael Ensign voiced Doctor Nefarious Tropy, William Hootkins voiced Dingodile and Mel Winkler voiced Aku Aku. A small <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's levels were prominently displayed at Sony's Electronic Entertainment Expo booth in Atlanta, Georgia. Around this time, the video game industry wondered if Crash Bandicoot: Warped was just {{more of the same}} of the previous installment.

25|$|An {{additional}} {{change to}} the central unit added {{a second set of}} capacitors for each channel. With each <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channels in the input units, the values were read into the alternating set of capacitors in the CDE. This caused the change in position between scans to be recorded. On the display, the values of these two measurements were rapidly cycled, causing the dots to elongate into short dashes, directly indicating the direction and speed of travel. Finally, they added the AN/SSA-21 unit, which read out the values and sent them as teletype signals to other ships, where they could be converted back to analog signals for display there.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1992 {{launch of}} TOPEX/Poseidon, {{altimetric}} satellites have been recording {{the change in}} sea level. Current rates of sea level rise from satellite altimetry have been estimated {{in the range of}} 2.9–3.4 ± 0.4–0.6mm per year for 1993–2010. This exceeds those from tide gauges. It is unclear whether this represents an accelerated increase over the last decades, variability due to the sparse <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tide gauges, true differences between satellites and tide gauges, or problems with satellite calibration. In 2015, a small calibration errors of the first altimetric satellite – Topex/Poseidon - was identified. It had caused a slight overestimation of the 1992-2005 sea levels, which masked the ongoing sea level rise acceleration.|$|E
25|$|Preparation of pu'erh {{involves}} first separating a well-sized {{portion of}} the compressed tea for brewing. This {{can be done by}} flaking off pieces of the cake or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft from heat and hydration. A pu'erh knife, which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid letter opener, is used to pry large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as tuocha or mushroom pu'erh are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cake should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> underpricing {{of firms}} that went {{public on the}} Nouveau March between 1996 and 2000 and on the Neuer Markt between 1997 and 2000. Evidence suggests that firms that went public on the Nouveau March experienced lower underpricing than their counterparts that went public on the Neuer Markt. This difference in underpricing is partly explained by <b>the</b> differential performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two stock markets. The stock market performance has a positive significant impact on underpricing in both markets. However, the impact is stronger in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neuer Markt than in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nouveau March. Moreover, underwriter reputation lowers <b>the</b> underpricing <b>of</b> firms in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neuer Markt, while underwriter reputation does not affect <b>the</b> underpricing <b>of</b> firms in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nouveau March...|$|R
25|$|Europa {{has much}} {{indirect}} evidence for its sub-surface ocean. Models of how Europa {{is affected by}} Tidal heating require a subsurface layer of liquid water or warm ice in order to accurately reproduce the linear fracturing of the surface. Indeed, observations by the Galileo spacecraft of how Europa's magnetic field interacts with Jupiter's field strengthens {{the case for a}} liquid, rather than solid, layer; an electrically conductive fluid deep within Europa would explain these results. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2012 appear to show an ice plume spouting from Europa's surface, which would immensely strengthen the case for a liquid subsurface ocean. As was the case for Enceladus, vapour geysers would allow for easy <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid layer. Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence that geysering is a frequent event on Europa {{due to the lack of}} water in the space near Europa.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{refers to}} the {{combination}} of a high-throughput sequencing methodology with computational methods to capture and quantify transcripts present in an RNA extract. The nucleotide sequences generated are typically around 100 bp in length, but can range from 30 bp to over 10,000 bp, depending on the sequencing method used. RNA-Seq leverages deep <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcriptome with many short fragments from a transcriptome to allow computational reconstruction of the original RNA transcript by aligning reads to a reference genome or to each other (de novo assembly). The typical dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude for RNA-Seq is a key advantage over microarray transcriptomes. In addition, input RNA amounts are much lower for RNA-Seq (nanogram quantity) compared to microarrays (microgram quantity), which allowed finer examination of cellular structures, down to the single-cell level when combined with linear amplification of cDNA. Theoretically, there is no upper limit of quantification in RNA-Seq, and background signal is very low for 100 bp reads in non-repetitive regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{hurricane}} weakened as it progressed inland, {{and within}} 14 hours of moving ashore, Camille weakened to tropical storm status. About 12 hours later, it weakened to tropical depression status, {{by which time}} it began a turn {{to the north and}} northeast. On August20, Tropical Depression Camille turned eastward through Kentucky, dropping heavy rainfall in West Virginia and Virginia. Later that day it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean east of Norfolk, and by that afternoon as it was emerging offshore it regained tropical storm status. Camille accelerated east-northeastward, attaining peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) as it interacted with larger Hurricane Debbie to its southeast (although the poor <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region means that {{it is possible that the}} storm may have regained hurricane intensity in a location where measurements of wind speed were not taken). Subsequently, Camille began to interact with a cold front, causing it to gradually change into an extratropical cyclone as it entrained cooler air. On August22, Camille was absorbed by the cold front to the south of Atlantic Canada.|$|E

In addition to The Bahamas, conch is also eaten in the West Indies (Jamaica in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in soups, stews and curries.
