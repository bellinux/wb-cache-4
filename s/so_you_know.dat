One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin.

That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
