40|$|Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFAS) {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of products of all day life. Due to their toxicological potential, an emerging focus is directed towards their exposure to humans. This study investigated the PFAS load of consumer products in a broad perspective. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (C 4, C 6 -C 8, C 10 -PFSA), carboxylic acids (C 4 -C 14 -PFCA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (4 : 2, 6 : 2; 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOH) were analysed in 115 random samples of consumer products including textiles (outdoor materials), carpets, cleaning and impregnating agents, leather samples, baking and <b>sandwich</b> <b>papers,</b> paper baking forms and ski waxes. PFCA and PFSA were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS, whereas FTOH were detected by GC/CI-MS. Consumer products such as cleaning agents or some baking and <b>sandwich</b> <b>papers</b> show low or negligible PFSA and PFCA contents. On the other hand, high PFAS levels were identified in ski waxes (up to about 2000 mikrog/kg PFOA), leather samples (up to about 200 mikrog/kg PFBA and 120 mikrog/kg PFBS), outdoor textiles (up to 19 mikrog/m 2 PFOA) and some other baking papers (up to 15 mikrog/m 2 PFOA). Moreover, some test samples like carpet and leather samples and outdoor materials exceeded the EU regulatory threshold value for PFOS (1 mikrog/m 2). A diverse mixture of PFASs can be found in consumer products for all fields of daily use in varying concentrations. This study proves the importance of screening and monitoring of consumer products for PFAS loads and the necessity for an action to regulate the use of PFASs, especially PFOA, in consumer products...|$|R

40|$|Per- and polyfluorinated {{chemicals}} (PFC) have inimitable properties. They {{are very}} stable, e. g. {{are resistant to}} biotic and abiotic breakdown, and are water and grease repellent. Therefore, they are used in numerous industrial applications, such as in paper- and packaging as well as textile industry. The manufacture, use, and disposal of consumer products is an important source for exposure into the environment. The persistence of PFCs, however, is problematic for the environment. A number of PFCs can be fund ubiquitously in the environment. Findings in remote regions, in human blood and breast milk are of very high concern. The most frequently detected PFCs are perfluorooctansulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Both of these compounds are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative. While the marketing and use of PFOS is prohibited with few exceptions in the EU since June 27, 2008 there is no substance specific regulation for PFOA. Available data on PFCs in consumer products are scarce to date. Hence, more data are {{needed in order to}} get an overview on recent PFC loads and to evaluate if these data implicate further measures against PFOA with respect to a regulation according to REACH. Therefore, the Federal Environment Agency of Germany initiated an analytical screening project in 2009. Perfluorinated sulfonic (C 4, C 6 -C 8, C 10 -PFSA) and carboxylic acids (C 4 -C 14 -PFCA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (4 : 2, 6 : 2; 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOH) were analyzed in 118 consumer products including textiles (outdoor materials), carpets, cleaning and impregnating agents, leather samples, baking and <b>sandwich</b> <b>papers,</b> paper baking forms and ski waxes. PFCA and PFCA were analysed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, whereas FTOH were detected by GC-CI-MS. The results show that there are consumer products with low or negligible PFSA- and PFCA-contents, such as the cleaning agents or baking and <b>sandwich</b> <b>papers</b> tested. On the other hand, high PFC levels were identified in ski waxes, leather samples, outdoor textiles and some baking papers. Moreover, the PFOS concentrations in most of the leather and carpet samples as well as some textile samples tested exceeded the regulatory threshold value of 1 ?g/m 2 PFOS according to the European PFOS regulation...|$|R

Developed are the chemical colorimetric modes for fast detection of socially dangerous trace impurities in water such as Co(II), Pd(II), and Rh(III) as well as NO 2 [...] ions and Fe(III) serving as model impurities. Application of portable digital devices and scanner allows estimating the color coordinates and increasing the accuracy and sensitivity of the tests. The combination of complex formation with preconcentration of colored complexes replaces the sensitive but time-consuming and capricious kinetic method that is usually used for this purpose at the more convenient and reliable colorimetric method.

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} {{methodology and}} built a portable reader to assess light transmittance in paper-based microfluidic devices in a highly sensitive, user-friendly and field-appropriate manner. By <b>sandwiching</b> the <b>paper</b> assay between micro-light-emitting diodes and micro-photodetectors, the reader quantifies light transmittance through the paper independent of ambient light conditions. To demonstrate {{the utility of the}} reader, we created a single-use paper-based microfluidic assay for measurement of alanine aminotransferase, an indicator of liver health in blood. The paper assay and reader system accurately differentiated alanine aminotransferase levels across the human reference range and demonstrated significant differences at clinically relevant cutoff values. Results were provided within 10 min and were automatically generated without complex image analysis. Performance of this point-of-care diagnostic rivals the accuracy of lab-based spectrometer tests {{at a fraction of the}} cost, while matching the timeliness of low-cost portable assays, which have historically shown lower accuracy. This combination of features allows flexible deployment of low cost and quantitative diagnostics to resource-poor settings...|$|R

With the increasing of honeycomb core thickness, sandwich composite material decreased in flat pressure strength, side pressure strength, and flexural properties.

40|$|We {{report a}} simple, {{low-cost}} and detachable microfluidic chip incorporating easily accessible paper, glass slides or other polymer films as the chip materials along with adhesive wax as the recycling bonding material. We use a laser {{to cut through}} the paper or film to form patterns and then <b>sandwich</b> the <b>paper</b> and film between glass sheets or polymer membranes. The hot-melt adhesive wax can realize bridge bonding between various materials, for example, paper, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) film, glass sheets, or metal plate. The bonding process is reversible and the wax is reusable through a melting and cooling process. With this process, a three-dimensional (3 D) microfluidic chip is achievable by vacuating and venting the chip in a hot-water bath. To study the biocompatibility and applicability of the wax-based microfluidic chip, we tested the PCR compatibility with the chip materials first. Then we applied the wax-paper based microfluidic chip to HeLa cell electroporation (EP). Subsequently, a prototype of a 5 -layer 3 D chip was fabricated by multilayer wax bonding.

The alternative mechanism is then extended to form a family of new morphing sandwich structures, including a fan-shaped mechanism, and single-curved cylindrical and conical mechanisms. Each are derived by substituting the base Miura core pattern with a Miura-derivative pattern, and attaching faces that have compatible rigid-foldability and avoid self-intersection during deployment.
