The adsorption behavior of metal ions onto activated <b>sludge</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>sludge</b> was analyzed with Weber–Morris intra-particle diffusion model, Lagergren first-order model and pseudo second-order model. The rate constant of intra-particle diffusion on activated <b>sludge</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>sludge</b> {{increased in the}} sequence of Cu(II) > Ni(II) > Cd(II).

40|$|A {{process for}} {{production}} of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) by activated sludge treating a paper mill wastewater was investigated. The applied {{strategy was to}} select for glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) by alternating anaerobic/aerobic conditions. Acidogenic fermentation was used as pretreatment to convert various organic compounds to volatile fatty acids which are preferable substrates for PHA production. Enrichment resulted in a culture dominated by GAOs related to Defluviicoccus vanus (56 %) and Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (22 %). Optimization of PHA accumulation by the enriched GAO culture was performed through batch experiments. Accumulation of PHA under anaerobic conditions was limited by the intracellular glycogen stored. Under aerobic conditions significant glycogen production (to 25 % of <b>sludge</b> <b>dry</b> weight) was observed alongside PHA accumulation (to 22 % of <b>sludge</b> <b>dry</b> weight). By applying a subsequent anaerobic period after an initial aerobic, the produced glycogen could be utilized for further PHA accumulation and by this strategy PHA content was increased to 42 % of <b>sludge</b> <b>dry</b> weight. The PHA yield over the entire process was 0. 10 kg per kg of influent COD treated {{which is similar to}} what has been achieved with a process applying feast/famine enrichment strategy with the same wastewater...|$|R

30|$|According to a {{literature}} {{review of the}} German Federal Environmental Agency, the silver concentration in nine municipal sewage treatment plants was determined. A silver concentration between 4 and 26.3 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> was found in 2002. In 2007 the silver concentration in the {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} sludge in Karlsruhe, Pforzheim and Nuremberg was between 12 and 45 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> [29]. In our investigations the sludge from the municipal STP in Schmallenberg had a silver concentration of 1.8 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge.</b> A study by the US EPA showed silver concentrations in the sewage sludge of 1.94 to 856 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> [30]. In this case various sites were studied. High concentrations can be explained by industrial silver entry. From these data, it can be concluded that in sludge of municipal STPs used for agricultural purposes, silver concentrations range from 2 to 45 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge.</b>|$|R

50|$|Weston Creek was {{the site}} of Canberra's main {{sewerage}} treatment plant from the early days of Canberra's settlement up until the late-1970s. Located by the river down the hill from the present day RSPCA site, the plant was proposed as early as 1915. Following several studies, it was approved for construction by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in January 1924, and commenced operating in 1927. Sewerage from the fledgling city of Canberra was pumped to the site through an underground pipe from the vicinity of the Canberra Hotel, through the Yarralumla area. In the late-1960s, odours from the plant became a problem in the expanding residential areas of Woden and Weston Creek, and also at nearby Government House. Several refinements were made to the plant, and the <b>sludge</b> <b>drying</b> beds were abandoned. The plant was closed in August 1978 and replaced by the new Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre.|$|E

40|$|Belt {{filter presses}} {{represent}} an economical means to dewater the residual sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants. In order to assure maximal water removal, the raw sludge {{is mixed with}} a chemical conditioner prior to being fed into the belt filter press. When the conditioner is properly dosed, the sludge acquires a coarse texture, with space between flocs. This information was exploited {{for the development of}} a software sensor, where digital images are the input signal, and the output is a numeric value proportional to the dewatered <b>sludge</b> <b>dry</b> content. Three families of features were used to characterize the textures. Gabor filtering, wavelet decomposition and co-occurrence matrix computation were the techniques used. A database of images, ordered by their corresponding dry contents, was used to calibrate the model that calculates the sensor output. The images were separated in groups that correspond to single experimental sessions. With the calibrated model, all images were correctly ranked within an experiment session. The results were very similar regardless of the family of features used. The output can be fed to a control system, or, in the case of fixed experiment conditions, it can be used to directly estimate the dewatered <b>sludge</b> <b>dry</b> content...|$|R

Heavy metals were analyzed and com-pared in treated sewage effluent (TSE), slurry <b>sludge,</b> <b>dried</b> <b>sludge,</b> landfill and underground wa-ter. Heavy metal concentrations were analyzed using the inductive coupled plasma optical emis-sion spectrometer (ICP-OES). All samples contained the same heavy metals with different concen-trations. The heaviest concentrations were Zn, Cr, Cu and Ni with traces of V, Cd, Pb and Ba. TSE and sludge were the main sources of landfill and underground water contamination. Due to water evaporation, heavy metals concentrations in sludge were higher compared to TSE and under-ground water. <b>Dried</b> <b>sludge</b> and landfill contained higher concentrations than the others.
