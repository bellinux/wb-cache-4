25|$|After {{six months}} of {{carefully}} selected plans, the first tri-ribbon 2 logo laced with a rhomboidal star came to be on March 1, 1987. The tri-ribbon 2 logo's color is white carried the slogan The <b>Star</b> <b>Network</b> when it aired as a station ID to reclaim the dominance in TV ratings. By 1988, the ribbons in the tri-ribbon 2 logo are tri-colored with red, green and blue. Truly, the tri-ribbon 2 logo was accidentally coming from a shooting star {{in the form of}} 2. Similarly, most numerical channel logos within this slogan have a star and versions came into regional TV channels like 3 (DYCB-TV in Cebu and D-3-ZO-TV in Baguio), 4 (DYXL-TV in Bacolod and DXAS-TV in Davao) and other regional stations. The tri-ribbon was also used on microphone flags until 2000, the celebration of the New Millennium.|$|E
25|$|In fiber-optic communication, {{the path}} {{coloring}} {{problem is the}} problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a <b>star</b> <b>network,</b> with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring problem may be modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or multigraph, in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general tree topology, local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by each switch in the network may be patched together to form a single global solution.|$|E

Extensive research has been performed that shows that <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> are as versatile as hypercubes. This paper is an effort in the same direction. Based on the well-known paradigms, we study the one-to-many parallel routing problem on <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> and develop an improved routing algorithm that finds n, 1 node-disjoint paths between one node {{and a set of}} other n, 1 nodes in the n-star network. These parallel paths are proven of minimum length within a small additive constant, and our algorithm has an optimal time complexity. This result significantly improves the previous known algorithms for the problem. Moreover, the algorithm well illustrates an application of the orthogonal partition of <b>star</b> <b>networks,</b> which was observed by the original inventors of the <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> but seems generally overlooked in the subsequent study. We should also point out that similar problems are already studied for hypercubes and have proven useful in designing efficient and fault tolerant routing algorithms on hypercube networks. 1...|$|R

40|$|Starting {{from the}} fact that {{complete}} Accepting Hybrid Networks of Evolutionary Processors allow much communication between the nodes and are far from network structures used in practice, we propose in this paper three network topologies that restrict the communication: <b>star</b> <b>networks,</b> ring networks, and grid networks. We show that ring-AHNEPs can simulate 2 -tag systems, thus we deduce the existence of a universal ring-AHNEP. For <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> or grid networks, we show a more general result; that is, each recursively enumerable language can be accepted efficiently by a star- or grid-AHNEP. We also present bounds for the size of these <b>star</b> and grid <b>networks.</b> As a consequence we get that each recursively enumerable can be accepted by networks with at most 13 communication channels and by networks where each node communicates with at most three other nodes. ...|$|R

Three splitting methods, including Traffic-Cutting, Traffic-Dividing and Synthesized-Splitting were proposed.

40|$|Abstract—Mining network {{evolution}} {{has emerged as}} an intriguing research topic in many domains such as data mining, social networks, and machine learning. While a bulk of {{research has focused on}} mining the evolutionary pattern of homogeneous networks (e. g., networks of friends), however, most real-world networks are heterogeneous, containing objects of different types, such as authors, papers, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network. Modeling co-evolution of multi-typed objects can capture richer information than that on single-typed objects alone. For example, studying co-evolution of authors, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network alone. In this paper, we study mining co-evolution of multi-typed objects in a special type of heterogeneous <b>networks,</b> called <b>star</b> <b>networks,</b> and examine how the multi-typed objects influence each other in the network evolution. A Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Model-based evolution model is proposed, which detects the co-evolution of multi-typed objects in the form of multi-typed cluster evolution in dynamic <b>star</b> <b>networks.</b> An efficient inference algorithm is provided to learn the proposed model. Experiments on several real networks (DBLP, Twitter, and Delicious) validate the effectiveness of the model and the scalability of the algorithm.

We consider call admission control problems with advance reservations in <b>star</b> <b>networks.</b> For the most general variant we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm resolving an open problem due to Erlebach. Our method is randomized and achieves an approximation ratio of 1 / 18. It can be generalized to accommodate call alternatives, in which case the approximation ratio is 1 / 24.

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> of chaotic oscillators, {{with all}} end-nodes connected {{only to the}} central hub node, under diffusive coupling, conjugate coupling and mean-field type coupling. We observe the existence of chimeras in the end-nodes, which are identical {{in terms of the}} coupling environment and dynamical equations. Namely, the symmetry of the end-nodes is broken and co-existing groups with different synchronization features and attractor geometries emerge. Surprisingly, such chimera states are very wide-spread in this network topology, and large parameter regimes of moderate coupling strengths evolve to chimera states from generic random initial conditions. Further, we verify the robustness of these chimera states in analog circuit experiments. Thus it is evident that <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> provide a promising class of coupled systems, in natural or human-engineered contexts, where chimeras are prevalent...|$|R
