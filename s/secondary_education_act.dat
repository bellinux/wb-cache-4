25|$|Johnson, {{whose own}} ticket {{out of poverty}} was a public {{education}} in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty, and was {{an essential component of}} the American dream, especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted budgets from local taxes. He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, LBJ launched a legislative effort which took the name of the Elementary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Act</b> (ESEA) of 1965. The bill sought to double federal spending on education from $4 billion to $8 billion.; with considerable facilitating by the White House, it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26 and then it remarkably passed without change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. This was an historic accomplishment by the president, with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before.|$|E
25|$|In federal legislation, the key planks for {{the right}} to a useful and remunerative job {{included}} the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After the war was the Employment Act of 1946, which created an objective for the government to eliminate unemployment, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited unjustified discrimination in the workplace and in access to public and private services. They remained some of the key elements of US labor law. The rights to food and fair agricultural wages was assured by numerous Acts on agriculture in the United States and by the Food Stamp Act of 1964. The right to freedom from unfair competition was primarily seen to be achievable through the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's enforcement of both the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914, with some minor later amendments. The most significant program of change occurred through Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The right to housing was developed through a policy of subsidies and government building under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. The right to health care was partly improved by the Social Security Act of 1965 and, more recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The Social Security Act of 1935 had laid the groundwork for protection from fear of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment. The right to a decent education was shaped heavily by Supreme Court jurisprudence, and the administration of education was left to the states, particularly with Brown v. Board of Education. A legislative framework developed through the Elementary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965, and in higher education, a measure of improvement began with federal assistance and regulation in the Higher Education Act of 1965.|$|E

5000|$|A {{significant}} opposition amongst parents, {{businesses and}} universities regarding the education reforms had surfaced by the 1970s, {{in which they}} believed there was a decline in academic standards, a lack of focus in the curriculum, and lax discipline in schools. Combined with financially pressured school boards beginning to call for the abolition of grade 13 {{as a means of}} financial restraint, this resulted in the government reevaluating its <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> system. The resulting document was the Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior (OS:IS), which had called for the formal elimination of grade 13, without formally eliminating the fifth year of <b>secondary</b> <b>education.</b> <b>Acting</b> upon the recommendations of the document, Ontario formally eliminated grade 13 in 1984, and introduced the Ontario Academic Credit system. The new system allowed for students to graduate from secondary schools in four years, while also maintaining the fifth year, known as OAC, which had courses catering for students planning to proceed with post-secondary education. Despite the fact that students were able to graduate from the secondary school system in four years, a fifth year of <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> continued to persist in Ontario, with fewer than 15 percent of students exercising the option to graduate in four years, with reports that between 20 percent and 25 percent of students choose to repeat one or more OAC years.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use {{data from the}} 2009 ad hoc module of the Labour Force Survey to study the impact of both contextual and {{educational}} determinants {{on the effect of}} parental background (PBE) on Early School Leaving (ESL). The results concerning the effect of educational characteristics are twofold. First, ‘vocationalism’ (i. e. a strong vocational sector in upper <b>secondary</b> <b>education)</b> <b>acts</b> as a safety net against dropout by offering less academically inclined students a valuable alternative with attractive labour market prospects. By contrast, while early tracking has no consistent effects in terms of average dropout rates, it dramatically boosts the effect of parental background. As regards the effect of the socio-economic context, we find a strong positive effect of poverty rates on the dropout risk of children of low-educated parents, boosting the effect of parental background. Secondly, we observe a negative effect of youth unemployment on dropout probabilities of children of high-educated parents (reduced opportunity costs), while the effect on children of low-educated parents turns out positive (reduced educational aspirations); this also strengthens the PBE. Finally, we find a strong negative effect on the average ESL-rates when qualifications offer an effective protection against unemployment, measured in terms of the relative odds of unemployment between unqualified and qualified adults. nrpages: 42 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} {{of domestic violence}} remains unacceptably high with numerous consequences ranging from psychological to maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity outcomes in pregnant women. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify factors that increased the likelihood of an event of domestic violence as reported by ever married Ghanaian women. Methods Data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) was analysed using a multivariate logistic model and risk factors were obtained using the forward selection procedure. Results Of the 1524 ever married women in this study, 33. 6  % had ever experienced domestic violence. The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 35  % for women who reside in urban areas. Risk of domestic violence was 41  % higher for women whose husbands ever experienced their father beating their mother. Women whose mother ever beat their father were three times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to women whose mother did not beat their father. The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 48  % less likely for women whose husbands had higher than <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> as compared to women whose husbands never had any formal education. Women whose husbands drink alcohol were 2. 5 times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to women whose husbands do not drink alcohol. Conclusion Place of residence, alcohol use by husband and family history of violence do increase a woman’s risk of ever experiencing domestic violence. Higher than <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> <b>acted</b> as a protective buffer against domestic violence. Domestic violence against women is still persistent and greater efforts should be channelled into curtailing it by using a multi-stakeholder approach and enforcing stricter punishments to perpetrators...|$|R
