5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs.</b> One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.|$|E
25|$|Swiss {{linguist}} Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) {{played a}} major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> that needs to be understood in order to fully understand the process of linguistics. The study of semiotics examines the signs and types of representation that humans use to express feelings, ideas, thoughts and ideologies. Although semiotics is often used in the form of textual analysis it also involves the study of representation and the processes involved with representation.|$|E

25|$|Writing is {{a medium}} of human {{communication}} that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, {{writing is a}} complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language, but a tool used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies {{on many of the}} same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> or symbols. The result of writing is called text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{for each}} of the above {{definitions}} there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function {{in the context of a}} body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.|$|E
500|$|The English word {{language}} derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European [...] "tongue, speech, language" [...] through Latin lingua, [...] "language; tongue", and Old French [...] The word {{is sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used for computer programming. Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language in this sense is a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> for encoding and decoding information. This article specifically concerns the properties of natural human language as it is studied in the discipline of linguistics.|$|E
50|$|The flood <b>of</b> <b>signs,</b> images, narratives, and myths {{surrounding}} us influence {{our behavior}} {{by the use}} of codes.

Codes connect semiotic <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> meaning with social structure and values.

5000|$|The Nepalese Manual Alphabet is used not for NSL per se, but for code {{switching}} into Nepali (i.e. when a signer spells out a personal or place name, or a Nepali word). The {{importance of the}} forms of this alphabet are, however, not restricted to this function. Indeed, fingerspelling handshapes {{have been widely used}} in development <b>of</b> new <b>signs,</b> through a process perhaps borrowed from America's various <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>Signed</b> English, whereby the initial letter of the Nepali word is incorporated into the NSL, thus creating so-called [...] "initialized signs".

2500|$|Informal, {{rudimentary}} sign {{systems are}} sometimes developed {{within a single}} family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> naturally, unless repressed by the parents.

2500|$|The Dogon {{people with}} whom the French anthropologists Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen worked with during the 1930s and 40s had a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> which ran into the thousands, {{including}} [...] "their own systems of astronomy and calendrical measurements, methods of calculation and extensive anatomical and physiological knowledge, {{as well as a}} systematic pharmacopoeia."

2500|$|The problem lay {{in forming}} a {{primitive}} proposition which encompassed this and {{would act as}} the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, “The big question now is, how must a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!” [...] The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live [...] Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition {{by the time of the}} writing of the Tractatus. The Tractatus does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, “Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.”. This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} expression and sharing of domain-specific constraints and knowledge in engineering design. Pierce's theory <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> allows understanding why purely graphical 3 D CAD systems partially fail to support design teams during design review meetings and more generally during collaborative design episodes. This theory can help us to go further in analysing annotation systems as symbolic <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> and we draw a parallel with the 2 D standard drawing system, as {{they have the same}} semiotic nature. We show that semantic annotations can be considered to improve the semiotic richness in 3 D CAD representations. A case study illustrates the need for co-operation support to multi disciplinary design teams. In this paper we support the idea that future design tools should integrate both symbolic and iconic types of representations so that the designers could freely build shared representations taking advantage of the whole symbolic-iconic spectrum. We propose future developments reconciling the graphical precision of 3 D digital models with the semantic richness <b>of</b> symbolic <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs...</b>|$|R

50|$|Inaugurated by the {{linguist}} Ferdinand de Saussure, structuralism sought to clarify <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>signs</b> through analyzing the discourses they both limit and make possible.
