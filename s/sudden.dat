5|$|Populations of C.australis were {{decimated}} in {{some parts}} of New Zealand because of <b>Sudden</b> Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although <b>Sudden</b> Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of <b>Sudden</b> Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the disease was lessening.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the <b>sudden</b> re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the <b>sudden</b> gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo <b>sudden</b> gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a <b>sudden</b> acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and <b>sudden</b> impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{variables}} are stars that experience <b>sudden</b> increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events. This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and flare stars, {{as well as}} giant and supergiant stars.|$|E

Finland and Sweden split their semifinal, but the Finns advanced to the final in the overtime period after Selänne set up Marko Tuomainen's winning goal. The Czech Republic defeated Finland to capture the gold medal, also in a <b>sudden</b> victory period. Selänne finished the tournament with 11 points, {{was named to the}} all-star team and was voted the most valuable player of the World Championship.|$|E
5|$|The second semi-final of the 2008–09 Heineken Cup, {{the premier}} European club rugby union competition, saw Cardiff Blues take on Leicester Tigers at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 3 May 2009. The scores were level after regular time and neither team {{was able to}} score during extra time, {{resulting}} in the first ever penalty shoot-out in a professional rugby match. Both teams missed one of their first five kicks, taking the shoot-out to <b>sudden</b> death.

5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, <b>sudden,</b> temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of {{structures such as}} the hippocampus {{that are involved in}} memory.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not <b>sudden,</b> but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is <b>sudden,</b> on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.|$|E
25|$|In the Platform Sutra, the {{dichotomy}} between <b>sudden</b> and gradual is reconciled. Guifeng Zongmi, fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between <b>sudden</b> and gradual.

25|$|In NCAA collegiate {{play in the}} United States, however, <b>sudden</b> death, {{adopted in}} 1999 for all {{championship}} play in addition to regular season play, remains. In 2005, the Division II Women's Championship game ended in <b>sudden</b> death as a goal was scored three minutes into the overtime to end the championship match. <b>Sudden</b> death is also prevalent in youth play, {{for the safety of}} players.|$|E
25|$|The NBA Summer League, a {{developmental}} summer league, employs <b>sudden</b> death basketball {{after the first}} overtime. The rules state The second overtime period (or any overtime period thereafter) is <b>sudden</b> death (first team to score a point wins). In the first <b>sudden</b> death professional basketball game, Devin Ebanks hit a game winner with 45 seconds elapsed for the D-League Select team, beating the summer league Atlanta Hawks.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{increased}} risk of <b>sudden,</b> unexpected death among children and adults with this syndrome. The full cause is not yet understood but it is generally attributed to SUDEP (<b>Sudden</b> Unexplained Death in Epilepsy).|$|E
25|$|Indian dhyana was {{translated}} as chán in Chinese, and zen in Japanese. Ideologically the Zen-tradition stresses prajna and <b>sudden</b> insight, {{but in the}} actual practice prajna and samādhi, or <b>sudden</b> insight and gradual cultivation, are paired to each other. Especially some lineages in the Rinzai school of Zen stress <b>sudden</b> insight, while the Sōtō school of Zen lays more emphasis on shikantaza, training awareness of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference.|$|E
