Australia toured during the season, but Shrewsbury struggled in the Tests with scores of 4, 13, 4 and 9 as England defended The Ashes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low scoring series. The highest team innings was 176. Shrewsbury topped the domestic batting averages.|$|R
50|$|Graeme's highest {{first-class}} innings came on 10 August 2007, when {{he scored}} 65, <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 145-run <b>partnership</b> with David Sales. His best first-class bowling figures are 6/44, playing for Northants against Glamorgan at Northampton in September 2016.|$|R
50|$|In the 2005 season, Stokes {{made his}} first XI debut for Hampshire after {{spending}} a number of seasons in the Second XI. His first team debut came against Sussex in the 2005 Twenty20 Cup. Stokes played 14 Twenty20 matches for Hampshire from 2005 to 2006, playing his final match in that format against Middlesex in the 2006 competition. In the 2006 competition, he became {{at the time the}} youngest person to score a Twenty20 half century when he scored 62 against Middlesex <b>in</b> 2006, <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>partnership</b> of 122 with Michael Carberry for the 1st wicket, which as of the 2010 season remains <b>a</b> Hampshire record <b>partnership</b> for that wicket.|$|R

500|$|Selected for {{his first}} Sheffield Shield match, against South Australia three weeks after his record {{breaking}} innings, Ponsford—still batting down the order, at number five—made 108. The South Australian (and former Australian) captain Clem Hill watched Ponsford bat and commented, [...] " [...] is young and full of promise; in fact, since Jim Mackay, the brilliant New South Welshman, I think he is the best." [...] In 1923–24 Ponsford continued to score at a heavy rate. Against Queensland in December, he made 248 and <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>partnership</b> of 456 runs with Edgar Mayne—the highest first wicket <b>partnership</b> by <b>an</b> Australian pair to this day. Later that season, he scored a pair of centuries against arch-rivals New South Wales, accumulating 110 in each innings.|$|R

He scored two first class centuries in the season, including a personal highest score of 123 against Leicestershire. Northants once again reached {{the final of the}} T20 competition, but this time lost to Lancashire. The next year, Northants returned to Twenty20 finals day with Wakely again captain, and were this time victorious. He was involved in century partnerships in both the semi-final and the final. In the semi, against Notts he and Ben Duckett took Northants from 15/3 to 138/4, himself scoring 53 from 45 balls.

25|$|In October 2011, Davis {{was named}} in the Australian squad for the Hong Kong Sixes, but was later forced to {{withdraw}} due to state commitments. In November 2011, he signed with the Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash League for the 2011–12 season, however, he did not play any matches for the team due to injury. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales in February 2012, Davis scored 303 not out, a triple-century and his highest score in any form of cricket. He <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>partnership</b> of 389 runs with Adam Voges, the third-highest partnership for Western Australia. After this innings, he became the leading runscorer in the competition for the 2011–12 season. Davis was selected to tour England with the Australia <b>A</b> team <b>in</b> July and August 2012.

50|$|With Bowes and Verity {{dominating}} the following year, Smailes had fewer opportunities but his accuracy improved greatly. In the last match against Sussex he took ten wickets <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{match for the}} first time, but just missed his 100 victims. At {{the end of the}} 1934 season, Smailes was awarded his county cap. 1936, however, saw Smailes capture significant attention for the first time, with an impressive all-round performance against India of 77 (including three sixes) and ten wickets for 62 runs. He <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>partnership</b> of 167 with Verity for the ninth wicket, against Somerset, in one of the more remarkable county matches, and his fast-medium swervers could still be valuable as he showed with seven for 72 against Middlesex at Scarborough. Nonetheless, it was Smailes' development of off-spin - helped by the continuously soft wickets in the North - that caused his advance. In this style he took nine for 41 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> match against Worcestershire, six for 57 against Nottinghamshire and five for 39 versus Leicestershire.|$|R
50|$|Burgess was a {{right-handed}} middle order batsman and a left-arm bowler.

25|$|In 1921 Street scored his maiden {{century with}} an innings of 109 against Essex, <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 141 run <b>partnership</b> with Vallance Jupp. Street scored two fifties {{to finish the}} 1921 season with 617 runs at an average 21.27, the highest average of his career.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the next}} few seasons, Johnson played regular county cricket for Somerset, averaging, after <b>a</b> poor 1922, <b>in</b> the 20s, and {{making a lot of}} catches <b>in</b> the slips. <b>As</b> late as 1926, when he was nearly 46 years of age, he was <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> last-wicket <b>partnership</b> of 139 in 95 minutes with Robertson-Glasgow against Surrey at The Oval, making an unbeaten 117 himself.

25|$|Hyman was {{not able}} to {{reproduce}} this form in first-class cricket but from August 1912 and through the next two first-class seasons, he played pretty regularly as a professional batsman for Somerset, though the move had limited success. In 1913, he played an innings of 110 in the match against Sussex at Bath, and <b>shared</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second-wicket <b>partnership</b> of 159 with Peter Randall Johnson. But this was his only score above 50 in the season and his batting average was just 17.|$|R
25|$|It is {{reported}} that he was due only to watch the match at Weston-super-Mare against Northamptonshire, but found he was playing.
