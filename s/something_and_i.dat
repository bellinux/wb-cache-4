500|$|Tabloid {{criticism}} of Islam4UK and Choudary since {{news of the}} proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a [...] "hate preacher". In January 2010, appearing on the BBC's The Daily Politics, he was asked by its presenter, Andrew Neil, for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK, before being asked to comment on his financial status, claiming that it was [...] "relevant to our viewers". [...] Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter, {{and that he was}} [...] "doing <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't want to discuss that with you. [...] I'm not on Jobseeker's allowance, {{but at the same time}} I have family allowance, I have very firmly held views which I'm propagating at the same time." [...] Responding to the media's {{criticism of}} him, Choudary said [...] "I do believe that people have been whipped up into an anti-Islam anti-Muslim frenzy." ...|$|E

Choi and he said I was thinking too much about my swing," [...] Lee said. [...] "I was always working on <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am too technical sometimes so K.J. introduced me to Steve. Steve is a simple guy who is teaching me how to practise with better routine and how to trust my own game and not think too much.|$|E
2500|$|Lennon first {{conceived}} [...] "Please Please Me" [...] as a bluesy, slow tempo song. Lennon recalled: [...] "I {{remember the}} day I wrote it, I heard Roy Orbison doing 'Only the Lonely', or <b>something.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was also always intrigued by the words to a Bing Crosby song that went, 'Please lend a little ear to my pleas'. The double {{use of the word}} 'please'. So {{it was a combination of}} Roy Orbison and Bing Crosby". Originally it was vocally sparse, did not contain any harmonies or responses, nor did it have the scaled harmonica intro.|$|E

2500|$|St. James rose to fame in {{the late}} 1990s with her RIAA {{certified}} Gold albums God and Pray, the latter of which won a Grammy Award in 1999 for Best Rock Gospel Album. The albums spawned multiple singles, including [...] "God", [...] "Pray", and [...] "Yes, I Believe in God". Since then she has established herself {{as one of the}} most prominent musical artists in Contemporary Christian music (CCM), with four additional full-length studio albums: Transform, Worship God, If I Had One Chance to Tell You <b>Something</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> Will Praise You. Staple songs such as [...] "Wait for Me", [...] "Reborn", [...] "Song of Love", [...] "I Thank You", [...] "Alive", and [...] "Shine Your Glory Down", have all been derived from these releases. She has sold two million albums since starting her career.|$|E
2500|$|Several of Károlyi's {{athletes from}} the [...] "six-pack" [...] era have criticized his {{training}} methods. Some {{of his former}} athletes, including Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, and Erica Stokes, have stated publicly that Károlyi was verbally and psychologically abusive during workouts. Károlyi's constant critical remarks about weight and body type were said to drive some gymnasts to develop eating disorders and low self-esteem. Some gymnasts, such as Phillips, Moceanu, and 1988 Olympian Chelle Stack, have also said they were compelled to continue training and competing even when coping with serious injuries such as broken bones. In one interview, Moceanu, {{who was one of}} Károlyi's final protégés, said: [...] "I'm sure Bela saw injuries, but if you were injured, Bela didn't want to see it. ... You had to deal with it. I was intimidated. He looked down on me. He was six-feet <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was four-foot nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Sessions's {{confirmation}} hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, four Department of Justice lawyers {{who had worked}} with Sessions testified that he made racially offensive remarks. One of those lawyers, J. Gerald Hebert, testified that Sessions had referred to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) as [...] "un-American" [...] and [...] "Communist-inspired" [...] (Sessions said he was referring to their support of the Sandinistas) and that they did more harm than good by trying to force civil rights [...] "down the throats of people". Hebert, a civil rights lawyer, said that he did not consider Sessions a racist, and that Sessions [...] "has a tendency sometimes to just say <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe these comments were along that vein". Hebert also said that Sessions had called a white civil rights attorney [...] "maybe" [...] a [...] "disgrace to his race". Sessions said he did not recall making that remark and he did not believe it.|$|E

2500|$|Victor succeeded {{his uncle}} as 9th Duke of Devonshire in 1908, whereupon Evelyn became the Duchess of Devonshire. The Devonshires {{were one of}} the country's richest families, thought by some to have more wealth than the royal family. The Duchess was to oversee four large estates in England and one Irish castle. With her new position, she oversaw the {{reorganisation}} of the Devonshire estates. The Duchess strictly adhered to etiquette and her position, being characterised by a brother-in-law as [...] "accustomed to authority." [...] She was known for her abrasive personality; her granddaughter-in-law wrote that she [...] "was not altogether easy to get on with," [...] whilst another referred to her as [...] "an unpleasant woman." [...] Her husband's biographer described her as [...] "cold, authoritarian, and frugal," [...] and a servant recalled that [...] "she wouldn't speak to you unless she wanted <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't say she ever thanked you either." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Lynch {{was working}} on the first few episodes of Twin Peaks, his friend Monty Montgomery [...] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be {{executive}} producer or <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." [...] The book was Barry Gifford's novel Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula, which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was [...] "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called Wild at Heart, a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Describing his plot as a [...] "strange blend" [...] of [...] "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film The Wizard of Oz. Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community," [...] said Debnam-Carey. She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E

2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
