This study provides additional evidence consistent with the latter hypothesis. Three observable bank characteristics are examined as proxy measures for the interim private information used by rational depositors in assessing the riskiness of a bank's long-lived assets that may trigger bank runs. The three factors are (1) the distance of the solvent banks' headquarters from the headquarters of each failed bank; (2) the size of the solvent banks; and (3) the capital ratio as a proxy for their <b>solvency.</b> The <b>analysis</b> is conducted {{in the context of the}} five large bank failures that occurred in the Southwest region of the US during the mid- 1980 s.

40|$|AbstractThis paper tackles a broad topic by endeavouring to find {{solutions}} to avoid insolvency in regard to insurance companies in Romania. The maintenance of the solvency state of insurance companies requires them {{to have the ability}} to honour their obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries of the contract. We analysed solvency as a dependent variable - as compared to the degree of the exposure of solvency, since solvency is, in our opinion, a key element in the management of assets and liabilities, and is a topic that is currently preoccupying researchers. The importance of the research is underlined by the fact that this subject is highly relevant in regard to insurance companies who have been subject to increased market demands in a business environment that have become difficult to navigate. Through the study conducted, built on relevant opinions from academic literature, we chose as the objective of the research, the identification of the influence variables and the intensity with which they impact the degree of exposure of the Romanian insurance company's <b>solvency.</b> Our <b>analysis</b> led to the identifications of new elements that can optimize the effects of the insolvency law as applied to insurance companies in Romania...|$|R

To achieve this, we integrate several copula models and reinsurance contracts in a dynamic financial analysis framework and conduct numerical tests within a simulation study. Depending on the reinsurance contract and the copula concept employed, we find large differences in risk assessment for the ruin probability and for the expected policyholder deficit.

These are two basic requirements in achieving the financial stability of the company. If liquidity reflects the company's ability to meet short-term obligations, solvency reflects company's ability to meet the medium and long term maturities. One {{of the most important}} premises which determine the effective development of a company refers to the action of providing liquidity and solvency. These are the key indicators of financial stability management. Ensuring the solvency is the priority objective of a company that wants to maintain a financial autonomy and the flexibility of management resulting from the balance between revenues and cash flow payments. Liquidity represents the indicator that reflects the quality of the company's financial balance on short-term and measures the ability of the company to meet short-term obligations through rapid transformation of current assets into cash. The purpose of the research includes studying and analyzing the liquidity and solvency of the company whose scope should be reflected in achieving the optimal coefficients of the two indicators. Liquidity and <b>solvency</b> <b>analysis</b> is done by the system of rates that actually reflect those indicators that highlight whether a company has availability to meet short-term maturities or if the size of debt and financial costs allows the company to meet the medium and long term maturities...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze {{financial}} performance Kertosono Sustainable Sugar Factory from year 2006 - 2008 in terms of liquidity, solvency and Profitability. Types of data used are secondary data. Methods of data collection with interviews and documentation. Data analysis methods used to analyze liquidity, <b>solvency</b> <b>analysis,</b> analysis, profitability analysis and additional indicators according to the Decree of Finance Minister No. 826 /KMK. 013 / 1992. Results from this study states that the level of overall company financial performance according to the Decree of Finance Minister No. 826 /KMK. 013 / 1992 indicate that financial performance Kertosono Sustainable Sugar Mill from 2006 until the year 2008 has decreased continuously, at year 2006 with very healthy condition, the year 2007 with an unhealthy condition and the year 2008 with an unhealthy condition, which reflects the company's health conditions in poor condition. This is probably caused by some internal factor, which includes the settlement of the sale, the costs increased primarily non-operating costs, debt servicing capabilities must be enhanced and the purchase of fixed assets used by the company is more intended for operational activities. So for the next period the company must consider these factors in order to achieve its goals as expected.

The company also began consider sortly nonoperating expenses...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the statistical/mathematical model selected and the variable set considered on the ability to identify financially troubled life insurers. Models considered are two artificial neural network methods (back-propagation and learning vector quantization (LVQ)) and two more standard statistical methods (multiple discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis). The variable sets considered are the insurance regulatory information system (IRIS) variables, the financial <b>analysis</b> <b>solvency</b> tracking (FAST) variables, and Texas early warning information system (EWIS) variables, and a data set consisting of twenty-two variables selected by us in conjunction with the research staff at TDI and a review of the insolvency prediction literature. The results show that the back-propagation (BP) and LVQ outperform the traditional statistical approaches for all four variable sets with a consistent superiority across the two different evaluation criteria (total misclassification cost and resubstitution risk criteria), and that the twenty-two variables and the Texas EWIS variable sets are more efficient than the IRIS and the FAST variable sets for identification of financially troubled life insurers in most comparisons.

The views expressed in this Working Paper {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the authors and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. The paper explores the extent to which the pressure of debt service on other spending items may push governments to embark on fiscal consolidation beyond what is strictly necessary to secure <b>solvency.</b> The empirical <b>analysis</b> identifies thresholds of interest bill indicators beyond which governments appear to shift to policies aimed at durably curbing the debt trajectory. Hence, in the current context of high inherited public debts, countries experiencing rising borrowing costs and interest payments would be more likely to enact more aggressive fiscal consolidations than warranted by strict solvency concerns. Conversely, those benefiting from persistently low interest rates despite rising debt stocks would likely opt for a more gradual fiscal consolidation path than what solvency considerations would normally dictate...|$|R
40|$|The Spanish {{financial}} system {{is experiencing a}} very turbulent economic period in which loan defaults has lived an unprecedented increasing period, going from being less than 1 % in 2004 to levels of above 13 % in 2013. The impact of this, along with other circumstances, {{has led to the}} greatest financial restructuring ever made to date in Spain, with important macroeconomic and microeconomic consequences. This paper studies the determinants of delinquency (loan default) in Spanish credit institutions for the period of 2004 - 2011 and introduces new variables that have been disclosed as relevant in the current financial crisis as well as others non-previously considered internal variables, such as hedging derivatives (which are having an increasingly greater importance in accounts of Spanish credit institutions). Among the most prominent variables that have {{had a significant impact on}} the increase of delinquency are, among external variables, house prices, unemployment rates and the number of companies declaring bankruptcy and, among internal variables, property investment, customer credits over active, interest rate, participated companies and <b>solvency</b> rates. The <b>analysis</b> also shows significant differences in delinquency¿s behavior between savings banks and banks and between credit institutions that needed recapitalization and those that did not...|$|R
