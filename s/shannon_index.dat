5|$|The {{quantity}} of benthic macroinvertebrates at sites in Tangascootack Creek has been {{measured by the}} West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition using different systems. These sites included designations T-1 and T-2the main creek just {{above and below the}} entry of Muddy Run, respectivelyand T-3 which is further downstream from T-2. Total taxa richness, as measured by the organization, ranged from 3 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 7 at site T-1, with an average of 4.3. The EPT Taxa Richness (measured on a scale of 0 to 4) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 2 at site T-1, with an average of 0.7. The scores of the sites according to version 3 of the Beck’s Index (twice the number of pollution-intolerant benthos taxa plus the number of facultative benthos taxa) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 6 at site T-1. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (a method of determining a stream's ecosystem quality based on its benthic macroinvertebrates), the sites ranged from 3.538 for site T-1 to 6.2 for site T-2, with an average of 5.024. On the <b>Shannon</b> <b>index,</b> the sites ranged from 0.950 at site T-2 to 1.925 at site T-3, with an average of 1.325.|$|E

Based on these criteria, none of the study sites of hot springs in the Eastern Amhara region exceeded the 1.5 level of the <b>Shannon</b> diversity <b>index,</b> for birds (Table  3). Especially, bird <b>Shannon</b> diversity <b>index</b> was below 1 at 50  % of the sites studied.

30|$|Due to {{the effects}} of {{temperature}} and the OMCs on OTUs, the Shannon diversity was also influenced (Additional file 1 : Table S 4). On the one hand, it has been found that relatively higher temperature would lead to lower <b>Shannon</b> diversity <b>index.</b> For example, in SP group on day 21, the <b>Shannon</b> diversity <b>index</b> was 2.136 at 30  °C, 1.307 at 35  °C, 1.406 at 40  °C, 1.176 at 45  °C and 0.835 at 50  °C. On the one hand, the <b>Shannon</b> diversity <b>index</b> was different under different OMCs. For example, at 30  °C on day 21, it was 1.257 in S group, 2.136 in SP group, 1.807 in SC group and 1.312 in SPC group, while at 50  °C on day 21, it was 0.849 in S group, 0.835 in SP group, 0.845 in SC group and 0.910 in SPC group.

5|$|The highest <b>Shannon</b> Diversity <b>Index</b> of any {{stream in}} the Fishing Creek {{watershed}} is around 2.75, for West Branch Fishing Creek.

5000|$|When {{all types}} in the dataset of {{interest}} are equally common, all [...] values equal , and the <b>Shannon</b> <b>index</b> hence takes the value [...] The more unequal the abundances of the types, the larger the weighted geometric mean of the [...] values, and the smaller the corresponding Shannon entropy. If practically all abundance is concentrated to one type, and the other types are very rare (even if {{there are many of}} them), Shannon entropy approaches zero. When there is only one type in the dataset, Shannon entropy exactly equals zero (there is no uncertainty in predicting the type of the next randomly chosen entity).|$|E
50|$|When {{interpreted}} in ecological terms, {{each one of}} these indices corresponds to a different thing, and their values are therefore not directly comparable. Species richness quantifies the actual rather than effective number of species. The <b>Shannon</b> <b>index</b> equals log(qD), and in practice quantifies the uncertainty in the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset. The Simpson index equals 1/qD and quantifies the probability that two individuals taken at random from the dataset (with replacement of the first individual before taking the second) represent the same species. The Gini-Simpson index equals 1 - 1/qD and quantifies the probability that the two randomly taken individuals represent different species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Shannon</b> <b>index</b> {{has been}} a popular {{diversity}} index in the ecological literature, where it {{is also known as}} Shannons diversity index, the Shannon-Wiener index, the Shannon-Weaver index and the Shannon entropy.

The idea is that the more different letters there are, and the more equal their proportional abundances in the string of interest, the more difficult it is to correctly predict which letter will be the next one in the string. The Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty (entropy or degree of surprise) associated with this prediction. It is most often calculated as follows: ...|$|E

Organic manure has been shown to have profound effects on bacterial population diversity (Naeem and Li 1997) and nutrient cycling rates (Philippot et al. 2013), which play an important role in microbial functions and processes (Chaer et al. 2009).|$|R

This measure allows weighting rare and abundant species in different ways, just as the diversity indices collectively do, but its meaning is intuitively easier to understand.
