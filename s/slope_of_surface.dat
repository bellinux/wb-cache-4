40|$|The {{intraperitoneal}} injection of standard young rats of race A with 2 / 5 cc. of adrenalin chloride 1 : 50, 000 results in increased speed of geotropically oriented creeping upon an inclined surface. It {{was expected that}} the effect of such increased frequency of stepping must be analogous to that due to imposition of added loads carried by the rats during geotropic progression. This is verified. The curve connecting θ with log sin α is distorted, under adrenalin, so as to be comparable to that obtained with an added mass of approximately 2. 5 gm. upon the young rat's saddle; the threshold <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> for orientation is accordingly lowered, from α = 20 ° to α = 12. 5 °; at the new threshold <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> the mean orientation angle θ is the same as in the absence of adrenalin at the corresponding threshold <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface.</b> The total variation of performance is significantly increased in the injected rats, and at given <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> the variation is slightly increased. The proportionate modifiable variation of response is quite unaffected by the distortion of the θ – α curve, and is the same as in standard young A rats untreated or carrying additional loads.

40|$|ABSTRACT With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of {{magnetic storage media}} in home and industry, it's very urgent to investigate the tribological behavior of recording media and improve their tribological properties. In the late 1980 's, {{the invention of the}} friction force microscope makes it feasible to evaluate the surface morphology and microtribological properties at nano scale. The surface morphology, surface adhesion and microtribological behavior of magnetic audio tapes were investigated by a new developed atomic force/friction force microscope (AFM/FFM). The results show that the surface roughness and grain size of three kinds of audio tapes made in China are almost equal to those of abroad tapes. The friction force at a given load and friction coefficient of Sony tape are larger than those of Nature tapes.

These are in fact identifiable among the forty-one individuals carefully studied. Their classification is concordant with the behavior of the respective indices of variation of θ, for which an interpretation has been provided. The basic result is, therefore, that the three receptor groups of excitation units are inherited independently, and alternatively as regards the members of a homologous pair, and that rather simple dominance relations obtain between homologous groups from the two races, namely that a B effect is dominant over the homologous A effect. This interpretation has been tested in various ways, and is in principle completely consistent with the results of a similar experiment involving races A and K...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{roughness}} on the directional spectral emissivity {{as well as}} the directional and hemispherical total emissivities was systematically studied for the precious metals silver, gold, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and iridium in order to avoid or minimise the effect of oxidation and other chemical reactions. The microtopography of these surfaces, which were mechanically treated by rolling, turning, grinding, lapping, and polishing, and subjected to an appropriate thermal treatment to remove crystal structure defects caused by roughening, was characterised by roughness measurements yielding roughness profiles and their statistical characteristics such as roughness height, roughness transfer length, and average <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> elements. The emis-sivities were measured by radiometric techniques in the wavelength range 2. 5 mm to 51 mm and in the angular range 08 to 758 at a temperature of 150 8 C. The results of the emissivity and roughness measurements are discussed within the scope of the existing theories for the emissivity of rough surfaces. It was found that roughnesses with heights smaller than a fraction 0. 01 of the wavelength can still affect the radiative properties of the surface. However, the emissivity does not monotoni-cally increase with the roughness height but rather correlates with the slope of parts of the surface profile. For the same metal with different surface finish, the directional total emissivity was observed to vary by at most a factor of 20. These changes are much larger than those caused by structural defects due to roughening and should be attributed to the surface topography. ...|$|E

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] surface tension of polymers in a supercritical fluid {{is one of the}} most important physicochemical parameters in many engineering processes, such as microcellular foaming where the surface tension between a polymer melt and a fluid is a principal factor in determining cell nucleation and growth. This paper presents experimental results of the surface tension of polystyrene in supercritical carbon dioxide, together with theoretical calculations for a corresponding system. The surface tension is determined by Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis-Profile (ADSA-P), where a high pressure and temperature cell is designed and constructed to facilitate the formation of a pendant drop of polystyrene melt. Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations are applied to simulate the surface tension of a corresponding system, and good qualitative agreement with experiment is obtained. The physical mechanisms for three main experimental trends are explained using SCFT, and none of the explanations quantitatively depend on the configurational entropy of the polymer constituents. These calculations therefore rationalize the use of simple liquid models for the quantitative prediction of surface tensions of polymers. As pressure and temperature increase, the surface tension of polystyrene decreases. A linear relationship is found between surface tension and temperature, and between surface tension and pressure; the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> tension change with temperature is dependent on pressure.

40|$|In {{article was}} {{formulated}} and {{solved the problem}} of conditional nonlinear technical and economic optimization of the distance between intermediate supports, uniform in height, during {{the design of the}} cable metro lines in highly urban-ized city environment. The optimization problem involves a single-criterion objective function that expresses the cost of construction of the cable metro line (total cost of intermediate supports and their foundations, traction and carrying steel cables and technical equipment). The specified objective function subject to minimization by finding the optimal combination of the distance between intermediate supports and tension carrying ropes with accounting constructive, modal, structural and planning constraints in the form of nonlinear inequalities. The optimization algorithm was based on the direct method of optimization type, Hooke-Jeeves, which was modified taking into account the need of varying the height of intermediate supports with a constant step equal to the step of unification. When constructing the objective function were considered three possible forms sagging of carrying ropes, which can be implemented for various values of the efforts of their tension. Analysis was done of the influence of the step unification and minimum size of interme-diate supports on their optimum step, the cost of intermediate supports, the cost of 1 km cable metro line for different values of the angle <b>of</b> the longitudinal <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> relief along the cable metro line. The graph of height of uni-fied supports from the angle <b>of</b> the longitudinal <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> relief has discrete-step type. With the increase of the step unify the discreteness increases: the width of the range of angles <b>of</b> the longitudinal <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> relief within which the height of the supports remains constant, increases. The graph of step installation of unified supports along the cable metro line from the angle <b>of</b> the longitudinal <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> relief also has discrete-step type. The transition to a larger height unified intermediate supports determines the need for installation of supports with a large pitch. Its value then begins to decrease monotonically with further increase of the angle <b>of</b> the longitudinal <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> relief until it needs to transition to the new size of supports. Synchronous change in the optimal values of the height and step of the installation of intermediate supports, depending on the angle <b>of</b> the longitudinal <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the sur-face relief leads {{to the fact that the}} optimal cost characteristics of the cable metro lines are smooth functions. It has an extreme character with a minimum at angles of inclination <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> elevation ~ 5 degrees, which is associated with the form of sagging of the load-bearing ropes. Unification of intermediate supports has little effect on the optimal cost characteristics of the cable metro lines. Even for a sufficiently large step of the unification the largest difference in op-timal value is almost insignificant: it lies in the range of 2 [...] . 3 %, increasing with increasing the angle <b>of</b> the longitudinal <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> relief and unit cost of the intermediate support.

40|$|Measurement of the geotropic {{orientation}} of young rats creeping upon an inclined surface has {{lead to a}} theory of the orientation. For a number of well-inbred lines of rats tested, the relationship between angle of orientation 8 on the inclined surface and {{the slope of the}} surface (a) is a specific, characteristic, reproducible property. The curve connecting 0 with a, for a standard age of individual (13 - 14 days), defines the tropistic orientation as a type of performance, in terms of an essential condition of the performance. I The curve for each race of rats is compound, comprising three segments; each of these segments behaves as an independent heritable unit in crosses between different races (Crozier and Pincus, 1929 - 30 a, b, 1931 - 32 e). The complete curve, extending from a threshold <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> to an upper slope beyond which no further significant increase in extent of upward orientation is apparent, is interpreted as resulting from the fact that two elements are concerned in the sensory excitation which results in the oriented creeping. One of these is the magnitude of the gravitational pull experienced by the legs which support and propel the body mass; the second is the frequency with which this gravitational pull acts upon the legs. Each of these elements is directly controlled by the slope of the surface upon which creeping takes place; the speed of 1 In a discussion of this matter which is not at all clear, von Buddenbrock (1931, pp. 716 et seq.) claims that this performance is not tropistic in character, but is a manifestation of a "higher activity; " but he completely ignores the development of the quantitative treatment which derives from the elementary assumption as to the nature of a tropistic performance (Crozier, 1929), namely, that orientation is maintained when excitation is sensorially equivalent upon the two sides of a bilaterally symmetrical organism...|$|E
40|$|Extension of {{analysis}} of the functional basis of geotropic excitation and response in young rats has made it desirable to obtain, for additional genetically stabilized lines, further tests of the quantitative reproducibility of orientation data as secured from successive generations in these lines {{over a period of}} several years; and of the measures of variation of performance as these are related to the exciting vector and to the extent of orientation. Procedures are illustrated whereby the significance of measurements can be checked automatically. It is shown that differences apparent in the geotropic behavior of three inbred lines of R. norvegicus are quantitatively recoverable over a period of nine generations. The constant, characteristic features for each inbred line concern: the extent of upward orientation, absolutely and as a function of the inclination of the substratum; the threshold slope for orientation; the dispersion of mean orientation-angles as governed by the slope of substratum; the dependence of the dispersion of the relative variation of observed orientation-angles upon the intensity of excitation; and the proportion of the total variation of response which is modifiable as a function of the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface.</b> It is also shown that when for two lines of rats the curves connecting orientation-angle with inclination of substratum differ in position and in details of form, the curves none-the-less undergo distortions of homologous type when rats of these lines creep geotropically with the same additional load in the form of a mass attached at a corresponding position on the back; and that shifting this mass to another position induces a quite different modification of the curve. These effects are discussed in terms of the view that orientation during geotropic creeping is controlled by the adjustment of sensorially equivalent tension-excitation in the legs of the two sides of the body, and that the frequency distributions of thresholds for excitation within the several groups of receptor units concerned differ quantitatively among the inbred stocks, but are statistically constant within each line...|$|E

The definition of surface quality has been put in mathematical terms and quantitative requirements has been derived by ray-tracing. Mandrels, from which the mirrors are replicated, are required to have figuring errors of #<=# 5 - 6 arcsec HEW and #<=# 0, 5 nm surface microroughness as well as a power-spectrum <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> irregularities of #<=#- 1. Meanwhile this quality is achieved routinely by Carl Zeiss, who produce the mandrels. The mirrors are made by Media Lario in Italy using galvanic deposition on aluminum mandrels which are coated with a nickel layer and a gold layer. After numerous single shells and two mirror modules of four shells each two mirror demonstration models have been built by Media Lario which achieve the XMM specification. In the middle of 1995 the order was placed to build a mirror qualification model containing 20 X-ray qualified shells. The mirror development went along with numerous X-ray testing by the TS team using the 120 m long X-ray test facility PANTER of the MPE. In 1992 / 3 the facility originally used for the ROSAT project had to be reconstructed for testing larger mirror shells as well as performing the 'Electrical Optical Breadboard Tests' of the XMM focal plane instruments and the reflection grating spectrometer. In particular the vacuum tank housing the test specimen was enlarged to a length of 12 m at a diameter of 3, 5 m. The mirror development has reached the stage that the XMM specifications are met. The PANTER facility is qualified for testing and calibrating the telescope flight models and performing the 'end-to-end' tests with the flight models of the experiments. (orig.)

40|$|Races of Rattus norvegicus {{labelled}} A and B give characteristic curves relating {{angle of}} orientation θ during geotropic progression to the inclination (α) of the surface. The orientation-angles for B are higher at every slope, and the threshold slope for orientation is lower in B. When these races are cross-bred, the F 1 progeny show a θ-α curve in general corresponding {{to that for}} the B parent, as regards both threshold slope and magnitudes of θ. Differences between the curve for F 1 and B have to do (1) with a slight but significant distortion of the curve, such that from α = 15 ° to about (α = 35 ° the mean curve is slightly above that for B, whereas above this <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface,</b> θ is consistently below that for B, and (2) below α = 35 ° the horizontal latitude of variation in the curve θ vs. log sin α {{is much greater than}} above α = 35 °. The first distortion is interpreted as due to the fact that, as a manifestation of heterosis, developmental processes which upon the one hand lead to growth in bulk in the posterior region of the body, and on the other which would lead to a proportionate development of tension receptors in the legs, fail to keep pace harmoniously. In ordinary development of individuals in a pure line, harmonious relationships between these two aspects of growth are maintained. The variation of response (θ) is not altered in F 1, if attention is paid to the total observed variation; but the unmodifiable or uncontrollable portion of the total variation of θ, not affected as a function of sin α, is increased. This fact is more pronounced in female offspring from the matings A ♂ x B ♀. This effect in F 1 is interpreted as due to the introduction of modifying genetic influences, which affect variation of orientation. The percentage of modifiable variation is reduced from 74 per cent (mean) in B to about 59 per cent in F 1. These interpretations are checked by the behavior of offspring produced in the backcross F 1 x B. The disharmony of developmental processes thought to be signalized by the distortion of the form of the θ-α curve disappears completely in these backcross individuals. It can be computed that an equivalent distortion of the θ-α curve for B would be produced by the posterior attachment of a mass of about 0. 5 gm., unaccompanied by its proportion of receptors in the legs; in backcrossing to the B line, this should be reduced in the average to about " 0. 25 gm.," which is at about the threshold for any detectable effect of a mass added posteriorly. The variability of θ in (F 1 x B) is not different from that for B, or for F 1 (total variation); but, as must be expected if the unmodified variation has been increased in F 1 by the action of modifying genetic influences not directly connected with the genes determining the numbers of tension-receptors, we find that in (F 1 x B) the percentage of modifiable variation is returned half-way (65 per cent) toward that for the B line. The bearing of certain considerations derived from the treatment of this case is discussed with reference to the desirability that other phenomena of "hybrid vigor" and heterosis be similarly analyzed...|$|E
