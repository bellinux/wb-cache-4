40|$|An {{apparatus}} for rejecting {{waste heat}} from a system located {{on or near}} the lunar equator is presented. The system utilizes a reflective catenary shaped trough deployed about a vertical radiator to shade the radiator from heat emitted by the hot lunar surface. The catenary shaped trough is constructed from a film material and is aligned relative to the sun so that incoming solar energy is focused to a line just above the vertical radiator and can thereby isolate the radiator from the effects of direct sunlight. The film is in a collapsed position between side by side <b>support</b> <b>rods,</b> all of which are in a transport case. To deploy the film and <b>support</b> <b>rods,</b> a set of parallel tracks running perpendicular to length of the <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> are extended out from the transport case. After the support tracks are deployed, the <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> are positioned equidistant from each other {{along the length of the}} support tracks so that the flexible film shade between adjacent <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> is unfolded and hangs in a catenary shaped trough. A heat radiator is supported between each pair of <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> above each hanging reflective trough...|$|R

40|$|The helical slow-wave circuit embodies a {{helical coil}} of {{rectangular}} tape supported {{in a metal}} barrel by dielectric <b>support</b> <b>rods.</b> Although the helix slow-wave circuit remains the mainstay of the traveling-wave tube (TWT) industry because of its exceptionally wide bandwidth, a full helical circuit, without significant dimensional approximations, has not been successfully modeled until now. Numerous {{attempts have been made}} to analyze the helical slow-wave circuit so that the performance could be accurately predicted without actually building it, but because of its complex geometry, many geometrical approximations became necessary rendering the previous models inaccurate. In the course of this research it has been demonstrated that using the simulation code, MAFIA, the helical structure can be modeled with actual tape width and thickness, dielectric <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> geometry and materials. To demonstrate the accuracy of the MAFIA model, the cold-test parameters including dispersion, on-axis interaction impedance and attenuation have been calculated for several helical TWT slow-wave circuits with a variety of <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> geometries including rectangular and T-shaped rods, as well as various <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> materials including isotropic, anisotropic and partially metal coated dielectrics. Compared with experimentally measured results, the agreement is excellent. With the accuracy of the MAFIA helical model validated, the code was used to investigate several conventional geometric approximations in an attempt to obtain the most computationally efficient model. Several simplifications were made to a standard model including replacing the helical tape with filaments, and replacing rectangular <b>support</b> <b>rods</b> with shapes conforming to the cylindrical coordinate system with effective permittivity. The approximate models are compared with the standard model in terms of cold-test characteristics and computational time. The model was also used to determine the sensitivity of various circuit parameters including typical manufacturing dimensional tolerances and <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> permittivity. By varying the circuit parameters of an accurate model using MAFIA, these sensitivities can be computed for manufacturing concerns, and design optimization previous to fabrication, thus eliminating the need for costly experimental iterations. Several variations were made to a standard helical circuit using MAFIA to investigate the effect that variations on helical tape and <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> width, metallized loading height and <b>support</b> <b>rod</b> permittivity, have on TWT cold-test characteristics...|$|R

40|$|A 2, 000 lbf {{jib crane}} {{is needed to}} replace an {{existing}} 1, 000 lbf jib crane in the Chemical Lab (Building MO- 733). The existing 1, 000 lbf jib crane (to be replaced) has a 174 boom (I-beam). The crane {{is attached to the}} wall through two brackets (about 8 1 / 2 -ft apart). The boom is attached to the lower bracket, and a <b>supporting</b> <b>rod</b> is attached to the upper bracket. The <b>supporting</b> <b>rod</b> is attached to the boom at about 8 -ft from the free end. After preliminary studies and discussions, it was decided to construct the new jib crane from two perpendicular I-beams (L-shape) without a <b>supporting</b> <b>rod.</b> The crane is to be supported on the wall through the two lower existing brackets (about 5 -ft apart). The boom is to be 20 -ft long cantilever (the horizontal I-beam). The vertical I-beam is to be attached to the lower two existing brackets to support the jib crane to the wall. This construction is to be similar to another existing 1, 000 lbf jib crane (L-shape) in the lab. The purpose of this document is to perform a design analysis for the proposed 2, 000 lbf jib crane to determine suitable sizes of members and configuration of the new jib crane assembly.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out {{to examine the effects of}} triplestarting helical grooves on the drag of fixed circular cylinders and the vortex-induced vibration of elastically supported cylinders. For the elastically supported cylinder, the Reynolds number varied from 1. 3 x 104 to 4. 6 x 104, whilst for the fixed cylinder from 3. 1 x 104 to 3. 75 x 105. A comparative approach which allows direct comparisons of the results was adopted where two cylinders of identical dimensions and physical properties with or without helical surface grooves were tested in exactly same experimental set-ups. In the elastically supported cylinder tests, the cylinders were attached to a vertically cantilevered <b>supporting</b> <b>rod</b> and towed in a towing tank. Both the in-line and cross-flow vibrations were permitted. In the fixed cylinder tests, the cylinders were supported on rigid vertical struts and towed horizontally in the same towing tank.

40|$|Objective: Whether {{or not a}} {{protective}} stoma reduces the rate of anastomotic leakage after distal colorectal anastomosis is still discussed controversially. It does however facilitate clinical management once leakage has occurred. Loop ileostomies seem {{to be associated with}} a lower morbidity and a better quality of life compared to loop colostomies. Generally, diverting loop ileostomies are secured at skin level by means of a supporting device in order to prevent retraction of the ileostomy into the abdomen. However, due to the <b>supporting</b> <b>rod,</b> difficulties may occur in applying a stoma bag correctly and leakage of faeces onto the skin may occur even with correct eversion of the afferent limb. Our aim was to compare morbidity and time to self-sufficient stoma-care in patients having a loop ileostomy with rod to those without rod. Methods: A total of 60 patients necessitating loop ileostomy were analyzed. Patients received surgery in of the two involved institutions according to inhouse standard procedures. 30 patients had an ileostomy with rod (VCHK Inselspital) and a further 30 without rod (KSW Winterthur). Morbidity and time to self-sufficiency regarding stoma care was analyzed during the first 90 postoperative days. Morbidity was determined according to a scoring system ranging from 0 to 4 points for any given set of possible complications (bleeding, necrosis, skin irritation, abscess, stenosis, retraction, fistula, prolapse, parastomal hernia, incomplete diversion), where 0 = no complication and 4 = severe complication.

40|$|Summary Flow {{visualizations}} {{are presented}} for the wake behind a spherical body moving {{along a plane}} wall in the Reynolds number range 100 < Re < 350. Five different rotation rates are examined and as the sphere undergoes forward rolling, the observed wake modes bear similarities to the flow behind an isolated sphere in a free-stream. For cases with reversed and zero rotation of the sphere, a new anti-symmetric wake mode is observed. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Sedimenting particles near a wall experience fluid forces which exert {{a moment on the}} body, resulting in a net rotation [1]. The present study aims to understand more fully the flow structures that form in the wake of such a body. This has been examined, to a certain degree, for the cylinder moving along a wall [2, 3] but information is so far lacking for the case of the sphere. Experiments were carried out in a closed water tunnel equipped with a moving floor. Boundary layer suction took place {{at the start of the}} working section to remove the boundary layer developing upstream.

A <b>supporting</b> <b>rod</b> extends underneath a specialized region consisting of alternating thin and thick transverse rows of irregular dense patches, and with surface ridges around (all or) most of the surface of the sperm. Primary spermatocytes in the prophase of the first meiotic division have synaptonemal complex(es), and are rich in mitochondria. In early spermiogenesis, mitochondria are arranged around the surface of the nucleus, a dense layer appears at one pole of the nucleus, close to an apposed dense layer at the cell membrane in which a row of microtubules develops. The intercentriolar (= central) body develops close to the nucleus. The fully developed intercentriolar body has a regular striation and is located perpendicular and close {{to the surface of the}} nucleus. Two flagella extend into the space surrounding the outgoing median process, their basal bodies are located perpendicular to the intercentriolar body and their cross-striated rootlets extend along the surface of the rounded nucleus. At a later stage, rootlets and flagella become more parallel with the intercentriolar body, the nucleus and the fused mitochondria migrate into the median process, and the flagella become {{incorporated in}}to the median process (= sperm body). The outgrowing spermatozoa are connected to the cytoplasm of the cytophore by dense arching membranes. Finally, rootlets of flagella are resorbed and the spermatozoa are pinched off close to the basal bodies.
