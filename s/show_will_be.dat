5|$|Writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{of the show}} TGS with Tracy Jordan have decided to rig the TGS auditions—in which they are {{in search of a}} new cast member on the show—by planning to add bad actors so that their preferred choice, Jayden Michael Tyler (Nick Fondulis), gets hired by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place and worries that her position on the <b>show</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the show, reassures Jenna that the two have nothing to worry about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden. Jenna eventually figures out what Liz and Pete are scheming, so she and Tracy go out and find people (Angela Grovey and David Perlman) and bring them to the TGS auditions.|$|E
