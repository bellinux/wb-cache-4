40|$|The {{continuing}} {{creation of}} portfolio insurance applications {{as well as}} the mixed research evidence suggests that so far no consensus has been reached about the effectiveness of portfolio insurance. Therefore, this paper provides a performance evaluation of the stop-loss, <b>synthetic</b> <b>put</b> and constant proportion portfolio insurance techniques based on a block-bootstrap simulation. Apart from more traditional performance measures, we consider the Value-at-risk and Expected Shortfall of the strategies, which are more appropriate in an insurance context. An additional performance evaluation is given by means of the stochastic dominance framework where we account for sampling error. A sensitivity analysis is performed in order to examine the impact on performance of a change in a specific decision variable (ceteris paribus). The results indicate that a buy-and-hold strategy does not dominate the portfolio insurance strategies at any stochastic dominance order. Moreover, both for the stop-loss and <b>synthetic</b> <b>put</b> strategy a 100 % floor value outperforms lower floor values. For the CPPI strategy we find that a higher CPPI multiple enhances the upward potential of the CPPI strategies, but harms the protection level in return. As regards the optimal rebalancing frequency, daily rebalancing should be preferred for the <b>synthetic</b> <b>put</b> and CPPI strategy, despite the higher transaction costs.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on whether pre-harvest pricing strategies can improve returns over cash sales at harvest. It also examines cash flow needs of such strategies. The analysis is conducted for Ohio corn produced from 1986 through 1999. The pre-harvest strategies evaluated (short futures, long <b>put,</b> <b>synthetic</b> long <b>put,</b> put-call fence) did not statistically improve returns over cash sales at harvest. However, if implemented during or before planting, these naÃ¯ve strategies reduced the standard deviation of annual gross income. Substantial cash flow may be incurred, either to establish the strategy or meet margin calls. Therefore, assessments of pre-harvest pricing strategies should include cash flow needs, along with return and risk.

The first strategy, super-replication, {{while maintaining the}} portfolio value greater or equal to a target value, minimizes the transaction cost of replicating a debt insurance put option by using dynamic linear programming. The second strategy replicates this put option by maximizing the guarantor's expected utility. A comparative study shows that both strategies give better results than the Leland (1985) method. If we use a risk-adjusted performance metric, the utility-based method performs best when transaction costs are relatively low. When transaction costs are relatively high, the two strategies yield similar results and still outperform Leland's.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the validity and reliability of a new method for measuring three-dimensional (3 D) putting stroke kinematics using the TOMI 1 device. A putting robot and a high-speed camera were used to simultaneously collect data for the validity evaluation. The TOMI 1 device, when used in conjunction with standard 3 D coordinate data processing techniques, was found to be a valid and reliable method for measuring face angle, stroke path, putter speed, and impact spot at the moment of ball contact. The validity of the TOMI 1 measurement system was quantified using the 95 % limits of agreement method for each aforementioned variable. The practical significance of each validity score was assessed by incorporating the maximum estimated measurement error into the stroke of the putting robot for 10 consecutive putts. All putts were executed from a distance of 4 m on a straight and flat <b>synthetic</b> <b>putting</b> surface. Since all putts were holed successfully, the measurement error for each variable was deemed to be negligible for the purposes of measuring putting stroke kinematics.

The strategies are compared relatively to each other under di erent market conditions. The comparison is conducted using three types of criteria: return criteria, risk criteria and investor preferences criteria. The results showed neither OBPI nor CPPI outperforms the other in terms of terminal portfolio value and payo s. Neither of OBPI or CPPI returns stochastically dom- inate the other at rst order. The Vega function analysis showed that the OBPI is much more sensitive to the underlying risky asset volatility than CPPI where the sensitivity is negative and becomes more negative with higher multiples. In terms of oor protection CPPI dominated OBPI in a bearish market and has been domi- nated by OBPI in bullish and no trend markets.

Our measure builds on the methodologies proposed by Almeida and Garcia (2015) and Almeida, Ardison, Garcia, and Vicente (2016), which rely in solving dual minimization problems of Cressie Read discrepancy functions in spaces of probability measures. Due to the recently documented robustness of the Hellinger estimator (Kitamura et al., 2013), we adopt within the Cressie Read family, this specific discrepancy as loss function. From this choice, we derive a minimum Hellinger risk-neutral measure that correctly prices an observed panel of hedge fund returns. The estimated risk-neutral measure is used to construct our tail risk measure by pricing <b>synthetic</b> out-of-the-money <b>put</b> options on hedge fund returns of ten specific categories.

The study found that increasing fluid velocity, fiber aspect ratio, and consistency decreased the dispersion level. The study also found that the effect of individual parameters is more pronounced than the role of the interactive terms on the fiber flocculation. 	The second case considered was applying the fiber dispersion analysis to computer-synthesized images consisting of different arrangements of fibers. Four sets of sub-cases were presented. These sub-cases were divided based on the fiber-concentrated location and fiber distribution. The use of computer-synthesized images was found to be very useful to simulate real situation during fiber dispersion. 	The third case investigated the fiber distribution on a dry paper. Images for different types of paper were taken and evaluated to see the dispersion level of each type of paper. It was found that the current texture analysis was applicable to determine the dispersion level for dry papers. 	While three cases indicated that the texture analysis can be used to investigate the fiber dispersion, the texture analysis used here is not a perfect and universal method and may not be suitable to analyze other types of dispersions. The human vision will always be essential to determine if the texture analysis is applicable to any other problem...|$|R

The role of the engineer in synthetic biology is to apply engineering principles to the design and analysis of proposed systems. Building biological systems de novo are the best way to demonstrate our successes on this front and so far has yielded biological devices such as synthetic promoters, toggle switches, oscillators, and logic gates. Here we aim to push the current boundaries of synthetic biology and study the principles behind engineering pattern formation in ensembles of E. coli cells. Motivated by the study of morphogenesis, we hope to develop synthetic systems with the high-minded goals of one day engineering molecular differentiation or even multicellularity. Pattern formation will be a critical part of these goals and brings an additional focus on cell-to-cell communication and signaling molecules. Here we examine two different communication mechanisms, quorum sensing and contact-based signaling, and see what types of patterns we can achieve. 	Using quorum sensing, we focus on diffusion-driven instability (Turing patterning), where a homogeneous steady state of an ensemble of cells is destabilized in the presence of diffusion. This is made possible by the conflicting interactions of the internal dynamics of the cells and the normalizing effect of diffusion between them. The work in this area thus far has centered around activator-inhibitor network theory and to date has yet to yield a biological experimental demonstration. Here we analyze the Turing mechanism and propose a new network which we call a “quenched oscillator” system and demonstrate its ability to produce diffusion-driven instability. We then propose a synthetic implementation and present work towards a partial implementation. In the process, we use zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) and small RNAs (sRNAs) to construct new <b>synthetic</b> inverters to <b>put</b> together in a ring oscillator for use in a quenched oscillator system. 	Interest in contact-based signaling has risen recently with the discovery of a contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) system in E. coli. While a synthetic contact-mediated communication channel has not yet been achieved, its realization will provide a huge boost in engineering possibilities, particularly for multicellular applications. Here we develop an analytical framework based on graph theory for analyzing lateral inhibition networks, a category that CDI falls under, for the existence and stability of equitable patterns. Without an actual CDI system to use, we develop what we call a “compartmental lateral inhibition” system using diffusible molecules and engineered communication channels to simulate contact-mediated signaling for verification of our patterning analysis. The current state of our synthetic implementation is presented, highlighting experimental setup details that may prove useful for future applications in engineered multicellular ensembles...|$|R

Leonard for the degree of Master of Forestry in Forest Operations presented on September 8 th. 2003 Title: Applications for Synthetic Rope in Logging Steel wire rope is used for many logging applications. This material has served the logging industry well in terms of strength, durability, and longevity. Steel wire rope is difficult to use because of properties that make it stiff, heavy, and unyielding. These same properties cause fatigue, exhaustion, and may contribute to worker injuries. Our research placed synthetic rope samples in the hands of selected loggers to try out alternatives to steel wire rope. Few studies have addressed the use of synthetic rope for logging applications. Initial trials with cooperating logging contractors showed positive ergonomics and logging productivity efficiencies. The logging industry is slow to change; so, not all of these initial trials were accepted. Designed research of synthetic rope in logging is needed to determine when synthetic rope is a suitable replacement for steel Vllfe rope. replace In our trials, we assessed static line applications (guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines) and running line applications for yarding and ground-based logging systems. Our running line applications using synthetic rope included two skidder / crawler tractor winching trials, a Boman Mark IV carriage trial, and a Koller K 300 mainline trial. Static line applications such as guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines are acceptable replacements of steel wire rope with synthetic rope. Loggers were more likely to try additional applications once they used synthetic rope as tree straps and were confident of its strength. Cost was an initial drawback for most logging contractors. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} damage, replacement, and wear criteria for synthetic rope in logging applications. Running line applications showed positive results in the skidder / crawler winching trials with faster cycle times and increased efficiencies for using synthetic rope. The Koller K 300 mainline trials also produced positive results as a running line. The Boman Mark IV internal drum carriage trial showed no significant differences between steel wire rope and synthetic rope. We believe designed research is necessary to evaluate carriage applications with synthetic rope. Future studies for static line applications should include guyline taglines, skyline taglines, haywire (rigging line) replacement, and various other applications. <b>Putting</b> <b>synthetic</b> rope into the hands of users will help identify valuable applications where synthetic rope has merit. Future studies for running lines should focus on designed trials to adequately observe the effects of synthetic rope in specific applications such as side-hill lateral yarding, uphill lateral pulling in winching trials, and other difficult logging conditions. Preliminary results show synthetic rope is a good candidate for the replacement of steel wire rope in selected logging applications. More research is needed to determine damage, replacement, and wear criteria for all applications of synthetic rope in logging...|$|R
