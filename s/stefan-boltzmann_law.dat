5|$|The visible {{radiation}} emitted by white dwarfs varies {{over a wide}} color range, from the blue-white color of an O-type main sequence star to the red of an M-type red dwarf. White dwarf effective surface temperatures extend from over 150,000K to barely under 4,000K. In accordance with the <b>Stefan–Boltzmann</b> <b>law,</b> luminosity increases with increasing surface temperature; this surface temperature range corresponds to a luminosity from over 100 times the Sun's to under 1/10,000 that of the Sun's. Hot white dwarfs, with surface temperatures in excess of 30,000K, have been observed to be sources of soft (i.e., lower-energy) X-rays. This enables the composition and structure of their atmospheres to be studied by soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet observations.|$|E
5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} interlinked, and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the <b>Stefan–Boltzmann</b> <b>law,</b> which relates the luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the mass–luminosity relation, which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between M and R is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E

In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured. It should be noted that an accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{negative}} feedback is that radiation leaving the Earth increases {{in proportion to the}} fourth power of temperature, in accordance with the <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> <b>law.</b> This feedback is always operational; therefore, while it may be overridden by positive feedbacks for comparatively small temperature changes it will dominate for larger temperature changes. An {{example of a}} positive feedback is the ice-albedo feedback, in which increasing temperature causes ice to melt, which increases the amount of heat that Earth absorbs. This feedback only operates in a restricted range of temperatures (those for which ice exists, and does not cover the whole surface; once all the ice has melted, the feedback ceases to operate).|$|E

At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly).

The COBE FIRAS instrument data in the 0. 15 - 2. 88 THz frequency interval at the mean temperatures T = 17. 72 K, T = 14 K, and T = 6. 73 K are used for calculating the radiative and thermodynamic functions, such as the total radiation power per unit area, total energy density, total emissivity, number density of photons, Helmholtz free energy density, entropy density, heat capacity at constant volume and pressure for the warm, intermediate-temperature and very cold components of the Galactic continuum spectra.

In the present work, a thermo-economic study of a Novikov power plant model is presented under three different regimes of performance: maximum power (MP), maximum ecological function (ME) and maximum efficient power (EP). In this study, different heat transfer laws are used: The Newton’s law of cooling, the <b>Stefan–Boltzmann</b> radiation <b>law,</b> the Dulong–Petit’s law and another phenomenological heat transfer law. For the thermoeconomic optimization of power plant models, a benefit function defined as the quotient of an objective function and the total economical costs is commonly employed.

40|$|AbstractIt has {{recently}} been suggested (S. B. Giddings (2016) [2]) that the Hawking black-hole radiation spectrum originates from an effective quantum “atmosphere' which extends well outside the black-hole horizon. In particular, comparing the Hawking radiation power of a (3 + 1) -dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of horizon radius rH with the familiar Stefan–Boltzmann radiation power of a (3 + 1) -dimensional flat space perfect blackbody emitter, Giddings concluded {{that the source of}} the Hawking semi-classical black-hole radiation is a quantum region outside the Schwarzschild black-hole horizon whose effective radius rA is characterized by the relation Δr≡rA−rH∼rH. It is of considerable physical interest to test the general validity of Giddings's intriguing conclusion. To this end, we study the Hawking radiation of (D+ 1) -dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. We find that the dimensionless radii rA/rH which characterize the black-hole quantum atmospheres, as determined from the Hawking black-hole radiation power and the (D+ 1) -dimensional <b>Stefan–Boltzmann</b> radiation <b>law,</b> are a decreasing function of the number D+ 1 of spacetime dimensions. In particular, it is shown that radiating (D+ 1) -dimensional Schwarzschild black holes are characterized by the relation (rA−rH) /rH≪ 1 in the large D≫ 1 regime. Our results therefore suggest that, at least in some physical cases, the Hawking emission spectrum originates from quantum excitations very near the black-hole horizon...|$|R
40|$|Muon and tau neutrinos (#nu#_x) {{interact}} with protoneutron star matter only via neutral currents and exchange energy with the stellar gas predominatly by neutrino-electron scattering and neutrino-pair processes. In contrast, electron neutrinos and antineutrinos (#nu#_e and anti #nu#_e) are frequently absorbed and produced in charged-current mediated reactions with nucleons. Therefore the emergent #nu#_e and anti #nu#_e originate from layers with lower temperatures further {{out in the}} star and are emitted with much lower characteristic spectral temperatures. In addition, a major contribution to the #nu#_e and anti #nu#_e opacities is due to absorptions, while the opacity of #nu#_x is strongly dominated by scattering reactions with nucleons and nuclei in which the #nu#_x energy is (essentially) conserved. Therefore the #nu#_x distribution is nearly isotropic when #nu#_x decouple energetically and their outward diffusion is slowed down. In a generalized form to include this effect, the <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> Radiation <b>Law</b> can account for both the facts that #nu#_e (anti #nu#_e) and #nu#_x emerge from the star with similar luminosities but with very different characteristic spectral temperatures. Simple analytical expressions to estimate the effect are given. If, as recently argued, even at densities significantly below nuclear matter density neutral-current scatterings were associated with considerable energy transfer between neutrino and target particle, one might expect spectral temperatures of #nu#_x much closer to those of #nu#_e and anti #nu#_e.

Yet, the observed changes in upper ocean temperature (approx. 0. 1 K) were approximately twice those expected from the <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> black-body radiation <b>law</b> for the Earth's surface, with phase lags (0 deg. to 30 deg. of phase) much shorter than the 90 deg. phase shift expected as well. Moreover, White et al. (1997, 1998) found the Earth's global decadal mode in covarying SST and SLP anomalies phase locked to the decadal signal in the Sun's irradiance. Yet, Allan (2000) found this decadal signal also characterized by patterns similar to those observed on biennial and interannual time scales; that is, the Troposphere Biennial Oscillation (TBO) and the El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This suggested that small changes in the Sun's total irradiance could excite this global decadal mode in the Earth's ocean-atmosphere-terrestrial system similar to those excited internally on biennial and interannual period scales. This is a significant finding, proving that energy budget models (that is, models based on globally-averaged radiation balances) yield unrealistic responses. Thus, the true response must include positive and negative feedbacks in the Earth's ocean-atmosphere-terrestrial system as its internal mode (that is, the natural mode of the system) respond in damped resonance to quasi-periodic decadal changes in the Sun's irradiance. Moreover, these responses are {{not much different from}} those occurring internally on biennial and interannual period scales...|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of atmosphere can appreciably warm a planet’s surface above {{the temperature of}} an airless environment. Known as a natural Greenhouse Effect (GE), this near-surface Atmospheric Thermal Enhancement (ATE) as named herein is presently entirely attributed to the absorption of up-welling long-wave radiation by greenhouse gases. Often quoted as 33 K for Earth, GE is estimated as a difference between planet’s observed mean surface temperature and an effective radiating temperature calculated from the globally averaged absorbed solar flux using the <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> (SB) radiation <b>law.</b> This approach equates a planet’s average temperature {{in the absence of}} greenhouse gases or atmosphere to an effective emission temperature assuming ATE[*]≡[*]GE. The SB law is also routinely employed to estimating the mean temperatures of airless bodies. We demonstrate that this formula as applied to spherical objects is mathematically incorrect owing to Hölder’s inequality between integrals and leads to biased results such as a significant underestimation of Earth’s ATE. We derive a new expression for the mean physical temperature of airless bodies based on an analytic integration of the SB law over a sphere that accounts for effects of regolith heat storage and cosmic background radiation on nighttime temperatures. Upon verifying our model against Moon surface temperature data provided by the NASA Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we propose it as a new analytic standard for evaluating the thermal environment of airless bodies. Physical evidence is presented that Earth’s ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth’s total ATE is ~ 90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE[*]=[*]GE[*]+[*]TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE[*]>[*] 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth’s ATE defined as GE[*]=[*]ATE – TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.|$|R
