40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable displacement pumps) or bleed <b>off</b> <b>valves</b> (for fixed displacement pumps). Variable displacement pumps require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. Bleed <b>off</b> <b>valves</b> represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a fixed displacement pump (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a bleed <b>off</b> <b>valve,</b> but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|R

25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow <b>off</b> <b>valve).</b> Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|Inspection {{disclosed}} that the bombs had dished in the hull plating {{in the vicinity}} of the after torpedo room and the maneuvering room, causing a leak in a vent riser. Less than ten minutes after the Japanese plane had been sighted, the commanding officer decided to discontinue the patrol.

In addition, all three radio antennas were down, a leak in her pressure hull had been aggravated, and Tunnys rudder action indicated possible damage. She set her course for Balintang Channel and surfaced late in the day on 2 September. Tunny continued to sight Japanese airplanes as she made her way to Hawaii. She completed this patrol on 17 September at Pearl Harbor.|$|R

25|$|The ported shroud is a {{performance}} enhancement {{that allows the}} compressor to operate at significantly lower flows. It achieves this by forcing a simulation of impeller stall to occur continuously. Allowing some air to escape at this location inhibits the onset of surge and widens the operating range. While peak efficiencies may decrease, high efficiency may be achieved over a greater range of engine speeds. Increases in compressor efficiency result in slightly cooler (more dense) intake air, which improves power. This is a passive structure that is constantly open (in contrast to compressor exhaust blow <b>off</b> <b>valves,</b> which are mechanically or electronically controlled). The ability of the compressor to provide high boost at low rpm may also be increased marginally (because near choke conditions the compressor draws air inward through the bleed path).

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a distribution system for liquid media, for example, liquid, comprising a manifold from which several pipes branch <b>off.</b> <b>Valves</b> for {{opening and closing}} are allocated to the pipe branches. The manifold consists of pipe sections placed adjacent to each other, whereby said pipe sections can be moved in relation to each other, and a collar for abutting a valve body is provided in the inside of each pipe section. The valve bodies are seated on a rigid valve stem which is arranged centrally in the manifold. A flexible diaphragm is arranged between the two facing ends of adjacent pipe sections, said diaphragms forming a diaphragm chamber between said pipe sections. By moving two pipe sections or their facing ends apart, the pipe branch allocated to this diaphragm is opened for the liquid medium conveyed in the manifold...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLab on Chip {{technologies}} have enabled {{the possibility of}} novel μTAS devices (micro Total Analysis System) that could drastically improve health care services for billions {{of people around the}} world. However, serious drawbacks that reside in fluid handling technology currently available for these systems often restrict the commercialization of such devices.
