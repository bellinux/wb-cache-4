5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E

25|$|The {{cycle and}} motor {{manufacturing}} industries brought into existence {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary trades. Most notably these were general engineering, metal casting, drop forging, chain-making and the manufacture of instruments and gauges, machine tools, and all types of electrical equipment. The manufacture of aircraft, aero engines and related equipment also took place in Coventry as early as 1916, and during World War II the aircraft industry dwarfed all other local industries. With the outbreak of war many of the motor firms switched to aircraft work, and the whole of Coventry's industrial skills and resources turned to war production of one <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of one <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.|$|E

Agrippa was for {{some time in the}} service of Maximilian I, probably as a soldier in Italy, but devoted his time mainly {{to the study of the}} occult sciences and to problematic theological legal questions, which exposed him to various persecutions through life, usually in the mode described above: He would be privately denounced for one <b>sort</b> of heresy <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> He would only reply with venom considerably later (Nauert demonstrates this pattern effectively).|$|R

25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures of one <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> the Menasco engines being {{the primary source of}} those problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Films noir tend {{to revolve}} around heroes {{who are more}} flawed and morally {{questionable}} than the norm, often fall guys of one <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as [...] "alienated"; {{in the words of}} Silver and Ward, [...] "filled with existential bitterness". Certain archetypal characters appear in many films noir—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: Laura, The Killers, The Naked City, and Touch of Evil.|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing.

The eunuchs were all slaves who did all of the work in the Forbidden City such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining guests, and all of the bureaucratic work needed to govern a vast empire and serving as the emperor's advisers. The eunuchs spoke in a distinctive high-pitched voice and to further prove that they were really eunuchs had to keep their severed penises and testicles in jars of brine that they wore around their necks when working. The Forbidden City was full of treasures, which the eunuchs were constantly stealing and selling on the black market. The business of government and of providing for the emperor created further opportunities for corruption and virtually all of the eunuchs engaged in theft and corruption of one <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
