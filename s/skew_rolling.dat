40|$|The {{rolling process}} is an {{excellent}} method for processing new high performance polymers. <b>Skew</b> <b>rolling,</b> as a highly accurate and highly efficient rolling technology, has been commonly used to enhance mechanical properties and productivity. However, {{the complexity of the}} mechanics in the <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> process of polymers is a significant challenge for manufacturers and researchers. In this work, models for calculating the deformed area under parallel rolling and <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> have been developed. Based on the models, interactive force models in the rolling process have also been developed. Finite element analysis was used to simulate the rolling process. Experimental results were compared with the force model and simulation results. A study on angle compensation based on the influences of angle and friction conditions on force ratio Fxd/Fzd in the <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> process was carried out. The results showed the accuracy of models and equations, and the work offered the possibility of angle compensation for the two polymers employed in this study...|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{kinematic}} stabilization of rolling cylinders is developed for high-speed cylindrical roller bearings. This stabilization requires race and roller crowning to produce {{changes in the}} rolling geometry as the roller shifts axially. These changes put a reverse <b>skew</b> in the <b>rolling</b> elements by changing the rolling taper. Twelve basic possible bearing modifications are identified in this paper. Four have single transverse convex curvature in the rollers while eight have rollers with compound transverse curvature composed of a central cylindrical band of constant radius surrounded by symmetric bands with both slope and transverse curvature...|$|R
40|$|A {{theory of}} {{kinematic}} stabilization of rolling cylinders is extended {{and applied to}} the design of cylindrical roller bearings. The kinematic stabilization mechanism puts a reverse <b>skew</b> into the <b>rolling</b> elements by changing the roller taper. Twelve basic bearing modification designs are identified amd modeled. Four have single transverse convex curvature in their rollers while eight have rollers which have compound transverse curvature made up of a central cylindrical band surrounded by symmetric bands with slope and transverse curvature. The bearing designs are modeled for restoring torque per unit axial displacement, contact stress capacity, and contact area including dynamic loading, misalignment sensitivity and roller proportion. Design programs are available which size the single transverse curvature roller designs for a series of roller slopes and load separations and which design the compound roller bearings for a series of slopes and transverse radii of curvature. The compound rollers are proportioned to have equal contact stresses and minimum size. Design examples are also given...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{incorporates}} {{an array}} of Contact Potential Difference (CPD) sensors to measure and monitor the degree of <b>skew</b> in the <b>rolling</b> elements of a spherical roller bearing. Skewing is the motion of a roller as it turns about an axis normal to the roller race interface. Roller skew is generated {{as part of the}} kinematic effects of roller bearings. Skew monitoring is important for bearing design as it is an indirect measure of bearing life. 	For the purpose of this thesis, roller skew was measured utilizing multiple pairs of CPD probes located around the bearings outer raceway at varying points of the loading zone. These CPD probes are not in direct contact with the rollers, but in close proximity to their surface (through the bearing outer ring). The skew angle measured is related to different operating conditions such as applied load, shaft speed, and lubrication. 	The pair of CPD probes detected a signal as the roller surface passed by and the phase difference between the two distinct signals measured the skew angles in the range of 0. 016 to 1. 10. The shaft is rotated both clockwise and counterclockwise to capture any probe misalignment which was in the range of 0. 5 up to 2. 0. This thesis also provides a model for the probe signal as a spherical roller surface passes the probe surface. M. S.

40|$|Currently {{magnesium}} alloy bars are manufactured {{mainly in the}} extrusion process. This method has some drawbacks, which include: low process capacity, considerable energy demand, small length of finished products. Therefore it is purposeful to develop efficient methods for manufacturing of Mg alloy products {{in the form of}} bars, such methods include groove rolling and three-high <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> processes. Modified stretching passes provide change in material plastic flow, which contributes to the occurrence of the better distribution of stress and strain state than in the case of rolling in classical stretching passes. One of the modern method of Mg alloy bars production is rolling in a three-high <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> mill, which allows to set in a single pass a larger deformation compared to the rolling in the stretching passes...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new method for producing stepped rail axles. The method {{is based on}} the <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> process. With this method, the product is formed by three tapered rolls located every 120 ° on the perimeter of the billet. Positioned askew to the centerline of the billet, the rolls rotate in the same direction and with the same velocity. At the same time, they get closer together or go apart depending on the desired cross sectional reduction of an axle step. In addition, the workpiece is shifted lengthwise relative to the rolls by the translational motion of the workpiece-holding chuck. In order to verify the designed method for producing rail axles, a series of numerical simulations were performed using the Simufact. Forming v. 12 simulation software. The numerical modeling enabled the determination of maps of the effective strain and temperature in the finished product as well as variations in the loads and torques during rolling. The numerical results unambiguously confirm that the <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> method can be applied to form parts of considerable dimensions (the modeled axles had a length of 2146 mm and their maximum diameter was 202 mm) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Bimetallic bars which possess higher {{corrosion}} resistance and mechanical properties, {{it is the}} newkind of bimetallic bars which are better than standard bars. The bimetallic bars are more often applied in concreteconstruction. There are few methods which ensure a good strength of bimetallic layer bond. Hydrostatic extrusion,rotary rolling and explosive cladding are most often used methods. Design/methodology/approach: The simulations of the bar rolling in a three-high skew mill were carriedout using the Forge 2005 ® commercial program. Findings: The higher value of yield stress of the cladding layer does not produce the effect of “flowing down” ofthis layer over the core surface and it’s folding between the rolls. The use of non-corrosive steel on plating layerassures receipt on a high durability and esthetics bimetallic bars. Practical implications: Bimetallic bars are chiefly used in the building industry at production of concreteconstructions, and as working elements in bridge building in aggressive environment. Originality/value: Production of bimetallic bars is very difficult. One from many problems during productionbimetallic bars is assurance good strength of bimetallic layer bond. A theoretical analysis of bimetallic bar rollingin a three-high skew mill {{is presented in the}} paper and the distributions of stress and strain intensities in thebimetallic bar during <b>skew</b> <b>rolling</b> are shown...|$|E
