However, the complex nature of the turbulent swirling in-cylinder flow necessitates experimental data for validation of the used turbulence models. In the present work, the flow in a dynamic scale model of a uniflow-scavenged cylinder is investigated experimentally. The model has a transparent cylinder and a movable piston driven by a linear motor. The flow is investigated using phase-locked stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) and time resolved laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Radial profiles of the phase-averaged mean velocities are computed from the velocity fields recorded with PIV and {{the validity of the}} obtained profiles is demonstrated by comparison with reference LDA measurements. Radial profiles are measured at five axial positions for 15 different times during the engine cycle and shows the temporal and spatial development of the swirling in-cylinder flow. The tangential velocity profiles {{in the bottom of the}} cylinder near the end of the scavenging process are characterized by a concentrated swirl resulting in wake-like axial velocity profiles and the occurrence of a vortex breakdown. After <b>scavenge</b> <b>port</b> closing the axial velocity profiles indicate that large transient swirl-induced structures exists in the cylinder.

However, at certain conditions the engine can not work properly as predicted.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} ways {{of identifying}} sources of acoustic emission (AE) in the liners of large (10 MW) diesel engine cylinders. A set of experiments using simulated sources of AE {{were carried out}} on a cylinder liner of around 600 mm bore, allowing the development of techniques to accurately identify wave arrival time, attenuation and effects of geometric changes on propagating waves. The experiments with simulated AE sources were used to characterise the signal propagation to chosen locations on the liner surface. Wave propagation within the liner is complex due to variations in wall geometry and is further complicated when a number of waves can propagate around the liner and arrive at the sensor at the same time. A technique for source identification on the cylinder liner has been developed based on wave arrival time.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Free Piston Energy Converter (FPEC) is a {{new type}} of {{automotive}} prime mover, offering high efficiency in conjunction with low emissions. The FPEC essentially consists of two opposing cylinders with a linear alternator incorporated in-between that produces electric power directly. As indicated by the name, there is no mechanical linkage that controls the motion of the piston in the FPEC. Instead the piston moves {{as a response to the}} forces acting upon it, which implies that the piston motion will depend on operating conditions. Furthermore, it is possible to vary the compression ratio in simple manners, without any hardware modifications. However, by eliminating the crank mechanism a simple and effective way of control is removed, and control issues are the major drawback of the FPEC. Modeling was performed in order to investigate the multi-fuel capability of the FPEC, which is an inherent benefit of its variable compression. A dynamic model predicting the movement, velocity, acceleration and frequency of the translator was used in an iterative manner, together with the commercial 1 -D gas dynamic code BOOST, and detailed chemistry calculations in the SENKIN code. Reduced mechanisms of Diesel, gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen were used. Furthermore, detailed chemistry simulations employing a partially stirred reactor (PaSR) approach together with a detailed combustion mechanism (70 species participating in 306 reactions) of a Diesel oil surrogate, represented by a blend of n-heptane and toluene, were performed using the 3 -D CFD code KIVA- 3 V.

5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959. Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did {{not refer to}} the cylinder displacement, but rather to the year it was introduced. Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid L) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid L). It was a simplified version of the Series 53 {{that did not have}} exhaust valves. This was accomplished by using loop <b>scavenging</b> <b>ports</b> for both intake and exhaust along with a mechanical blower. This engine used a dry sleeve with 9 intake ports and three exhaust ports in that sleeve. These sleeves were located {{in such a way that}} the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the intake ports in the block. This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the intake ports just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the intake ports while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height. The net compression ratio is 18:1. Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture. Instead, the blower forced air in the intake ports and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by a gear pump. As fuel is injected just before top dead center, little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine. The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine. The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the intake air and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the air intake. The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible. Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses. It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use. This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency. It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.|$|R

50|$|The Winton Engine Corporation {{produced}} the first practical two-stroke diesel engines in the 400 to 1,200 hp (300 to 900 kW) range. They powered early Electro-Motive Corporation (another GM subsidiary) diesel locomotives and U.S. Navy submarines. In 1934 an 8-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447 kW), 8-201A diesel engine powered the first American diesel-powered train the Burlington Zephyr streamliner passenger train. The locomotive diesel manufacturing side of Winton {{became part of}} the Electro-Motive Corporation (later the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors) in 1935. The 2-stroke Winton Model 201 series engines featured Uniflow <b>scavenging</b> with intake <b>ports</b> in the cylinder walls and exhaust valves in the cylinder heads which would carry over to later Cleveland Diesel designs. They were a 60 degree opposed V type engine with mechanical injection. They were produced for rail use until late 1938 when the new lighter-weight diesel engine with more speed and flexibility had been developed and introduced as the EMC designed Model 567 series. EMD's successor is still producing locomotive engines based on the Model 567 design.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an opposed-piston {{two-stroke}} (OP 2 S) gasoline {{direct injection}} (GDI) engine is introduced and its working principles and scavenging process were analyzed. An optimization function was established to optimize the scavenging system parameters, include intake port height, exhaust port height, intake port circumference ratio, the exhaust port circumference ratio and opposed-piston motion phase difference. The effect of the port height on the effective compression ratio and effective expansion ratio were considered, and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) was employed as the optimization objective instead of scavenging efficiency. Orthogonal experiments were employed to reduce the calculation work. The effect of the scavenging parameters on delivery ratio, trapping ratio, scavenging efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency were calculated, and the best parameters were also obtained by the optimization function. The results show that IMEP {{can be used as}} the optimization objective in the uniflow <b>scavenging</b> system; intake <b>port</b> height is the main factor to the delivery ratio, while exhaust port height is the main to engine trapping ratio, scavenging efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency; exhaust port height is the most important factor to effect the gas exchange process of OP 2 S-GDI engine...|$|R
40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{developing}} a free-piston engine as an innovative internal combustion engine for the generation of electrical power. The arrangement of the Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG) in opposed-piston design consists of two piston units oscillating freely, thereby alternately compressing the common combustion chamber {{in the center of}} the unit and gas springs on either side. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving pistons into electric energy. Since the pistons are not mechanically coupled to a crank train, the bottom and top dead centers of the piston movement can be varied during operation e. g. to adjust the compression ratio. Utilizing these degrees of freedom, the present paper deals with the analysis of different combustion processes in a <b>port</b> <b>scavenged</b> opposed-piston combustion chamber prototype. This contains the experimental investigation of spark ignition (SI) as well as the transition to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Based on test bench results, a 3 D-CFD model, which has been used to develop the first prototype, is calibrated by actual measurements. The simulation results enable a deeper analysis of scavenging and in-cylinder processes exceeding the measurement possibilities on a test bench...|$|R
40|$|Computations {{were carried}} out to {{simulate}} in-cylinder flow field and mixture preparation of a small <b>port</b> <b>scavenged</b> direct-injection two-stroke spark-ignition engine using {{a modified version of}} KIVA- 3 code. Simulations of the interaction between air flow and fuel were performed on a commercial Piaggio (125 cc) motorcycle engine modified to operate with a hollow-cone injector located in different positions of the dome-shaped combustion chamber. The engine has a large exhaust port and five smaller transfer ports connecting the cylinder to the crankcase. The numerical grid of this complex geometry was obtained using an IBM grid generator based on the output of engine design by CATIA solution. To take into account the rapid distortion of flow, the standard k-ε turbulence model in KIVA- 3 was replaced by the RNG k-ε model. Three cases of hollow-cone injector locations were explored: one, located on the head, injected the fuel along the cylinder axis; another one, also located on the head, injected the fuel in counter flow; the third one, located on cylinder wall, injected the fuel towards the combustion chamber. It was found that the most important parameters that strongly influence in-cylinder droplet vaporization process and spatial vapor distribution are: fluid flow pattern, injector location, injection pressure and injection timing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Internet {{is rapidly}} nearing IPv 4 address space exhaustion. Current {{projections}} predict {{that within the}} next two years, all IPv 4 address blocks will have been assigned. IPv 6 adoption on the other hand has not ramped up as rapidly. As we transition from an Internet built on an abundance of IP addresses to one of scarcity, innovative techniques that allow us to do more with less are likely to flourish. One such class of emerging techniques attempts to utilize unused port ranges to implement IP address sharing. We call this class of approaches <b>Port</b> <b>Scavenging.</b> In this paper we present a unique approach that allows multiple end hosts on a network to share a single IPv 4 address by relying on a modified hardware address resolution protocol. Using the proposed approach it is possible to allow thousands of end hosts to share a single IPv 4 address {{and at the same time}} be able to maintain an end-to-end consistent network. Our approach is fundamentally different other techniques, as it does not require that packets from the end-host be modified at the network layer by an intermediate entity as they transit the network. In addition, each end-host can use a valid routable public IP address. We have developed an initial implementation of our ideas via a modified Linux kernel which demonstrates the feasibility of our approach. I...|$|R
