In this study, data of the energy and water consumption of 23 Portuguese schools and their main building characteristics and properties was gathered.

40|$|Embarrassment is {{an emotion}} that emerges during various {{purchase}} and consumption situations. There {{is a lack}} of studies comprehensively addressing how consumers behave when they are embarrassed. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} map how consumers behave during purchase process situations that cause embarrassment. To do so, drugstores were selected <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>places</b> where a number of products that can cause embarrassment, such as condoms, pregnancy tests, and day-after pills, can be purchased. In-depth interviews with 30 drugstore sales representatives and 26 consumers were conducted using an empiric investigation strategy. Content analysis resulted in the creation of a conceptual framework and some theoretical propositions. According to the framework, consumers, when feeling embarrassed, decide whether to abandon the purchase (by giving up or asking someone else to make the purchase) or if they face the situation, remain confident, and develop strategies to deal with the situation and finish it as soon as possible. The framework details consumers’ actions...|$|E

In 1970, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered that TRU wastes be segregated from other radioactive wastes and placed in retrievable storage until such time that the waste could be sent to a geologic repository and permanently disposed. Retrievable storage also defined container storage life by specifying that a container must be retrievable as a contamination-free container for 20 years. Hanford stored approximately 37, 400 TRU containers in 20 -year retrievable storage from 1970 to 1988. The Hanford TRU wastes placed in 20 -year retrievable storage are considered disposed under existing Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> in storage prior to September 1988.

40|$|Bioimpedance is {{a common}} feature of every tissue and its {{analysis}} allows {{the understanding of the}} physiological state of the tissue under test as well as its changes. The increase of glucose concentration can be detected by monitoring the tissue bioimpedance.

The scientific community has focused its efforts to find an integrated solution for in-vivo implantable bioimpedance measurement devices.

The objective of this thesis is to characterize the different shapes and configurations of probes suitable for bioimpedance in-vivo measurement applications. The electrode modeling and simulation, and analysis of its interaction with the tissue are performed by using the electronic design automation software ADS, from Agilent. Two shapes and six configurations are considered and analysed.

30|$|External coping {{strategies}} were used less commonly in the CHMH {{group compared to}} the control group {{with the exception of}} visiting health care services. Visiting health care services can be considered an external coping strategy, and contradicts studies saying that adolescents struggling with mental health problems show an overall coping strategy of avoidance (Chan 1995; Seiffge-Krenke 2000; Ebata and Moos 1991). This may, however, reflect the low threshold in Norway for visiting health units, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> in or near schools. Speaking with family and friends were little used {{coping strategies}} in all groups, especially in the groups with mental health problems, and may reflect social isolation in adolescents struggling with mental health problems with or without chronic headaches. According to Martin and Theunissen (Martin and Theunissen 1993), adults with chronic headaches score significantly lower on social support, compared to non-headache subjects, which can be an indicator that chronic headache sufferers are less able to seek support from family or peers. The study by Murberg and Bru (Murberg and Bru 2005) found decreased levels of symptoms of depression in Norwegian adolescents that seek parental support in stressful situations. According to the latter study, the importance of the external coping strategies seeking parental or friend support are essential for mental health among adolescents. Our data suggests it may be even more important when having the additional burden of a chronic headache.|$|R

However, unfortunately, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> also complex environments where the acoustic propagation is multipath, due to reflections from the waveguide boundaries.
