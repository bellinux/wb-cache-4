40|$|Abstract: <b>Spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of {{hydrological}} response {{are observed}} from field studies and remote sensing, and predicted by distributed hydrologic models. However, techniques for using <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> to assess model performance are presently very simple. Rather than make assessments {{based on the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns,</b> spatially explicit predictions are generally assessed using point observations or integrated responses. The problem of comparing two <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> {{is not unique to}} hydrology, and has been researched in many other disciplines (e. g. pattern recognition, image processing). Hydrologists currently rely on either simple quantitative comparisons or human perception to assess the spatial similarity of predicted and observed patterns. While visual methods work well at local scales and with simple patterns, larger scale and more complex patterns demand alternative techniques. Automation of new quantitative techniques should prove applicable to hydrological applications. This paper discusses various methods currently used for comparing <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> in hydrology. A review of promising techniques from other disciplines with potential application to hydrologically relevant <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> is then presented. Some preliminary assessment of these techniques is undertaken and future directions for this research are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Self-organized <b>spatial</b> <b>patterning</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in all ecosystems and {{is often associated with}} a positive effect on ecosystem functioning. Also on intertidal mudflats, dominating organisms form regular <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of different sizes and persistence. The main species who organise themselves in <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> on intertidal mudflats are the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis L.), dwarf eelgrass (Zostera noltii) and benthic diatoms. In this thesis three case studies will be presented considering these species and their spatial self-organisation. Overall {{it turns out that the}} underlying mechanism in all three species is the same, although specific interactions differ. In this mechanism, the so-called scale-dependent feedback model, a short-scale positive feedback and a large-scale negative feedback operate on the community, thereby creating <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns.</b> The effect of those patterns on ecosystem functioning is still under debate, but most evidence leads to the conclusion that self-organized <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> increase resilience and productivity of the ecosystem. A future management application of understanding self-organised <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> is their ability to predict ecosystem health and current stress levels. ...|$|R
25|$|Motor imagery {{involves}} {{the imagination of}} the movement of various body parts resulting in sensorimotor cortex activation, which modulates sensorimotor oscillations in the EEG. This can be detected by the BCI to infer a user's intent. Motor imagery typically requires a number of sessions of training before acceptable control of the BCI is acquired. These training sessions may take a number of hours over several days before users can consistently employ the technique with acceptable levels of precision. Regardless of the duration of the training session, users are unable to master the control scheme. This results in very slow pace of the gameplay. Advance machine learning methods were recently developed to compute a subject-specific model for detecting the performance of motor imagery.

25|$|The Eungella National Park, {{where the}} {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog was once found, was under threat from bushfires and weed invasion. Continual fires may have destroyed or fragmented {{sections of the}} forest. The outskirts of the park are still subject to weed invasion and chytrid fungus has been located within several rainforest creeks within the park. It was thought that the declines of the northern gastric-brooding frog during 1984 and 1985 were possibly normal population fluctuations. Eight months after the initial discovery of the northern gastric-brooding frog, sick and dead Eungella torrent frogs, which cohabitat the streams with gastric brooding frogs, were observed in streams in Pelion State Forest. Given the more recent {{understanding of the role}} of the amphibian disease in the decline and disappearance of amphibians, combined with the temporal and <b>spatial</b> <b>pattern</b> of the spread of the pathogen in Australia, it appears most likely that the disease was responsible for the decline and disappearance of the gastric-brooding frogs. Despite continued efforts to locate the northern gastric-brooding frog it has not been found. The last reported wild specimen was seen in the 1980s. In August 2010 a search organised by the Amphibian Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature set out to look for various species of frogs thought to be extinct in the wild, including the gastric-brooding frog.|$|E

We investigated <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of Chinese seed plant species diversity and analyzed the correlation between species richness and climatic factors at a large scale. Floral information was obtained from national and regional records of seed plants, and climatic data were taken from 642 observatory sites across China between 1970 and 2000. We detected large spatial variation in speciesrichness and density. Species density decreased with latitude. The following {{did not affect the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of species richness and species density: area, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and frost-free days. <b>Spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of species richness were affected by annual variation in mean annual temperature, mean temperature during the coldest month, spatial variation of mean annual temperature and precipitation. <b>Spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of species density were principally shaped by annual variation in mean annual temperature, mean temperature during the coldest month, spatial variation of mean annual temperature per unit area and spatial variation of mean annual precipitation per unit area. Linear step-wise regression models indicated that annual variation in mean annual temperature influenced <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of species richness, while spatial variation in mean annual temperature and the spatial variation in mean annual temperature per unit area fine-tuned them.

To complement Ripley’s K function, we use the Thomas process, a point pattern model, to quantify temporal changes in <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> for five tropical tree species known to have density-dependent mortality from species-specific pests and/or pathogens on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We fit the data of each species to the model to estimate the cluster size (σ) and density of cluster centres (ρ).

How do tiller <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> constrain seedling recruitment within the community?Locations: Artificial {{banks of the}} River Rhone, France. Material and Methods: We examined 45 vegetation patches dominated by Elymus repens. During a first phase we tested relationships between soil variables and three clonal traits (spacer length, number of clumping tillers and branching rate), and between the same clonal traits and <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> (i. e. density and degree of spatial aggregation) of tillers at a very fine scale. During a second phase, we performed a sowing experiment to investigate effects of density and <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of E. repens on recruitment of eight species selected from the regional species pool. Results: Clonal traits had clear effects - especially spacer length - on densification and aggregation of E. repens tillers and, at the same time, a clear response of these same clonal traits as soil granulometry changed. The density and degree of aggregation of E. repens tillers was positively correlated to total seedling cover and diversity at the finest spatial scales. Conclusions: <b>Spatial</b> <b>patterning</b> of a dominant perennial grass responds to soil heterogeneity through modifications of its clonal morphology as a trade-off between phalanx and guerrilla forms. In turn, <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> have strong effects on abundance and diversity of seedlings. <b>Spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of tillers most probably led to formation of endogenous gaps in which the recruitment of new plant individuals was enhanced. Interestingly, we also observed more idiosyncratic effects of tiller <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> on seedling cover and diversity when focusing on different growth forms of the sown species...|$|R

Geostatistical modelling was used to analyse the <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> of the taxa distributions. To test whether the spatial distributions of the different taxa were related to soil heterogeneity, we performed exploratory analyses of relationships between abundance of the bacterial taxa and key soil properties. The distributions of the relative abundance of most taxa varied {{by a factor of}} 2. 5 to 6. 5 and displayed strong <b>spatial</b> <b>patterns</b> at the field scale with autocorrelation ranging between 2 to 37 m.
