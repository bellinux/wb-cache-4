5|$|Josip Broz Tito's biographer Vladimir Dedijer {{described}} Misita's {{death as}} a great loss for the uprising. On 31 August 2008, the deputy speaker of the Serbian National Assembly, Božidar Delić of the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party,</b> dedicated a plaque to Misita in the Vuk Karadžić Square in Loznica. One of the people present was the man that had applied for the plaque to be installed, Božidar Panić, who had idolised Misita in his youth, and had lit a candle for him every year.|$|E
5|$|The ICTY also indicted Milošević, {{as well as}} Jovica Stanišić and Franko Simatović of the Serbian State Security Service, Croatian Serb {{political}} leader Goran Hadžić {{and the leader of}} the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> Vojislav Šešelj for various war crimes, including those committed in Vukovar. Milošević's trial ended without any verdict upon his death in March 2006, while the Vukovar-related charges against Stanišić and Simatović were dropped from their indictments even before the pair were acquitted on all counts in 2013. In March 2016, Šešelj was acquitted on all counts pending appeal. Hadžić died of cancer in July 2016, before his trial could be completed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> (Serbian: Српска народна радикална странка, Srpska narodna radikalna stranka) was {{an ethnic}} Serb {{political}} party in Austria-Hungary.|$|R
50|$|By mid-1920s, Plamenac did a {{complete}} turnaround, deciding {{to cut a}} deal with the Kingdom of SCS authorities, which allowed him to return home where he became a centrist politician with <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> of Nikola Pašić.|$|R
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Strache, the party has cooperated mainly with the Northern League, Vlaams Belang (successor to the Vlaams Blok, which it has traditionally maintained good ties with), and the Pro Germany Citizens' Movement in Germany. The FPÖ also has contacts with the Danish People's Party, the Slovak National Party, the Sweden Democrats, the Lithuanian Order and Justice, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany and the German Freedom party. In 2007, the party's then-only MEP {{was a member of}} the short-lived Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty grouping in the European Parliament. Outside the EU, it has contacts with Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Progressive Party (formerly of the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party),</b> the Swiss People's Party, the Israeli Likud, the U.S. Republican Party and the United Russia party.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Vojislav Šešelj taught {{political}} science at the University of Michigan after being expelled by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1981. In June 1989, he traveled to the United States again to meet with Momčilo Đujić in San Marcos, California, where Đujić named him Chetnik Vojvoda (duke in Serbian). He went on to form the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> in 1991 and was accused by the ICTY tribunal of leading the Beli Orlovi militants in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in war-state Republic of Serbian Krajina. Radovan Karadžić pursued post-graduate medical studies at Columbia University from 1974 to 1975, but did so without any specific political agenda at the time being; he later became the war-time president of the Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War and subsequently went into hiding in Serbia until his capture in 2008 for ICTY charges of war crimes and genocide.|$|E
5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{breakdown}} of the Federalist Bloc, the SLS was forced to redefine its tactics. From a federalist program, it turned back on the defence of purely Slovenian interests, trying to form a compromise with the centralist establishment. After multiple unsuccessful attempts, the SLS was included in the Yugoslav government in 1927, when it formed a coalition with the <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party.</b> The roles were now reversed, with the Slovene People's Party in government, and its former Croatian agrarian allies in opposition.|$|R
50|$|The Kingdom {{underwent}} a crucial change in 1921 {{to the dismay}} of Croatia's largest political party, the Croatian Peasant Party (Hrvatska seljačka stranka). The new constitution abolished the historical/political entities, including Croatia and Slavonia, centralizing authority in the capital of Belgrade. The Croatian Peasant Party boycotted the government of the <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> throughout the period, except for a brief interlude between 1925 and 1927, when external Italian expansionism was at hand with her allies, Albania, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria that threatened Yugoslavia as a whole.|$|R

50|$|The SPS {{during the}} Milošević era, {{has been accused}} by {{opposition}} of using an authoritarian style of rule and allowing a criminal economy to exist in Serbia including personal profiteering by the Milošević family from illegal business transactions in the arms trade, cigarettes and oil, although this illegal business {{was caused by the}} UN sanctions, and none of accusations for personal profiteering were ever proven at the court. Opposition media to the SPS or Milošević's administration were harassed by threats; media members involved were fired or arrested; independent media faced high fines mostly by Ministry of information led by the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party's</b> Aleksandar Vučić; state-sponsored paramilitaries seized radio equipment of opposition supporters; and in April 1999, the owner and distributor of the most popular daily newspaper in Serbia was killed, and although it was never proven on court that murder had any connections to SPS, opposition media and parties claimed so, but couldn't prove it even after they came to power. The SPS maintained the Communist era policy of maintaining connection with official trade unions; however, independent trade unions faced hostility and their activists were brutalized by police while in custody.|$|R
2500|$|Members {{of the new}} interim {{government}} soon gathered under the Presidency of Jovan Avakumović. Aleksandar Mašin was appointed Minister of Civil Engineering, Jovan Atanacković was appointed Minister of the Army, while Đorđe Genčić became Minister of the Economy.

Nikola Pašić, Stojan Ribarac and Jovan Žujović were also considered to be members of the new government but were absent from Belgrade {{at the time of the}} overthrow.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, {{faced with}} a {{constant}} prosecution by the regime, HRSS was forced to soften its policy, change its name into Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), recognize the Vidovdan Constitution and form a coalition with <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party.</b> This resulted in HSS losing its popularity which was seen in 1927 election when it lost almost third of votes won in the previous elections. After termination of the coalition agreement with the Radicals, HSS formed Peasant-Democratic Coalition with Pribičević's Independent Democratic Party. In 1928, Vladko Maček become new president of HSS after the assassination of Stjepan Radić.|$|R
25|$|Also, {{it would}} gather over 98% of Serbs of Yugoslavia in one state. In his speeches and books, Šešelj claimed {{that all of}} the {{population}} of these areas are in fact ethnic Serbs, of Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Muslim faith. However, outside of Šešelj's <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party,</b> the line as such was never promoted in recent Serbian political life.|$|E
25|$|After the World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina {{became part}} of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes which later {{transformed}} into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Serb monarchy, being one of the victors of the World War, sought Croat and Slovene political parties as their partners when forming the country. MNO, reformed into the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO), dropped the pursuit of Muslim national identity and focused on protecting the religious and existential issues of Muslims through coalescing with other parties, sometimes even with the Serbian parties such as Nikola Pašić's People's Radical Party and Milan Stojadinović's <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tomić was {{the editor}} of Srpsko kolo and Zastava {{magazines}} {{and founder of the}} People's Freethinker Party (Narodna slobodoumna stranka), which in 1891 became the Radical Party (Radikalna stranka). In 1889, following a drawn-out series of provocations regarding the honour of his wife, Tomić stabbed to death a liberal political rival, Miša Dimitrijević, {{the editor of}} Branik magazine, in Novi Sad. He served seven years in prison for murder, emerging in 1896 with no loss of political zeal. Not only political but economic issues had far reaching importance to him. Tomić, then the most vociferous opponent of the hierarchy, the leader of the <b>Serbian</b> <b>radical</b> <b>party</b> and son-in-law of Svetozar Miletić, blamed the clergy for driving people away from churches because of its insistence on controlling church and autonomous finances: Whoever has to worry about how to spend so much money has no more time to care for the church and people.|$|E
50|$|Plamenac {{immediately}} enrolled the Yugoslavian {{political life}} {{as a member of}} the <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> of Nikola Pašić. He also became a Minister in the Kingdom's Government, causing an outburst of public controversy regarding his post, nevertheless King Alexander remained strictly supportive on the matter, as part of his rehabilitation program. After Pašić's death, Plamenac quickly advanced in the Radicals' hierarchy and became a vigorous supporter and advocate of its policies of centrism. He became the regime's champion in the political fights against the Peasants of the pro-Green Montenegrin Federalist Party, accusing it for separatism and support of Yugoslavia's destruction.|$|R

50|$|The crisis {{led to the}} {{resignation}} of Jovanović on June 24, 1943. It was only temporarily resolved when Miloš Trifunović, {{a leader of the}} <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party,</b> became prime-minister. Ill feelings between the Croats and Serbs in London were exacerbated by reports of mass killings in Yugoslavia. Other major problems further undermined Trifunović’s position. One was the shift of British military and logistic help from Mihailović - staunchly supported by the Serbian majority in the government - to Tito’s partisans. Of a different nature was King Peter’s determination to marry the Greek Princess Alexandra: this was firmly opposed by the same Serbian ministers (and also Mihailović), who considered a royal wedding highly inappropriate during wartime.|$|R
500|$|On 28 June 1989, the 600th {{anniversary of}} the Battle of Kosovo, Đujić granted the title of vojvoda to Vojislav Šešelj, and ordered him [...] "to expel all Croats, Albanians, and other foreign {{elements}} from holy Serbian soil", stating he would return only when Serbia was cleansed of [...] "the last Jew, Albanian, and Croat". Šešelj {{was at the time}} an anti-Communist dissident and was subsequently described for his activities in the Yugoslav Wars as [...] "a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition." [...] Later Šešelj became leader of the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party,</b> a government coalition partner of Serbian President Slobodan Milosević. In 1998, Đujić publicly stated that he regretted awarding that title to Šešelj. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I was naïve when I nominated Šešelj [...] Vojvoda; I ask my people to forgive me. The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milošević" [...] and that he is [...] "disappointed in Šešelj for openly collaborating with Milošević's Socialist Party, with Communists who have only changed their name. [...] Šešelj has sullied the reputation of Chetniks and Serbian nationalism." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{they reached}} Ovčara, [...] away from Vukovar, the captives were ordered from the buses one-by-one {{and forced to}} run the {{gauntlet}} past dozens of JNA troops and Serb paramilitaries towards a farm storage building. Slavko Dokmanović, a former mayor of Vukovar, {{was one of the}} armed men involved in beating prisoners. As the captives were beaten, they were also stripped of their personal belongings, money and jewelry. Over the course of the day, the JNA military police failed to prevent soldiers of the Croatian Serb TO and Serbian paramilitaries from beating the prisoners in the storage building. They were beaten using sticks, rifle butts, chains, baseball bats, and in one instance a wounded prisoner was beaten with his own crutches. By sundown, at least two men were beaten to death. In addition, one of the captors shot five prisoners, including one Frenchman, who is presumed to be Nicolier. Seven or eight men were returned to Vukovar on orders of the JNA, presumably released at the intervention of their Serb neighbours. Ultimately, Mrkšić ordered the JNA military police to withdraw from the farm, leaving the prisoners in the custody of a Croatian Serb TO unit led by Miroljub Vujović, commander of the Croatian Serb TO in Vukovar, and the Leva Supoderica paramilitary unit. Leva Supoderica was a volunteer unit set up by the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> ( [...] ; SRS) in Šid, Serbia, and subordinated to the JNA's 1st Guards Mechanised Brigade.|$|E

5000|$|Croats were at {{the outset}} {{politically}} disadvantaged with the centralized political structure of the kingdom, which was seen as favouring the Serb majority. The political situation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was fractious and violent. In 1927, the Independent Democratic Party, which represented the Serbs of Croatia, turned its back on the centralist policy of King Alexander. On 20 June 1928, Stjepan Radić and four other Croat deputies were shot while in the Belgrade parliament {{by a member of}} the <b>Serbian</b> People's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party.</b> Three of the deputies, including Radić, died. The outrage that resulted from the assassination of Stjepan Radić threatened to destabilise the kingdom. In January 1929, King Alexander responded by proclaiming a royal dictatorship, under which all dissenting political activity was banned and renaming the state the [...] "Kingdom of Yugoslavia". The Ustaša was created in principle in 1929.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, Domanović {{wrote and}} {{published}} his first work, {{a short story}} Na mesečini (In the Moonlight), in a popular magazine for intellectuals called Javor. Two years later, {{he got his first}} tenure as a lecturer in a gymnasium in Pirot. There he met Jaša Prodanović, who helped found the <b>Serbian</b> independent <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> in 1901. At that time, Domanović joined Republikanska stranka (The Republican Party), and got married to Natalija Ristić. He took an active part to maintain the doctrine of republicanism {{during the time of the}} monarchy. He was threatened repeatedly not to criticize The Establishment. After nine months, he was transferred, as a punishment on request of his political rivals, to a gymnasium in Vranje. On the same count, after a year in Vranje, he was transferred to Leskovac. Following a critical speech on the position of teachers in 1898, he was dismissed from his post, along with his wife. As a response, he wrote a short story Ukidanje strasti (The Tearing of Passion).|$|R
5000|$|During a Parliament {{session in}} 1928, the Croatian Peasant Party's leader Stjepan Radić was mortally wounded by Puniša Račić, a deputy of the <b>Serbian</b> <b>Radical</b> People's <b>Party,</b> which caused further upsets among the Croatian elite. In 1929, King Aleksandar proclaimed a {{dictatorship}} and imposed {{a new constitution}} which, among other things, renamed the country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Political parties were banned from the start and the royal dictatorship took on an increasingly harsh character. Vladko Maček, who had succeeded Radić {{as leader of the}} Croatian Peasant Party, the largest political party in Croatia, was imprisoned, and members of a newly emerging insurgent movement, the Ustaše, went into exile. According to the British historian Misha Glenny the murder in March 1929 of Toni Schlegel, editor of a pro-Yugoslavian newspaper Novosti, brought a [...] "furious response" [...] from the regime. In Lika and west Herzegovina in particular, which he described as [...] "hotbeds of Croatian separatism," [...] he wrote that the majority-Serb police acted [...] "with no restraining authority whatsoever." ...|$|R
