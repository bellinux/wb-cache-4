5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a <b>single</b> <b>turn.</b> When the BP gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, a chosen character can Default, which accumulates BP and reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a <b>single</b> <b>turn</b> with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is in sleep mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a <b>single</b> <b>turn,</b> a team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E
5|$|Mario Party 4 {{features}} eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Princess Daisy and Waluigi {{from the}} Mario series, {{who can be}} directed as characters on six themed game boards in the game. The objective {{of the game is}} to earn as many stars as possible, which are obtained by purchase from a single predefined space on the game board. Each character's movement is determined by a roll of a die, with a roll from each player forming a <b>single</b> <b>turn.</b> Each turn in Mario Party 4 is followed by a minigame in which characters compete for coins they can use to purchase items and stars.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{repetitive}} {{actions and}} long-playing times, 4X games {{have been criticized}} for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a <b>single</b> <b>turn.</b> This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was designed to reduce the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.|$|E

40|$|This paper shows a {{preliminary}} idea {{on the use}} of electrical field as circulation promoter in a <b>single</b> <b>turned</b> PHP. The main idea is using the already demonstrated capability of the electric force in redistributing the phases and changing flow pattern in two-phase flow. A preliminary experimental activity on a <b>Single</b> <b>Turned</b> Pulsating Heat Pipe (STPHP) with pipes of internal diameter 2 mm, using ethanol and water as working fluids, is shown. The STPHP has been operated changing the gravity action (i. e. the distance between evaporator and condenser). This activity has highlighted a low repeatability and a very unstable behaviour of these devices, observed with both fluids. The device evolves towards a steady state regime where the liquid is hold in the upper condenser section even before quasi-steady state regime are observed. The distance between condenser and evaporator does not improve this unstable behaviour. The asymmetrical action of the electrical field on the loop should promote the circulation and a stable behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Current studies {{dealing with}} the {{detection}} of angry users in automated telephone-based speech applications take acoustic and sometimes linguistic information into account in order to classify the emotional state of the caller in <b>single</b> user <b>turns.</b> Angry user turns, however, don’t appear from nowhere {{and the likelihood of}} observing another angry turn rises substantially when anger has already been observed previously in the discourse. In this contribution we examine the context of angry user turns in two different telephone corpora. We then introduce Hidden Markov Models (HMM) as classifiers modeling the temporal aspects of anger across <b>single</b> <b>turns.</b> As additional information source, the HMMs improve our acoustic classifier serving as baseline substantially. Performance gains of 1 - 4 % can be reported by performing late fusion of the acoustic classifier and the HMMs. 1...|$|R

On the voyage to the Texel however, Archimedes broke her crankshaft {{and was forced to}} return to England for further repairs, which on this occasion were effected by the firm of Miller, Ravenhill & Co. It was during this refit that the original full helix, <b>single</b> <b>turn,</b> single threaded propeller was replaced by a double-threaded, half turn propeller with two distinct blades.

25|$|The {{propeller}} {{itself was}} of sheet iron, 5 feet 9inches {{in diameter and}} about 5 feet long, and consisted of a full 360° screw, single threaded and of a <b>single</b> <b>turn</b> in keeping with Smith's revised 1836 patent. Following the ship's entry into service, the propeller would subsequently undergo a number of modifications, {{the most important of}} which were an alteration to a double threaded/half turn format, and a division of the original 360° screw into two separate blades. The propeller had the unusual feature of being fully retractable in order to reduce drag when the ship was under sail—a task that took about 15 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Apparently {{aware of}} the Navy's view that screw {{propellers}} would prove unsuitable for seagoing service, Smith determined to prove this assumption wrong. In September 1837, he took his small vessel (now fitted with an iron propeller of a <b>single</b> <b>turn)</b> to sea, steaming from Blackwall, London to Hythe, Kent, with stops at Ramsgate, Dover and Folkestone. On {{the way back to}} London on the 25th, Smith's craft was observed making headway in stormy seas by officers of the Royal Navy. The Admiralty's interest in the technology was revived, and Smith was encouraged to build a full size ship to more conclusively demonstrate the technology's effectiveness. He was able to attract a number of investors to provide the necessary capital, including the banker Wright and the engineering firm of J. and G. Rennie, who together formed a new company called the Ship Propeller Company. The company's proposed vessel was initially tentatively named Propeller, but the name eventually adopted for the ship was Archimedes, after the 3rd century Greek inventor.|$|E
