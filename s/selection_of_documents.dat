25|$|The manuscripts were {{dispersed}} {{all over}} the world {{in the aftermath of the}} discovery. Stein's acquisition was split between Britain and India because his expedition was funded by both countries. Stein had the first pick and he was able to collect around 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments for which he paid £130, although these include many duplicate copies of the Diamond and Lotus Sutras. Pelliot took almost 10,000 documents for the equivalent of £90, but, unlike Stein, Pelliot was a trained sinologist literate in Chinese, and he was allowed to examine the manuscripts freely, so he was able to pick a better <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> than Stein. Pelliot was interested in the more unusual and exotic of the Dunhuang manuscripts, such as those dealing with the administration and financing of the monastery and associated lay men's groups. Many of these manuscripts survived only because they formed a type of palimpsest whereby papers were reused and Buddhist texts were written on the opposite side of the paper. Hundreds more of the manuscripts were sold by Wang to Otani Kozui and Sergei Oldenburg. Efforts are now underway to reconstitute the Library Cave manuscripts digitally, and they are now available as part of International Dunhuang Project.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{academic}} reviewer {{was no less}} harsh, {{declaring that}} [...] "unfortunately, the best {{that can be said}} about the volume's scholarly apparatus is that it is all but swallowed up in the 600-odd pages of authentic, or nearly authentic, Marx texts." [...] Padover was lauded for judicious <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and [...] "capable" [...] translation, with the inclusion of selected correspondence singled out as particularly illuminating. His own editorial contribution was deemed to be problematic, however, with Padover's bibliographic notes said to [...] "contain more errors of commission and omission" [...] than could be conveniently cited in short academic review. Padover's failure to print Marx's writings in concert with those of his friend and co-thinker Frederick Engels was also cause for criticism.|$|E

It “focuses on his creative process, his recurring themes, and the diverseness of his aesthetic,” providing, as curators Patrick Allegaert, Yoon Hee Lamot, and Dr. Valérie Rousseau noted, a chronological overview of his oeuvre and a comprehensive understanding of van Genk’s mindset. To complement the presentation of his major artworks, Mind Traffic “includes a <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and objects from van Genk’s living environment: an accumulation of favorite books from his library, handmade maps, personal notes, and his collection of raincoats.” In their published statement, the curators proposed an original perspective: “The artworks {{can be seen as}} memory palaces,” as they “depict intricately layered and densely networked urban panoramas and reference interconnectivity.” ...|$|E

Two diagnostic measures may inform <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> attributes for cluster discrimination: term discrimination value and the sum of pairwise term-vector correlations.
