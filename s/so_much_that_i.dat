[...] On 30 June, Del Piero wrote an open letter to the Juventus fans thanking them for almost two decades of support, stating, [...] "Above all what remains is the fans, you who are Juventus.

500|$|Beach Thomas's war work led {{to state}} recognition, {{as it did}} for many of the correspondents and {{newspaper}} owners; France appointed him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency." [...] This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.|$|E
500|$|The North American {{album cover}} artwork {{originates}} {{from a medical}} journal Cox discovered in a thrift store. A painting in the journal depicts a doctor treating an ill boy, [...] "while his mom looks on, concerned", as described by Cox. In photographing the painting, {{the face of the}} boy was obscured by the flash of the camera. While it [...] "kind of took away from the photo" [...] according to him, the picture became [...] "somehow…romantic, the idea that there was so much emotion in the face that it got whited out." [...] Cox described the boy as being [...] "the saddest boy…lovesick and emaciated", adding, [...] "I related to that boy <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> literally, in the thrift store, almost started crying." [...] The European album artwork was created by v23, a group that designs cover art for label 4AD.|$|E

At {{the suggestion of}} Ono's live-in companion at the time, [...] interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. [...] "I realized that for something to move me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way - solidity, commodity, all of that.

500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One sat in my hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E
500|$|The {{last three}} decades of Moore's life {{continued}} in a similar vein; several major retrospectives took place around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition {{in the summer of}} 1972 in the grounds of the Forte di Belvedere overlooking Florence. Following the pioneering documentary 'Henry Moore', produced by John Read in 1951, he appeared in many films. In 1964, for instance, Moore was featured in the documentary [...] "5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk)" [...] by American filmmaker Warren Forma. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed Knife Edge Two Piece in 1962 for College Green near the Houses of Parliament in London. According to Moore, [...] "When I was offered the site near the House of Lords... I liked the place <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't bother to go and see an alternative site in Hyde Park—one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park. The House of Lords site is quite different. It is next to a path where people walk and it has a few seats where they can sit and contemplate it." ...|$|E

500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E

2500|$|Late in his life, Seedman finally {{revealed}} why he {{had given}} the order. In a new preface to the 2011 E-book release of his 1974 memoir Chief!, he explained what he had kept to himself for four decades. With the tensions outside escalating, he had called Chief Inspector Michael Codd from the mosque and asked for two busloads of police cadets armed with nightsticks to keep order on the street outside. Codd refused and hung up. When Seedman called back {{he was told that}} Codd was out to lunch. That failure to support officers in the field had been the real reason for his retirement.

They are real life superheroes and I am representing their emotions on screen". Adding that he never had felt such responsibility towards any other character he had played to date, he told the media that the film did not take any stance on mercy-killing. Roshan said that he was able to identify with Ethan Mascarenhas because, when he was going through the Guzaarish script, he had been nursing a knee problem and doctors told him that the knee will never be okay. According to Roshan, the script [...] "..energised me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not depressed about my knee problem anymore".|$|E
2500|$|Tatum was not {{inclined}} toward understatement or expansive use of space. [...] He seldom {{played in a}} simplified way, preferring interpretations that displayed his great technique and clever harmonizations. [...] When jazz pianist Stanley Cowell {{was growing up in}} Toledo, his father prevailed upon Tatum to play piano at the Cowell home. [...] Stanley described the scene as, [...] "Tatum played so brilliantly and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> ... <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought the piano was gonna break. [...] My mother left the room ... so I said 'What's wrong, Mama?' [...] And she said 'Oh, that man plays too much piano. [...] A handful of critics, notably Keith Jarrett, have complained that Tatum played too many notes or was too ornamental or was even 'unjazzlike'. [...] Jazz critic Gary Giddins opined, [...] "That is the essence of Tatum. If you don't like his ornament, you should be listening to someone else. That's where his genius is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jobs did not contact {{his birth}} family during Clara's (his adoptive mother) lifetime, however. He would later tell his {{official}} biographer Walter Isaacson: [...] "I never wanted [...] {{to feel like}} I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out." [...] However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to {{spend a great deal}} of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that [...] "his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{creating}} {{lyrics and}} melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn {{from various sources}} for inspiration. [...] His first musical memory was hearing Neil Young's [...] "Heart of Gold" [...] at age eleven: [...] "It moved me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> insisted my mother buy me the 45." [...] In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's [...] "The Message" [...] and the [...] "in-your-face sexual lyrics" [...] of Prince's [...] "Dirty Mind". Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics. Starting with 1989's Mother's Milk album, John Frusciante and Flea have written {{nearly all of the}} music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates. Kiedis said in 2006, [...] "Somehow I find songs... in the bigness of what they're doing." [...] His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of Charles Bukowski, Kiedis' main literary influence.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{reportedly}} [...] "dismissed by most {{critics as}} 'strange' and 'unintelligible'" [...] {{at the time}} of its release, the film received positive reviews from 71% of 34 surveyed critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Bill Cosford of The Miami Herald praised it as [...] "an unusual film": [...] "Its comedy springs from that odd combination of self-effacement and self-absorption that characterized some of the Saturday Night Live characters and continues to provide Bill Murray with work. And though Buckaroo Banzai is basically a comic strip, it's also relentlessly hip, hipper even than it is goofy." [...] Cosford added, [...] "There are inside jokes and 'quotations' from movies, television and pop music, and there's lots of weird activity on the edges of the film, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suspect Banzai might even be rewarding the second time around. First or second, the film defies easy explanation. But it's anarchic comedy for the 1980s, closest in spirit to the Marx Brothers as they might have been if they grown up on themselves, and had had the benefit of post-Star Wars special effects. It's also adventure in the Buck Rogers mold, the aliens employing a wide array of weaponry, including Arachnids From Space, the good guys fighting back from a mobile command post aboard the Cavaliers' doubledecker tour bus. The pace of both jokes and action is that of Airplane!, and to say much more is only to spoil the fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeing further {{potential}} in the idea, Horn teamed Jeczalik and Langan with Dudley in February to develop the project and brought {{in one of his}} business partners, ex-NME journalist Paul Morley, as a provider of concepts, art direction and marketing ideas. Morley came up with the project name (taken from the essay [...] "The Art of Noises" [...] by noted futurist Luigi Russolo, and finalised at Jeczalik's request by dropping the final 's'). Much later, in a July 2002 article penned for The Guardian, Morley wrote [...] "I loved the name Art of Noise <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> forced my way into the group. If over the years people asked me what I did in the group, I replied that I named them, and it was such a great name, that was enough to justify my role. I was the Ringo Starr of Art of Noise. I made the tea. Oh, and I wrote the lyrics to one of the loveliest pieces of pop music ever, Moments in Love." [...] Horn himself joined the new group as production advisor and provider of further ideas. This {{was the first time that}} he had been part of a group since parting company with his The Buggles' partner Geoff Downes (after they had been part of Yes).
