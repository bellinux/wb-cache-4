40|$|The Anda Sag, the {{northern}} part of the Xujiaweizi Fault Depression in the Songliao Basin, contains high-quality source rocks and tight, lithologic gas deposit-dominated volcanic reservoirs of the Lower Cretaceous Yingcheng Formation. This area is known to have a variety of volcanic edifices that are characterized by multi-phase eruption and superimposed distribution. Currently, the sag has been highly explored, and drilling of targets in the critical crater areas with reservoirs relatively developed has basically finished. So, additional targets will be defined. Thus, a criterion for dividing the volcanic eruption phases was established based on core, well log and seismic response marks. Through a well-seismic <b>skeleton</b> <b>section</b> analysis, it was believed that three volcanic eruption phases (I, II and III) occurred in the Anda Sag. Finally, the volcanic edifice and facies belt distribution of each phase were predicted by using seismic coherence body and trend-surface analysis technologies, with over 30 new volcanic crater targets identified. The predicted results show that the distribution of lithofacies and lithologies determines the framework of better volcanic reservoirs in the west and south than that in the east and north respectively. Lithological-structural gas reservoirs are dominant in the west, while tight lithologic gas reservoirs are dominant in the east. Based on the study results, the favorable exploration area is finalized as 950  km 2, a potential of 100 billion m 3 gas resources has been implemented...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a survey of}} performance models for parallel algorithmic skeletons. First, higher-order functions (HOFs) are presented according to the modelled skeletons. Next, the corresponding parallel implementations (skeletons) for the HOFs are discussed with the performance models that were constructed for the skeletons. 1 Introduction Effective portability depends crucially on the predictability of performance. Therefore, accurate performance models are required to predict the behaviour of a given skeleton before successfully porting the application that is currently using this skeleton. For the importance of performance models for algorithmic skeletons, this report aims to survey some of them. 2 Higher Order Functions for the Modeled <b>Skeletons</b> This <b>section</b> presents briefly the HOFs {{used to describe the}} <b>skeletons</b> in <b>Section</b> 3.

40|$|Acoustic Doppler current {{profilers}} (ADCPs) {{were used}} to measure water velocities in the tailrace at John Day Dam over a two-week period in February 2005. Data were collected by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Hydraulic Design Section, Portland District, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The objective of this project was therefore to collect field measurements of water velocities in the near-field draft tube exit zone {{as well as the}} far-field tailrace to be used for improving these models. Field data were collected during the project using five separate ADCPs. Mobile ADCP data were collected using two ADCPs mounted on two separate boats. Data were collected by either holding the boat on-station at pre-defined locations for approximately 10 minutes or in moving transect mode when the boat would move over large distances during the data collection. Results from the mobile ADCP survey indicated a complex hydrodynamic flow field in the tailrace downstream of John Day Dam. A large gyre was noted between the <b>skeleton</b> <b>section</b> of the powerhouse and non-spilling portion of the spillway. Downstream of the spillway, the spillway flow is constrained against the navigation lock guide wall, and large velocities were noted in this region. Downstream of the guide wall, velocities decreased as the spillway jet dispersed. Near the tailrace island, the flow split was measured to be approximately equal on Day 2 (25. 4 kcfs spillway/ 123 kcfs total). However, approximately 60 % of the flow passed along the south shore of the island on Day 1 (15. 0 kcfs spillway/ 150 kcfs total). At a distance of 9000 ft downstream of the dam, flows had equalized laterally and were generally uniform over the cross section. The collection of water velocities near the draft tube exit of an operating turbine unit is not routine, and equipment capable of measuring 3 D water velocities in these zones are at the forefront of hydraulic measurement technology. Although the feasibility of measuring 1 D water velocity magnitudes has been previously demonstrated by the authors, the feasibility of resolving 3 D water velocity vectors given the heterogeneity of the flow field was unknown before this study’s data were collected. Both the 1 D and 3 D data were collected by deploying three ADCPs on dual-axis rotators directly above the draft tube exit of Turbine Unit 16. These instruments collected 1 D data during both the mobile reconnaissance campaign and a later one-week period with zero spillway discharge. During the zero spillway discharge period, Turbine Unit 16 was operated over a range of discharges. Approximately 12 hours of 1 D velocity data were collected at low (12 kcfs), middle (16. 2 kcfs), and high (19. 2 kcfs) turbine discharges. The 1 D dataset indicates large differences in flow patterns and RMS velocity fluctuations among the various discharge levels. Results from this project show that it is technically feasible to measure 3 D water velocities directly downstream of an operating turbine unit using a narrow beam swath (i. e., 6 -degree) ADCP. Data products from these 3 D velocity data include a measurement of the draft tube barrel flow distribution (a. k. a., the flow split), directional changes and the general decay of velocity as flow exits the draft tube and enters the tailrace, and a relative measure of the homogeneity of the flow field...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{culmination of}} research projects that combine {{the utility of}} computational methods with the practicality of experiments in order to investigate a variety of chemical phenomena. The theoretical molecular models and quantum chemical calculations reported herein provide explanations of selectivity, elucidations of mechanisms, and predictions of reactivity that will continually advance the scientific community in future endeavors, especially {{in the field of}} organic chemistry and complex polycycle synthesis. Section I describes investigations centering upon the 4 + 2 cycloaddition between benzene and allene, a reaction developed by Gerhard Himbert in the 1980 s. In collaboration with Chris Vanderwal at UC Irvine, we study the mechanisms of intramolecular Diels–Alder cycloadditions of various N-phenyl-allenamides to uncover the competing concerted and stepwise diradical pathways that bring about intriguing experimental observations. Additionally, the reaction optimization of carbon analogues is aided and explained through computations, providing access to novel cycloadducts. With growing interest in the mechanistic intricacy of the 4 + 2 reaction, a theoretical study of the Diels–Alder reaction of allene with butadiene and with benzene elucidates the complexity of each cycloaddition, revealing an ambimodal transition state along the butadiene/allene pathway and the importance of preserving aromaticity in the reaction with benzene. To gain insight into the importance of intramolecularity in the original Himbert systems, we conducted a systematic investigation of various tether moieties and their effects on the thermodynamics of the reaction. Finally, in our quest to efficiently synthesize a library of complex polycyclic scaffolds, we looked into subsequent transformations of the bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octadiene cycloadducts, namely ring-rearrangement metathesis to form fused tricycles and an interesting dyotropic shift that occurs in a stepwise manner, resulting in isomerized bicyclo[3. 2. 1]octadiene <b>skeletons.</b> <b>Section</b> II compiles research pertaining to other pericyclic reactions as well as collaborative projects with different research groups. Intramolecular Diels–Alder reactions with tryptamine-derived Zincke aldehydes and diene-tethered cycloalkenones, in conjunction with Chris Vanderwal and Samuel Danishefsky, respectively, are studied computationally to explain stereoselectivities and influences from external reagents. Collaborative efforts with the Barrio and Petric groups provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} noncovalent binding modes of a class of positron emission tomography probes used for diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, the utilization of computations to further synthetic efforts is exemplified in the molecular modeling of Vanderwal’s tetracyclic exiguaquinol core and Jung’s palladium-catalyzed alkene isomerizations. The thermodynamic properties of Rebek’s host–guest systems were examined, using molecular mechanics and implicit solvent to understand the binding of adamantyl guests in resorcinarene-based cavitands.

This review focuses on lower appendicular musculoskeletal structure of human body to represent joints and links architectures; to identify muscle attachments and functions; and to illustrate muscle groups which are responsible for a particular joint movement. Firstly, human lower skeletal structure, linking systems, joint mechanisms, and their functions are described with a conceptual representation of joint architecture of human <b>skeleton.</b> This <b>section</b> also represents joints and limbs by comparing with mechanical systems. Characteristics of ligaments and their functions to construct skeletal joints are also discussed briefly in this part. Secondly, the study focuses on muscular system of human lower limbs where muscle structure, functions, roles in moving endoskeleton structure, and supporting mechanisms are presented ellaborately. Thirdly, muscle groups are tabulated based on functions that provide mobility to different joints of lower limbs. Finally, for a particular movement action of lower extremity, muscles are also grouped and tabulated to have a better understanding on functions of individual muscle. Basically the study presents an overview of the structure of human lower limbs by characterizing and classifying skeletal and muscular systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT:The main {{principle}} of design of truss by using Ferro-cement is economy and safety. In this investigation a ferrocement roof truss {{has been designed}} which are of low in cost, light in weight and easy to maintain. The first step of design involves the calculation of dead load using IS 875 (part- 1) and wind load using IS 875 (part- 3) - 1987. The next step involves the calculation of tension and compression in each individual member of the truss. Sections of the truss are designed using the value of highest tension or compression. After designing all the sections, the truss is constructed. A 6 -mm diameter circular coil is used as reinforcing material for construction and angles of desired shape are made to hold the sections in position. Hexagonal wire mesh or chicken mess is cut into required sizes and are placed over the reinforced <b>skeleton</b> of the <b>section.</b> Conventional mortar of cement sand ratio of 1 : 2 is prepared.

40|$|In this paper, {{the seismic}} {{performance}} of an irregular high-rise building with two large openings (20 m by 20 m) in elevation was studied. There were two transfer {{stories in the}} building, which were set for structural requirement as well as architectural function. The analytical model of the building was first established in the finite element program of Strand 7 ○R. Plate element and beam element were employed for the structural walls, columns and beams, respectively. Some points on member skeleton curves of structural members were obtained using the software named Section Builder○R, and Takeda constitutive rule included in the Strand 7 was applied for the constitutive rule of the members. Then, nonlinear time-history analysis of the structure under multi-earthquake inputs was carried out. The dynamic properties and displacement responses were compared {{to the results of}} the dynamic model test. Compared to the test, it was concluded that the nonlinear dynamic responses can be accurately reflected by the analytical model developed in this paper.

Seismic performance of the irregular high-rise building was evaluated on both the analytical responses and experimental results.

Fossil remains of over 75 individuals have been recovered, including nearly 20 complete skeletons with skulls. Individuals of all ages are known, from hatchlings less than 13 centimetres (5 in) long, to very old adults reaching nearly 2 metres (6.5 ft) in length.When describing Psittacosaurus mongoliensis in 1923, Osborn also gave the name Protiguanodon mongoliense to another skeleton found nearby, believing it to represent an ancestor of the ornithopod Iguanodon, in the new subfamily Protiguanodontinae. Protiguanodon mongoliense, AMNH 6523, measured 1.35 m long, and was known from much of the skeleton, although at the time of description the neck vertebrae were still covered by matrix. Osborn diagnosed his taxa on the basis of features of the teeth and snout. However, modern taxonomists find these features insignificant, instead placing Protiguanodon mongoliense within Psittacosaurus mongoliensis. When the skeleton was prepared further, it became clear that it was nearly identical to Psittacosaurus mongoliensis. In 1958, Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian (better known as C. C. Young) renamed the skeleton Psittacosaurus protiguanodonensis. Today the specimen is generally referred to as the species Psittacosaurus mongoliensis and the names Protiguanodon mongoliense and Psittacosaurus protiguanodonensis are considered junior synonyms of the name Psittacosaurus mongoliensis, which was coined first.|$|R
40|$|Limb {{elements}} in birds have been characterized as exhibiting {{a reduction in}} trabecular bone, thinner cortices and decreased bending strength when pneumatized, yet it is unclear if these characteristics generalize to the axial <b>skeleton.</b> Thin <b>section</b> techniques, the traditional gold standard for bone structure studies, have most commonly been applied {{to the study of}} avian bone. This destructive technique, however, makes it subsequently impossible to use the same samples in experimental testing systems that allow researchers to correlate structure with the mechanical properties of the bone. Micro-computed tomography (µCT), a non-destructive X-ray imaging technique, can be used to assess the effect of pneumatization on vertebral cortical and trabecular bone through virtual extraction and structural quantification of each tissue type. We conducted a preliminary investigation of the application of µCT methods to the study of cortical and trabecular bone structure in a small sample of pneumatic and apneumatic thoracic vertebrae. The sample consisted of two similar-sized anatids, Aix sponsa (n = 7) and Oxyura jamaicensis (n = 5). Volumes of interest were created that contoured (outlined) the boundaries of the ventral cortical bone shell, the trabecular compartment and the whole centrum (cortical bone + trabecular bone), and allowed independent structural analysis of each volume of interest. Results indicated that bone volume fraction of the whole centrum was significantly higher in the apneumatic O. jamaicensis than in the pneumatized A. sponsa (A. sponsa = 36 %, O. jamaicensis = 48 %, P < 0. 05). In contrast, trabecular bone volume fraction was similar between the two species. The ventral cortical bone shell was approximately 23 % thinner (P < 0. 05) in A. sponsa (0. 133 mm) compared with apneumatic O. jamaicensis (0. 172 mm). This case study demonstrates that µCT is a powerful non-destructive imaging technique that may be applied to the three-dimensional study of avian bone. The preliminary results suggest that pneumatic and apneumatic vertebrae of comparably sized avian species differ in relative bone volume, with the largest difference apparent {{at the level of the}} cortex, and not within trabecular bone. The presence of relatively thin cortices in pneumatic vertebrae is consistent with previous studies contrasting diaphyseal cortical bone between pneumatic and apneumatic long bones. Methodological issues related to this and any comparative µCT study of bone structure are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Coral reefs, {{skeleton}} {{samples and}} bottom sediments {{in the vicinity}} of the hydrocarbon exploration test well in the Træna Deep have been studied to assess the ecological effects and "health status" of Lophelia coral reefs. The fieldwork was carried out in June 2005, providing skeleton and sediment samples from 33 locations, video-recordings from eight dives with Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), and data on water movement from three current meters located at different sites. Current velocity and direction were recorded over a period of six days. The velocity varied between 0 and 27 cm/s, with the weakest currents in the area close to the exploration drilling site, and the strongest currents at the reference site about 12 km southeast of the drilling site. The current pattern showed tidal influence with a strong westward component. This current pattern was also reflected in the eastward growth of the coral reefs and by the orientation of fan-shaped gorgonian corals facing in the same direction. The analysis of video-records did not reveal clear difference in "health" status between reefs up-current or down-current to the drill site. The reefs consisted typically of a living "frontal" zone facing the currents, and a dead "tail" extending down-current for up to ca. 150 m. analysis of <b>skeleton</b> thin <b>sections</b> revealed that it is possible to establish the chronology and thrack the years in skeletons when the explorations drilling occured. The relatively coarse-gained sediments in the area made it possible to obtain seminent cores of limited length (5 - 30 cm), but several cores contain elevated Ba/barite concrentration at the sediment surface or just below. The geographic distribution of Ba content in sediments allowed the reconstruction of drilling mud disperal pattern westward from the drilling site, cinsistent with the prevailing current directions. Barite crystals, derived from the drilling mud, were identified among trapped sediments in the skeleton cavities of dead coral polyps older than six years. Highest barite concentrations was found in a polyp older than 13 years. The presence of relatively coarse-gained sediments abd drilling mud components in the coral polyps ca. 600 m down current from the drilling site signals the elevated turbulance and sediment supply during the drilling acitivty. This elevated sediment dispersion was likely having an influence upon the coral reefs, but due to the relatively shor duration of the drilling campaign and strong currents that effectively dilute episodic sediment discharges the damage was apparently not significant. Thus the results provide only minor indications of negative effects of drilling mud discharge on the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa, but demonstrate that the method developed here can be used to trace exposure to elevated particle load originating from drilling activity...|$|R
5000|$|In Section III, full of {{euphoria}} he sets foot {{again on}} German soil, with only ‘shirts, trousers and pocket handkerchiefs’ in his luggage, {{but in his}} head ‘a twittering birds’-nest/ of books liable to be confiscated’. In Aachen Heine first comes in contact again with the Prussian military:Still always that wooden pedantic race, Still always a right angleIn every movement and every faceThe frozen conceit.In Section IV on the winter-journey to Cologne he mocks the anachronistic German society, that more readily with archaic skills builds the Cologne Cathedral, unfinished since the Middle Ages, than addressing itself to the Present Age. That the anachronistic building works came to be discontinued {{in the course of}} the Reformation indicated for the poet a positive advance: the overcoming of traditional ways of thought and the end of spiritual juvenility or adolescence. In Section V he comes to the Rhine, as ‘the German Rhine’ and ‘Father Rhine’, icon and memorial of German identity. The River-god however shows himself as a sorrowful old man, disgusted with the babble about Germanic identity. He does not long to go back among the French who, according to Heine, now drink beer and read ‘Fischte’ and Kant. Section VI introduces the ‘Liktor’, the poets demon and ghostly doppelganger, always present, who follows him about carrying a hatchet under his cloak, waiting for a sign to execute the judicial sentence against the Poet. He confronts the shadowy figure, and is told, ‘I am the Deed to your Thought.’ In Section VII the Execution begins in dream. Followed by his ‘silent attendant’ the poet wanders through Cologne. He marks the doorposts with his heart’s blood, and this gives the Liktor the signal for a death-sentence. At last he reaches the Cathedral with the Three Kings Shrine, and “smashes up the poor <b>skeletons</b> of Superstition.’In <b>Section</b> VIII he travels further on to Hagen and Mülheim, places which bring to mind his former enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte. His transformation of Europe had called awake in Heine the hope for universal freedom. However: the Emperor is dead. Heine had been an eye-witness in Paris of his burial in 1840 at Les Invalides. Section IX brings culinary reminiscences of ‘homely Sauerkraut’ seasoned with satirical pointedness: Section X, Greetings to Westphalia.In Section XI he travels through the Teutoburg Forest and fantasizes about it, what might have happened, if Hermann of the Cherusci had not vanquished the Romans: Roman culture would have permeated the spiritual life of Germany, and in place of the ‘Three Dozen Fathers of the Provinces’ should have been now at least one proper Nero. The Section is - in disguise - also an attack on the Culture-politics of the ‘Romantic on the Throne,’ Friedrich Wilhelm IV.; then pretty well all the significant individuals in this outfit (for example Raumer, Hengstenberg, Birch-Pfeiffer, Schelling, Maßmann, Cornelius) lived in Berlin. Section XII contains the poets address on the theme: ‘Howling with the wolves,’ as the carriage breaks down in the forest at night, and he responds as the denizens of the forest serenade him. This Heine offers as a metaphoric statement of the critical distance occupied by himself as polemic or satirical poet, and of the sheepskin-costume appropriate for much of what was surrounding him.I am no sheep, I am no dog, No Councillor, and no shellfish - I have remained a wolf, my heart And all my fangs are wolfish. Section XIII takes the traveller to Paderborn. In the morning mist a crucifix appears. The ‘poor jewish cousin’ had even less good fortune than Heine, since the kindly Censor had at least held back from having him crucified - until now, at any rate…In Section XIV and Section XV the poet betakes himself in a dream to another memorable place: he visits Friedrich Barbarossa in Kyffhäuser. Not surprisingly the mythic German Emperor presents himself as a man become imbecile through senility, who is above all proud of the fact that his banner has not yet been eaten by moths. Germany in internal need? Pressing need of business for an available Emperor? Wake up, old man, and take your beard off the table!
