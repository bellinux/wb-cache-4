This study explores the major collection security issues related to library collections in Malaysian university libraries. The study reveals the measures adopted by the Malaysian libraries to ensure effective collections security governance. The findings indicate that main breaches of collection security are book theft, damage, mutilation, or defacement; books attacked by insects or worms; and non-return of borrowed materials. The measures used to reduce and address security breaches include electronic <b>security</b> system; <b>manual</b> <b>security</b> approaches such as checking identity cards before access to the collections...|$|R

40|$|In today’s hi-tech world, {{conventional}} {{physical security}} methods are simply insufficient {{for the protection}} of an organisation’s information assets. This is because of the ever-increasing dependency on the use of electronic data in everyday business process activities. Since it is an information security policy that forms the basis for a security program, the importance of developing an effective policy is quite significant. Another phenomenon that has brought about a need for proper Information security policies is the fact that Information Technology is constantly evolving. As a result, new and changing security threats have to be constantly counter-acted. The intended objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a concise and generic methodology for the development, implementation and maintenance of a strategic information security policy. It must be noted that this project deals solely with policy development and it is therefore not indented to replace official and/or commercial <b>security</b> <b>manuals.</b> Policy development is quite a complicated task and developers will have to consult a number of information sources to successfully achieve their goal. This methodology should be used as the “primary information source ” and will provide more than adequate general guidance on the development process of an effective information security polic...|$|R
