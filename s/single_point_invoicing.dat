40|$|It {{is known}} that {{homogeneous}} continua cannot be separated by a <b>single</b> <b>point.</b> However, {{there is no guarantee}} in general that the subcontinua in such spaces have the same property. This paper establishes the fact that, in all but the most simple case, the nontrivial subcontinua with minimal finite boundary in a homogeneous continuum share the property of the entire space that they cannot be separated by a <b>single</b> <b>point.</b> More specifically, if X is a homogeneous continuum, then no <b>single</b> <b>point</b> separates X. If the nontrivial subcontinua of X with minimal boundary contain precisely two boundary points, then these subcontinua can be separated by a <b>single</b> <b>point.</b> However, if these subcontinua have finite boundary containing more than two points, then like X itself, they cannot be separated by a <b>single</b> <b>point...</b>|$|R

40|$|RNAMute is an {{interactive}} web tool written in Java that calculates the secondary structure of all <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutations, given an RNA sequence, and organizes them into categories {{according to their}} distances from the wildtype predicted structure. The secondary structure predictions are performed using the Vienna RNA package. Several alternatives are used for the categorization of <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutations: Vienna’s RNADistance based on dot-bracket representation, tree edit distance, and second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix based on Shapiro’s coarse grain treegraph representation. Selecting a category in {{each one of the}} tables lists all <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutations belonging to that category. Selecting a mutation displays a graphical picture of the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutation and the wildtype, and includes basic information such as associated energies, representations, distances.

40|$|Background: Integrated working between {{health and}} social care {{services}} within England has been encouraged by Government policy in the last decade, and has been argued to provide a seamless, joined up experience for service users (Department of Health 2011). One way of integrating care is {{through the use of}} a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access to {{health and social}} care services. A <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access to services has been trialled in mental health and learning disability services to improve access, and following on from policy (e. g. Department of Health 2007) and support from literature (Rogers, Entwistle & Pencheon 1998; Lovell & Richards 2000; Raine, Carter, Sensky & Black 2005) a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access to health and social care for older adults has been implemented in parts of the UK. This thesis examines the implementation of one such <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access. Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access and whether it had any impact upon integrated working within a county in England, UK. Methods: An ethnographic approach was taken, using a combination of methods including interviews, focus groups and observations. This was complemented by a grounded theory approach to analysis. Findings: The <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access had an adverse effect upon integration. The poor management of change and lack of communication led to issues within the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access such as failure of IT systems and duplication. Staff became frustrated and disengaged from the process, and consequently reported feeling disempowered, retreating back to their professional 'tribes'. Conclusion: Firm conclusions about the efficacy of a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access with regard to its effect upon integrated working could not be reached. However, the findings suggest that clear communication, continued change management and recognition of professional culture are decisive factors when attempting to integrate health and social care. Further research into the impact of a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access upon integration as well as outcomes for service users is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Background: RNAMute is an {{interactive}} Java application that calculates the secondary structure of all <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutations, given an RNA sequence, and organizes them into categories {{according to their}} similarity {{with respect to the}} wild type predicted structure. The secondary structure predictions are performed using the Vienna RNA package. Several alternatives are used for the categorization of <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutations: Vienna's RNAdistance based on dot-bracket representation, as well as tree edit distance and second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix based on Shapiro's coarse grain tree graph representation. Results: Selecting a category in each one of the processed tables lists all <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutations belonging to that category. Selecting a mutation displays a graphical drawing of the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutation and the wild type, and includes basic information such as associated energies, representations and distances. RNAMute can be used successfully with very little previous experience and without choosing any parameter value alongside the initial RNA sequence. The package runs under LINUX operating system. Conclusion: RNAMute is a user friendly tool {{that can be used to}} predict <b>single</b> <b>point</b> mutation...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{customer care}} (ICC) system aims {{to provide a}} <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of contact to the customer for all issues surrounding a service or a product (an offer). For example, the customer care system could provide a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of contact for all phases of a service starting from ordering and provisioning to billing and maintenance. The <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of contact should be maintained even when the offer is put together using services and products provided by multiple providers.
