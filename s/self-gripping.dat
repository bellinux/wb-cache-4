40|$|Background: Mesh {{hernia repair}} {{is one of}} the most fre-quently {{performed}} procedures in general surgery. Re-cently, use of the <b>self-gripping</b> mesh demonstrated a ben-eficial effect on postoperative pain in inguinal hernia repairs. However, in intra-abdominal placement, the use of this novel mesh requires greater laparoscopic skill and dexterity because of the mesh’s tendency to fold and adhere to itself and to any surrounding tissues. We hy-pothesized that gel-like coverage of a <b>self-gripping</b> mesh with a water-soluble film would allow delaying the imme-diate surface adhesion of the mesh to the tissue, which may allow greater freedom and ease in mesh placement for laparoscopic surgeons. Methods: In this ex vivo animal study, gel-coated <b>self-gripping</b> mesh (ProGrip) was compared with a control uncoated mesh in bovine and porcine tissue specimens and assessed for dislodgement shear forces before and after dissolving of the gel. Results: Gel coating of the mesh reduced preperitoneal dislodgement forces in a porcine abdominal wall speci-men by 81 % (8. 05 0. 66 vs 1. 53 0. 82 N, P. 01). Dissolving the gel markedly increased the anchoring forces (10. 62 3. 70 vs 1. 53 0. 82 N, P. 0001), and after dissolving the gel, the mesh shear dislodgement forces were similar and noninferior to the control mesh (8. 05 0. 66 vs 10. 62 3. 70 N, P NS). Conclusions: We believe that water-soluble gel coating does not impair the adhesive features of the <b>self-gripping</b> mesh and may simplify its use in open and laparoscopic procedures by allowing controlled activation of the <b>self-gripping</b> mechanism...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeSecure mesh {{fixation}} in incisional {{hernia repair}} is mandatory to prevent mesh dislocation and possible recurrence. Traditional fixation {{methods have been}} implicated {{as a source of}} chronic postoperative pain. We report 2 -year outcomes with a <b>self-gripping</b> mesh for open tension-free repair of large incisional hernia. MethodsThis prospective case series enrolled 20 patients with large primary incisional hernia (mean defect size: 84  cm 2). Patients were electively treated by a single surgeon using a macroporous polyester mesh with resorbable polylactic acid microgrips (ProGrip™, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) using open onlay technique. Main outcomes included pain severity, Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS), complications, and hernia recurrence. Patients returned for follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. ResultsMedian mesh fixation time was 2  min. Mean operative time was 38  min and blood loss was minimal (50  cc). Most patients (75 %) were discharged same day. The only perioperative complication was a minor seroma in one patient. Patient follow-up compliance through 2 years was 100 %. Mean pain score was 1. 8  at discharge, 0. 9  at 1 month, 0. 7  at 1 year, and 0  at 2 years. At 2 -years, all patients were “very satisfied” with treatment and hernia-specific quality of life was excellent (mean CCS score =  0). No infection, mesh removal, or hernia recurrence occurred during follow-up. ConclusionsOpen repair using a <b>self-gripping</b> mesh is a viable treatment option in patients with large incisional hernia.

The {{objective of this}} randomized trial is to compare the outcomes following <b>self-gripping</b> mesh repair to polypropylene mesh secured with sutures in open inguinal hernioplasty. Method: Eligible patients aged 18 â 80 Â years old, who had primary unilateral uncomplicated inguinal hernia, were randomized into either Polypropylene (PL) group or PROGRIP (PG) group just before the placement of mesh intra-operatively by computer generated code. The primary outcome was the time from mesh placement to end of operation, whereas secondary outcomes included the total operative time, amount of analgesic used, length of post-operative stay, seroma formation, chronic discomfort, chronic pain score and recurrence. The study has been registered in [URL] carrying an ID of NCT 00960011. Patients were followed-up in outpatient clinic for up to 6 Â years after operation. Results: From March 2009 to April 2016, 45 patients were included. The mean age of PG group (nÂ =Â  22) was 62. 0 Â Â±Â  15. 7 Â years old while that of the PL group was 62. 6 Â Â±Â  4. 9 Â years old (nÂ =Â  23). There {{was no significant difference}} regarding the smoking habit, drinking habit, comorbidities, previous hernia operation and Nyhus type of hernia between the two groups. The size of defects, the time of groin dissection and the size of incision were similar. In the PG group, there was significant reduction in the time for mesh placement (11. 8 Â Â±Â  3. 1 vs. 21. 0 Â Â±Â  6. 2 Â min, pÂ  < Â  0. 001) and total operative time (39. 2 Â Â±Â  9. 8 vs. 47. 7 Â Â±Â  8. 0 Â min, pÂ =Â  0. 003). There was one recurrence in PL group and nil in PG group. Although {{there was a significant difference}} in paresthesia between 2 groups after operation, the difference disappears with time and comparable from post-operative 1 Â year onwards. There was no difference in chronic pain, chronic discomfort, affect daily activities, palpable mesh demonstrated throughout the whole study period till 6 Â years after operation.

The aim of this case series study was to analyze 1 -year outcomes in patients with IH treated with Progrip <b>self-gripping</b> mesh compared to polypropylene (PPL) mesh fixed with sutures during the Rives-Stoppa technique. Methods: Between June 2014 and June 2015, we performed a prospective comparative non-randomized (case series) analysis between 25 patients with IH using retromuscular Progrip <b>self-gripping</b> mesh and 25 patients with retromuscular PPL mesh fixed with sutures, under Rives-Stoppa repair. All intraoperative and perioperative morbidities were reported with particular attention to wound infection, seroma or hematoma formation, duration of hospital stay, presence of abdominal wall pain (VAS) and recurrence during long-term follow-up. Results: Mean operative time in Progrip group was shorter than Non-Progrip group (101  ±  29. 5 versus 121  ±  39. 8  min). In Progrip group, the only postoperative complication was seroma in two patients; however, in Non-Progrip group, we reported seroma in three patients, and hematoma in 4 patients (p =  0. 03). The median hospital stay was shorter in Progrip group (5. 8  ±  2. 2  days versus 6. 6  ±  2. 9  days). Mean VAS score in the first 48  h was higher in Non-Progrip group than Progrip group (4. 9  ±  2. 1 versus 8. 1  ±  2) (p =  0. 01).

40|$|Groin {{hernia repair}} {{by using the}} laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair {{approach}} presents lower post-operative pain with a quicker return to normal patient activity compared to the open technique. Nevertheless, the long learning curve, general anaesthesia, and increased costs due to devices are the arguments against TAPP.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{clinical}} outcomes following sutureless ProGrip™ mesh repair to traditional Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh secured with sutures. Data were collected prospectively and were analyzed for 57 male and 3 female patients with 60 inguinal hernias. All patients included underwent open surgical repair for inguinal hernia with polypropylene mesh or ProGrip mesh. In our two centres study sixty patients were operated; 30 were treated with Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh (L group) and 30 with ProGrip mesh (P group) with or without fixation. The primary parameter measured was intensity of postoperative pain using visual analogue scale (VAS); other outcomes included assessment of early and late complication. VAS was assessed in 7 days and 4 months of the postoperative period. Our results show that VAS scored at the 7 th postoperative day was 1. 5 for the ProGrip mesh versus 4. 4 in Lichtenstein repair group. The difference between groups was statistically significant (P= 0. 001). Surgery duration was significantly shorter in the P group (24. 9 vs. 58. 3 min; P= 0. 001). No recurrence was observed at 3 months in both groups.

40|$|Aims: Inguinal {{hernia repair}} {{according}} to Lichtenstein technique {{has become the}} most common procedure performed by general surgeons. Heavy weight polypropylene meshes have been reported to stimulate inflammatory reaction responsible for mesh shrinkage when scar tissue evolved. Additionally, some concerns remain regarding the relationship between chronic pain and mesh fixation technique. In order to reduce those drawbacks, we have developed a new mesh for anterior tension free inguinal hernia repair which exhibits <b>self-gripping</b> absorbable properties. Materials and Methods: 52 patients (69 hernias) were prospectivly operated with this mesh (SOFRADIM-France) made of low-weight isoelastic large pores knitted fabric which incorporated resorbable micro hooks that provides self gripping properties to the mesh during the first months post-implantation. The fixation of the mesh onto the tissues is significantly facilitated. The mesh is secured around the cord with a self gripping flap. After complete tissular ingrowth and resorption of the PLA hooks, the low-weight (40 g/m 2) polypropylene mesh insures the long term wall reinforcement. Results: Peroperativly, no complication was reported, the mesh was easy to handle and to fix. Discharge was obtained at Day 1. No perioperative complication occurred, return to daily activities was obtained at Day 5. 5. At one month, no neurological pain or other complications were described. Conclusions: Based on the first results of this clinical study, this unique concept of low density self gripping mesh should allows an efficient treatment of inguinal hernia. It should reduce postoperative complications and the extent of required suture fixation, making the procedure more reproducibl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract text Introduction: the {{abdominal}} wall defects surgery needs of prosthetic light, resistant, biocompatible and economic materials, to reduce recurrence risks, shorten recovery length {{and improve the}} patients postoperative comfort. The Ideal prosthesis would be simply implantable, biocompatible and usable both in open and laparoscopic surgery. The material we tested is also bioadhesive. Methods&Materials: we studied a new material, the Buchypaper of Carbon Nanotubes (BP). About BP we observed {{that it can be}} tailored with scissors, it can be sterilized, it is superlight, flexible, bioadhesive and biocompatible. The BP can be linked to any kind of prosthetic material and employed to fix the prosthesis to biological alive tissues. We tested on Sprague Dawley rat model and bench tests on New Zeeland female rabbits. The measurement of the bioadhesivity was realized by peeling test at 90 ° with INSTRON 4502. Results: we compared BP Fmax= 4. 1 N versus Parietene Progrip® “self gripping” Fmax= 0. 01 N. Infinity GORE Fmax= 0, 3 N, were fixed to the biological support with fibrin glue Tissucol® Baxter. Test show the adhesion strength of new dry BP sample applied on biological support. As peel force is applied we measure the displacement of <b>self-gripping</b> BP from fascia and muscular layer. For the samples of BP tested on the smooth surface (BPs), BP tested on the rough surface. We compared these results with the peeling test of Parietene Progrip® “self gripping”. The bio-adhesiveness of the side coated with polyglactin is very low, showing maximum peel strength of only 0. 001 N/mm, 100 times lower than that recorded for BPr sample. Conclusions: the tests showed a significant performance difference among the prosthetic samples. At the light of our experience we think that the BP can replace any kind of suture and biologic glues in the fixing prosthesis materials in the alive tissues, avoiding theoretically but possible infections and chronic pain due to nerve “entrapment”. The BP showed a bioadhesivity 100 times bigger than the best self gripping actually marketed prosthetic material. We believe that the modifiable BP bioadhesivity, if largely employed, can radically change the fixing surgical technique...|$|E
