40|$|Crosstalk in VLSI {{interconnects}} {{is a major}} constrain in DSM and UDSM technology. Among various strategies {{followed for}} its minimization, shield insertion between Aggressor and Victim {{is one of the}} prominent options. This paper analyzes the extent of crosstalk in inductively coupled interconnects and minimizes the same through distributed shield insertion. Comparison is drawn between signal voltage and crosstalk voltage in three different conditions i. e. prior to shield insertion, after shield insertion and after additional ground tap insertion at <b>shield</b> <b>terminal.</b> Comment: Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, see [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Wireless relay can be {{utilized}} to extend signal coverage, achieve spatial diversity by user cooperation, or <b>shield</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> from adverse channel conditions over the direct link. In a two-hop multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system, the overall noise at the destination station (DS) {{consists of the}} colored noise forwarded from the relay station (RS) and the local white noise. We propose blind noise correlation estimation at the DS by utilizing statistics of the broadband relay channel over the RS-DS hop, which effectively improves signal detection at the DS. For further performance improvement, we also propose to estimate the two cascaded MIMO relay channels over the source-RS and the RS-DS links at the DS based on the overall channel between the source and the DS and the amplifying matrix applied at the RS. To cancel cross-talk interference at a channel-reuse-relay-station (CRRS), we utilize the random forwarded signals of the CRRS as equivalent pilots for local coupling channel estimation and achieve a much higher post signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) than the conventional dedicated pilots assisted cancellers without causing any in-band interference at the DS. When an OFDM-based RS is deployed on a high-speed train to <b>shield</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> from the high Doppler frequency over the direct link, inter-subchannel interference (ICI) mitigation is required at the RS. By utilizing statistics of the channel {{between the base station}} and the train, we develop both full-rate and reduced-rate OFDM transmission with inherent ICI self-cancellation via transmit and/or receive preprocessing, which achieve significant performance improvement over the existing ICI self-cancellation schemes.

40|$|An Advanced Development Program (ADP) {{to develop}} and {{demonstrate}} effective Atmospheric Electricity Hazards Protection (AEHP) for the fighter, transport/bomber, helicopter and cruise missile classes of air vehicles is being conducted under an Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories (AFWAL) contract with Boeing Military Airplane Company (BMAC). Other Government agencies are also supporting the ADP. The parameters characterizing the lightning threat have been defined for moderate and severe flashes; e. g., 200 kA peak and 200 kA/microsecond rise rate for the severe threat lightning current. The attachment of lightning flashes to aircraft has resulted in many losses of aircraft in the past. The losses {{have been caused by}} both physical damage to the aircraft frame or structure, and electrical effects to aircraft flight critical elements and systems. The losses associated with upset and/or damage may increase with the advent of sensitive integrated circuitry being used in flight critical applications, and the use of composite material in these airframes and structures thereby reducing its electromagnetic shielding effectiveness. Protection concepts; e. g., circuit and system <b>shielding,</b> <b>terminal</b> protection, conducting floors and cable protection; may be used to prevent damage. A design methodology considering airframe characteristics, and circuit and system characteristics and criticality, which will lead to identification of balanced protection schemes is presented. Incorporation of AEHP is expected to enhance the operational flexibility of air vehicles through increased confidence of all-weather operational integrity. The effectiveness demonstration phase of the AEHP ADP using a modified F- 14 airframe with advanced avionic and power systems is described. An ACAP helicopter is also {{to be used as a}} testbed. The testbeds will be subjected to low-level continuous wave (CW), moderate-level pulse, and severe-level pulse current injection. This method evaluates the safety margin of the generic protection design...|$|R
40|$|Among a small {{collection}} of Invertebrates, recently collected by Mr. K. Schädler in the neighbourhood of Kisser, I {{met with a}} gephyrean worm, belonging to the genus Aspidosiphon. Though we know already several species of this genus from the Malay Archipelago, thanks the careful investigatons of Dr. Sluiter, during his stay at Batavia 1), the present specimen could not be identified with one of them. The body of our specimen (fig. 1) has a nearly cylindrical shape; it measures 3 ½ mm. in breadth, its length being about eight times greater (26 mm.). The colour {{of the body is}} brownish-yellow, that of the anal and <b>terminal</b> <b>shields</b> dark brown, almost black. In the anterior half of the trunk the body-wall is rather thick, marked by annular grooves; in its posterior half, however, the skin is plain and thin, and the retractor-muscles and nephridia are visible through it.

40|$|Lightning {{interception}} is investigated through {{scale model}} experiments. By regarding the rod-plane gap under lightning impulses {{as a reference}} case, results are presented relating to the discharge interception probability of an earthed rod inserted in the gap; the impulse volt­age polarity, {{the length of the}} reference gap and the earthed rod height were considered as influencing parameters. Proximity effects of a neighbouring object on the interception probability distribution of an air terminal are also investigated by inserting two earthed rods in the reference rod-plane gap. Experimental results are interpreted in terms of the breakdown mechanism and electric field computations. A new lightning attachment model, statistical model, is introduced. Thus, statistical methods for the estimation of lightning incidence to air <b>terminals,</b> <b>shielding</b> design of common structures and for the evaluation of the lightning performance of overhead transmission lines are proposed.

40|$|A {{balanced}} bridge chopper circuit {{including four}} {{metal oxide semiconductor}} field effect transistors (MOSFETs) is driven by a remote oscillator connected through an isolator to modulate low-voltage low-frequency input signals at their remote source into a square wave A. C. output signal that can be conducted to a common point where it is amplified and demodulated for better linear measurement of said low-voltage signals. The oscillator is connected through the isolator to the bridge circuit {{in such a manner}} that opposing pairs of the bridge transistors are simultaneously conducting. The isolator may comprise a novel photovoltaic isolation device or it may consist of an isolation transformer or of other types of electrical isolation devices. The transistors and input and output terminals for the bridge circuit are shielded and are mounted on a heat sink consisting of a thermally conducting metal plate and/or a metal oxide single crystal which is in common with the <b>shield</b> and/or one <b>terminal</b> of the low-voltage source such that all leads and terminals are maintained at a constant temperature and preferably at the same temperature as the low-voltage source. Air currents are prevented from causing thermally induced voltages within the bridge circuit by the circuit shield and in some extreme cases by the use of a hermetically sealed shield for the critical circuit elements and connections. For accurately balancing out interelectrode capacitance-coupled gate drive to low-level channel signals, a pair of variable capacitors are connected between one output terminal of the bridge circuit and the gate of each of its two adjacent transistors. The balanced bridge chopper may be produced as a monolithic planar-silicon integrated circuit in which gate-to-channel capacitance balancing is accomplished during manufacturing in place of the variable capacitors. A novel balanced input filter and trimmer capacitors between the bridge output terminals and local ground greatly reduce 60 Hz. common mode noise. In a hybrid circuit embodiment of the bridge circuit, the individual MOSFET chips forming the bridge circuit are bonded and interconnected within a hermetically sealed and magnetically transparent metal oxide single crystalline container. Multiplexing circuitry is also disclosed for driving several chopper circuits from a single oscillator and for connecting the outputs from the chopper circuits to a single amplifier and demodulator at a remote location...|$|R
