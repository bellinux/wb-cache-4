5|$|The Meteorological Flight {{first came}} into being on 1 November 1924. Its main {{priority}} was identifying temperature, pressure, humidity and general weather conditions being logged at sea level to 18,000 feet. These flights were named THUM (Temperature/Humidity). Changes in air conditions usually came in the Atlantic in the west. The Meteorological Office (MET) relied on reports from ships in this regard. The need for aircraft for operations was ignored in 1939 owing to lack of aircraft. However, in June 1940, Bomber Command started to become anxious about base landing conditions and the accuracy of general forecasts. In response from strong support, No. 403 Squadron RAF, No. 404 Squadron RAF and No. 405 Squadron RAF were formed for this purpose. The routes requested by the MET usually involved distances of up to 1,000nm. Hudsons were ideal for this operation, but since none were available Bristol Blenheims filled the role. On 1 March 1941 Coastal Command assumed operational control of all the units. They were redesignated No. 1401 to 1406 flights. All were handed over to No. 18 Group RAF. In October 1940, two more flights, 1407 and 1408 were sent to Iceland to begin operations from there. Several types of <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> were used; Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires. Operations were conducted mostly up to 15,000 feet in wartime as the aneroid capsule altimeter {{was not able to}} give accurate readings. A Mk. 14B ICAN altimeter was used. The aircraft had to be flown at the height measured for two minutes to allow the readings to settle or stabilise.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 Eddie participated in, {{what was}} the last Ford National Reliability Air Tour, in his Cessna.

A new engine was sent to him and after a {{difficult}} takeoff, he went on to win first place for <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and finished third overall.|$|E
500|$|The {{operation}} was broad in its scope. As well as eliminating French airfields and aircraft factories around Paris, in von Waldau's words, the bombing was to [...] "achieve a desirable {{influence on the}} morale of the capital". German reconnaissance aircraft reported 1,244 aircraft on airfields in and around Paris, including 550–650 <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> This French air power was to be destroyed along with the aviation factories in the area. French anti aircraft artillery (AAA) defences were mapped from tactical to operational level, and intelligence of French ground defences was therefore good. The {{operation was}} due to be carried out on 30 May, but again, bad weather prevented it.|$|E

[...] It was a single bay biplane with rectangular plan wings mounted without stagger but with marked dihedral and braced with pair of parallel, airfoil section interplane struts. A pair of inverted V cabane struts, parallel to each other, joined the central section of the upper wing to the upper fuselage longerons. There were ailerons on the upper wing only. [...] The wings were duralumin two spar structures with fabric covering.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{trained on}} <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the squadrons's pilots were {{surprised}} to find Lockheed P-38 Lightnings sitting on Stoney Cross's dispersal pads. Only members of the advance party had any experience flying the Lightning. [...] These pilots had flown combat sorties with the 55th Fighter Group. The change from single engine to twin engine aircraft required considerable retraining for both pilots and ground crew. Although some pilots entered combat with as little as eight hours of flying time on the P-38, in late April the squadron was reinforced by pilots who had trained on the Lightning in the States and were more experienced on the type. [...] However, the lack of instrument training in the P-38 took its toll on the 394th as weather, not enemy action, caused the loss of pilots and airplanes.|$|E
