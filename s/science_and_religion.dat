5|$|Charles Smithson – {{the main}} male character. Though {{born into a}} family {{with close ties to}} nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and {{considerable}} education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist. Though trying to become an enlightened and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on Smithson's actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system. Moreover, conflicting identification with social forces, such as <b>science</b> <b>and</b> <b>religion,</b> lead Smithson to an existential crisis.|$|E
5|$|While various {{religions}} and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through {{concepts such as}} theistic evolution, there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their {{religions and}} who raise various objections to evolution. As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have {{the same types of}} natural causes as other inherited traits in animals. In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions between <b>science</b> <b>and</b> <b>religion</b> have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists.|$|E
5|$|Helmle, Corbett & Harrison {{teamed with}} another {{architectural}} firm, Sugarman & Berger. Henry Sugarman, {{of the latter}} organization, advised in the building's design and supervised interior construction work. The cornerstone was laid on March 24, 1929. It has an all-black irregular shape stepped like the building. On it are inscribed the year 1929 and a symbol designed by Roerich consisting of a circle enclosing three dots together with a monogram. The monogram, showing the letter R within the letter M, stands for the Roerich Museum. The circle and the three dots are the symbol of Roerich's Banner of Peace. He once said the circle represents eternity and unity and the dots the triune nature of existence. On another occasion he said the symbol has two meanings: in one interpretation, the circle represents the totality of culture and the dots are art, <b>science,</b> <b>and</b> <b>religion</b> (or philosophy), while in the other, the circle symbolizes the endlessness {{of time and the}} dots are the past, the present, and the future. The cornerstone contains a 400-year-old casket from the Rajput dynasty of northern India. Made of iron with inlays of gold and silver, the casket contains photographs taken during the Roeriches' expedition to Central Asia. It is also said to contain Jacob's Pillow or the Stone of Scone. Prominent politicians participated in the cornerstone-laying ceremony and among messages read from prominent Americans was a letter from Albert Einstein in which he praised the cultural goals of the building's directors.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict between <b>science</b> <b>and</b> <b>religion,</b> he proposes that 'to believe' means {{to accept a}} conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion.|$|E

25|$|<b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>religion</b> {{are based}} on {{different}} aspects of human experience. In science, explanations {{must be based on}} evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, <b>science</b> <b>and</b> <b>religion</b> are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put <b>science</b> <b>and</b> <b>religion</b> against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.|$|E
