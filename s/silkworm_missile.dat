5|$|In 1987, Missouri was {{outfitted}} with 40mm grenade launchers and 25mm chain guns {{and sent to}} take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating in the Persian Gulf at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment– a striking contrast to her world cruise months earlier. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, Missouri escorted tanker convoys through the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire control system trained on land-based Iranian <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> launchers.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1991, 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait; {{three were}} damaged {{in the attack}} but all {{returned}} to base. On 26January, RAF Jaguars and Tornadoes raided several <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> batteries in Kuwait to encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country. On the 30th, two RAF Jaguars destroyed a Polnochny-class landing ship with rockets and cannon. The Iraqi Republican Guard, entrenched on the Kuwait-Saudi border, were subjected to a continuous intensive bombing campaign for weeks to demoralise them, allied Jaguars forming {{a portion of the}} delivering aircraft. The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces. Both nations' Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991, at the end of Desert Storm.|$|E
500|$|Within a few days, the Special Operations {{forces had}} {{determined}} the Iranian pattern of activity; the Iranians hid {{during the day}} near oil and gas platforms in Iranian waters and at night they headed toward the Middle Shoals Buoy, a navigation aid for tankers. With this knowledge, SOF launched three Little Bird helicopters and two patrol craft to the buoy. The Little Bird helicopters arrived first and were fired upon by three Iranian boats anchored near the buoy. After a short but intense firefight, the helicopters sank all three boats. Three days later, in mid-October, an Iranian <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> hit the tanker Sea Isle City near the oil terminal outside Kuwait City. Seventeen crewmen and the American captain were injured in the missile attack. During Operation Nimble Archer, four destroyers shelled two oil platforms in the Rostam oil field. After the shelling, a SEAL platoon and a demolition unit planted explosives {{on one of the}} platforms to destroy it. The SEALs next boarded and searched a third platform [...] away. Documents and radios were taken for intelligence purposes.|$|E

50|$|The {{occupation}} of al-Faw placed Basra {{at risk of}} being attacked. The Iranians also used the peninsula as a launch pad for <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> which were deployed against shipping and oil terminals in the Persian Gulf, and also against Kuwait, which supported Iraq throughout the war.|$|R
50|$|On February 25, 1991 a shore-based Iraqi {{launcher}} fired two <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> at the USS Missouri {{which was}} in company with the USS Jarrett and HMS Gloucester. A Sea Dart missile from HMS Gloucester shot down one Silkworm and the other missed, crashing into the ocean. Royal Air Force officers subsequently recovered an HY-2 missile at Umm Qasr in southern Iraq. It is currently displayed at the RAF Museum Cosford.|$|R
2500|$|... 1987: Persian Gulf: Operation Nimble Archer. Attacks on two Iranian oil {{platforms}} in the Persian Gulf by United States Navy {{forces on}} October 19. [...] The attack {{was a response}} to Iran's October 16, 1987 attack on the MV Sea Isle City, a reflagged Kuwaiti oil tanker at anchor off Kuwait, with a <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{retaliation}} for the attacks, Iran fired Silkworm missiles (suspected to be the HY-4 version) from land bases against SAG Delta in the Strait of Hormuz and against the [...] in the northern central Persian Gulf, but all missed due to the evasive maneuvers and use of decoys by the ships. A missile was probably shot down by the Garys [...] gun. The Pentagon and the Reagan Administration later denied that any <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> attacks took place probably since {{it was the only}} way to keep the situation from escalating further as they had promised before publicly that any such attacks would merit retaliation against targets on Iranian soil.|$|E
50|$|On Thursday, October 15, 1987, Iran hit the American-owned (and Liberian-flagged) supertanker, the Sungari, with a <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> off Kuwait's main Mina Al Ahmadi oil port. The next morning, Iran hit another ship, the U.S.-flagged MV Sea Isle City, {{with another}} <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Iranians {{put their}} {{foothold}} in the Al Faw peninsula to good use. They used the peninsula as a launch pad for <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> which were deployed against shipping and oil terminals in the Persian Gulf, and also against Kuwait, which supported Iraq throughout the war. It gave them a chokehold on any goods and supplies coming up the Shatt al Arab and Khawr Abd Allah waterway for Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|Lai was {{believed}} to be the mastermind of a US$10 billion scheme, during which he allegedly bribed high level officials in the administration of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone in order to smuggle luxury cars and entire tanker-loads of oil into the country. The smuggling ring fraudulently avoided US$3.6 billion in taxes and fees. [...] Chinese authorities do not comment on allegations that Lai's Yuanhua group was also a conduit for clandestine military shipments, such as <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery shells and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The jet-powered GEAT UAV shapes like a {{scaled-down}} <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> {{except the}} UAV adopts shoulder wing {{as opposed to}} the mid wing of <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile.</b> The three-piece tailplanes of GEAT jet-powered UAV are arranged in Y shape, {{as opposed to the}} inverted Y shape of <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile.</b> The inlet is located above the fuselage. [...] The propeller-driven GEAT UAV has a conventional layout and tricycle landing gear system, and like its jet-powered cousin, it also has a shoulder wing configuration.|$|E

5000|$|In February 1991 {{during the}} Persian Gulf War the US {{battleship}} , escorted by [...] (carrying Sea Dart) and [...] (equipped with Phalanx CIWS), was engaged by an Iraqi <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> (NATO reporting name [...] "Seersucker"). The <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> was intercepted and {{destroyed by a}} Sea Dart fired from Gloucester. This {{was the first time}} any missile had successfully engaged another missile during combat at sea. During the same engagement, the Jarretts Phalanx 20 mm CIWS was placed in autoengagement mode and targeted chaff launched by the Missouri rather than the incoming missile.|$|E
50|$|The C-101 {{anti-ship missile}} {{has a lower}} speed and higher cruise {{altitude}} than larger and more potent supersonic anti-ship missiles such as the SS-N-22, and thus is relatively prone to interception {{in comparison to the}} SS-N-22, but this drawback is partially made up by its smaller radar cross section and lower infrared signature. The same advantages are retained when compared to the subsonic <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles,</b> which also have higher cruise altitude and lower speed in comparison to C-101. As a result, the C-101 saw wider service in Chinese armed forces than its larger cousin C-301, mainly as a stopgap measure for the air force until the newer supersonic missile such as the Russian Kh-31 becomes widely available, and as an upgrade for older missile boats such as the Heku class to replace the original <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> on board. Although Chinese claim that other type of seekers such as infrared imaging and television seekers have been successfully developed, the status is rather uncertain due to the availability of newer anti-ship missiles. The general designer of C-101 is Mr. Liang Shoupan (梁守磐), who is also the general designer of another Chinese supersonic AShM C-301. According to Chinese military enthusiasts, the upgraded C-101 with the latest improvements is reportedly designated as YJ-16.|$|R
50|$|The {{guidance}} {{package was}} assembled by cannibalizing gyroscopes from the Chinese <b>Silkworm</b> cruise <b>missile.</b> A source is cited as claiming {{that there were}} inertial and even GPS guidance systems illegally imported from Belarus, but these allegations have not been confirmed.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after his}} {{move to the}} UK in 1984, Jamshid Hashemi {{developed}} {{a relationship with the}} UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) which would last nine years. Hashemi broke off the relationship in 1993 after the UK Government refused to issue him a British passport. At one time Hashemi gave the UK Conservative Party [...] "£55,000 after meeting Margaret Thatcher at the home of the then foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe." [...] Hashemi deals that MI6 approved of included the supply of £350 million worth of <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> from China to Iran in 1987 (the agency had supported this by sending an agent to China in 1985 to help arrange the deal) and the transfer of Portuguese 155mm ammunition.|$|R
50|$|This {{anti-ship missile}} is {{designed}} specifically for targets with displacement between 1,000 tons to 4,000 tons. Neither small anti-ship missiles such as the TL-6 and C-701 nor large ones such as the C-802 and <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> are cost effective when used for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Leftwich, {{under the}} command of RADM (then Commander) Daniel Bowler, participated in Operation Nimble Archer on 19 October 1987. This was a {{response}} to Iran's 16 October 1987 attack on the MV Sea Isle City, a reflagged Kuwaiti oil tanker at anchor off Kuwait, with a <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{oil tanker}} MV Sea Isle City was renamed for this city {{when it was}} reflagged and {{registered}} in the United States in 1987 during Operation Earnest Will.

50|$|A {{developed}} version {{based on}} HY-4, {{known as the}} XW-41, has been developed. This latest version of the C-201 missile family {{is said to have}} a 300 km range with additional GPS/GLONASS guidance. However, due to the availability of more advanced anti-ship missile with similar range, such as the C-602, the future of XW-41, like others in the <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> family, is uncertain despite its successful trials. Although still a member of <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile,</b> the developer considers the missile was different enough to be a listed as a separate category of its own due to the amount of new technologies adopted. After the Gulf War, United Arab Emirates ordered 30 of these shore-based version for coastal defense, and accordingly to Jane's Defence Weekly, these missiles are referred by the general name Silkworm missiles, but domestic Chinese sources have claimed that these were XW-41s, though there are reports claiming these missiles are other models of Silkworm series.|$|E
50|$|The crash {{began in}} Far Eastern markets {{the morning of}} October 19, but {{accelerated}} in London time—very largely because London had closed early on October 16 due to the storm—by 9.30am the London FTSE100 had fallen over 136 points. Later that morning, two U.S. warships shelled an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf in response to Iran's <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> attack on the Sea Isle City.|$|E
50|$|The S-3B saw {{extensive}} service {{during the}} 1991 Gulf War, performing attack, tanker, and ELINT duties, and launching ADM-141 TALD decoys. This {{was the first}} time an S-3B was employed overland during an offensive air strike. The first mission occurred when an aircraft from VS-24, from the , attacked an Iraqi <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> site. The aircraft also participated in the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s and in Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese {{used this}} missile {{as a basis}} for their Silkworm series, with IR, radar and {{turbojets}} or rocket engines depending on the model. It had a fuselage of 75-80 cm width and a mass of over 2 tonnes. This is comparable to the 600-800 kg and 35-40 cm of Western missiles. With improved electronics, the warhead reduced to 250 kg and the original rocket engine replaced with a turbojet, this weapon was much improved with a range of over 100 km. Chinese <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> were used in hundreds of ships and shore batteries. The Chinese Navy built more than two hundred modified versions of the 183R (Komar-class), the Hegu-class, (complete with a longer hull and an additional 25mm mount aft) and the Osa-class. Frigates and destroyers were also equipped with the missile. Some were exported and they were used in shore batteries built for North Korea, Iraq and Iran. The Soviet Union developed an equivalent, the P-120 Malakhit.|$|R

50|$|The Silkworm gained fame in the 1980s when it {{was used}} by {{both sides in the}} Iran-Iraq War; both {{countries}} were supplied by China. During 1987, Iran launched a number of <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> from the Faw Peninsula vicinity striking the American-owned, Liberian-flagged tanker Sungari and U.S.-flagged tanker Sea Isle City in October 1987. Five other missiles struck areas in Kuwait earlier in the year. In October 1987, Kuwait's Sea Island offshore oil terminal was hit by an Iranian Silkworm which was observed to have originated from the Faw peninsula. The attack prompted Kuwait to deploy a Hawk missile battery on Failaka Island to protect the terminal. In December 1987, another Iranian Silkworm was fired at the terminal, but it struck a decoy barge instead. Prior to these attacks the missile's range was thought to be less than 80 km, but these attacks proved that the range exceeded 100 km with Kuwaiti military observers seeing that the missiles originated from the area and tracking them on radar along with US satellite imagery of the launch sites.|$|R
50|$|On 16 October, Sea Isle City was in Kuwaiti waters, {{waiting to}} be loaded. It had been escorted there by U.S. warships, but was not under their {{protection}} at the time. An Iranian <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> launched from the Iranian-occupied Al-Faw Peninsula hit the ship's wheel house and crew quarters, blinding its master, a U.S. citizen and wounding 18 crew members. The damage to the ship would take four months to repair.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Navy made a {{significant}} contribution to Allied efforts {{in the early stages of}} the war. In particular, Royal Navy Westland Lynx helicopters were responsible for the destruction of almost the entire Iraqi Navy. Additionally, Royal Navy minehunters cleared Iraqi mines near the Kuwaiti coast, allowing the US battleships Wisconsin and Missouri to move in close enough to launch devastating bombardments against Iraqi ground forces. HMS Gloucester intercepted an Iraqi <b>Silkworm</b> <b>Missile</b> bound for the US Battleships.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{related to}} the Bubiyan action was the Battle of Khafji, where Saddam Hussein sent an amphibious assault to Khafji to {{reinforce}} the city against the Coalition attack. This too was spotted by the Coalition naval forces and subsequently destroyed. The last action of the Iraqi Navy was to fire a <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missile</b> from an inland launcher at the battleship however, it was intercepted midflight by a Sea Dart missile from the British destroyer [...] and succesfully destroyed.|$|E
50|$|During their {{occupation}} in the 16th century, the Portuguese built fortresses here, {{as well as}} on the nearby Qeshm and Hormuz Islands. The island contains an Iranian military base which maintains several Chinese-made <b>Silkworm</b> HY-2 surface-to-surface <b>missiles</b> placed there in 1987.|$|R
500|$|On 29 January, the [...] led Missouri northward, using {{advanced}} mine-avoidance sonar. In {{her first}} naval gunfire support action of Desert Storm she shelled an Iraqi {{command and control}} bunker near the Saudi border, the first time her [...] guns had been fired in combat since March 1953 off Korea. The battleship bombarded Iraqi beach defenses in occupied Kuwait {{on the night of}} 3 February, firing 112 [...] rounds over the next three days until relieved by Wisconsin. Missouri then fired another 60 rounds off Khafji on 11–12 February before steaming north to Faylaka Island. After minesweepers cleared a lane through Iraqi defenses, Missouri fired 133 rounds during four shore bombardment missions as part of the amphibious landing feint against the Kuwaiti shore line the morning of 23 February. The heavy pounding attracted Iraqi attention; in response to the battleship’s artillery strike, the Iraqis fired two HY-2 <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> at the battleship, one of which missed. The other missile was intercepted by a GWS-30 Sea Dart missile launched from the British air defence destroyer [...] within 90 seconds and crashed into the sea roughly [...] in front of Missouri.|$|R
50|$|The {{attacks on}} oil tankers continued. Both Iran and Iraq carried {{frequent}} attacks {{during the first}} four months of the year. Iran was effectively waging a naval guerilla war with its IRGC navy speedboats, while Iraq attacked with its aircraft. In 1987, Kuwait asked to reflag its tankers to the US flag. They did so in March, and the US navy began Operation Earnest Will to escort the tankers. The result of Earnest Will would be that while oil tankers shipping Iraqi/Kuwaiti oil were protected, Iranian tankers, and neutral tankers shipping to Iran would be unprotected, resulting in both losses for Iran and the undermining of its trade with foreign countries, damaging Iran's economy further. Iran also deployed <b>Silkworm</b> <b>missiles</b> to attack some ships, but only a few were actually fired. Both the US and Iran jockeyed for influence in the Gulf. To discourage the US from escorting tankers, Iran secretly mined some areas in the Gulf. The US began to escort the reflagged tankers, but one of them was damaged by a mine while under escort. While being a public-relations victory for Iran, the US increased its reflagging efforts. While Iran mined the Persian Gulf, their speedboat attacks were reduced, primarily attacking unflagged tankers shipping in the area.|$|R
