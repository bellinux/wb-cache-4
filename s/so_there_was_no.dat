Extreme care is still taken, as there only has to be single instance of this not being the case to have deadly consequences.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig Borga did {{not return}} to the WWF after his ankle healed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> closure to his feud with Tatanka. The feud between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow was also soon forgotten. In the summer of 1994, both wrestlers joined Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. The two {{eventually}} formed a tag team and unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased {{operations}} at midnight on 1 April 1996, {{and local government}} was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially {{different from those of}} the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire had continued to be held at the Ruthin branch, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> problem in segregating the records.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|The Captaincy General of Chile {{followed}} a process analogous {{to that of}} the May Revolution, and elected a Government Junta that inaugurated the brief period known as Patria Vieja. The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Rancagua, and the subsequent Reconquista of Chile would make it a royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural barrier between the Argentine revolutionaries and Chile, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> military confrontation between them until the Crossing of the Andes, led by José de San Martín in 1817, a campaign that resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.|$|E

5|$|The House {{resolution}} did {{not pass}} the Senate, nor did the Senate pass a resolution of their own, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> 2012 budget of record. The actual appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2012 included four continuing resolutions and three full-year appropriations bills enacted in November and December 2011, {{in accordance with the}} United States budget process. These appropriations were greatly affected by the Budget Control Act of 2011, passed in August 2011 as a resolution to the debt-ceiling crisis; it mandated budget cuts over a ten-year period beginning with Fiscal Year 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} {{long-range}} radar station at Poling caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working and could see almost as far out to sea. Along the surrounding coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until Poling was repaired.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible {{due to the lack}} of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no mention}} of NATO {{enlargement}} in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> formal commitment not to expand. Whether or not the West informally committed to not enlarge NATO to the East is a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer rejects that an informal agreement existed. Texas A University political scientist Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson argues that an informal agreement existed.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E

5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> need to include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> need to lengthen the signal {{as in the case}} of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, {{so it had}} become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was pulled at the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> possibility of delaying the release.|$|E

5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who {{were glad to}} be rid of the former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of the}} equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Bretagne was based in Toulon. At the time, Italy remained neutral, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> immediate threat to the Mediterranean Fleet. In December, Bretagne covered convoy traffic in the Atlantic. On 4 December, she and Provence, along with the cruisers Colbert, Dupleix, and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar. Around {{the middle of the}} month, the task force began to return to the Mediterranean. After returning to Toulon, Bretagne underwent an extensive overhaul, which lasted until 3 March 1940. On 11 March, she left France carrying 1,820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury along with the cruiser Algérie, which carried another 1,179 boxes. They arrived in Halifax on 10 April. On the return voyage, they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April. On 27 April, Bretagne and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria. Bretagne and Provence returned to Mers El Kébir on 18 May.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do <b>so,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E
