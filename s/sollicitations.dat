60|$|Sect. 222. The {{reason why}} men enter into society, is the {{preservation}} of their property; and the end why they chuse and authorize a legislative, is, {{that there may be}} laws made, and rules set, as guards and fences to the properties of {{all the members of the}} society, to limit the power, and moderate the dominion, of every part and member of the society: for since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society, that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure, by entering into society, and for which the people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making; whenever the legislators endeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence. Whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavour to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to resume their original liberty, and, by the establishment of a new legislative, (such as they shall think fit) provide for their own safety and security, which is the end for which they are in society. What I have said here, concerning the legislative in general, holds true also concerning the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him, both to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society. He acts also contrary to his trust, when he either employs the force, treasure, and offices of the society, to corrupt the representatives, and gain them to his purposes; or openly preengages the electors, and prescribes to their choice, such, whom he has, by <b>sollicitations,</b> threats, promises, or otherwise, won to his designs; and employs them to bring in such, who have promised before-hand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate candidates and electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it but to cut up the government by the roots, and poison the very fountain of public security? for the people having reserved to themselves the choice of their representatives, as the fence to their properties, could do it for no other end, but that they might always be freely chosen, and so chosen, freely act, and advise, as the necessity of the commonwealth, and the public good should, upon examination, and mature debate, be judged to require. This, those who give their votes before they hear the debate, and have weighed the reasons on all sides, are not capable of doing. To prepare such an assembly as this, and endeavour to set up the declared abettors of his own will, for the true representatives of the people, and the law-makers of the society, is certainly as great a breach of trust, and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government, as is possible to be met with. To which, if one shall add rewards and punishments visibly employed to the same end, and all the arts of perverted law made use of, to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design, and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country, it will be past doubt what is doing. What power they ought to have in the society, who thus employ it contrary to the trust went along with it in its first institution, is easy to determine; and one cannot but see, that he, who has once attempted any such thing as this, cannot any longer be trusted.|$|E

[...] Yet neither thus disheartn'd or dismay'd, [...] The time prefixt I waited, when behold [...] The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard, [...] 270 [...] Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come [...] Before Messiah and his way prepare. [...] I as all others to his Baptism came, [...] Which I believ'd was from above; but he [...] Strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim'd [...] Me him (for it was shew'n him so from Heaven) [...] Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first [...] Refus'd on me his Baptism to confer, [...] As much his greater, and was hardly won; [...] But as I rose out of the laving stream, [...] 280 [...] Heaven open'd her eternal doors, from whence [...] The Spirit descended on me like a Dove, [...] And last the sum of all, my Father's voice, [...] Audibly heard from Heav'n, pronounc'd me his, [...] Me his beloved Son, in whom alone [...] He was well pleas'd; by which I knew the time [...] Now full, that I no more should live obscure, [...] But openly begin, as best becomes [...] The Authority which I deriv'd from Heaven. [...] And now by some strong motion I am led [...] 290 [...] Into this wilderness, to what intent [...] I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know; [...] For what concerns my knowledge God reveals. [...] So spake our Morning Star then in his rise, [...] And looking round on every side beheld [...] A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades; [...] The way he came not having mark'd, return [...] Was difficult, by humane steps untrod; [...] And he still on was led, but with such thoughts [...] Accompanied of things past and to come [...] 300 [...] Lodg'd in his brest, as well might recommend [...] Such Solitude before choicest Society. [...] Full forty days he pass'd, whether on hill [...] Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night [...] Under the covert of some ancient Oak, [...] Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew, [...] Or harbour'd in one Cave, is not reveal'd; [...] Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt [...] Till those days ended, hunger'd then at last [...] Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild, [...] 310 [...] Nor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his walk [...] The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm, [...] The Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd aloof.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanics of}} a complex fluid such as a foam we propose a model experiment (a bidimensional flow around an obstacle) for which an external <b>sollicitation</b> is applied, and a local response is measured, simultaneously. We observe that an asymmetric obstacle (cambered airfoil profile) experiences a downards lift, opposite to the lift usually known (in a different context) in aerodynamics. Correlations of velocity, deformations and pressure fields yield a clear explanation of this inverse lift, involving the elasticity of the foam.

The strategy demonstrated using long alkyl chain cations provides an opportunity to prepare nanomaterials with a nanoscale structuration.

40|$|Advanced {{plans were}} made by the Dutch {{government}} to extend the port of Rotterdam by means of the construction of a land reclamation in the North Sea, the Maasvlakte 2. Because no safety standards exist for the Maasvlakte 2, it is useful to determine an optimal design from an economic point of view by cost-benefit analysis. The economic optimal design of the Maasvlakte 2 is assumed to be the design for which the net present value (NPV) of the total costs (including loss of benefits) is minimal. An accompanying optimal level of safety for the Maasvlakte 2 is also found. In this analysis, the Maasvlakte 2 is assumed to be a system composed of three elements, a breakwater, a sea defence and a terrain area. For each element, decision variables are selected which have influence on the resistance (strength) and {{the costs and benefits of}} the Maasvlakte 2, and also represent relations between elements. For the breakwater, the crest height and the diameter of the concrete blocks in the armour layer are considered as decision variables. For the terrain area, the height of the terrain area is the only decision variable considered. For the sea defence, the crest height, the diameter of the quarry stones in the protection layer of the outer slope and the angle of the outer slope are considered as decision variables. A selection of failure modes is also made for each element. Each failure mode is written in the form of a reliability function Z = R-S in which R is the resistance and S is the <b>sollicitation.</b> For the failure modes, hydraulic conditions (waves, water levels) represent the <b>sollicitation.</b> The geometry and strength of the elements, also determined by the decision variables, represent the resistance. In the calculation of the economic optimal design of the Maasvlakte 2, a bottom-up approach is used: 1. at first, calculations are executed for each failure mode 2. then, these results are used in the optimisation per element 3. finally, optimal element results are used in the optimisation of the system. This way the optimal design for Maasvlakte 2 is derived. With this optimisation method, a probabilistic design is determined and compared with a deterministic design it proves to be much more cost effective.

60|$|Tiberius in the {{beginning}} of his reign made Valerius Gratus President of Judea; and after 11 years, substituted Pontius Pilate, who governed 10 years. Then Vitellius, newly made President of Syria, deprived him of his honour, substituting Marcellus, and at length sent him to Rome: but, by reason of delays, Tiberius died before Pilate got thither. In the mean time Vitellius, after he had deposed Pilate, came to Jerusalem in the time of the Passover, to visit that Province as well as others in {{the beginning}} of his office; and in the place of Caiaphas, then High Priest, created Jonathas the son of Ananus, or Annas as he is called in scripture. Afterwards, when Vitellius was returned to Antioch, he received letters from Tiberius, to make peace with Artabanus king of the Parthians. At the same time the Alans, by the <b>sollicitation</b> of Tiberius, invaded the kingdom of Artabanus; and his subjects also, by the procurement of Vitellius, soon after rebelled: for Tiberius thought that Artabanus, thus pressed with difficulties, would more readily accept the conditions of peace. Artabanus therefore straightway gathering a greater army, opprest the rebels; and then meeting Vitellius at Euphrates, made a league with the Romans. After this Tiberius commanded Vitellius to make war upon Aretas King of Arabia. He therefore leading his army against Aretas, went together with Herod to Jerusalem, to sacrifice at the publick feast which was then to be celebrated. Where being received honourably, he stayed three days, and in the mean while translated the high Priesthood from Jonathas to his brother Theophilus: and the fourth day, receiving letters of the death of Tiberius, made the people swear allegiance to Caius the new Emperor; and recalling his army, sent them into quarters. All this is related by Josephus Antiq. lib. 18. c. 6, 7. Now Tiberius reigned 22 years and 7 months, and died March 16, {{in the beginning}} of the year of Christ 37; and the feast of the Passover fell on April 20 following, that is, 35 days after the death of Tiberius: so that there were about 36 or 38 days, for the news of his death to come from Rome to Vitellius at Jerusalem; which being a convenient time for that message, confirms that the feast which Vitellius and Herod now went up to was the Passover. For had it been the Pentecost, as is usually supposed, Vitellius would have continued three months ignorant of the Emperor's death: which is not to be supposed. However, the things done between this feast and the Passover which Vitellius was at before, namely, the stirring up a sedition in Parthia, the quieting that sedition, the making a league after that with the Parthians, the sending news of that league to Rome, the receiving new orders from thence to go against the Arabians, and the putting those orders in execution; required much more time than the fifty days between the Passover and Pentecost of the same year: and therefore the Passover which Vitellius first went up to, was in the year before. Therefore Pilate was deposed before the Passover A.C. 36, and by consequence the passion of Christ was before that Passover: for he suffered not under Vitellius, nor under Vitellius and Pilate together, but under Pilate alone.|$|R

Alexander the great having conquered all the Persian Empire, and some part of India, died at Babylon {{a month before the}} summer Solstice, in the year of Nabonassar 425: and his captains gave the monarchy to his bastard brother Philip Aridæus, a man disturbed in his understanding; and made Perdiccas administrator of the kingdom. Perdiccas with their consent made Meleager commander of the army, Seleucus master of the horse, Craterus treasurer of the kingdom, Antipater governor of Macedon and Greece, Ptolemy governor of Egypt; Antigonus governor of Pamphylia, Lycia, Lycaonia, and Phrygia major; Lysimachus governor of Thrace, and other captains governors of other Provinces; as many as had been so before in the days of Alexander the great. The Babylonians began now to count by a new Æra, which they called the Æra of Philip, using the years of Nabonassar, and reckoning the 425th year of Nabonassar to be the first year of Philip. Roxana the wife of Alexander being left big with child, and about three or four months after brought to bed of a son, they called him Alexander, saluted him King, and joined him with Philip, whom they had before placed in the throne. Philip reigned three years under the administratorship of Perdiccas, two years more under the administratorship of Antipater, and above a year more under that of Polyperchon; in all six years and four months; and then was slain with his Queen Eurydice in September by the command of Olympias the mother of Alexander the great. The Greeks being disgusted at the cruelties of Olympias, revolted to Cassander the son and successor of Antipater. Cassander affecting the dominion of Greece, slew Olympias; and soon after shut up the young king Alexander, with his mother Roxana, in the castle of Amphipolis, under the charge of Glaucias, An. Nabonass. 432. The next year Ptolemy, Cassander and Lysimachus, by means of Seleucus, form'd a league against Antigonus; and after certain wars made peace with him, An. Nabonass. 438, upon these conditions: that Cassander should command the forces of Europe till Alexander the son of Roxana came to age; and that Lysimachus should govern Thrace, Ptolemy Egypt and Lybia, and Antigonus all Asia. Seleucus had possest himself of Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Sustana and Media, the year before. About three years after Alexander's death he was made governor of Babylon by Antipater; then was expelled by Antigonus; but now he recovered and enlarged his government over a great part of the East: which gave occasion to a new Æra, called Æra Seleucidarum. Not long after the peace made with Antigonus, Diodorus saith the same Olympic year; Cassander, seeing that Alexander the son of Roxana grew up, and that it was discoursed thro'out Macedonia that it was fit he should be set at liberty, and take upon him the government of his father's kingdom, commanded Glaucias the governor of the castle to kill Roxana and the young king Alexander her son, and conceal their deaths. Then Polyperchon set up Hercules, the son of Alexander the great by Barsinè, to be king; and soon after, at the <b>sollicitation</b> of Cassander, caused him to be slain. Soon after that, upon a great victory at sea got by Demetrius the son of Antigonus over Ptolemy, Antigonus took upon himself the title of king, and gave the same title to his son. This was An. Nabonass. 441. After his example, Seleucus, Cassander, Lysimachus and Ptolemy, took upon themselves the title and dignity of kings, having abstained from this honour while there remained any of Alexander's race to inherit the crown. Thus the monarchy of the Greeks for want of an heir was broken into several kingdoms; four of which, seated to the four winds of heaven, were very eminent. For Ptolemy reigned over Egypt, Lybia and Ethiopia; Antigonus over Syria and the lesser Asia; Lysimachus over Thrace; and Cassander over Macedon, Greece and Epirus, as above.|$|R
