40|$|Sol-gel reactions, in general, have to {{take place}} in organic {{solvents}} in order to control the hydrolysis and condensation reaction. This leads to drawbacks in applications, since the organic solvent vapor concnetration has to be controlled for example in ocoating applications for environmental, health or security reasons. For this reason, a reaction route has been developed to produce coating precursors stable against water as solvent. To achieve this, conventional electrostatically stabilized sols obtained either by hydrolysis and condensation or commercially availabe <b>sols</b> (e. <b>g.</b> SiO 2 <b>sols)</b> have been surface modified to reduce the particle-to-particle interaction and electrosterically stabilized precursors compatible to water have been obtained.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The screen-printing {{technology}} {{provides a}} low cost high-throughput approach to good contacts for silicon solar cells. However, currently screen-printed contacts are formed {{at the expense}} of slight performance and fill factor loss. The front grid contact is particularly important and requires low contact resistance, high shunt resistance, and low junction recombination for high fill factor. Often contacts are fired in the moderate to high temperature range (750 - 800 oC) to achieve low series resistance. However, high temperature firing can lead to junction shunting and recombination, which degrades fill factor. Moreover shallow or higher sheet resistance emitters (50 - 100 Ω/sq) are desirable for high performance, which makes devices even more vulnerable to high temperature firing. Therefore, in this study, we modify the paste composition by adding some dopants and additives to lower the peak firing temperature for good ohmic contacts. This also reduces the wafer bowing and enhances SiN-induced defect hydrogenation in multicrystalline silicon substrates. The results show that increasing the additives concentration lowered the optimum firing temperature from 780 to 720 oC. In addition, the ideality factor is reduced significantly at the lower firing temperature. Thus additives used in this study were able to lower the peak firing temperature and increase the fill factor without hurting the series resistance. Fill factor of 0. 774 on textured CZ was obtained at ~ 720 oC peak firing temperature for paste <b>G</b> (<b>SOL</b> 9807). These pastes were formulated at Heraeus.

The two new baenid taxa are described based on skull material. Gamerabaena sonsallai, gen. et sp. n., and Stygiochelys gilberti, sp. n., are identified as Eubaenines based {{on the presence of}} the following characters: a broadly concave maxillary triturating surface, a deep temporal emargination with no parietal/squamosal contact, and a C-shaped quadratojugal. A high resolution baenid phylogenetic analysis supports the Baenidae phylogenetic framework of Gaffney and Meylan. The analysis regards S. estesi and S. gilberti as a monophyletic group and considers <b>G.</b> <b>sol</b> 1 sallai as the sister taxon of those Eubaenine genera. An analysis of the large amount of material collected indicates intraspecific variation within the shells of E. cephalica and the skulls of the closely related P. bairdi.

There is also considerable variation among the three complete Palatobaeno skulls found at one of the localities. The taxon varies in the overall height of the skull, degree of pterygoid contact, degree of temporal emargination, bones that make up the stapedial foramen, and degree of nasal excavation.

40|$|The {{simplest}} and likeliest assumption {{concerning the}} cognitive bases of absolute pitch (AP) {{is that at}} its origin there is a particularly skilled function which matches {{the height of the}} perceived pitch to the verbal label of the musical tone. Since there is no difference in sound frequency resolution between AP and non-AP (NAP) musicians, the hypothesis of the present study is that the failure of NAP musicians in pitch identification relies mainly in an inability to retrieve the correct verbal label to be assigned to the perceived musical note. The primary hypothesis is that, when asked to identify tones, NAP musicians confuse the verbal labels to be attached to the stimulus {{on the basis of their}} phonetic content. Data from two AP tests are reported, in which subjects had to respond in the presence or in the absence of visually presented verbal note labels (fixed Do solmization). Results show that NAP musicians confuse more frequently notes having a similar vowel in the note label. They tend to confuse e. g. a 261 Hz tone (Do) more often with <b>Sol</b> than, e. <b>g.,</b> with La. As a second goal, we wondered whether this effect is lateralized, i. e. whether one hemisphere is more responsible than the other in the confusion of notes with similar labels. This question was addressed by observing pitch identification during dichotic listening. Results showed that there is a right hemispheric disadvantage, in NAP but not AP musicians, in the retrieval of the verbal label to be assigned to the perceived pitch. The present results indicate that absolute pitch has strong verbal bases, at least from a cognitive point of view...|$|R

In the cluster-continuum model calculations, we considered only 1 solvent molecule attached explicitly and others treated implicitly whereas in the DPCM calculations all the solvent molecules were treated implicitly. DPCM calculations were carried out on Pheo, PheoH(+), Pheo-CH(3) OH and PheoH(+) -CH(3) OH in methanol solution. The aim of these calculations {{was to determine the}} free energy changes involved in the deprotonation of PheoH(+) (Delta <b>G</b> (<b>sol))</b> and finally to obtain the corresponding pK (a) value. DPCM calculations were carried out employing the restricted open-shell density functional treatment (ROB 3 LYP) using the 6 - 31 G(d) basis set to determine the free energy of solvation of bare Pheo and PheoH(+) and of the clusters, Pheo-CH(3) OH and PheoH(+) -CH(3) OH in methanol. In-vacuo geometries of all the species were obtained by performing optimizations at ROB 3 LYP level using the 6 - 31 G(d) basis. Electronic energies of all the species were then obtained by carrying out single point DFT calculations using 6 - 311 +G(2 d, 2 p) basis set on the respective optimized geometries. Differences in thermal energy and molecular entropy were calculated by carrying out frequency calculations at ROB 3 LYP/STO- 3 G level on the optimized geometries of the truncated models. The optimized geometries of the clusters display intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. The pK (a) values of PheoH(+) calculated by DFT-DPCM and cluster-continuum methods are 6 center dot 12 and 4 center dot 70 respectively while the observed value is 4 center dot 14.

The post peak compressive strength behavior of the frozen soils {{with respect to the}} variation in total water content, dry unit weight and the temperature conditions are studied.

A brittle type of failure was observed for the frozen soils with high total water contents. The residual compressive strength of the frozen soils are found to be independent of the dry unit weight. However, for all the frozen soils the ratio of peak compressive strength to residual strength is found to decrease with increasing dry unit weight.

40|$|With the {{difficulty}} in treating recalcitrant infections and the growing resistance to antibiotics, new therapeutic modalities are becoming increasingly necessary. The interruption of bacterial quorum sensing (QS), or cell-cell communication is known to attenuate virulence, while limiting selective pressure toward resistance. This study initiates an ethnobotanically-directed search for QS inhibiting agents in south Florida medicinal plants. Fifty plants were screened for anti-QS activity using two biomonitor strains, Chromobacterium violaceum and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Of these plants, six showed QS inhibition: Conocarpus erectus L. (Combretaceae), Chamaecyce hypericifolia (L.) Millsp. (Euphorbiaceae), Callistemon viminalis (<b>Sol.</b> ex Gaertn.) <b>G.</b> Don (Myrtaceae), Bucida burceras L. (Combretaceae), Tetrazygia bicolor (Mill.) Cogn. (Melastomataceae), and Quercus virginiana Mill. (Fagaceae). These plants were further examined for their effects on the QS system and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an intractable opportunistic pathogen responsible for morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised patient. C. erectus, B. buceras, and C. viminalis were found to significantly inhibit multiple virulence factors and biofilm formation in this organism. Each plant presented a distinct profile of effect on QS genes and signaling molecules, suggesting varying modes of action. Virulence attenuation was observed with marginal reduction of bacterial growth, suggesting quorum quenching mechanisms unrelated to static or cidal effects. Extracts of these plants were also investigated for their effects on P. aeruginosa killing of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Results were evaluated in both toxin-based and infection-based assays with P. aeruginosa strains PA 01 and PA 14. Overall nematode mortality was reduced 50 - 90 %. There was no indication of host toxicity, suggesting the potential for further development as anti-infectives. Using low-pressure chromatography and HPLC, two stereoisomeric ellagitannins, vescalagin and castalagin were isolated from an aqueous extract of C. erectus. Structures were confirmed via mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Both ellagitannins were shown to decrease signal production, QS gene expression, and virulence factor production in P. aeruginosa. This study introduces a potentially new therapeutic direction {{for the treatment of}} bacterial infections. In addition, this is the first report of vescalagin and castalagin being isolated from C. erectus, and the first report of ellagitannin activity on the QS system. ...|$|R
40|$|Mudanças nas características anatômicas e fisiológicas e na produção de óleo essencial de plantas medicinais sob influência de diferentes condições de radiação têm sido evidenciadas. O objetivo deste trabalho foi caracterizar essas variações em plantas de alfazema-do-Brasil (Aloysia gratissima [Gilles & Hook. ] Tronc.) Verbenaceae, crescidas a pleno sol e com 40 e 80 % de redução da radiação solar incidente. Para a análise de crescimento, utilizou-se delineamento inteiramente casualizado (DIC), com três níveis de luzes e cinco repetições de três plantas. As análises do teor de clorofila e da anatomia foliar foram {{realizadas}} em DIC com três repetições de três plantas e, a análise do óleo essencial, em DIC, com três repetições de cinco plantas, para cada nível de radiação. O nível de 40 % de sombreamento foi o melhor no aspecto de crescimento. A matéria seca dos diversos órgãos da planta não diferiu entre os tratamentos com 40 % de sombreamento (massa seca total 201 g) e a pleno <b>sol</b> (148 <b>g),</b> ambos significativamente superiores ao tratamento com 80 % de sombreamento (68, 6 g). Plantas cultivadas a pleno sol apresentaram folhas com epiderme adaxial, parênquima paliçádico, esponjoso e limbo significativamente mais espesso que nos demais tratamentos, enquanto plantas crescidas a 80 % de sombreamento apresentaram folhas com a epiderme abaxial significativamente mais espessa. Não houve efeito significativo do sombreamento sobre o teor do óleo essencial, que variou de 2, 1 a 2, 2 %, embora o rendimento de óleo essencial tenha sido significativamente superior nas plantas crescidas em plena luz (0, 73 g planta- 1) e a 40 % de sombreamento (0, 88), em relação àquelas crescidas a 80 % de sombreamento (0, 26). Houve aumento significativo da concentração de clorofila a e b em função da diminuição da intensidade de radiação (20, 7 mg de clorofila total por g de massa fresca a pleno sol; e 23, 7 e 32, 0 com 40 e 80 % de sombreamento respectivamente) e uma redução significativa na razão a/b (3, 13 a pleno sol e 2, 94 e 2, 69, a 40 e 80 % de sombreamento, respectivamente). Changes in {{the anatomical}} and physiologic characteristics {{and in the}} production of essential oil of medicinal plants under influence of different radiation conditions have been demonstrated. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the variation in the anatomical and physiologic characteristics, and in the essential oil content of the Brazilian-lavender (Aloysia gratissima [Gilles & Hook. ] Tronc., verbenaceae), grown in different shading levels, characterized by the reduction of 0; 40, and 80 % of the incident solar radiation. For growth analyses we used a completely randomized design (CRD), with three levels of light and five replicates of three plants. The analyses of chlorophyll content and leaf anatomy were performed in CRD, with three replicates of three plants, while the analyses of essential oil content was carried out in CRD, with three replicates of five plants for each light level. The results showed that 40 % of shading was the best condition for plant growth. Dry matter from different organs of the plant did not differ in the treatments 40 % of shading (total dry matter 201 g) and at full sunlight (148 g), both significantly higher than 80 % of shading (68. 6 g). Plants cultivated in full sunlight showed leaves with adaxial epidermic tissue, palisade, and spongy parenchyma and limb significantly thicker than other treatments; however plants grew at 80 % shading showed leaves with abaxial epidermic tissue significantly thicker. Shadowing did not significantly interfere with the essential oil content, which ranged from 2. 1 to 2. 2 %.; Nevertheless, the essential oil yield was significantly higher in plants grew in full sunlight (0. 73 g plant- 1) and 40 % shading (0. 88), than on those grew at 80 % shading (0. 26). There was significant increase of chlorophyll a and b concentration in function of the decrease in light intensity (20. 7 mg total chlorophyll per g fresh matter at full sunlight; and 23. 7 and 32. 0 with 40 % and 80 % shading respectively), as well as significant reduction in ratio a/b (3. 13 at full sunlight and 2. 94 and 2. 69 at 40 % and 80 % shading respectively) ...|$|R
