40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} maternal use of <b>sulfamethizole</b> near term {{and the risk of}} neonatal jaundice. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study using Danish registers. All Danish women giving birth between 1995 and 2007 were included from the Danish Fertility Database. Women redeeming a prescription for <b>sulfamethizole</b> up to 4 weeks before giving birth were identified from the National Prescription Register. The primary outcome was the number of neonates diagnosed with jaundice between birth and age 28 days identified in the National Hospital Register. Risk of neonatal jaundice was calcu-lated as odds ratios (ORs) with linear logistic regression with and without adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: We identified 841, 900 births. Of 1, 823 (0. 2 %) neonates exposed to <b>sulfamethizole</b> up to 4 weeks before birth, 197 (10. 8 %) developed neonatal jaundice. The OR of developing neonatal jaundice after exposure to <b>sulfamethizole</b> was 2. 35 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 02 – 2. 72). Adjustment for maternal age, education, household income, parity, and period of conception left OR unchanged at 2. 29 (95 % CI 1. 97 – 2. 67). After further adjustment for gestational age, the risk associated with <b>sulfamethizole</b> was rendered insignificant (OR 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 86 – 1. 22). Narrowing exposure time to the last week before birth did not change the estimates. Broken into gestational age groups, the rate of neonates with jaun-dice after exposure was similar to the rate of unexposed neonates with jaundice. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between redeeming a prescription of <b>sulfamethizole</b> near term and increased risk of neonatal jaundice. We showed that the presumed association is the result of preterm birth, which can be caused by maternal urinary tract infection...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} Thesis {{deals with}} the electrochemical behavior of <b>sulfamethizole</b> on carbon paste electrodes. <b>Sulfamethizole</b> is a sulfonamide antibiotic effective against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In human medicine, the most frequent application is {{for the treatment of}} urinary tract. In veterinary medicine, it is used for the and preventive treatment of both aquatic and terrestic animals. Due to the wide utilization and low metabolization, it also presents an environmental burden.

40|$|Resistance to {{antibiotics}} {{used for}} the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is increasing worldwide. The impact of in vitro resistance on clinical outcome in UTIs requires further study, since most studies of both humans and animals have evaluated only the efficacy of antibiotics toward bacteria susceptible in vitro. We were interested in evaluating the relationship between the in vitro antibacterial effect and the in vivo efficacy after antibiotic treatment. We simulated a natural ascending UTI by use of the ascending UTI mouse model and used Escherichia coli strains with various susceptibilities to amdinocillin (mecillinam) and <b>sulfamethizole.</b> Mice were treated for 3 days with antibiotic doses approximating human urinary tract concentrations after a standard oral dose. For a susceptible strain (MIC, 0. 5 μg/ml) and a resistant strain (MIC, 128 μg/ml), respectively, there were significant reductions in bacterial counts in the urine, bladder, and kidneys after treatment with amdinocillin, whereas for a strain for which the MIC was 16 μg/ml, there was a significant reduction in bacterial counts in the kidneys only (P 2, 048 μg/ml) could not be treated with <b>sulfamethizole,</b> as no effect could be demonstrated in the urine, bladder, or kidneys.

Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane.

40|$|Antibiotic-resistant infections kill {{approximately}} 23, 000 {{people and}} cost $ 20, 000, 000, 000 {{each year in}} the United States alone despite the widespread use of small-molecule antimicrobial combination therapy. Antibiotic combinations typically have an additive effect: the efficacy of the combination matches the sum of the efficacies of each antibiotic when used alone. Small molecules can also act synergistically when the efficacy of the combination is greater than the additive efficacy. However, synergistic combinations are rare and have been historically difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic pairs is limited by the scale of potential combinations: a modest collection of 1, 000 small molecules involves 1 million pairwise combinations. Here, we describe a high-throughput method for rapid identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs, the overlap 2 method (O 2 M). O 2 M extracts patterns from chemical-genetic datasets, which are created when a collection of mutants is grown in the presence of hundreds of different small molecules, producing a precise set of phenotypes induced by each small molecule across the mutant set. The identification of mutants that show the same phenotype when treated with known synergistic molecules allows us to pinpoint additional molecule combinations that also act synergistically. As a proof of concept, we focus on combinations with the antibiotics trimethoprim and <b>sulfamethizole,</b> which had been standard treatment against urinary tract infections until widespread resistance decreased efficacy. Using O 2 M, we screened a library of 2, 000 small molecules and identified several that synergize with the antibiotic trimethoprim and/or <b>sulfamethizole.</b> The most potent of these synergistic interactions is with the antiviral drug azidothymidine (AZT). We then demonstrate that understanding the molecular mechanism underlying small-molecule synergistic interactions allows the rational design of additional combinations that bypass drug resistance. Trimethoprim and <b>sulfamethizole</b> are both folate biosynthesis inhibitors. We find that this activity disrupts nucleotide homeostasis, which blocks DNA replication in the presence of AZT. Building on these data, we show that other small molecules that disrupt nucleotide homeostasis through other mechanisms (hydroxyurea and floxuridine) also act synergistically with AZT. These novel combinations inhibit the growth and virulence of trimethoprim-resistant clinical Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, suggesting that {{they may be able to}} be rapidly advanced into clinical use. In sum, we present a generalizable method to screen for novel synergistic combinations, to identify particular mechanisms resulting in synergy, and to use the mechanistic knowledge to rationally design new combinations that bypass drug resistance...|$|E

40|$|Sulfonamide {{antibiotics}} {{have a wide}} {{application range}} in human and veterinary medicine. Because they tend to persist in the environment, they pose potential problems {{with regard to the}} propagation of antibiotic resistance. Here, we identified metabolites formed during the degradation of sulfamethoxazole and other sulfonamides in Microbacterium sp. strain BR 1. Our experiments showed that the degradation proceeded along an unusual pathway initiated by ipso-hydroxylation with subsequent fragmentation of the parent compound. The NADH-dependent hydroxylation of the carbon atom attached to the sulfonyl group resulted in the release of sulfite, 3 -amino- 5 -methylisoxazole, and benzoquinone-imine. The latter was concomitantly transformed to 4 -aminophenol. Sulfadiazine, <b>sulfamethizole,</b> sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine, 4 -amino-N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide, and N-(4 -aminophenyl) sulfonylcarbamic acid methyl ester (asulam) were transformed accordingly.

Tw e nty patients with various urinary tract infections were treated with "Urobiotic" in this study. The dosages were 1 capsule 4 times daily in 8 cases and 2 capsules 4 times daily in the remaining 12 cases, both of which continued for 5 to 7 days. The effects thus attained are summarized as follows : In patients with acute cystitis, "Urobiotic" was noted to be effective in 4 out of 5 cases in which 4 capsules daily were given, and in all of 6 cases in which the dosage was 8 capsules daily. In chronic urinary infections, consisting of 6 cases of chronic cystitis and 3 cases of chronic pyelonephritis, "Urobiotic" was noted to be not effective in all of 3 cases in which the dosage was 4 capsules daily, but effective in 4 out of 6 cases in which 8 capsules daily were given. As side effects, mild gastric discomfort was noted in only 1 patient who was given 8 capsules daily. In con c lusion, "Urobiotic" was believed to be an effective remedy not only for acute cystitis, but also for chronic urinary tract infections. Dosage recommended is 8 capsules daily...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{reliable}} liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous confirmation of 13 sulfonamides in honey {{was developed and}} fully validated {{in accordance with the}} European Commission Decision No 2002 / 657 /EC. The validation scheme was built in accordance with the target level of 50 μgkg(- 1) for all analytes. The sulfonamides investigated were as follows: sulfaguanidine (SGN), sulfanilamide (SNL), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfathiazole (STZ), sulfamerazine (SMR), <b>sulfamethizole</b> (SMZ), sulfadimerazine (SDM), sulfamonomethoxine (SMNM), sulfamethoxypiridazine (SMP), sulfadoxine (SDX), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfaquinoxaline (SQX) and sulfadimethoxine (SDT). Several extraction procedures were investigated during the development phase. Finally, the best results were obtained with a procedure using acidic hydrolysis and cation exchange purification. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C 18 analytical column. Matrix effects were also investigated. Data acquisition implemented for the confirmatory purpose was performed by monitoring 2 MRM transitions per analyte under the positive electrospray mode. Mean relative recoveries ranged from 85. 8 % to 110. 2 % and relative standard deviations lying between 2. 6 % and 19. 8 % in intra-laboratory reproducibility conditions. The decision limits (CCα) ranged from 1. 8 to 15. 5 μgkg(- 1). High resolution mass spectrometry was used to investigate the possible formation of sulfonamide metabolites in honey. The validation results proved that the method is suitable for the screening and confirmatory steps as implemented for the French monitoring residue plan for sulfonamides residue control in honeybees...|$|E
40|$|The {{synergistic}} effect of combining molecular imprinting and {{surface acoustic wave}} SAW technologies for the selective and label free detection of antibiotics in aqueous environment was demonstrated for the first time. A molecularly imprinted polymer MIP for <b>sulfamethizole</b> SMZ selective recognition was prepared in a form of a homogeneous thin film {{on the surface of}} SAW sensor by oxidative electropolymerization of m phenylenediamine mPD in the presence of SMZ, acting as a template. A special attention was paid to the rational selection of the functional monomer using computational and spectroscopic approaches. SMZ template incorporation and its subsequent release from the polymer was supported by IR microscopic measurements. The thicknesses of SMZ MIP and non imprinted reference films were carefully controlled and optimized through electrical charge dosage and ellipsometry measurements. The fabricated SMZ MIP films were characterized in terms of their binding affinity and selectivity toward the target by analyzing the binding kinetics recorded using SAW system. The SMZ MIPs had SMZ binding capacity approximately more than eight times higher than the respective non imprinted polymer NIP and were able to discriminate among structurally similar molecules i. e. sulfanilamide and sulfadimethoxine. The presented approach for the facile integration of an antibiotic sensing layer with SAW technology allowed observing the real time binding events of the target molecule at relevant sensitivity levels and could be potentially suitable for cost effective fabrication of a multianalyte chemosensor for analysis of hazardous pollutants in aqueous environmen...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and removal}} of 19 antibiotics (including four macrolides, eight sulfonamides, three fluoroquinolones, three tetracyclines, and trimethoprim) were investigated in two ecological (constructed wetland (CW) and stabilization pond (SP)) and two conventional wastewater treatment processes (activated sludge (AS) and micro-power biofilm (MP)) {{in a county}} of eastern China. All target antibiotics were detected in the influent and effluent samples with detection frequencies of > 90 %. Clarithromycin, ofloxacin, roxithromycin and erythromycin-H 2 O were the dominant antibiotics with maximum concentrations reaching up to 6524, 5411, 964 and 957 ng/L, respectively; while the concentrations of tiamulin, sulfamerazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine, <b>sulfamethizole</b> and sulfisoxazole were below 10 ng/L. Although the mean effluent concentrations of target antibiotics were obviously lower than the influent ones (except ciprofloxacin), their removals were usually incomplete. Principal component analysis showed that the AS and CW outperformed the MP and SP processes and the AS performed better than the CW process in terms of antibiotics removal. Both the AS and CW processes exhibited higher removal efficiencies in summer than in winter, indicating biological degradation could {{play an important role}} in antibiotics removal. Because of the incomplete removal, the total concentration of detected antibiotics increased in the mixing and downstream sections of a local river receiving the effluent from a typical wastewater treatment facility practicing AS process. Nowadays, ecological wastewater treatment processes are being rapidly planned and constructed in rural areas of China; however, the discharge of residual antibiotics to the aquatic environment may highlight a necessity for optimizing or upgrading their design and operation.
