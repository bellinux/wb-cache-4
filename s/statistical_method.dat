5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by Kepler in May 2011, {{although it had}} {{been seen as a}} planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called Blender that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the <b>statistical</b> <b>method</b> that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptologists {{identifying}} Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus, Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius {{who report}} that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 years of reign in his Aegyptiaca. Ryholt relies instead on a <b>statistical</b> <b>method</b> and estimates {{the duration of}} Sheshi's reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method consists in tallying the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then, knowing that the first four of these kings reigned for at least c. 30 years, implies that they have left between 7.5 and 20 seals per year on throne. Consequently, Sheshi's nearly 400 scarabs would correspond to 20 to 53 years, which Ryholt gives as c. 40 years.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a system of}} indicators for measuring <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> use efficiency in enterprises. The indicators are formed based on the questionnaire, {{which is used to}} inspect the attitude of employees towards <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> use in Croatian enterprises. With the purpose of understanding <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> use effectiveness better, indicators are classified into two groups: comparative and individual indicators. These indicators were used {{in the construction of the}} E-score indicator, which can be used to predict if an enterprise will achieve a positive net income due to an effective use of <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> or not. The system of indicators of <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> use efficiency developed within this research can be easily used by any enterprise. Using these indicators an enterprise can estimate its competitive position compared to other enterprises and it can predict if the difference will increase or decrease. Despite the existence of many business systems of indicators, the impact of <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> use used to be neglected.

40|$|Robust <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> are {{designed}} to work well when classical assumptions, typically normality and/or the lack of outliers, are violated. Almost everyone agrees {{on the value of}} robust statistical procedures. Nonetheless, after more than 40 years and thousands of papers, few robust methods were available in standard statistical software packages until very recently. This paper argues that one of the primary reasons for the lack of robust <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> in standard <b>statistical</b> software packages is the fact that few developers of <b>statistical</b> <b>methods</b> are willing to write user-friendly and readable software for the methods they develop, regardless of the usefulness of the method.

Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features included having rotors step one position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that turns with every keypress) {{at either end of}} the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough ciphertext and applying a standard <b>statistical</b> <b>method</b> known as the kappa test, he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine.|$|E
25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a <b>statistical</b> <b>method</b> of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E
