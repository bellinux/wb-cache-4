40|$|We {{present a}} nonperturbative lattice {{formulation}} of noncommutative Yang-Mills theories in arbitrary even dimension. We show that lattice regularization of a noncommutative field theory requires finite lattice volume which automatically provides both an ultraviolet and an infrared cutoff. We demonstrate explicitly Morita equivalence of commutative U(p) gauge theory with (p*n_f) flavours of fundamental matter fields on a lattice of size L with twisted boundary conditions and noncommutative U(1) gauge theory with n_f species of matter on a lattice of size (p*L) with <b>single-valued</b> <b>fields.</b> We discuss the relation with twisted large N reduced models and construct observables in noncommutative gauge theory with matter.

50|$|The {{problem of}} {{compatibility}} in continuum mechanics involves {{the determination of}} allowable <b>single-valued</b> continuous <b>fields</b> on bodies. These allowable conditions leave the body without unphysical gaps or overlaps after a deformation. Most such conditions apply to simply-connected bodies. Additional conditions are required for the internal boundaries of multiply connected bodies.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that when the}} {{underlying}} sigma model of bosonic string theory is written in terms of <b>single-valued</b> <b>fields,</b> which live in the covering space of the target space, Abelian T-duality survives lattice regularization of the world-sheet. The projection onto the target-space is implemented through a sum over cohomology, which bears resemblance to summing over topological sectors in Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the case of string theory on a circle is shown to be explicitly self-dual in the lattice regulated model and automatically forbids vortex excitations which would otherwise destroy the duality. For other target spaces a generalized notion of T-duality is observed in which the target space and the cohomology coefficient group are interchanged under duality. Specific examples show that the fundamental group of the target space may not be preserved in the T-dual theory. Generalized models which exhibit T-duality behaviour, with dynamical variables that live on the k-dimensional cells of (p + 1) -dimensional world-volumes, are also constructed. These models correspond to gauge theories, and higher-dimensional analogues, in which one sums over various topological sectors of the theory...|$|R
50|$|In {{continuum}} mechanics, a compatible deformation (or strain) tensor {{field in}} a body is that unique tensor field that is obtained when the body is subjected to a continuous, <b>single-valued,</b> displacement <b>field.</b> Compatibility {{is the study of}} the conditions under which such a displacement field can be guaranteed. Compatibility conditions are particular cases of integrability conditions and were first derived for linear elasticity by Barré de Saint-Venant in 1864 and proved rigorously by Beltrami in 1886.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Transparency {{perception}} {{is recognized as}} one of the important phenomena for the theory of early vision. This is because transparency perception suggests that a simple theory reconstructing a <b>single-valued</b> <b>field</b> of a visual attribute, such as an optical-flow field, cannot model the neural mechanism in the brain and raises the fundamental issue of how the visual attribute is represented and computed in the visual cortex. Here we present a systematic study that examined the perceptual cost for motion transparency psychophysically. It has been known that the perceptual performance in motion transparency is worse than that predicted by assuming overlapping motions are detected individually. This perceptual “cost ” would reflect the neural encoding mechanism for transparent motions. The present results showed that the properties of the perceptual costs varied with the measures of psychophysical performance; the perceptual cost evaluated by motion detection thresholds became smaller as the directional difference between overlapping motions decreased, whereas the cost examined with precisions of directional judgments became worse. A computational analysis with a simple population coding model suggests that the percep-tual costs evaluated by two measures would arise from different mechanisms. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContinuum {{theory of}} moving dislocations {{is used to}} set up a non-local {{constitutive}} law for crystal plasticity in the form of partial differential equations for evolving dislocation fields. The concept of <b>single-valued</b> dislocation <b>fields</b> that enables {{to keep track of the}} curvature of the continuously distributed gliding dislocations with line tension is utilized. The theory is formulated in the Eulerian as well as in so-called dislocation-Lagrangian forms. The general theory is then specialized to a form appropriate to formulate and solve plane-strain problems of continuum mechanics. The key equation of the specialized theory is identified as a transport equation of diffusion-convection type. The numerical instabilities resulting from the dominating convection are eliminated by resorting to the dislocation-Lagrangian approach. Several examples illustrate the application of the theory...|$|R

Kinematic evolution equations for the SODT are obtained {{in the framework of}} the calculus of differential forms and then used to derive equations for alignment tensors by spatial projection. For a general and comprehensive treatment we refer the reader to Hochrainer (2015). Here we motivate the same equations in terms of probabilistic averaging over <b>single-valued</b> dislocation density <b>fields,</b> considering the case of deformation by dislocation glide.|$|R
