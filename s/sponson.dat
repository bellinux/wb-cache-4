5|$|Mutsu had an {{additional}} boom {{added to the}} mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y floatplane recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3, and a collapsible crane was installed in a port-side <b>sponson</b> the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K, added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.|$|E
25|$|Bullet {{deflector}} plates were installed over the rear fenders. The idea behind these plates {{was that the}} tank could drive over a trench, and the rear <b>sponson</b> machine guns could then fire onto the plates; the bullets would deflect into the trench or the area directly behind the tank. Like the <b>sponson</b> machine guns themselves, the {{deflector plates}} {{turned out to be}} useless. However, the idea was used again on M5 light tanks in the Normandy campaign.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Seastar {{features}} complex angling and shaping, as {{the result}} of extensive water tank testing. Pilots exit and enter the Seastar through a single door on the left-hand side of the aircraft from the <b>sponson,</b> and passengers board via a separate hatch located aft of the wing, also stepping from the <b>sponson.</b> This approach enables the aircraft to close to a relatively short distance from docks or boats for boarding purposes. The cabin can house up to 12 passengers, in addition to the crew in high-density seating, or can alternatively accommodate six-nine passengers in more spacious configurations; an aft baggage compartment is also present.|$|E
5000|$|Eleven steel <b>sponsons</b> were {{installed}} {{on the port side}} of the hull: two long horizontal sponsons; two long vertical <b>sponsons</b> and seven short vertical <b>sponsons.</b>|$|R

5|$|The ship's primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} eight 40-caliber 12.7cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts on <b>sponsons</b> {{along the sides}} of the hull. Shōhō was also initially equipped with four twin 25mm Type 96 light AA guns, also in <b>sponsons</b> {{along the sides of}} the hull.|$|R
25|$|Three Type 96 {{searchlights}} were positioned {{along the}} outer {{edges of the}} flight deck: two {{on the port side}} and one to starboard, just aft of the island. Like the collapsible crane, these could be lowered below flight deck level to prevent interference with normal flight activity. A fourth searchlight was mounted to the starboard side of the carrier’s island on a projecting <b>sponson.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like most early tanks, the Schneider {{was built}} like a simple {{armoured}} box, without compartmentalisation of the inner space. It lacked a turret, with the main armament, a short 75mm cannon, in a <b>sponson</b> on the right side. By later standards it would therefore have been an assault gun instead of a tank. The vehicle was considered a very imperfect design, because of a poor layout, insufficient fire-power, a cramped interior and inferior mobility due to an overhanging nose section, which had been designed to crush through the belts of barbed wire but in practice caused the tank to get stuck. Improved designs were almost immediately initiated but the production of these, the Schneider CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4, was eventually cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Tatum arrived off Okinawa's Hagushi beaches on 19 May and {{reported}} for duty with the antiaircraft and antisubmarine pickets stationed around the island. At dusk on 29 May, the warship was proceeding to her radar picket station {{when she was}} attacked by four enemy planes. As the first intruder swooped in across her bow, Tatums guns opened up and scored hits on his wing and fuselage. He banked sharply {{and headed for the}} ship's starboard side. About 40feet from her, the plane's left wing and tail struck the water, jarring loose his bomb. It skipped off the surface, struck and careened off the underside of a gun <b>sponson,</b> and pierced Tatums hull and two of her longitudinal bulkheads. The dud came to rest with its nose protruding eight inches into the passageway inboard of the executive officer's stateroom. The plane also skimmed over the water into Tatum, dented her hull, and knocked out her director fire control and communications with the engine room.|$|E
5000|$|The A.33 was a four-engined flying-boat with a parasol {{monospar}} wing, {{the wing}} {{was supported by}} two angled N-struts which connected the wing to hull-mounted <b>sponsons.</b> The hull-mounted <b>sponsons</b> were used rather than wingtip floats and were also used as fuel tanks. A Saro Cloud was modified with a monospar wing and <b>sponsons</b> to test the design concepts. The A.33 serial number K4773 first flew on 14 October 1938. However, the A33 prototype was written off after structural failure sustained during high-speed taxi trials on 25 October 1938 and development was abandoned. [...] A production contract for eleven aircraft was cancelled.|$|R

500|$|The two Wyomings, {{along with}} the Floridas and New Yorks were heavily modernized in the 1920s. All six ships were {{converted}} to completely oil-fired boilers with equipment taken from the cancelled South Dakota-class battleships. The boilers were trunked into a single funnel. These boilers were much more efficient than the coal-fired models the ships had been completed with, and they allowed a significantly greater cruising radius of [...] The ships were also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, which improved their underwater defense and also provided additional oil storage capacity. Wyoming and Arkansas lost their cage main mast, which {{was replaced by a}} short tripod mast that carried searchlights and radio antennas. Some of their secondary battery guns were relocated higher in the ship to improve their workability in heavy seas. A <b>sponson</b> for six guns was built into the hull abreast of the conning tower and the eight 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were moved {{to the top of the}} <b>sponson.</b> Both ships had their torpedo tubes removed.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{the machine}} gun mounted {{coaxially}} to the main gun, there were three [...]30 cal. machine guns in the hull. One was mounted in a ball mount {{in front of the}} bow gunner. The other two were mounted in fixed <b>sponson</b> mounts. The machine guns were fired by the driver; they were aimed by pointing the entire tank at the desired target. Another [...]30 cal machine gun was normally mounted {{on the top of the}} turret for anti-aircraft defense.|$|E
500|$|Sometime after Bronenosets was completed, {{an armored}} ring, [...] thick and [...] tall, was fitted {{around the base}} of the turret to prevent {{splinters}} from jamming it. Later, an armored, outward-curving [...] was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there. Three sponsons were later added, probably during the 1870s, to the upper portion of the turret. Each <b>sponson,</b> one above the gun ports and one on each side of the turret, mounted a light gun, probably a [...] Engstrem gun, for defense against torpedo boats. A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a hurricane deck was built between the funnel and the turret, also probably during the 1870s.|$|E

500|$|Courageous {{received}} a dual-purpose armament of sixteen QF 4.7-inch Mk VIII guns in single HA Mark XII mounts. Each {{side of the}} lower flight deck had a mount, and two were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed {{along the sides of}} the ship. During refits in the mid-1930s, Courageous received three quadruple Mk VII mounts for [...] 2-pounder [...] "pom-pom" [...] anti-aircraft guns, two of which were transferred from the battleship [...] [...] Each side of the flying-off deck had a mount, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one was behind the island on the flight deck. [...] She also received four water-cooled [...]50-calibre Mk III anti-aircraft machine guns in a single quadruple mounting. This was placed in a <b>sponson</b> on the port side aft.|$|E

These newer guns also had a longer range, of [...] Two guns were placed {{side by side on}} the forecastle, two on each broadsideone in a <b>sponson</b> and the other in a gun portand two {{side by side on the}} quarterdeck. Geier did not use sponsons for the second pair of guns, instead simply mounting them on the upper deck. The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon. The first five ships were also equipped with two [...] torpedo tubes, both of which were mounted on the deck. Geier instead had larger [...] torpedo tubes. Each ship carried five torpedoes.|$|E
500|$|Nagato {{was briefly}} fitted with an [...] {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on No. 2 turret in August 1925. Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata and Heinkel HD 25 floatplanes were tested from {{it before it}} was removed early the following year. An additional boom {{was added to the}} mainmasts of both ships in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y then assigned to them. A Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 floatplane was tested aboard Nagato that same year. A catapult was fitted between the mainmast and No. 3 turret in mid-1933, a collapsible crane was installed in a portside <b>sponson,</b> and the ships were equipped to operate two or three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The sisters began to operate Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938.

500|$|Before Devers' arrival, Armored Force {{doctrine}} emphasized light tanks weighing no {{more than}} [...] American doctrine held that tanks were for exploitation, not fighting other tanks. He rejected the M6 heavy tank and recommended to McNair that it be cancelled, citing its tremendous weight and concerns about its mobility and reliability. This was seen as support for this position, but Devers wanted a medium tank, preferably mounting something like a 105mm howitzer. He was appalled {{to find that the}} Armored Force's tanks were armed with nothing heavier than a 37mm gun. A new medium tank was beginning to come off the production line: the M3 Lee. Devers observed testing of one just days after taking command, and was unimpressed. American industry was unable to cast a turret large enough to hold a 75mm gun, so the M3 carried a 37mm gun, with a 75mm in a <b>sponson.</b> This gave it a limited traverse, rendering it difficult to engage moving targets. To make matters worse, the designers shortened the barrel to improve the M3's mobility, which Devers realized also reduced the gun's muzzle velocity, and hence its effectiveness against armor. In practice, M3 crews attempted to engage German armor with the 75mm, as the 37mm was ineffective against it. It was found that the 75mm could penetrate the frontal armor of German tanks at , but German tanks destroyed M3s at up to [...] Devers pronounced the M3 [...] "overweight, underpowered, and insufficiently armed".|$|E

2500|$|The quite thick (13.5%) wings were fabric {{covered over}} a metal frame. They were of {{constant}} chord out to gently curved tips, each carrying two ailerons. [...] The three 400hp (298kW) V-12 water-cooled Hispano Suiza 12 Jb engines were mounted close together {{on top of}} the wing and out of the spray in well-streamlined cowlings; those of the forward-facing outer engines slimmed finely to the trailing edge. [...] Each engine drove a two-bladed propeller. Flat radiators were placed {{on the underside of the}} upper wing, beneath each motor. The primary attachment of the wings was not to the fuselage but to the <b>sponson</b> tips, by two pairs of parallel steel struts to mid-wing.
