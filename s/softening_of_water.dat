30|$|Precipitation is a {{technique}} of removing one or more substances from a solution by adding reagents so that insoluble solids appear. The ‘solubility’ rules the technique, i.e., when the product of ion concentrations (in simple) in the solution over the solubility product of the respective solid, the precipitation occurs.

The treated water is reused whereas the settled portion is dewatered and disposed of.

40|$|A modern {{technique}} for desalination or <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{is the so-called}} nano ltration by means of membranes which carry a xed electric charge. For the mathematical modeling of such processes, two features are particularly important. Firstly, the distribution of ionic species generates an electric eld which in turn aects the uxes of these ions. Therefore, besides diusion and convection, electromigration {{has to be taken}} into account. This also leads to a strong coupling of the concentrations of all charged species, which can often be adequately incorporated into the model via the assumption of electroneutrality. Secondly, electrical double-layers (Donnan potential) build up at the surface of the membrane, which cause discontinuities in the ionic concentration pro les. We deduce a mathematical model for such a nano ltration process. This leads to a strongly coupled quasilinear parabolic system with nonlinear transmission and dynamical boundary conditions. By means of degree theory we obtain existence of stationary solutions, while L -maximal regularity is employed to get local strong wellposedness of this model.

30|$|The {{process of}} caustic {{embrittlement}} occurs in boilers {{and leads to}} formation of cracks on the riveted mild steel plates. The temperature ranges from 200 to 250  °C, which further leads to deposition of concentrated hydroxide on the waterside of the boiler [46]. We can also explain caustic embrittlement as a phenomenon where boiler becomes brittle, due to accumulation of caustic soda [47]. Caustic embrittlement {{is also known as}} stress corrosion cracking [46]. Caustic embrittlement is caused due to the presence of caustic soda in the boiler feed water, which is in direct contact with the steel and drums of the boiler [48]. In the boiler, when the water evaporates, the concentration of sodium carbonate increases. Sodium carbonate is used for the <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> via. lime soda process. During this process, there are chances that some of the sodium carbonate particles may be left behind. With the passage of time, the concentration of sodium carbonate increases, and it undergoes hydrolysis to form sodium hydroxide. When the concentration of sodium hydroxide increases by a certain amount, it makes water alkaline. This alkaline water enters into small cracks of inner walls of the boiler. Evaporation of this water leads to a continuous increase in the amount of sodium hydroxide present in the boiler tubes. This sodium hydroxide attacks the iron present on the boilers and dissolves it; thus, forming sodium ferrate, which further leads to caustic embrittlement [49].|$|E

The {{access road}} slope of Shuiluo River 500 KV {{transmission}} project has a loose earth-rock structure {{which is in}} a continuous state of slight creep deformation in natural conditions. Road construction period was coincided with the rainy season. On August 18, 2011, after several days of continuous rain, dramatic deformation of engineering slope occurred in the road K 0 + 305 ~ K 0 + 345 segment. Gradually a sliding deformation body was formed that vertical length is about 80 m, horizontal width is 30 ~ 50 m, {{the front and back}} edge height difference is 50 m, the total volume is about 6. 0 million m 3. Finite element numerical simulation and limit equilibrium calculation show that the overall deformation and local landslide collapse of the engineering slope was caused by two factors: paring slope and concentrated rainfall. On the one hand, the position of engineering slope was mainly in the anti-sliding section of the potential sliding body, slope excavation reduced the effective stabilizing force; On the other hand, construction was coincided with the period of concentrated rainfall, groundwater level raised significantly due to excess supply of rainfall (120 mm/d), the state of slip soil changed from unsaturated to saturated.

40|$|Abstract. The most {{important}} challenge for concrete technologists {{is to improve}} the properties of concrete. In the last two decades, in Russia and China, a new technology, called magnetic water technology, has been used in the concrete industry. In this technology, by passing water through a magnetic eld, some of its physical properties change and, as a result of such changes, the number of molecules in the water cluster decrease from 13 to 5 or 6, which causes a decrease in the water surface tension. Using magnetized water in concrete mixtures causes an improvement in the workability and compressive strength of concrete. Also, this processed water causes a reduction in the cement content required for the speci ed compressive strength value. In this research, in the concrete laboratory of Sahand University of Technology, the eects of magnetic water on some mechanical properties of high strength concrete, such as workability and compressive strength, have been studied. For the production of magnetic water, a magnetic treatment device (made in Germany) has been used. This device mostly is used for the <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and, for the rst time in this research, it has been used by the authors for the production of concrete. The results of tests showed that, in most cases, concrete made with magnetic water (magnetic concrete), has higher slump values than those of control concrete (up to 45 %). Also in some cases, the compressive strength of the magnetic concrete samples was higher than that of the control concrete samples (up to 18 %). Also, in some cases, with the same slump and compressive strength, cement content can be reduced by 28 % in the case of magnetic concrete...|$|E

Test results show that: 1. When the samples without immersion secondly load until complete failure, ultimate strain increases slightly than the first loading, of which the increasing value is 7. 5 %; elastic modulus has a relatively large reduction than the first, which reduces 22. 8 %; deformation modulus has a less reduction, which is about 3. 3 %; 2.

Model results clearly indicated the potential of high value crops and more efficient irrigation technology to <b>soften</b> the impact <b>of</b> <b>water</b> shortages. Furthermore infrastructure, the financial position of the farmer and the level of risk averseness have significantly impacted on the results. Policy makers and government authorities should take cognizance of these factors when evaluating water use efficiency and <b>water</b> management plans <b>of</b> different <b>water</b> user associations. Improvements in the adopted modeling procedure are also made. Dynamic Linear Programming, risk, irrigation, feasibility, South Africa, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, C 6, Q 15, Q 12,...|$|R
