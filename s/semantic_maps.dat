40|$|<b>Semantic</b> <b>maps</b> {{have offered}} {{linguists}} an appealing and empirically rooted methodology for describing recurrent structural {{patterns in language}} development and the multifunctionality of grammatical categories. Although some researchers argue that <b>semantic</b> <b>maps</b> are universal and given, others provide evidence {{that there are no}} fixed or universal maps. This paper takes the position that <b>semantic</b> <b>maps</b> are a useful way to visualize the grammatical evolution of a language (particularly the evolution of semantic structuring) but that this grammatical evolution is a consequence of distributed processes whereby language users shape and reshape their language. So it is a challenge to find out what these processes are and whether they indeed generate the kind of <b>semantic</b> <b>maps</b> observed for human languages. This work takes a design stance towards the question of the emergence of linguistic structure and investigates how grammar can be formed in populations of autonomous artificial ?agents? that play ?language games? with each other about situations they perceive through a sensori-motor embodiment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if instructing secondary learning disabled students in how to use <b>semantic</b> <b>maps</b> and requiring the students to use <b>semantic</b> <b>maps</b> to study a passage would affect the recall of the passage after a 24 hour delay. An attempt was also made to determine if using a sequential list of the main points of the passage would affect delayed recall in the same positive way as did the use of the <b>semantic</b> <b>maps.</b> Four secondary learning disabled students who evidenced difficulty in recalling prose material after a 24 hour delay were selected for this study. A multiple baseline design across subjects using a multiple probe technique was used in this study. During baseline, students read a prose passage and were told to study it as they usually studied for a test since they would be asked questions about the passage the following day. Twenty-four hours later students were read 10 short-answer questions and their answers were recorded. Each student was in turn trained to use a semantic map to study a prose passage after reading it. When students exhibited Proficiency in using the <b>semantic</b> <b>maps,</b> daily assessments ofrecall were again made. Results showed that each of the four students recalled substantially more items when using the semantic map than during baseline. A changing elements design was then used to determine if using a sequential list of the main items from the passage would result in the same high recall scores which resulted from using the <b>semantic</b> <b>maps.</b> The results from this part of the study were inconclusive. It was concluded that training in the use of <b>semantic</b> <b>maps</b> and the requirement that a semantic map be used for study, resulted in increased recall for the secondary leaning disabled students in this study.

The background of the research {{was based on the}} phenomenon of students’ difficulties in reading comprehension. This thesis is intended to answer the following research questions: (1) How is the implementation of <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> strategy in improving students’ reading comprehension in narrative text? (2) How is the implementation of thinking aloud strategy in improving students’ reading comprehension in narrative text? (3) How is the improvement of students’ achievement in narrative text after being taught by using <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> and thinking aloud strategy? (4) How is the students’ engagement in joining English lesson by using <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> and thinking aloud strategy? Those research questions discussed through classroom action research in SMP Nurul Islam Semarang. The data was gotten from classroom observation, test, and documentation. The data was analyzed by using descriptive analysis. This research shows that: (1) the implementation of <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> seemed to be more interesting and amusing. In the first cycle, the teacher gave a narrative text to the students and gave them the important words based on the text. Then, students were asked to categorize the words based on their part of speech.

(2) The implementation of thinking aloud strategy to improve students’ reading comprehension in narrative text was applied after <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> in every cycle. In the first cycle, after the students did <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping,</b> they were asked to answer some comprehensive questions based on the text in oral.

40|$|<b>Semantic</b> <b>maps</b> {{are usually}} assumed to {{describe}} a universal arrangement of different conceptual situations in a speaker's mind as determined by perceived relations of similarity between these conceptual situations. This paper provides a number of arguments that challenge this view, based on various types of evidence from processes of semantic change and synchronic implicational universals. The multifunctionality patterns described by <b>semantic</b> <b>maps</b> may originate from processes of form-function recombination in particular contexts rather than any perceived similarity between individual conceptual components.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} need to define a <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> from a {{database}} schema to an ontology. Such a mapping {{is an integral part}} of the data integration systems that use an ontology as a unified global view. However, both ontologies and database schemas evolve over time in order to accommodate updated information needs. Once the ontology and the database schema associated with a <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> evolved, it is necessary and important to maintain the validity of the <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> to reflect the new semantics in the ontology and the schema. In this paper, we propose a formulation of the mapping maintenance problem and outline a possible solution using illustrative examples. The main points of this paper are: (1) to differentiate the <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> maintenance problem from the schema mapping adaptation problem which only adapts mappings when schemas change; (2) to develop an approach for specifying the validity of a <b>semantic</b> <b>mapping</b> in terms of two-way legal instances translation between two models; (3) to explore the approach of using simple correspondences to capture changes to ontologies/schemas; and (4) to sketch a solution using examples. ...|$|R
