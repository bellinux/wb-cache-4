50|$|The best studied {{interaction}} between animals and Persoonia species is {{that between the}} plants and their pollinators. All species that have been studied in detail {{have been found to}} be pollinated by a variety of native bees, but especially species of Leioproctus subgenus Cladocerapis (Colletidae), which rarely visit any plants but Persoonia. The behaviour of these bees on Persoonia flowers is quite predictable. Both males and females alight on the cross-shaped “platform” formed by the recurved anther tips, orient themselves to be facing one of the anther/tepals, then <b>slide,</b> <b>face</b> first, down between the anther and the style to reach the two glands at either side of the base of the tepal, and drink the nectar from them. Females gather pollen grains with their legs while drinking nectar. The insect then withdraws to the top of the flower, makes a 180° turn, then repeats the process on the other side of the flower. Another species group in Leioproctus, subgenus Filiglossa, also specialises in feeding on Persoonia flowers but these smaller bees seem to be nectar and pollen “thieves”, not effective pollinators. The introduced honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also a frequent visitor of Persoonia flowers at most sites but it is still unclear whether this species is an effective pollinator.The fleshy fruits of Persoonia species are clearly adapted for animal dispersal but it is still unclear whether mammals such as possums and wallabies, or large flying birds such as currawongs are the most important dispersers. Parrots, also feed on Persoonia fruits, but the fruit (and seed) they eat are unripe, and hence their interaction with the plants is predatory rather than symbiotic.|$|E

On {{the basis}} of {{analysis}} on the geological environment of highway loess landslide, three in-situ loess samples, 500 mm× 600 mm× 600 mm, were cut on the shear crack of landslide. The residual shear experiment of soil samples were accomplished in native state and saturated case. Compared with the residual cohesive force and residual internal friction angle of <b>slide</b> <b>face</b> soil in native state by indoor shear experiment, that of landslide shear crack soil in saturated state by in situ shear experiment is grater with the degree of 12. 25 % and 29. 38 %.

40|$|It is very {{important}} for mine production safety to ensure the stability of the tailings dam. Taking a flatland tailings pond as the background, a threedimensional computational model was built based on a tailings dam under mullock heap preloading condition. Considering the current operating water level conditions, a liquid-solid coupling analysis of the model was conducted. The deformation characteristics of the tailings dam were revealed during successive preloading {{at the front of the}} dam. The safety factor and the potential <b>slide</b> <b>face</b> of the tailings dam were calculated under different conditions using the strength reduction method. The results show that the tailings dam in its current condition is basically stable, but if the mullock heap continues to be heightened, the tailings dam will become unstable. Therefore, in order to limit the height of the mullock heap, establishing a monitor and early warning mechanism are put forward to ensure mine production safety...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} this project {{demonstrate}} the potential of short-pulsed, frequency multiplied solid-state lasers of high beam quality for high precision and damage free machining of ceramic materials. To reach high quality results {{it is necessary to}} use material specific laser parameters and processing strategies. Regarding the processing strategies for material removal there are different methods of moving the laser beam relative to the workpiece: moving in the contour with constant repetition rate, moving in the contour with constant pulse overlap, on-the-fly. The processing strategy 'moving in the contour with constant pulse overlap' revealed to be best suited to reach a plain structure with low roughness. Using this processing technology it was possible to manufacture precision inductors by generating air gaps into the middle leg of an ferrite ceramic inductor core. Moreover, the functional characteristics of bearings and seals out of SiC-ceramic could be improved by structuring the <b>slide</b> <b>face.</b> Besides this, cutting of PTFE-materials to separate sensors or circuits was demonstrated successfully.

40|$|Abstract. The huge Donghekou {{landslide}} {{was triggered}} by the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 with about 2. 4 × 107 m 3 of rock displaced. The landslide is considered as an exam-ple of an earthquake-induced “ejection ” event, where dis-located slope materials was expelled over {{a section of the}} slope, but the kinematic processes are not well understood. We used the 2 -D granular discrete element method to char-acterize the kinematic behavior and mechanics of this “ejec-tion landslide”. The initial boundary conditions were applied along the ball–wall contacts by using derived velocities inte-grated from strong motion data with a duration of 125 s, in-cluding the peak acceleration near the Donghekou area. The constraints were primarily determined from the final geom-etry of the landslide and geological structures to account for the actual landslide characteristics. Simulated results showed that the large local seismic acceleration and a free face un-der the sliding body, caused by the dip difference between the upper <b>slide</b> <b>face</b> and the natural slope, originated from the activation of the landslide. For the lower sliding body, its kinematic mechanism was changed during sliding. Initially it was a push-type landslide, and then gradually changed to a retrogressive landslide. The eroded bed on the slope dur-ing the landslide had the potential of slightly increasing the runout distance from 1435 to 1519 m, and was predicted in the numerical simulation. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{comparisons}} of performance characteristics between the super-mirror face grinding machine using variable air pressure developed in this laboratory to grind precisely the <b>sliding</b> <b>face</b> of a surface hardened workpiece with thermal spray and the conventional one are investigated {{by measuring the}} surface roughness and hardness for a SCM 440. To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed grinding machine can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror face by grinding precisely the <b>sliding</b> <b>face</b> with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror face grinding machine using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more grinding machines attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror face grinding machine for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror face grinding machine for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height. It is also found that the surface hardness of both the conventional and the super-mirror face grinding machines are increased as the particle size of diamond wheel is reduced...|$|R
