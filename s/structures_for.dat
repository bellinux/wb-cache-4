5|$|Many {{species have}} {{developed}} specialized hyphal <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> nutrient uptake from living hosts; examples include haustoria in plant-parasitic species of most fungal phyla, and arbuscules of several mycorrhizal fungi, which penetrate into the host cells to consume nutrients.|$|E

5|$|A {{more recent}} proposal, the exomembrane hypothesis, {{suggests}} that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.|$|E
5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous species (such as certain scarab beetles in the Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species (such as the carrion beetles, Silphidae). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many beetles feed under bark, some feed on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some beetles have special mycangia, <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> the transport of fungal spores.|$|E

5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated {{that a third of}} all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

Major {{damage to the}} belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems. The fluid which remained in the fourth system gave the captain very limited control {{of some of the}} spoilers, ailerons, and one inboard elevator. That was sufficient to circle the plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a hard landing. There were no fatalities, but there were some injuries.|$|E

50|$|Linus Pauling {{discovered}} the chemical structure of protein and proposed a completely wrong <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> DNA, which carries hereditary information from parent to offspring. Pauling guessed a wrong <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> DNA because he assumed that {{a pattern that}} worked for protein would also work for DNA.

5|$|Insectivorous insects, or {{insects that}} feed on other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human <b>structures.</b> <b>For</b> example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs feed on aphids, {{and can be used}} as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels through {{different}} galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a boss, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> the player to explore. Each astronomical object has its own gravitational force, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or upside down. The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{surrounded}} on four sides {{by a series}} of walled cloisters, with seven different gates.

Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief.

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> technological uses. In this field, nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells.

The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's most {{important}} patrons were the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall, Cheshire. In 1865 he was commissioned {{to design the}} entrance lodge and other <b>structures</b> <b>for</b> Grosvenor Park in Chester, and StJohn's Church {{in the village of}} Aldford in the Eaton Hall estate for Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster. When the marquess died in 1869 he was succeeded by his son Hugh Grosvenor, 1stDuke of Westminster. Douglas received a large number of commissions from the 1st Duke and from his son, the 2nd Duke, throughout his career. It is estimated that for the 1stDuke alone he designed four churches and chapels, eight parsonages and large houses, about 15schools, around 50farms (in whole or in part), about 300cottages, lodges and smithies, two factories, two inns and about 12commercial buildings on the Eaton Hall estate alone. He also designed buildings on the duke's Halkyn estate in Flintshire, including another church.|$|E
