5|$|Major modern {{economic}} statistics, such as {{unemployment and}} GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> other factors.|$|E
40|$|Given {{conflicting}} theoretical {{predictions about}} the impact of <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> banks on economic growth, this paper empirically evaluates this debate. The results emphasize the growth-enhancing role of <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> banks. Chile is clearly an outlier; it has less liquid <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> lower levels of banking development than other rapidly growing countries. The paper then compares Chile’s commercial bank regulatory and supervisory system with other countries and highlights some areas worthy of further study. ...|$|R
30|$|This paper also {{focuses on}} {{different}} types of interdependence between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> government bond <b>markets</b> in the same region. First, the interdependence between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the bond <b>markets</b> in the same region {{is much more important}} than the interdependence across different regions (Baur and Lucey 2009). Second, the paper investigates the interdependence between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the bond <b>markets</b> in 39 countries. The samples already cover approximately 80 % of the global GDP, and therefore, it can be concluded that this paper’s analysis is reliable. The interdependence across different regions may result in an overly complicated analysis. In addition, over recent years the interdependence between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the bond <b>markets</b> has become quite valuable because the debt crisis {{is one of the most}} important parts in the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. The financial derivatives or the real estate markets are less liquid and important than government bond markets in most of the emerging markets. Thus, in this paper, our analysis emphasizes the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the government bond markets in 39 countries.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, as {{indicated}} by (UN 1999), an important factor characterising African markets is a very low correlation existing between the African <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the major world <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> also between the African markets themselves. The Ghana <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> is no different and is therefore hardly affected by movements on the international <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> This makes analysis performed on the stock index very peculiar to the Ghanaian market.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E

30|$|In the {{robustness}} test, the crisis period is defined using data and statistics {{instead of the}} pre-decided definition, which makes the estimation of Formula (2) more significant. In addition, the directions of the coefficients {{are consistent with the}} previous results. To be specific, in most of the developed markets, the flight to quality occurred between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the short-term government bond markets. However, in the emerging markets, there was little flight to quality evident between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the short-term government bond markets. In certain emerging Asian markets, the flight to quality was seldom evident between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the long-term government bond markets. Second, {{with the exception of the}} developed American market, there is significant negative spillover between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the long-term government bond markets. This is in line with the previous conclusions.|$|R

30|$|Firstly, {{using the}} Markov-switching method, this work tests whether the {{interdependence}} between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the government bond markets {{occurred during the}} Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. A sudden increase in correlations during the crises would prove significant interdependence between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the government bond markets. Secondly, this work clarifies all kinds of interdependence by measuring the flight to quality, the flight from quality, the negative spillover and the positive spillover {{in conjunction with the}} different changing directions of interdependence. This work also summarizes the features of interdependence between the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> government bond <b>markets</b> in various regions. Lastly, the characteristics of the interdependence in the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis are also mentioned, respectively.|$|R
40|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>markets</b> {{strive to}} provide an {{efficient}} trading platform for investors. Trading rules and mechanisms issued to accomplish this differ among <b>stock</b> <b>markets,</b> <b>and</b> are subject to modification over time. Furthermore, market participants assume {{a broad range of}} roles and trading strategies. Such variation poses problems to those involved in the study of market dynamics, when developing an artificial <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> for experimentation <b>and</b> analysis. More than once, the resulting artificial <b>stock</b> <b>markets,</b> <b>and</b> thus the experimental results, are based on very restrictive assumptions. This paper introduces an agent-based framework for artificial <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> development <b>and</b> experimentation. The framework is flexible in the sense that multiple market structures are supported, and an infinite range of trading strategies by market participants can be captured. Such features are accomplished through the configuration of framework properties, and the appropriate hooks for extension of the framework’s components. ...|$|R
25|$|Exchange-traded {{funds that}} invest in bonds are known as bond ETFs. They thrive during {{economic}} recessions because investors pull their {{money out of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> into bonds (for example, government treasury bonds or those issued by companies regarded as financially stable). Because of this cause and effect relationship, the performance of bond ETFs may be indicative of broader economic conditions. There are several advantages to bond ETFs such as the reasonable trading commissions, but this benefit can be negatively offset by fees if bought and sold through a third party.|$|E

25|$|Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{there was}} no {{regulation}} of securities at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data. To avoid another Wall Street Crash, the Securities Act of 1933 was enacted. It required the disclosure of the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, the names and compensations of corporate officers, about firms whose securities were traded. Additionally those reports had to be verified by independent auditors. In 1934 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was established to regulate the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> prevent corporate abuses relating to the sale of securities and corporate reporting.|$|E
