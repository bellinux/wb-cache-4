40|$|Discussions {{related to}} the adverse impacts {{associated}} with shore armor (i. e. seawalls and riprap) are a common topic within the coastal community. While many agree that the installation of these structures alters the shores geomorphic response, there is disagreement in the type and degree of response. Furthermore, studies that have delved into this topic have been conducted in numerous settings but have been confounded {{by a lack of}} data regarding shore morphologies prior to installation of these structures. At Yellowstone National Park, there is an opportunity to assess the impacts of shore armor quantitatively because the National Park Service requires detailed surveys in advance of all infrastructure improvement projects in an effort to determine the overall impacts of these projects on park environments relative to their benefits to park visitors and employees. The purpose of this study then was to contribute to this ongoing discussion of adverse impacts from shore armor by monitoring several non-engineered and engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> along the <b>shore</b> of Yellowstone Lake. For the purposes of this study, all <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> that possessed <b>shore</b> armor (i. e. a seawall or riprap) were referred to as an engineered beach while any shore lacking a seawall or riprap was classified as a non-engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segment.</b> This study began with an effort to determine if there were geomorphic differences between several non-engineered and engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> located along the western and northern shore of Yellowstone Lake. This effort was accomplished by measuring cross-shore profiles, dry-beach widths and conducting a grain size analysis of the dry-beach sediments. Results from the initial survey conducted in July-August 2005 established that there were significant geomorphic differences between the non-engineered and engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> of Yellowstone Lake. Visual observations combined with surveyed cross-shore profiles, grain size analyses and dry-beach width measurements revealed that the non-engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> were indeed geomorphically different from the engineered segments. That is, the non-engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> displayed relatively wider beaches composed of sand to fine gravel with gently sloping profiles whereas the engineered shores were typified with angular L-shaped profiles with narrow dry-beach faces. In addition to the geomorphic differences, visual observations and analysis of the data revealed that the engineered shores were indeed adversely impacted by the shore armor through the processes of placement loss and profile deflation. A repeat survey was then conducted in the summers of 2006 and 2007 to determine the short-term variability of these non-engineered and engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments.</b> Three years of data with a two-year interval indicated that there was a consistent difference in the geomorphology of the non-engineered and engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments.</b> These differences were reflected in the cross-shore profile, the volume, and the dry beach width for all four study sites. In addition to these consistent differences, analysis of the data showed that the non-engineered shore cross-shore profiles fluctuated about a mean shape, whereas the volumetric calculations and dry-beach measurements showed that both the non-engineered and engineered shores experience annual variability in their shore morphologies. Insight into the short-term variability was an essential component for the third portion of the study, which was an investigation into the long-term response of the shore to the engineering efforts along the shore of Yellowstone Lake. The third and final phase of this research was a long-term study of the shore responses to shore armor at Yellowstone Lake. This aspect of the study was intriguing because very few long-term studies focused specifically on shore responses to shore engineering exist. The methodology of this study incorporated the use of Historical GIS techniques to extract quantifiable data from construction drawings in order to be compared with the contemporary data collected from 2005 to 2007. Results revealed that, while both the non-engineered and engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> experienced a decrease in volume, the volumetric decrease was more pronounced for the non-engineered shores. The engineered shores indicated a smaller amount of volumetric change, suggesting that passive erosional processes and placement loss has had a long-term impact on the engineered shores in that the engineered structures have fixed the shoreline at these segments while the non-engineered shores are still able to adjust to changing conditions. Upon completion of this dissertation research, it was concluded that the engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> of Yellowstone Lake exhibit morphological features similar to those associated with hard stabilization of marine and Great Lakes coastal settings and are suggestive of enhanced erosion and shore degradation at engineered shore sites when compared to adjacent non-engineered <b>shore</b> <b>segments.</b> Ongoing monitoring and repeat annual surveys of study sites enhance understanding of shore zone processes at Yellowstone Lake. Furthermore, results from this study may also aid in developing alternative strategies for protecting lakeside infrastructure {{while at the same time}} conserving lakeshore resources and preserving the quality of visitor experiences at Yellowstone Lake...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of physical processes occurring at two different coasts, which belong to two different geographic zones, namely a subtropical region exposed to monsoons and typhoons and {{a region of}} temperate climate with ice-snowy winter season. The former coast comprises sandy shores nearby Lubiatowo and the Hel Peninsula, located at the south Baltic Sea in Poland. The shore at Lubiatowo is relatively stable in the long run, while the shore along Hel Peninsula is mostly vulnerable to erosion and strongly protected by use of various measures (groins, seawall and artificial beach nourishment). The second site is the eroded (and partly protected by dikes) coast at Hai Hau in the Gulf of Tonkin (the South China Sea, Vietnam). This <b>shore</b> <b>segment</b> is built of mixtures of sandy and cohesive material, comprising both marine sands and river-borne sediments which nourish the coastal zone at the Red River mouth, located northwards of the Hai Hau beach. The present analysis is focused on differences and similarities of hydro- and morphodynamics between the above coastal zones in various time and spatial scales. The analysis shows that regional climatic and environmental conditions, associated with geographical zones, {{play a key role}} in dynamic evolution of the coastal regions and necessitate different engineering activities against erosion and flooding.

The results show: (1) Qinzhou Bay coastal morphology change degree was strong in 2006 - 2012 and the coastline changed greatly. Originally part of the natural <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> which had twists and turns were gradually filled into artificial coast, the coast constantly advanced to the sea, coastline became regular and straight; (2) The change degree of coastline was relatively small in 2006 - 2008, the average artificial coastline increased 8. 86 km/a, the average artificial reclamation area was 20. 79 km 2 /a; in 2008 - 2012, the change range of coastline was the greatest, coastline changed most severely, the average artificial coastline increased 16. 07 km/a, the average artificial reclamation area was 58. 52 km 2 /a; however, in 2012 - 2014, coastline change degree relatively slowed, the average artificial coastline increased 4. 04 km per year, the average artificial reclamation area was 3. 464 km 2 /a.

Although wildfire is {{the main}} natural disturbance factor driving changes in the North American boreal forest, understanding how the fire history of the last millennium shaped the present-day landscape diversity is a difficult task {{due to the lack}} of palaeoecological reconstructions with high spatial (few hundreds of square metres) and temporal (annual) resolutions. 2. We combined a detailed inventory of the present-day lakeshore forest of two lakes of the Eastern Canadian taiga with the dendrochronological dating of the subfossil logs that accumulated in the lit-toral zones facing these shores. Our objective was to compare the millennial impact of wildfires among stands of various structures and compositions. Past stem densities and fire years were reconstructed from log recruitment rates and dating of charred logs. 3. Multivariate analysis of the present-day lakeshore forest revealed three and two homogeneous <b>shore</b> <b>segments</b> per site (i. e. clusters). Cluster 1 at both sites exhibited denser forest, higher dead wood values and a higher percentage of balsam fir, a fire-sensitive species. 4. In total, 426 and 611 subfossil logs (mostly black spruce) were crossdated over the last ~ 1400 years. Their dendrochronological analysis confirmed that each lakeshore cluster, identified from the traits of the present-day forest, experienced a specific fire history over the last millennium (i. e. 0 – 5 fires of variable severity) that locally influenced forest composition, tree density and growth. Each fire triggered a specific forest structure trajectory characterized by a different stem density and rate of recovery. 5. Synthesis. This study provides a long-term perspective that helps explain how the present-day landscape diversity in the Eastern Canadian taiga reflects the site-specific fire history over the last millennium. Fires have caused persistent and cumulative impacts resulting in a progressive opening of the forest cover along with balsam fir exclusion. Present-day landscapes are mosaics of forest stands characterized by different times since fire and different post-fire forest structure trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to improve our understanding of how changes in the environment affect ecological processes. Change detection is often confounded by the large variation found in ecological data due to the difficulty of finding replicates in nature. Intertidal communities were chosen for studies of biophysical interactions because the physical gradients are very strong, thus creating complex systems within spatial scales that are easily sampled. The selection of replicate beach habitats was the first step in designing a sampling protocol for comparative analyses of nearshore community structure. A high resolution shoreline partitioning model was developed to quantify the physical attributes of homogeneous shoreline segments and to statistically cluster replicate segments. This model was applied at 3 locations in Washington State. A portion of the south shore of San Juan Island was partitioned and the physical attributes quantified. Three groups of rocky segments differing only in slope angle were selected for biological sampling. The objective was to test the fidelity of macroalgal and invertebrate populations to replicate bedrock <b>shore</b> <b>segments.</b> The results showed that community structure and population abundances were more similar within groups of replicate segments (similar slopes) than among groups (different slopes). In South Puget Sound, community structure was compared to test for a deterministic organization of communities among replicate soft sediment beaches in an estuary. The results showed that replicate beach segments support similar communities, that communities become less similar as the distance between replicates increases, and that replicates within or among nearshore cells with similar temperature and salinity support communities that are more similar than replicates among cells with different water properties regardless of distance. On the outer Olympic coast, community comparisons were made among 9 sand beaches over a shoreline distance of 250 km. The results show that these communities are similar within segments and within nearshore cells, but because of population abundance fluctuations, the communities were different among cells and among years. This study shows that processes determining patterns in nearshore habitats can be quantified, which is a significant contribution to studies of habitat distribution and the siting of marine preserves...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{shoreline}} responses immediately shoreward of two adjacent schemes of <b>segmented</b> <b>shore</b> parallel rubble mound breakwaters undergoing the same forcing by waves and tides. Scheme one {{consists of four}} longer, emergent breakwaters that have produced tidal tombolos in their lee. Scheme two consists of five shorter, lower breakwaters that are submerged at higher tides with salients in the breakwater's lee. Empirical orthogonal function {{analysis was used to}} decompose a video derived shoreline dataset into the dominant modes of shoreline change for both schemes. The two schemes showed similar modes of change. The primary mode of change for both schemes was the cross-shore growth and shrinking of the salients/tombolos. The secondary mode of change was the longshore movement of the salients/tombolos. For all modes of change, the dominant length scale was dictated by the breakwater dimensions and locations. A new manifestation of hydrodynamic parameters is introduced: the cumulative integral of the de-meaned parameters. This parameterisation allowed for meaningful correlation of the temporal EOF components with forcing parameters and identification of the important influence of the tide on observed morphodynamic change. Clear differences were observed between the shoreline responses measured in schemes one and two; including differences in bay erosion/accretion; and the longshore translation of salients/tombolos. The beaches in scheme two showed behavioural patterns similar to unprotected beaches which were not observable in scheme one. It is postulated that these differences are caused both by the different breakwater designs and by variation in longshore sediment supply...|$|R
