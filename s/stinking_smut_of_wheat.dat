40|$|Hill bunt or <b>stinking</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> is a seed borne {{disease of}} wheat {{in the hills}} of Uttaranchal. It is caused by Tilletia foetida (wallr) Liro and T. caries (D. C.) Tul that cause {{considerable}} loss to the crop {{in the hills of}} Uttaranchal. The disease appears in the form of swollen grains full of smut spores. The minimal incidence of this disease has been reported to degrade the quality of grain and wheat flour, which make the entire seed lot unfit for chapati making (4). Holton (1967) reported 25 - 50 % reduction in yield due to hill bunt (1). The present study was under taken to find out photosynthetic loss due to hill bunt disease and also to see the efficacy of Oxalis and Cannabis plant extract for its control. A field experiment was laid out at the experimental farm Hawalbagh of VPKAS Almora (Uttaranchal) (1250 M amsl 29. 36 DN 79. 38 DE) during rabi season of 1998 - 99 and 1999 - 2000. Sandy soil loam and susceptible wheat variety Girija were used as plant material. The experiment was conducted in randomized block design with four replications and four treatments i. e. seed treated with water (control) (T 1); seed dressed with mancozeb @ 2. 5 g/kg (T 2); seed dipped in Oxalis (T 3) and Cannabis (T 4) leaf extract (1 : 1 w/v) for 24 hrs. before sowing. Incidence of hill bunt disease was estimated on infected tiller count basis. During grain filling recording of photosynthesis & other associated parameters on flag leaves of crop were made using portable photosynthesis system (Model CIRAS I, UK). Leaf temperature depression was calculated by subtracting the values of leaf temperature from atmospheric temperature (DC). *Corresponding author...|$|E

Other physical treatment methods with practical relevance in cereals are hot humid air and electron treatment. Hot water treatment is also known to control different seed-borne pathogens of vegetables.

The genetic basis of resistance in 20 wheat genotypes with resistance to Ustilago tritici race T 11 was studied in crosses with the widely grown but susceptible Indian cultivar, PBW 343. These lines were also involved in 10 ‘resistant × resistant’ crosses, to infer diversity for resistance genes in this set. All 30 crosses were developed to the F 3 stage. Fifteen parents were inferred to carry dominant genes for resistance to race T 11. Ten of these resistant lines (ML 521, W 59, W 1616, W 2484, W 2531, W 5915, W 6202, WL 1786, WL 2956 and WL 3450) had resistance controlled by 2 dominant genes acting in a complementary manner whereas in 4 lines (W 4461, W 5100, W 2615 and WL 3951), there was a single dominant gene and in a single genotype, WL 5907, there were 2 dominant genes with duplicate gene action governing the resistance. In lines W 2139, W 3899, W 4985, W 5450 and W 5792 a single recessive gene conferred resistance.

5000|$|From {{the late}} 1800s until the 1930s, <b>stinking</b> <b>smut</b> was a devastating disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> For example, {{infection}} levels over 20% were common in Washington {{in the early}} 1900s. One of the most extreme cases was in Kansas in 1890 where the yield was reduced 20-50% because of Tilletia caries. Only when seed treatments became available after 1930 did losses from smut drop to much lower levels. Today, losses from smut rarely occur unless a grower chooses not to plant treated seed, but, if left untreated, bunt can reduce yield by more than 50% [...] In modern agriculture, if an infection occurs, losses are 5-10%.

The aim of research was to assess the contamination of grain <b>of</b> spring <b>wheat</b> and barley phytopathogenic fungi in one of the main grain regions of Ukraine - the southern forest. The research conducted during the summer 2014 and compared with the results of previous years. Samples were taken from different plots. Seed contamination of samples by various phytopathogenic fungi was determined by the number of infected kernels per 100 seed sample. Frequency of registered species was recorded. For every studied sample we set the percentage of species. Analysis of the grain on the fungal infection and avdelenie in pure culture was performed according to the procedures used a method of washing and centrifugation, seeds, embryos analysis method, biological method based on the stimulation of development and growth of pathogens in the infected seeds during seed germination in nutrient media. We analyzed 200 samples <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley grain with 8 games on the definition of the infestation and root rot spores solid and smut. In all the samples studied was dominated latent form of infection grains (outwardly healthy, germinating, well executed seeds had normal luster, patina fungus was absent); but sometimes observed apparent lesion (plaque formation, a different degree of deformation of grains). When the microscope isolated fungi was established dominance of species such as fungi of the genera Alternaria, Helmintosporium, Fusarium, smut fungi. The research of cereal seeds showed that all the tested party for the harvest in 2014 were infected with different pathogens in different degrees. On the basis of literature data and our own observations, comparing infection rates average cereal seeds complex fungal diseases, it may be noted that in 2014 the percentage of infestation was higher than in previous years, there is a trend of growth in incidence. The results showed that the overall percentage of infected root rots seeds <b>of</b> spring <b>wheat</b> in 2014 was 55. 5 %, the infestation of spring barley was 64. 7 %. Compared to previous years the trend increase in the prevalence of fungal diseases on cereals: wheat infestation grew by 12. 8 %, barley - 2. 13 %. Smut infected - 11. 2 % wheat, barley - 37. 4 %. Infection bunt was 4. 6 %, including 3. 3 % of wheat; Barley 17. 6 %. The growth and development of root rot during the growing season depended on the presence of soil infection.
