40|$|Ordered {{intermetallic}} {{phases of}} Pt with several transition metals {{have been prepared}} and their electrocatalytic properties studied. In light of these tests it is proposed that these catalysts {{could be used as}} electrodes in fuel cells, as they combine an excellent capacity to adsorb organic fuels at the Pt sites with low <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> poisoned by intermediates and reaction products at the transition-metal sites. An experimental procedure used to obtain the four intermetallic phases Pt-M (M = Mn, Pb, Sb and Sn) is described. The phases thus produced were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with surface analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The data thus obtained support the conclusion that the method described here is highly effective for the preparation of Pt-M phases featuring a range of structural and electronic modifications that will allow a useful relation to be established between their physicochemical properties and predicted electrocatalytic activity.

40|$|With the {{long-term}} aim {{of developing a}} new type of therapy for diabetes, we have investigated the reprogramming of liver cells in normal mice toward a pancreatic phenotype using the gene combination Pdx 1, Ngn 3, MafA. CD 1 mice were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and given a single dose of Ad-PNM, an adenoviral vector containing all three genes. Ad-PNM induced hepatocytes of the liver to produce insulin, and the blood glucose became normalized. But over several weeks, the insulin-positive cells were lost and the blood glucose rose back to diabetic levels. Simultaneous administration of a peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor agonist, WY 14643, caused remission of diabetes at a lower dose of Ad-PNM and also caused the appearance of a population of insulin-secreting ductal structures in the liver. The insulin-positive ducts were stable and were able to relieve diabetes in the long term. We show that the effect of WY 14643 is associated with the promotion of cell division of the ductal cells, which may increase their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> reprogrammed toward a beta cell fate...|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{inhibitory}} concentration (MIC) of fluconazole for E. jeanselmei is very high, flucytosine and miconazole also have relatively high MICs which indicate that the fungus is fairly resistant to these drugs. Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and voriconazole have lower MICs, and E. jeanselmei is most susceptible to itraconazole and terbinafine. Novel drugs such as echinocandin and caspofungin also have favorable antifungal activity against Exophiala jeanselmei isolates. However, in vitro <b>susceptibility</b> in comparison <b>to</b> the efficacy of antifungal agents in clinical manifestations of this fungus is currently unknown, that in vitro success {{may or may not}} directly correlate clinically. Previous cases of black grain mycetoma caused by E. jeanselmei were clinically treated and cases of phaeohyphomycosis caused by this fungus were completely cured where both cases were remedied by administering itraconazole. E. jeanselmei also showed some <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> treated with antifungal agents such as amphotericin B, voriconazole and posaconazole. Amphotericin B used to be the most potent antifungal treatment for severe fungal infections, but due to its strong association with severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, its use is now often replaced with azoles and echinocandins. The use of combinations of surgical excision and pharmacological treatments for severe infections is usually the preferred way to treat diseases caused by this fungus.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess parental beliefs and intentions about genetic testing for their children in a multi-ethnic population with the aim of acquiring information to guide interventions for obesity prevention and management. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in parents of native Dutch children and children from a large minority population (Turks) selected from Youth Health Care registries. The age range of the children was 5 - 11 years. Parents with lower levels of education and parents of non-native children were more convinced that overweight has a genetic cause and their intentions to test the genetic predisposition of their child to overweight were firmer. A firmer intention to test the child was associated with the parents' perceptions of their child's <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> overweight, a positive attitude towards genetic testing, and anticipated regret at not having the child tested while at risk for overweight. Interaction effects were found in ethnic and socio-economic groups. Ethnicity and educational level play a role in parental beliefs about child overweight and genetic testing. Education programmes about obesity risk, genetic testing and the importance of behaviour change should be tailored to the cultural and behavioural factors relevant to ethnic and socio-economic target groups. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Both endocytic uptake and viral fusion {{can lead}} to human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) transfer to CD 4 + lymphocytes, either through directional regurgitation (infectious transfer in trans [I-IT]) or through de novo viral production in dendritic cells (DCs) resulting in a second-phase transfer to CD 4 + lymphocytes (infectious second-phase transfer [I-SPT]). We have evaluated in immature monocyte-derived DCs both pathways of transfer with regard <b>to</b> their <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> blocked by potential microbicidal compounds, including cyanovirin (CNV); the plant lectins Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, Urtica dioica agglutinin, and Cymbidium hybrid agglutinin; and the glycan mannan. I-IT was a relatively inefficient means of viral transfer compared to I-SPT at both high {{and low levels of}} the viral inoculum. CNV was able to completely block I-IT at 15 microg/ml. All other compounds except mannan could inhibit I-IT by at least 90 % when used at doses of 15 microg/ml. In contrast, efficient inhibition of I-SPT was remarkably harder to achieve, as 50 % effective concentration levels for plant lectins and CNV to suppress this mode of HIV- 1 transfer increased significantly. Thus, our findings indicate that I-SPT may be more elusive to targeting by antiviral drugs and stress the need for drugs affecting the pronounced inhibition of the infection of DCs by HIV- 1. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Infection {{with several}} DNA or RNA viruses induces {{a state of}} {{increased}} sensitivity to cell lysis mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), particularly {{in the presence of}} gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Infection of human cells with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may induce a similar phenomenon. However, TNF and IFN-gamma are known upregulators of HIV replication, raising the question of the potential role of these cytokines in the selective elimination of cells infected with this virus. The present study demonstrates that chronically infected U 1 cells were killed with much greater efficiency by costimulation with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma than their uninfected parental cell line U 937. However, synergistic induction of viral expression also occurred in U 1 cells as a consequence of treatment with the two cytokines. Cell death in U 1 cells was not caused by the massive production of virions, in that costimulation with glucocorticoid hormones and TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma resulted in high levels of virion production without cytopathicity. To investigate the nature of the selective cytotoxic effect observed in U 1 cells costimulated with TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma, a panel of uninfected cell clones was generated by limiting dilution of U 937 cells and tested for response to TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma. In contrast to the uncloned bulk parental U 937 cell line, most uninfected cell clones showed a very high <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> killed by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Similar findings were obtained when both infected U 1 cells and several uninfected U 937 cell clones were costimulated with an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody in the presence of IFN-gamma, although, unlike cells stimulated with TNF-alpha, cells treated with anti-Fas antibody did not express virus. Therefore, the increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> cytokine-mediated lysis observed in cell lines infected with HIV is likely due to the selection of preexisting cell clones rather than viral infection...|$|R
40|$|We satellite-tracked the {{foraging}} trips {{of males}} and females of the 2 sibling species of giant petrels, Macronectes halli and M. giganteus, breeding sympatrically at Bird Island (South Georgia, Antarctica), during the incubation period (November-December). Size of the activity range in addition to speed and distance covered on foraging trips were similar between the species, but were lower for males than for females in both species. Sex-specific differences agree with previous observations on diets and on attendance at seal carcasses, suggesting that females mainly forage at sea, whereas males mainly scavenge on the coast. Overall, however, the foraging ecology of both species seems very similar. Interspecific and intersexual competition may be reduced by the limited overlap in the at-sea range, with southern giant petrels foraging further south than did northern giant petrels, and females further west than males, suggesting some spatial partitioning in foraging areas. Male northern giant petrels foraged almost exclusively on the South Georgia coast; their strong dependence during the brooding and chick-rearing period on Antarctic fur seals, whose population has increased exponentially in recent years, may be reflected in the recent population increase of northern giant petrels at South Georgia. Foraging areas of giant petrels overlapped extensively with longline fishery distribution, highlighting their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> caught on longline hooks. Females were at higher risk during the study period since they made longer trips and foraged further west than males, into areas where local longline fisheries are more active...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a discrete-time opinion dynamics {{model in which}} each individual's <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> influenced by others is dependent on her current opinion. We assume that the social network has time-varying topology and that the opinions are scalars on a continuous interval. We first propose a general opinion dynamics model based on the DeGroot model, with a general function to describe the functional dependence of each individual's susceptibility on her own opinion, and show that this general model {{is analogous to the}} Friedkin-Johnsen model, which assumes a constant susceptibility for each individual. We then consider two specific functions in which the individual's susceptibility depends on the polarity of her opinion, and provide motivating social examples. First, we consider stubborn positives, who have reduced susceptibility if their opinions are {{at one end of the}} interval and increased susceptibility if their opinions are at the opposite end. A court jury is used as a motivating example. Second, we consider stubborn neutrals, who have reduced susceptibility when their opinions are in the middle of the spectrum, and our motivating examples are social networks discussing established social norms or institutionalized behavior. For each specific susceptibility model, we establish the initial and graph topology conditions in which consensus is reached, and develop necessary and sufficient conditions on the initial conditions for the final consensus value to be at either extreme of the opinion interval. Simulations are provided to show the effects of the susceptibility function when compared to the DeGroot model.

40|$|Abstract Background The Scottish biting midge, Culicoides impunctatus, {{responsible}} for more than 90 % of biting attacks on human beings in Scotland, is known to demonstrate a preference for certain human hosts over others. Methods In this study we used a questionnaire-based survey to assess the association between people's perception of how badly they get bitten by midges and their demographic, lifestyle and health related characteristics. Results Most people (85. 8 %) reported being bitten sometimes, often or always with only 14. 2 % reporting never being bitten by midges when in Scotland. There was no association between level of bites received and age, smoking, diet, exercise, medication, eating strongly flavoured foods or alcohol consumption. However, {{there was a strong}} association between the probability of being bitten and increasing height (in men) and BMI (in women). A large proportion of participants (33. 8 %) reported experiencing a bad/severe reaction to midge bites while 53. 1 % reported a minor reaction and 13. 1 % no reaction at all. Also, women tend to react more than men to midge bites. Additionally, the results indicated that the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> bitten by midges is hereditary. Conclusions This study suggests that midges prefer to bite men that are tall and women that have a large BMI, and that the tendency for a child to be bitten or not could be inherited from their parent. The study is questionnaire-based; therefore, the interpretation of the results may be limited by the subjectivity of the answers given by the respondents. Although the results are relevant only to the Scottish biting midge, the approach used here could be useful for investigating human-insect interactions for other insects, particularly those which transmit pathogens that cause disease. </p...|$|R

Further study of Gross virus-induced leukemia incidence in the cross C 3 H (H- 2 k) x C 57 BL (H- 2 b) indicated quite clearly that a gene closely linked to the H- 2 complex, Rgv- 11 (resistance to Gross-virus-l), was one of two independently segregating loci sharing in the control of <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> leukemogenesis (2).
