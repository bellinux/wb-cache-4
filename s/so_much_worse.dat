In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it [...] "apocalyptic", she said, [...] "I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this – <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this." [...] Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. [...] "Taking care of children {{has nothing to do with}} politics. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicisation of humanitarian aid, there will be a humanisation of politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|In affidavits, Fletcher {{wrote that}} she has almost no memory of her {{childhood}} up {{until the age of}} 14. [...] She explained that her writing started out just for her and was cathartic because she had been sexually abused as a child. “At first I would capture a particular feeling of dread and try to weave it into a scenario that explained the feeling", she wrote. [...] Fletcher described what she called her [...] "monsters":"I have always been afraid of monsters. The monsters in my life had always been real; for too long they were always there with unlimited access to me, and I was helpless to do anything about it. In my stories, I have created new monsters. [...] rise above the horror of the real life monsters. Somehow, making these monsters <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> makes me feel better, and makes my life seem more bearable. I may still be afraid of the monsters, but at least in the stories, they prey on someone else, not me." ...|$|E

It was first performed in England on 24 May 1856 in Italian at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, {{where it was}} considered morally questionable, and [...] "the heads of the Church {{did their best to}} put an injunction upon performance; the Queen refrained from visiting the theatre during the performances, though the music, words and all, were not unheard at the palace". It was first performed in the United States by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company on 3 December 1856 in Italian at the Academy of Music in New York. George Templeton Strong noted in his diary: [...] "People say the plot's immoral, but I don't see that it's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> than many others, not to speak of Don Giovanni, which as put on the stage is little but rampant lechery", while the Evening Post critic wrote: [...] "Those who have quietly sat through the glaring improprieties of Don Giovanni will hardly blush or frown at anything in La traviata." ...|$|E
