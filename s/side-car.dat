50|$|The {{group was}} {{organized}} on 26 October 1918 at Gengault Aerodrome (Toul), France. On 27 October the 141st and 25th Aero Squadrons (Pursuit) {{were assigned to}} the unit. Both were new units, recently deployed to France and equipped with SPAD XIIIs. The Sixth Air Park was assigned to the Group on 30 October, it was equipped with trucks, cars, motorcycles and <b>side-cars</b> {{for the use of the}} Group.|$|R

60|$|He {{looked up}} as he heard the hoot of a motor horn, and his tense face relaxed into a smile. Andrew, in the <b>side-car</b> of Whitney's bicycle, waved his hand and Dick's {{troubles}} began to vanish. One could rely on Andrew, who, after all, was a much better Johnstone than himself. Somehow, Andrew would stand between them and whatever threatened the honor of Appleyard.|$|E
60|$|I had {{a healthy}} {{suspicion}} of young Ollyett in every aspect, but though I knew that I {{should have to}} pay for it, I fell to his flattery, and my priceless article on the 'Gubby Dance' appeared. Next Saturday he asked me to bring out The Bun in his absence, which I naturally assumed would be connected with the little maroon <b>side-car.</b> I was wrong.|$|E
50|$|From 1918 to 1923, the {{regiment}} garrisoned at Castres, then Carcasonne where a dissolution {{was placed in}} effect in 1926. Recreated in 1929 under the designation of 4e bataillon de dragons portés 4e BDP, {{the regiment}} was formed at Trèves from elements of the 4e groupe de chasseurs cyclistes. The regiment was equipped with chenilettes Citroën, automatic machine guns AMR and <b>side-cars.</b> In 1935, the regiment was designated as 4e régiment de dragons portés and garrisoned at Verdun.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Between Schleswig Limits" [...] {{museum in}} Bylderup-Bov was {{approached}} by Nordisk Film {{in the autumn of}} 2013 with regards to assisting with uniforms and weapons. In March 2014 the film company collected 120 Danish steel helmets, 100 gas-mask canisters, 50 pairs of wool pants, 24 dummy-rifles, 32 cartridge belts, and a khaki officer coat. Moreover, the museum loaned two old Nimbus motorcycles with <b>side-cars.</b> All equipment was initially transported to Budapest in Hungary, where part of the movie was shot.|$|R
50|$|In September 1939, Ducuing took {{command of}} the battery of D.C.A. (défense contre aéronefs, or {{anti-aircraft}} group) of the Croix Faron at Toulon. At the end of January 1940, the French Admiralty was anxious to observe and maintain free passage along the Pas-de-Calais coast, and so set up a coastal battery at Cap Gris-Nez. Ducuing was charged with commanding and organizing this battery from March 1940. He had 3 officers and around 100 men under him, with only twenty rifles and six revolvers between them. On 22 May, facing the German offensive as it closed in on him, with the weak means at his disposal he organized an advanced position of 24 men of which he took personal command. When practically encircled, commandant Ducuing and his men completely destroyed a German column {{made up of a}} small number of <b>side-cars,</b> a light tank and two armored cars. In the evening, he refused a surrender proposed to him by the Germans.|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{took her}} advice and soon {{afterward}} left Appleyard in the <b>side-car.</b> Whitney let the high-powered bicycle go {{when they turned}} into the main western road, which runs, straight and level, along the Solway, and they reached Dumfries in an hour. Mackellar had not left his office and in five minutes Andrew had made the situation plain. Mackellar pondered it silently for a time, and then looked up.|$|E
60|$|Our 'Mobiquities' were Friday evening {{accounts}} of easy motor-bike-cum-side-car trips round London, illustrated (we {{could never get}} that machine to work properly) by smudgy maps. Ollyett wrote the stuff with a fervour and a delicacy which I always ascribed to the <b>side-car.</b> His account of Epping Forest, for instance, was simply young love with its soul at its lips. But his Huckley 'Mobiquity' would have sickened a soap-boiler. It chemically combined loathsome familiarity, leering suggestion, slimy piety and rancid 'social service' in one fuming compost that fairly lifted me off my feet.|$|E
60|$|While he did so, {{he noticed}} a sinuous line running to meet him. At first he {{supposed}} it was the track he had made in going down the lane; then he thought it looked rather deep, and with sudden suspicion he placed the back wheel of his bicycle beside it. The pattern the tire left in the mud was different, and now he saw another line run out from the grass. This seemed to indicate the track of a <b>side-car,</b> and Williamson, leaning his wheel against the wall, followed the marks back over the ground he had traversed.|$|E
5000|$|Simon Milward {{completed}} {{the road in}} 2001 by motorbike and it was cycled in the 2004 winter by Alastair Humphreys and Rob Lilwall, followed on foot by Rosie Swale-Pope in 2005 and ridden solo on motorcycle by both Adrian Scott and by Russian woman Sasha Teplyakova (via the Old Summer Road) the same year. In 2006, the Hungarian talk show host, Sándor Fábry, and the painter András Wahorn made an assisted trip on the road from Magadan to Yakutsk (using the Tomtor road) on a 30 years old Cadillac Eldorado Convertible car, {{as part of their}} Cadillac Drive TV show, driving from Los Angeles to Budapest. In 2007 the Polish Motosyberia team {{completed the}} Old Summer Road. In 2009 Walter Colebatch and Tony Pettie on the Sibirsky Extreme Project completed the new road, from Yakutsk to Magadan via Ust-Nera, in three and a half days. In 2010 Walter Colebatch returned to host the first commercial motorcycle tour on the Road, in which Sherri-Jo Wilkins became the first foreign female rider to ride the road. In September 2010, Paul and Dean Martinello together with Barton Churchill, completed the Old Summer Road into Magadan, and remain the latest motorcycle arrival to Magadan - 30 September. In summer 2012, Sean Ardley of California cycled the road from Magadan to the Lena River in 16 days, 12 hours. In June 2013, Nikolaos J. Kavouras member of Motorcycle Club of Kozani, was the first Greek biker who made the new road (via Ust-Nera) in four days, completed his [...] "mongolia2magadan" [...] effort. Commercial trips for small numbers of motorcycles are available. The very first attempt to ride a motorcycle in winter condition was made by Dan Popescu, motorbiker, the Romanian Motorcyclists Association (AMR) president in late March 2012. He rode one Aprilia Pegaso 650 IE on the distance between Yakutsk to near Kyubeme in few days, including night time riding, the coldest temperature down to −35 °C, helped by a back up team in two 4&times;4s including an ambulance. Most recent completion of the Old Summer Road was done during August 2015 by the leavinghomefunktion team - an international group of young artists on Ural motorcycles with <b>side-cars.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{staggered}} out-of-doors again, {{and fell}} into the car, whose ever-running machinery masked my yelps and hiccups. When I raised my forehead from the wheel, I saw that traffic through the village had been resumed, after, as my watch showed, one and one-half hour's suspension. There were two limousines, one landau, one doctor's car, three touring-cars, one patent steam-laundry van, three tricars, one traction-engine, some motor-cycles, one with a <b>side-car,</b> and one brewery lorry. It was the allegory of my own imperturbable country, delayed {{for a short time}} by unforeseen external events but now going about her business, and I blessed Her with tears in my eyes, even though I knew She looked upon me as drunk and incapable.|$|E
60|$|There was {{moonlight}} in {{the shallow}} depression that led down from the summit, but soon the hilltops rose higher and they plunged into a dark glen. A glimmer of light flashed up to meet them, and as the <b>side-car,</b> rocking wildly, raced past the Mosspaul hotel, Andrew remembered what had happened there a few months previously. He had seen since then that Dick {{had not been in}} much danger when Staffer's car swerved; the risk of being struck down had been run by him only. Well, that did not matter much. If any one was threatened now, it was neither himself nor Dick, and it was horrible to feel that Elsie might be in some danger. Whitney was driving recklessly fast, but Andrew frowned impatiently as he watched the hillsides unfold out of the dark and rush by while the throbbing of the engine filled the narrow glen.|$|E
60|$|Reaching the road, {{where he}} would excite no curiosity, {{he sat down in}} the shelter of a bank and lighted a cigarette, for he had {{received}} a decided shock. Some one had driven a motorcycle down the loaning, but had not gone to the farm. This was strange; and it was significant that the man had taken a good deal of trouble to hide the machine, which suggested that he must have meant to leave it for some time, and wished to prevent its being seen. There was nothing on the moss to repay a visit, and the owner of a motorcycle would have no reason for taking a short cut across the mountain on foot, when he could drive round as soon by road. That there was probably another man in the <b>side-car</b> made the puzzle worse; and Williamson's face hardened as he admitted the possibility of their having tried to follow him.|$|E
60|$|The {{struggle}} was resumed. And soon {{it became clear}} that the first goal was no earnest of the quality of the struggle. Teddy and Cecily formed a terribly efficient combination. Against their brilliant rushes, supported in a vehement but effective manner by the Indian to their right and guided by loud shoutings from Mr. Britling (centre), Mr. Direck and the <b>side-car</b> lady and Mr. Raeburn struggled in vain. One swift advance was only checked by the dust cloak, its folds held the ball until help arrived; another was countered by a tremendous swipe of Mr. Raeburn's that sent the ball within an inch of the youngest Britling's head and right across the field; the third resulted in a swift pass from Cecily to the elder Britling son away on her right, and he shot the goal neatly and swiftly through the lattice of Mr. Lawrence Carmine's defensive movements. And after that very rapidly came another goal for Mr. Britling's side and then another.|$|E

50|$|The only model {{produced}} was a three-wheeler {{urban cycle}} car which closely resembled the <b>side-car</b> {{half of a}} motor-cycle/side car combination. This reflected Poinard’s main business as a <b>side-car</b> manufacturer. The driver sat alone on a saddle controlling the front wheel using a motorcycle style handle-bars. Close behind the driver was a bench seat suitable for two narrow passengers, although doubts have been expressed {{as to whether the}} vehicle’s engine power would have been sufficient to move so many people.|$|E

50|$|White Lady (also {{known as}} a Delilah, or Chelsea <b>Side-car)</b> is {{essentially}} a sidecar made with gin in place of brandy.

50|$|As {{part of this}} position, Bendor-Samuel {{essentially}} {{turned his}} attic bedroom into the UK office of Wycliffe Bible Translators.

5000|$|The new 10 lap (107.90 miles) <b>Side-Car</b> TT {{held on the}} Clypse Course was {{led from}} start to finish by Eric Oliver and {{passenger}} Les Nutt riding a Norton <b>side-car</b> outfit with a [...] "dust-bin" [...] fairing at an average speed of 68.87 mph. The Norton outfit of Bill Boddice/J.Pirie hit a bank at Creg-ny-Baa and flipped over on lap 7, but continued on to finish the race in 6th place. The winner of the 1954 Lightweight TT race, Werner Haas crashed at Governor's Bridge on lap 1 of the 1954 Ultra-Lightweight TT Race, also held on the Clypse Course. This allowed Rupert Hollaus to win the race in 1 hour, 33 minutes and 3.4 seconds at an average race speed of 69.57 mph. His victory was notable because he was one of only seven riders to have won an Isle of Man TT race in their first attempt.|$|E
5000|$|On March 8, 1921, at 20:20, the Prime Minister of Spain, Eduardo Dato, {{was driving}} his car home through Plaza de la Independencia {{after a long}} session at the parliament, when three Catalan anarchists driving a grey {{motorcycle}} with <b>side-car</b> shot him with a handgun. Dato was promptly driven to the Casa de Socorro hospital, but was dead on arrival.|$|E
50|$|The third <b>side-car</b> wheel {{was driven}} with an axle {{connected}} to the rear wheel of the motorcycle. These were fitted with a locking differential and selectable road and off-road gear ratios through which all four and reverse gears worked. This made the R75 highly manoeuvrable and capable of negotiating most surfaces. A few other motorcycle manufactures, like FN and Norton, provided an optional drive to sidecars.|$|E
