40|$|A {{comparison}} of 40 -yr (1960 - 99) trends in Antarctic geopotential height and temperature from quality controlled radiosonde observations and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data is undertaken. Observations from four Antarctic stations-having sufficiently long-term and consistent datasets-at four pressure levels (850, 500, 300, and 100 hPa) are utilized. The NNR reveals substantial negative trends in tropospheric geopotential height at {{high southern latitudes}} with no significant trends seen in the lower stratosphere above Antarctica. In contrast, observations indicate only minor negative trends in tropospheric height, while statistically significant decreases in height in the lower stratosphere have occurred over East Antarctica. However, both NNR and observations show a consistent, significant warming (similar to 1 degreesC) in the lower troposphere (> 500 hPa) above coastal Antarctica. At higher altitudes, trends derived from the two datasets diverge; the NNR fails to capture the marked cooling in the lower stratosphere associated with <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Differences in the trends are principally caused by NNR errors prior to the assimilation of satellite sounder data, which coincides with significant jumps in NNR upper-air temperatures. A rapid drop in NNR tropospheric geopotential height across East Antarctica as recently as 1993 is traced {{to the introduction of}} automatic weather stations in the region. Errors in the model height of these surface pressure data cause a significant climate jump in the NNR not observed in comparable models. Such spurious jumps considerably diminish the usefulness of the NNR for climate change studies in Antarctica...|$|E

Comparisons to Aura Microwave Limb Sounder N 2 O and O 3 observations show the GMI simulation credibly represents the transport processes and net heterogeneous chemical loss necessary to simulate Arctic ozone. We {{find that the}} maximum seasonal ozone depletion varies linearly {{with the number of}} cold days and with wave driving (eddy heat flux) calculated from MERRA fields. We use this relationship and MERRA temperatures to estimate <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> from 1993 to 2004 when inorganic chlorine levels were in the same range as during the Aura period. Using these loss estimates and the observed March mean 63 - 90 N column O 3, we quantify the sensitivity of the ozone dynamical resupply to wave driving, separating it from the sensitivity of ozone depletion to wave driving. The results show that about 2 / 3 of the deviation of the observed March Arctic O 3 from an assumed climatological mean is due to variations in O 3 resupply and 13 is due to depletion. Winters with a stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) before mid-February have about 1 / 3 the depletion of winters without one and export less depletion to the midlatitudes. However, a larger effect on the spring midlatitude ozone comes from dynamical differences between warm and cold Arctic winters, which can mask or add to the impact of exported depletion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Abstract With the Match technique, {{which is}} based on the coordinated release of ozonesondes from a network of {{sounding}} stations in the Northern Hemisphere in order to obtain a large number of double probed air parcels, the chemical ozone loss inside the stratospheric polar vortex was quantified during the winters 1996 / 97, 1997 / 98, and 1998 / 99. Large interannual differences regarding the amount of chemical ozone loss were detected. In winter 1996 / 97, the coldest winter examined here, ozone loss was detected in February and March, with maximum vortex averaged loss rates around 40 ppbv/day. Overall, the ozone loss was lower than in the two preceding years, because only the inner part of the polar vortex was affected by major ozone loss. Despite this, the total ozone column densities that where observed in spring 1997 were lower compared to both years before, which indicates a large dynamical contribution. In winter 1997 / 98, temperatures were higher than in preceding years, and only slight ozone loss was detected, which was probably connected to lee wave formation {{at the edge of the}} polar vortex. In winter 1998 / 99, the warmest winter examined with Match so far, no chemical ozone loss was detected. These results demonstrate clearly that, given the present chlorine loading, the amount of ozone destruction in the Arctic stratosphere is determined by the temperature distribution. In this work, the dependence of the ozone loss rates on the temperature histories of the air parcels was analysed for the first time. Using all Match data that were obtained inside the polar vortex in an isentropic level of 475 K during the years 1995 - 2000, it was shown that chemical ozone loss in February occurred solely within those air parcels that experienced temperatures below 193 - 195 K either between the two soundings or up to ten days before the first sounding. According to the present understanding of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in polar regions, stratospheric chlorine is activated below certain threshold temperatures, which then initiates ozone destruction. The results obtained in this work give experimental evidence for the existence of such a threshold temperature being of significance for the ozone destruction. For the altitude under consideration, the threshold temperature determined in this work agrees with the threshold temperature for chlorine activation that was observed by others. </Body...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Photochemistry of <b>Ozone</b> <b>Loss</b> in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) field mission was to obtain data to better characterize the summertime <b>seasonal</b> decrease of <b>ozone</b> at mid to high latitudes. The decrease in ozone occurs mainly in the lower stratosphere {{and is expected to}} result from in situ chemical destruction. Instrumented balloons and aircraft were used in POLARIS, along with satellites, to measure ozone and chemical species which are involved with stratospheric ozone chemistry. In order to close the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> budget, however, ozone transport must also be estimated. Comparison to a global chemistry and transport model (CTM) of the stratosphere indicates how well the summertime <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> processes are simulated and thus how well we can predict the ozone response to changing amounts of chemical source gases. Moreover, the model gives insight into the possible relative magnitude of transport contributions to the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> decline. Initial comparison to the Goddard CTM, which uses transport winds and temperatures from meteorological data assimilation, shows a high ozone bias in the model and an attenuated summertime <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> cycle. Comparison of the model chemical partitioning and <b>ozone</b> catalytic <b>loss</b> rates to those derived from measurements shows fairly close agreement both at ER- 2 altitudes (20 km) and higher. This suggests that the model transport is too active in resupplying ozone to the high latitude region, although chemistry failings cannot be completely ruled out.

40|$|The {{persistence}} and decay of springtime total ozone anomalies {{over the entire}} extratropics (midlatitudes plus polar regions) is analysed using results from the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM), a comprehensive chemistry-climate model. As in the observations, interannual anomalies established through winter and spring persist with very high correlation coefficients (above 0. 8) through summer until early autumn, while decaying in amplitude {{as a result of}} photochemical relaxation in the quiescent summertime stratosphere. The {{persistence and}} decay of the ozone anomalies in CMAM agrees extremely well with observations, even in the southern hemisphere when the model is run without heterogeneous chemistry (in which case there is no ozone hole and the <b>seasonal</b> cycle of <b>ozone</b> is quite different from observations). However in a version of CMAM with strong vertical diffusion, the northern hemisphere anomalies decay far too rapidly compared to observations. This shows that ozone anomaly persistence and decay does not depend on how the springtime anomalies are created or on their magnitude, but reflects the transport and photochemical decay in the model. The seasonality of the long-term trends over the entire extratropics is found to be explained by the persistence of the interannual anomalies, as in the observations, demonstrating that summertime ozone trends reflect winter/spring trends rather than any change in summertime ozone chemistry. However this mechanism fails in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes because of the relatively large impact, compared to observations, of the CMAM polar anomalies. As in the southern hemisphere, the influence of polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in CMAM increases the midlatitude summertime loss, leading to a relatively weak <b>seasonal</b> dependence of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the observations...|$|R

The model seeks insight into the phenomenon as a paradigm of unanticipated amplification of human activity, strives for clarity and relevance and complies with fundamental principles and with global constraints such as ozone levels and decay rates, chlorine monoxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and cloud sightings. Two main conclusions emerge: 1) the local regeneration of active chlorine mediated by nitrogen dioxide on ice clouds after sunrise is a key factor, and 2) local <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> become highly sensitive to initial conditions, and to slight perturbations of the catalytic activity of clouds, above critical levels of active chlorine...|$|R

Additionally, the degree of homogeneity of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> within the vortex was shown to depend on the meteorological conditions. Results derived here are in general agreement with the results obtained by other methods for deducing polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Differences occur mainly owing to different time periods considered in deriving accumulated <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> However, very strong <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> as deduced from SAOZ for January in winters 1993 - 1994 and 1995 - 1996 cannot be identified using available HALOE observations in the early winter.

40|$|International audienceThe Match {{method for}} {{quantification}} of polar chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is investigated mainly {{with respect to}} the impact of mixing across the vortex edge onto this estimate. We show for the winter 2002 / 03 that significant mixing across the vortex edge occurred and was accurately modeled by the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere. Observations of inert tracers and ozone in-situ from HAGAR on the Geophysica aircraft and sondes and also remote from MIPAS on ENVISAT were reproduced well. The model even reproduced a small vortex remnant that was isolated until June 2003 and was observed in-situ by a balloon-borne whole air sampler. We use this CLaMS simulation to quantify the impact of cross vortex edge mixing on the results of the Match method. It is shown that a time integration of the determined vortex average <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates as performed in Match results in larger <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> than the polar vortex average <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in CLaMS. Also, the determination of the Match <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates can be influenced by mixing. This is especially important below 430 K, where ozone outside the vortex is lower than inside and the vortex boundary is not a strong transport barrier. This effect and further sampling effects cause an offset between vortex average <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates derived from Match and deduced from CLaMS with an even sampling for the entire vortex. Both, the time-integration of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> and the determination of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates for Match are evaluated using the winter 2002 / 03 CLaMS simulation.

40|$|The {{response}} of the Southern Ocean to a repeating <b>seasonal</b> cycle of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is studied in two coupled climate models and found to comprise both fast and slow processes. The fast response {{is similar to the}} inter-annual signature of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on Sea Surface Temperature (SST), on to which the ozone-hole forcing projects in the summer. It comprises enhanced northward Ekman drift inducing negative summertime SST anomalies around Antarctica, earlier sea ice freeze-up the following winter, and northward expansion of the sea ice edge year-round. The enhanced northward Ekman drift, however, results in upwelling of warm waters from below the mixed layer in the region of seasonal sea ice. With sustained bursts of westerly winds induced by ozone-hole depletion, this warming from below eventually dominates over the cooling from anomalous Ekman drift. The resulting slow-timescale response (years to decades) leads to warming of SSTs around Antarctica and ultimately a reduction in sea-ice cover year-round. This two-timescale behavior - rapid cooling followed by slow but persistent warming - is found in the two coupled models analysed, one with an idealized geometry, the other a complex global climate model with realistic geometry. Processes that control the timescale of the transition from cooling to warming, and their uncertainties are described. Finally we discuss the implications of our results for rationalizing previous studies of the effect of the ozone-hole on SST and sea-ice extent. ...|$|R

The Match technique allows {{the determination of the}} chemically induced <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> from a statistical analysis of pairs of ozonesonde measurements that took place at different times and locations of a calculated air mass trajectory. Under twilight conditions, as they are typical for the polar winter, the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rate strongly varies with the solar zenith angle. Thus it was necessary to simulate the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> along each of the match trajectories to obtain results quantitatively comparable to the match analyses. In order to obtain initial values for these model runs the seasonal development of the relevant trace gas mixing ratios was simulated using idealized trajectories. It could be shown that the model significantly underestimates the early winter <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> The match dataset of the winter 1991 / 92 allows a time dependent comparison of the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates only on the 475 K potential temperature level (#approx# 19 km).

A statistical analysisof the measured differences in ozone mixing ratio and the time the air parcel spent in sunlightbetween the measurements provides the chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Initial results were first describedby von der Gathen et al. [1995]. Here we present a more detailed description of the technique anda more comprehensive discussion of the results. <b>Ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates of up to 10 ppbv per sunlit hour(or 54 ppbv per day) were found inside the polar vortex on the 475 K potential temperaturesurface (about 19. 5 km in altitude) at the end of January. The period of rapid <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> coincidesand slightly lags a period when temperatures were cold enough for type I polar stratosphericclouds to form.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> to {{polar stratospheric cloud}} volume (V(sub PSC)) and chlorine and bromine loading is explored using chemistry and transport models (CTMs). A simulation using multi-decadal output from a general circulation model (GCM) in the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) CTM complements one recycling a single year s GCM output in the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) CTM. Winter polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the GSFC CTM depends on equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) and polar vortex characteristics (temperatures, descent, isolation, polar stratospheric cloud amount). Polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the GMI CTM depends only on changes in EESC as the dynamics repeat annually. The GSFC CTM simulation reproduces a linear relationship between <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> and Vpsc derived from observations for 1992 - 2003 which holds for EESC within approx. 85 % of its maximum (approx. 1990 - 2020).

40|$|Stratospheric ozone {{profiles}} are retrieved for {{the period}} 2002 – 2009 from SCIAMACHY measurements of limb-scattered solar radiation in the Hartley and Chappuis absorption bands of ozone. This data set is {{used to determine the}} chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar vortices by averaging the ozone in the vortex at a given potential temperature. The chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> at isentropic levels between 450 K and 600 K are derived from the difference between observed ozone abundances and the ozone modelled taking diabatic cooling into account, but no chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of up to 30 – 40 % between mid-January and the end of March inside the Arctic polar vortex are reported. Strong inter-annual variability of the Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is observed, with the cold winters 2004 / 2005 and 2006 / 2007 showing chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> inside the polar vortex at 475 K, where 1. 7 ppmv and 1. 4 ppmv of ozone were removed, respectively, over the period from 22 January to beginning of April and 0. 9 ppmv and 1. 2 ppmv, respectively, during February. For the winters of 2007 / 2008 and 2002 / 2003, <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of about 0. 8 ppmv and 0. 4 ppmv, respectively are estimated at the 475 K isentropic level {{for the period}} from 22 January to beginning of April. Essentially no <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> were diagnosed for the relatively warm winters of 2003 / 2004 and 2005 / 2006. The maximum <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the SCIAMACHY data set was found in 2007 at the 600 K level and amounted to about 2. 1 ppmv for the period between 22 January and the end of April. Enhanced losses close to this altitude were found in all investigated Arctic springs, in contrast to Antarctic spring. The inter-annual variability of <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> and PSC occurrence rates observed during Arctic spring is consistent with the known QBO effects on the Arctic polar vortex, with exception of the unusual Arctic winter 2008 / 2009. The maximum total <b>ozone</b> mass <b>loss</b> of about 25 million tons was found in the cold Arctic winter of 2004 / 2005 inside the polar vortex between the 450 K and 600 K isentropic levels from mid-January until the middle of March. The Antarctic vortex averaged <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> as well as the size of the polar vortex do not vary much from year to year. The total <b>ozone</b> mass <b>loss</b> inside the Antarctic polar vortex between the 450 K and 600 K isentropic levels is about 50 – 60 million tons and the vortex volume for this altitude range varies between about 150 and 300 km 3 for the period between mid-August and mid-November of every year studied, except for 2002. In 2002 a mid-winter major stratospheric warming occurred {{in the second half of}} September and the <b>ozone</b> mass <b>loss</b> was only about half of the value in the other years. However, inside the polar vortex we find chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> at the 475 K isentropic level that are similar to those in all other years studied. At this isentropic level <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of 70 – 90 % between mid-August and mid-November or about 2. 5 ppmv are observed every year. At isentropic levels above 500 K the chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> were found to be larger in 2002 than in all other years studied. Comparisons of the vertical variation of <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> derived from SCIAMACHY observations with several independent techniques for the Arctic winter 2004 / 2005 show that the SCIAMACHY results fall in the middle of the range of previously published results for this winter. For other winters in both hemispheres – for which comparisons with other studies were possible – the SCIAMACHY results are consistent with the range of previously published results...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that extensive depletion of ozone, initiated by heterogenous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds(PSCs) can occur in both the Arctic and Antarctic lower stratosphere. Moreover, {{it has been shown}} that ozone lossrates in the Arctic region in recent years reached values comparable to those over the Antarctic. But until now theaccumulated <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> over the Arctic have been the smaller, mainly because the period of Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> hasnot-unlike over the Antarctic-persisted well into springtime. Here we report the occurrence-during the unusuallycold 1995 - 96 Arctic winter-of the highest recorded chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> over the Arctic region. Two new kinds ofbehaviour were observed. First, <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> at some altitudes was observed long after the last exposure to PSCs. Thiscontinued loss appears to be due to a removal of the nitrogen species that slow down chemical ozone depletion. Second,in another altitude range <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates decreased while PSCs were still present, apparently because of an earlytransformation of the ozone-destroying chlorine species into less active chlorinenitrate. The balance between these twocounteracting mechanisms is probably a fine one, determined by small differences in wintertime stratospherictemperatures. If the apparent cooling trend in the Arctic stratosphere is real, more dramatic <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> may occurin the future...|$|R

By comparing TRAC-calculated <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> to <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> derived with the passive ozone method in a chemistry transport model we differentiate effects of internal mixing and cross vortex boundary mixing on a TRAC reference correlation. As a test case, we consider results of a cold Arctic winter/spring episode from an E 39 /C experiment, where typical features, for example, sufficient polar stratospheric cloud formation potential, denitrification and dehydration, and intermittent and final stratospheric warming events, are simulated. We find that internal mixing does not impact the TRAC-derived reference correlation at all.

40|$|The {{empirical}} relationship {{found between}} column-integrated Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> {{and the potential}} volume of polar stratospheric clouds inferred from meteorological analyses is recalculated in a self-consistent manner using the ERA Interim reanalyses. The relationship is found to hold at different altitudes {{as well as in}} the column. The use of a PSC formation threshold based on temperature dependent cold aerosol formation makes little difference to the original, empirical relationship. Analysis of the photochemistry leading to the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> shows that activation is limited by the photolysis of nitric acid. This step produces nitrogen dioxide which is converted to chlorine nitrate which in turn reacts with hydrogen chloride on any polar stratospheric clouds to form active chlorine. The rate-limiting step is the photolysis of nitric acid: this occurs at the same rate every year and so the interannual variation in the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is caused by the extent and persistence of the polar stratospheric clouds. In early spring the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rate increases as the solar insolation increases the photolysis of the chlorine monoxide dimer in the near ultraviolet. However the length of the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> period is determined by the photolysis of nitric acid which also occurs in the near ultraviolet. As a result of these compensating effects, the amount of the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is principally limited by the extent of original activation rather than its timing. In addition a number of factors, including the vertical changes in pressure and total inorganic chlorine as well as denitrification and renitrification, offset each other. As a result the extent of original activation is the most important factor influencing <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> These results indicate that relatively simple parameterisations of Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> could be developed for use in coupled chemistry climate models...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTracer-tracer {{relations}} {{have been used}} {{for a long time to}} separate physico-chemical change from change caused by transport processes. In particular, for more than a decade, ozone-tracer {{relations have}} been used to quantify chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the polar vortex. The application of ozone-tracer relations for quantifying <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> relies on two hypotheses: that a compact ozone-tracer relation is established in the 'early' polar vortex and that any change of the ozone-tracer relation in the vortex over the course of winter is caused predominantly by chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Here, we revisit this issue by analysing various sets of measurements and the results from several models. We find that mixing across the polar vortex edge impacts ozone-tracer relations in a way that may solely lead to an 'underestimation' of chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> and not to an overestimation. Further, differential descent in the vortex and internal mixing has only a negligible impact on <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> estimates. Moreover, the representation of mixing in three-dimensional atmospheric models can have a substantial impact on the development of tracer relations in the model. Rather compact ozone-tracer relations develop ? in agreement with observations ? in the vortex of a Lagrangian model (CLaMS) where mixing is anisotropic and driven by the deformation of the flow. We conclude that, if a reliable 'early vortex' reference can be obtained and if vortex measurements are separated from mid-latitude measurements, ozone-tracer relations constitute a reliable tool for the quantitative determination of chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the polar vortex...|$|R
