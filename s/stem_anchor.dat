40|$|Flaviviruses are {{responsible}} for serious human diseases, including dengue fever, yellow fever and West Nile. They are enveloped viruses and the envelope protein (E) is thought {{to play an important}} role in the virus life cycle, the nature of which is poorly understood. The flavivirus E protein undergoes a series of conformational changes during its life cycle, starting with the immature prM-E heterodimer. In the final stage of maturation, E rearranges into sets of antiparallel homodimers arranged into sets of trimers known as E protein 2 ̆ 2 rafts 2 ̆ 2. This exposes a furin cleavage site on the pr portion of prM, which is then cleaved, resulting in the mature particles, which are then released. Infection of new host cells involves receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the host cell endosome, the subsequent drop in pH brings about a third rearrangement of E into fusogenic parallel trimers, initiating fusion of host and viral membranes, releasing the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm. The objective of this work was to elucidate the roles that E plays in the virus life cycle. Three aspects of E were examined. ^ Firstly, the role of two conserved helices found within the <b>stem</b> <b>anchor</b> region of the envelope protein were examined. A series of deletions were introduced into highly conserved regions of the helices. All these deletions proved lethal. It was determined that any mutations introduced into the helices resulted in a defect in virus fusion, disrupting entry. This suggests a role for the helices in formation and stability of the fusogenic trimer during the fusion process in entry. ^ Secondly, stabilizing residues between E protein rafts in the mature particle were examined. Regions of potential contact between rafts were identified and conserved residues from within these regions were selected for mutagenesis. Though these were all single point mutations, all proved lethal. It was determined that all these mutants were defective in maturation. This suggests the existence of a stabilizing lattice of contact points required for proper formation of the mature particle. ^ Lastly, an in-silico screen of an NIH small molecule library identified compounds, which docked into two binding pockets between E monomers in the E dimer interface. Four compounds from this screen exhibited significant antiviral activity by disrupting the maturation process. ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryStem cells {{will undergo}} {{self-renewal}} to produce new stem cells {{if they are}} maintained in their niches. The regulatory mechanisms that recruit and maintain stem cells in their niches are not well understood. In Drosophila testes, a group of 12 nondividing somatic cells, called the hub, identifies the stem cell niche by producing the growth factor Unpaired (Upd). Here, we show that Rap-GEF/Rap signaling controls <b>stem</b> cell <b>anchoring</b> to the niche through regulating DE-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Loss of function of a Drosophila Rap-GEF (Gef 26) results in loss of both germline and somatic stem cells. The Gef 26 mutation specifically impairs adherens junctions at the hub-stem cell interface, which results in the stem cells “drifting away” from the niche and losing stem cell identity. Thus, the Rap signaling/E-cadherin pathway may represent one mechanism that regulates polarized niche formation and <b>stem</b> cell <b>anchoring...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn mountainous regions forested slopes play an {{important}} protective role against rockfall. Up to now, most of the researches on rockfall protection forest have been and {{are focused on the}} dissipative effect of standing and living trees. There are hardly any studies on the protective capacity of tree stumps and lying stems against snow avalanches and rockfalls. Although, these techniques are more and more used throughout the Alps. In Austria, the felling technique Alpi has been developed, which allows a specialised lumberjack to create small rockfall barriers using one or two tree <b>stems</b> <b>anchored</b> on high tree stumps. Lying tree stems can be then used to increase efficiently the roughness of the soil and so to limit or avoid triggering and propagation falling rocks. But, due to the wood decay, the efficiency of such bio-engineering type protective works is decreasing with time. One of the questions that the forest and natural hazard managers have to answer is: what is the lifetime of such protective structures? In order to answer to this question we have developed a specific research on this thematic. The main objectives of this research program are to quantify the efficacy of these bio-engineering type rockfall fences depending on their characteristics (stump and stems density, position on the slope, tree species, etc.), and to evaluate their resistance over time. To achieve these objectives we have developed two types of experiments. The first one, performed during the summer 2009 on our experimental site test of Vaujany (France), are full scale rockfall experiments on four felled trees, which have been anchored on their stumps and are lying in an oblique direction to the slope. In total, fifty rocks (from 522 at 2242 kg) have been released one by one. For each rock, the trajectory has been filmed with high speed digital cameras. The second type of experiment is the uprooting of tree stumps (spruce, fir and beech) of different ages and diameter. To uproot the stumps we are using the same technique as for winching tests. For each experiment, stumps samples are taken {{in order to determine the}} wood decay ratio. Finally, a statistical analysis will be made in order to study the correlation between the force required to uproot a stump and its wood decay ratio. The first uprooting test campaign has been held during the summer 2009. First results of both experiment types will be presented. This study is part of the European Interreg IV Alpine Space project "MANFRED"...|$|R

Moreover, {{there is no other}} specific therapy for flaviviral infections; consequently, new antiviral drugs are needed for the treatment of these diseases.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the fixation with cement or by increasing the screw diameter in injured osseous environment a new screw concept was tested. Firstly the topology of the shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators was optimized using a parameter study. The resulting concept represents a compromise between maximal resistance against translational and rotational movement and the complexity of the actuator. It consists of two along the screw axis running SMA sheets made of NiTi alloy which expand fully by body temperature. The actuators were integrated into a screw demonstrator (Figure 1). First tests according to standard ASTM F 543 with bone substitutes and alcohol fixated cervical and thoracic vertebrae by tensile were promising. The pullout strength increased from 432 N to 542 N with bone substitutes and from 240 N up to 293 N by using a human vertebra. The feasibility study shows that SMA actuators are suitable to increase the pullout strength of a pedicle screw. The actuator concept was also used for an adaptive hip stem implant.

Effectively there are two blood circulations in the test. The blood-vessels have a lining consisting of a single layer of large columnar cells, the appearance of which is described. The gelatinous test resolves itself under the microscope into a network of fibres of variable thickness, but the larger ones at least are aggregates of smaller fibrils.

40|$|Introduction At {{the current}} state of the art, endoprostheses are {{predominantly}} manufactured by cutting, forming or casting technologies. An innovative approach for manufacturing of endoprostheses can be found in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology of Beam Melting. With that, the implant gets manufactured by layer-wise, local melting of metal powder with a laser or electron beam, based on 3 D CAD data. Methods Two different approaches of a new implant design and implant functionality were realised. The first approach is the integration of internal functional channels and cavities. The second approach is the combination of Beam Melting technology with new materials. The target is to achieve a homogeneous force distribution at the implant-bone interface by using shape-memory-alloys. Results The inner channels and cavities (inner design features) can fulfil various functions within the implant, e. g. local supply of bio-resorbable filler, prevention and treatment of implant loosening even years after implantation, post-operative medical treatment through a medication depot and supply channels, post-operative drainage of blood and wound oozing through the implant, endoscopic examination of implant-bone interface and surrounding tissue and easier and quicker explantation with less damage to the bone structure through local application of soluble. In non-cemented hip implants, stem loosening is mainly caused by a change in force application and insufficient load transmission between implant and osseous anchor bedding. The active components were integrated in hip stems with a new designed surface and inner structures. The results proved that the frictional connection between a <b>stem</b> prosthesis <b>anchored</b> without cement and the femur can be achieved using shape memory alloy elements.

In addition to patient specific design and surface or volume structuring of implants, the integration of value-added features in implants e. g. inner and outer structuring and the integration of active elements is a new field of application for Additive Manufacturing technologies in arthroplasty...|$|R

DESIGN: An in vitro experiment using a biaxial materials testing machine in combination with three-dimensional motion measurement devices was performed. BACKGROUND: Primary stability of uncemented total hip replacements {{is considered to be a}} prerequisite for the quality of bony ongrowth to the femoral stem. Dynamic motion as a response to loading as well as total motion of the prosthesis have to be considered under quasi-physiological cyclic loading conditions. METHODS: Seven paired fresh cadaveric femora were used for the testing of two types of uncemented femoral <b>stems</b> with different <b>anchoring</b> concepts: CLS <b>stem</b> (Spotorno) and Cone Prosthesis (Wagner). Under sinusoidal cyclic loading mimicking in vivo hip joint forces a new measurement technique was applied allowing for the analysis of the three-dimensional interface motion. RESULTS: Considerable differences between the two prostheses could be detected both in their dynamic motion and total motion behaviour. Whereas the CLS stem, due to the wedge-shaped concept, provides smaller total motions, the longitudinal ribs of the Cone prostheses result in a substantially smaller dynamic motion. CONCLUSIONS: The measuring technique provided reliable and accurate data illustrating the three-dimensional interface motion of uncemented femoral stems...|$|R
40|$|Establishment of {{the human}} {{placenta}} requires that fetal cytotrophoblast <b>stem</b> cells in <b>anchoring</b> chorionic villi become invasive. These cytotrophoblasts aggregate into cell columns and invade both the uterine interstitium and vasculature, anchoring the fetus to the mother and establishing {{blood flow to the}} placenta. Cytotrophoblasts colonizing spiral arterioles replace maternal endothelium as far as the first third of the myometrium. We show here that differentiating cytotrophoblasts transform their adhesion receptor phenotype so as to resemble the endothelial cells they replace. Cytotrophoblasts in cell columns show reduced E-cadherin staining and express VE-(endothelial) cadherin, platelet-endothelial adhesion molecule- 1, vascular endothelial adhesion molecule- 1, and alpha- 4 -integrins. Cytotrophoblasts in the uterine interstitium and maternal vasculature continue to express these receptors, and, like endothelial cells during angiogenesis, also stain for alphaVbeta 3. In functional studies, alphaVbeta 3 and VE-cadherin enhance, while E-cadherin restrains, cytotrophoblast invasiveness. Cytotrophoblasts expressing alpha 4 integrins bound immobilized VCAM- 1 in vitro, suggesting that this receptor-pair could mediate cytotrophoblast-endothelium or cytotrophoblast-cytotrophoblast interactions in vivo, during endovascular invasion. In the pregnancy disorder preeclampsia, in which endovascular invasion remains superficial, cytotrophoblasts fail to express most of these endothelial markers (Zhou et al., 1997. J. Clin. Invest. 99 : 2152 - 2164.), suggesting that this adhesion phenotype switch is required for successful endovascular invasion and normal placentation...|$|R
30|$|The {{bactericidal}} {{effect of}} metal ions, especially copper and silver ions, {{is a well}} known phenomenon which has been recognized for centuries (Dollwet and Sorenson 1985). Pure copper and silver films have to be discussed critically in orthopedic and trauma surgery where tissue integration is essential for permanent implants, because the permanent long-term release of ions may result in reduced tissue integration of the implant and a pronounced “immuno-incompetent fibro-inflammatory zone” (Gristina 1994). Modification of the biocompatible TiO 2 -coating by copper incorporation is hence only one possibility to create antibacterial properties. In this respect, amongst others silver-coated orthopaedic implants have been studied. In animal experiments {{as well as in}} a prospective clinical trial a reduced infection rate was thereby observed (Hardes et al. 2010; Gosheger et al. 2004). However, this very silver coating may not be applied to the prosthetic <b>stem,</b> i.e. the <b>anchoring</b> parts of the prosthesis (Hardes et al. 2010). On the other hand, with the presented copper-loaded TiO 2 surface coating, infection prevention could be achieved in the perioperative period, combined with excellent biocompatibility that allows coating of implant parts made for implant fixation in bone and other tissues. Furthermore, the remaining biocompatible surface coating could improve immuno-competence at the interface between implant and host tissue reducing both the risk for infection and aseptic loosening (Gristina 1994).|$|R
40|$|Formation of motile sperm in Drosophila melanogaster {{requires}} {{the coordination of}} processes such as stem cell division, mitotic and meiotic control and structural reorganization of a cell. Proper execution of spermato-genesis entails the differentiation of cells derived from two distinct embryonic lineages, the germ line and the somatic mesoderm. Through an analysis of homozygous viable and fertile enhancer detector lines, we have identified molecular markers for the different cell types present in testes. Some lines label germ cells or somatic cyst cells in a stage-specific manner during then-differentiation program. These expression patterns reveal transient identities for the cyst cells {{that had not been}} previously recognized by morphological criteria. A marker line labels early stages of male but not female germ cell differentiation and proves useful in the analysis of germ line sex-determination. Other lines label the hub of somatic cells around which germ line <b>stem</b> cells are <b>anchored.</b> By analyzing the fate of the somatic hub hi an agametic background, we show that the germ line plays some role in directing its size and its position in the test is. We also describe how marker lines enable us to identify presumptive cells in the embryonic gonadal mesoderm before they give rise to morphologi-cally distinct cell types. Finally, this collection of marker lines will allow the characterization of genes expressed either in the germ line or in the soma during spermato-genesis...|$|R
