40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between wind energy turbines and the grid results in two main problems, increasing the short-circuit level {{and reducing the}} Fault Ride-Through (FRT) capability during faults. The objective {{of this paper is}} to solve these problems, for fixed speed Wind Energy Systems (WECS), utilizing the bridge-type Fault Current Limiter (FCL) with a discharging resistor. A <b>simple</b> <b>cascaded</b> control system is proposed for the FCL to regulate the terminal voltage of the generator and limit the current.

40|$|We {{present a}} <b>simple</b> <b>cascading</b> {{algorithm}} for rapid hierarchical image segmentation based on perceptually driven contour completion and scene statistics. We {{start with an}} initial fine-scale segmentation of an image obtained by perceptual completion of partial contours into polygonal regions using region-contour correspondences established by Delaunay triangulation of edge pixels. The resulting polygon size distribution is analyzed for a dominant mode of granularity of the image. Polygons whose sizes are {{less than or equal}} to this granularity are merged with their spectrally closest neighbors to obtain the next level of polygonal segments in the hierarchy. The iterative application of this process precipitates textured regions as polygons with highly convolved boundaries and helps distinguish them from objects which typically have more regular boundaries. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel type of {{frequency}} responses of ultra-wideband (UWB) bandpass filter is presented. Different {{from the traditional}} Chebyshev transfer function filters, the in-band reflection lobes can be theoretically controlled and realized to be a dome-shaped envelope filtering responses. The amplitude of reflection coefficients near the band edge can be easily assigned to be lower than those near the center operating frequency, which {{is very important for}} reducing the sensitivity of manufacture errors and thus promotes the industrial mass production. The filter using <b>simple</b> <b>cascaded</b> topology with shunt short-circuited stubs is designed based on the modified design procedure. Because of the existing of the discontinuities of T-junction, the practical design issues have also addressed accordingly. Finally, a prototype of our proposed UWB bandpass filter is designed and demonstrated.

40|$|A {{useful tool}} {{in the design of}} {{reliable}} digital communication systems is channel coding. Turbo codes have been shown to yield an outstanding coding gain close to theoretical limits in the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. In this paper, a novel DC-free turbo coding scheme using Maximum A Posteriori algorithm (MAP) / Soft Output Viterbi Algorithm (SOVA) for the turbo decoder is presented. The proposed scheme achieves the DC-free coding and errorcorrecting capability simultaneously. The scheme has a <b>simple</b> <b>cascaded</b> structure of the running digital sum (RDS) control encoder and the turbo encoder. A given sequence becomes DC-free if and only if the absolute RDS value of the sequence is bounded by a constant for any time instant. The RDS control encoder generates a sequence which gives the turbo coded sequence with a bounded RDS value. The structure allows us to exploit efficient soft-decision decoding which attains additional coding gains compared with hard-decision decoding over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel...|$|R
50|$|When {{the canal}} was built, {{it was made}} quite wide, and the locks were all {{constructed}} on the northern side of the canal, rather than centrally to the channel, as most locks built previously on the BCN had been. This was probably to make the task of duplicating them easier, if this became necessary. This arrangement created a large lagoon on the southern side of the lock, {{at the end of}} which a <b>simple</b> <b>cascade</b> weir allowed surplus water to flow into the next pound. The lagoons increased the volume of water in the short pounds. The locks were built with a single gate at the top and at the bottom, whereas most locks built previously on the BCN had double gates at the bottom end of the lock.|$|E
50|$|During the 2004 Zhuhai Air Show, SCAIC {{revealed}} {{its latest}} WS-2 multiple launch rocket system. The weapon is fitted with 6 box-shape launchers and fires 400mm rockets {{to a maximum}} range of 200 km, however some sources claim {{that it might be}} up to 350 km. This enables the PLA to strike the west coast of Taiwan, including the capital Taipei. It is speculated that WS-2 {{is going to be a}} cheaper alternative to the expensive short range ballistic missiles in Chinese inventory. The WS-2 is fitted with a <b>simple</b> <b>cascade</b> inertial terminal guidance to compensate for the degraded accuracy caused by the long distance flight of the rocket. In 2008, it was revealed that sub-munitions are developed for WS-2, including a specialized anti-radar version, which is a rocket containing three UAVs. Once the rocket is fired to the target area, the UAVs are released the same way like other sub-munitions. The seekers would seek out target radar signals as UAVs began to cruise, and once locked on to the radar, UAV would home in and attack. Some domestic Chinese military enthusiasts have claimed such technology was based on the principle of Israeli Harpy anti-radar UAVs, but this could not be confirmed by independent sources outside China.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Modelling is a {{valuable}} tool for hydrological study. Models vary in their numerical and parametric complexity, input requirements, possible response variables, and the certainty of the outputs. Model selection therefore depends on the available data for input parameters, the desired outputs, and computational resources. ‘HILLS’, a physically-based distributed model, was used in previous research into hillslope hydrology in south-east Australia. The study investigated the sensitivity of soil, topography, and rainfall to generating subsurface lateral flow. Model instability and overparameterisation created uncertainty in the results. Consequently for further study into hillslope hydrology in south-east Australia, a <b>simple</b> <b>cascading</b> bucket model was developed, using data from a field monitoring site near Holbrook, New South Wales. The detailed field information enabled model validation on the runoff and subsurface lateral flow from the hillslope outlet, as well as water redistribution within the hillslope, reflected by the soil moisture content and depth of watertables. This paper provides {{a description of the}} cascading model...|$|R
40|$|Considering a {{preferential}} selection {{mechanism of}} load destination, we {{introduce a new}} method to quantify initial load distribution and subsequently construct a <b>simple</b> <b>cascading</b> model. By attacking the node with the highest load, we investigate the cascading dynamics in some synthetic networks. Surprisingly, we observe that for several networks of different structural patterns, a counterintuitive phenomenon emerges if the highest load attack {{is applied to the}} system, i. e., investing more resources to protect every node in a network inversely makes the whole network more vulnerable. We explain this ability paradox by analyzing the micro-structural components of the underlying network and therefore reveals how specific structural patterns may influence the cascading dynamics. We discover that the robustness of the network oscillates as the capacity of each node increases. The conclusion of the paper may shed lights on future investigations to avoid the demonstrated ability paradox and subsequent cascading failures in real-world networks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cascaded coil flux control {{based on a}} Current Source Parallel Resonant Push-Pull Inverter (CSPRPI) for Induction Heating (IH) applications. The most important problems associated with current source parallel resonant inverters are start-up problems and the variable response of IH systems under load variations. This paper proposes a <b>simple</b> <b>cascaded</b> control method to increase an IH system’s robustness to load variations. The proposed IH has been analyzed in both the steady state and the transient state. Based on this method, the resonant frequency is tracked using Phase Locked Loop (PLL) circuits using a Multiplier Phase Detector (MPD) to achieve ZVS under the transient condition. A laboratory prototype was built with an operating frequency of 57 - 59 kHz and a rated power of 300 W. Simulation and experimental results verify {{the validity of the}} proposed power control method and the PLL dynamics.

40|$|Requirements on {{switching}} and interconnection fabrics inside switching equipment, high-performance computers and datacenters {{of the future}} are {{getting more and more}} demanding in terms of throughput and power saving.

40|$|Community {{detection}} is {{the process}} of assigning nodes and links in significant communities (e. g. clusters, function modules) and its development has led {{to a better understanding of}} complex networks. When applied to sizable networks, we argue that most detection algorithms correctly identify prominent communities, but fail to do so across multiple scales. As a result, a significant fraction of the network is left uncharted. We show that this problem stems from larger or denser communities overshadowing smaller or sparser ones, and that this effect accounts for most of the undetected communities and unassigned links. We propose a generic cascading approach to community detection that circumvents the problem. Using real and artificial network datasets with three widely used community detection algorithms, we show how a <b>simple</b> <b>cascading</b> procedure allows for the detection of the missing communities. This work highlights a new detection limit of community structure, and we hope that our approach can inspire better community detection algorithms.

40|$|A new characteristic-based {{method for}} the {{solution}} of the 2 D laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is presented. For coupling the continuity and momentum equations, the artificial compressibility formulation is employed. The primitives variables (pressure and velocity components) are defined as functions of their values on the characteristics. The primitives variables on the characteristics are calculated by an upwind differencing scheme based on the sign of the local eignevalue of the Jacobian matrix of the convective fluxes. The upwind scheme uses interpolation formulae of third-order accuracy. The time discretization is obtained by the explicit Runge-Kutta method. Validation of the characteristics-based method is performed on two different cases: the flow in a <b>simple</b> <b>cascade</b> and the flow over a backward-facing step...|$|E

Focusing on stated price limits corresponding to urn predictions in line with both, standard and error BHW models our data indicate that the inclusion of errors does not significantly improve the explanatory power of the standar...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the fundamental question: how a legacy "student" Artificial Intelligent (AI) system {{could learn from}} a legacy "teacher" AI system or a human expert without complete re-training and, most importantly, without requiring significant computational resources. Here "learning" is understood as an ability of one system to mimic responses of the other and vice-versa. We call such learning an Artificial Intelligence knowledge transfer. We show that if internal variables of the "student" Artificial Intelligent system have the structure of an n-dimensional topological vector space and n is sufficiently high then, with probability close to one, the required knowledge transfer can be implemented by <b>simple</b> <b>cascades</b> of linear functionals. In particular, for n sufficiently large, with probability close to one, the "student" system can successfully and non-iteratively learn k≪ n new examples from the "teacher" (or correct {{the same number of}} mistakes) at the cost of two additional inner products.
