In this work, nanoscale apertures are produced using focused-ion-beam (FIB) nulling of Si cantilevers, and mask location is defined using a piezoelectrically-driven scanning stage.

This antenna uses a combination of aperture-coupled technique and stacked patch {{in order for the}} radiating elements to increase the bandwidth. Two shapes (I-shape and H-shape) and sizes of <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> are etched onto the ground with a purpose to couple the energy between feedline and stacked patch. One PIN diode switch is integrated in the feed network to control the length of the feedline. A variation of the feedline length controls the selected <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> to be active.

40|$|Abstract—A {{generalized}} {{equivalent circuit}} model for waveguide transverse slots is {{proposed for the}} efficient analysis of waveguide transitions and waveguide slot antennas and slot-excited antennas. The transverse slots on the broad and end waveguide walls analyzed in this paper are decomposed into three structures: two apertures and an auxiliary waveguide section. The <b>slot</b> <b>aperture</b> in the host waveguide is modeled as an inductance-capacitance-transformer (LCT) combination, for which the equivalent inductance and capacitance are determined by first considering the case of zero-thickness slot, then the transformer turns ratio is calculated for the slot on a finite thickness wall. The effect of the wall thickness is accounted for by a waveguide section having cross-sectional dimensions equal {{to those of the}} slot, and length equal to the wall thickness. The loaded <b>slot</b> <b>aperture</b> is modeled along with the external load as a lumped load impedance. Expressions for the inductance, capacitance and transformer turns ratio are obtained in terms of the slot length and width.
