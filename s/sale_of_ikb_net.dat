40|$|Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) is {{critical}} {{for the expression of}} multiple genes involved in inflammatory responses and cellular survival. NF-kB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with an inhibitor <b>of</b> NF-kB (<b>IkB),</b> but inflammatory stimulation induces proteasomal degradation <b>of</b> <b>IkB,</b> followed by NF-kB nuclear translocation. The degradation <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> is mediated by a SCF (Skp 1 -Cullin 1 -F-box protein) -type ubiquitin ligase complex that is post-translationaly modified by a ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd 8. In this study, we report that BRCA 1 -associated protein 2 (Brap 2) is a novel Nedd 8 -binding protein that interacts with SCF complex, and is involved in NF-kB translocation following TNF-a stimulation. We also found a putative neddylation site in Brap 2 associated with NF-kB activity. Our findings suggest that Brap 2 is a novel modulator that associates with SCF complex and controls TNF-a-induced NF-kB nuclear translocation...|$|R
40|$|A primary {{level of}} control for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is {{effected}} through its interactions with the inhibitor protein, inhibitor <b>of</b> kappa B (<b>IkB).</b> Several lines <b>of</b> evidence confirm the existence of multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> that appear to regulate NF-kB by distinct mechanisms. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to understand the evolutionary history and intrinsic functional diversity <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> family members. Phylogenetic relationships were constructed to trace the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>IkB</b> family genes. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 IkB subfamily members that clustered into 5 major clades. Since the ankyrin (ANK) domain {{appears to be more}} ancient than the Rel homology domain (RHD), our phylogenetic analysis suggests that some undefined ancestral set of ANK repeats acquired an RHD before any duplication and was later duplicated and then diverged into the different IkB subfamilies. Functional analysis identified several functionally divergent sites in the ANK repeat domains (ARDs) and revealed that this region has undergone strong purifying selection, suggesting its functional importance in IkB genes. Structural analysis showed that the major variations in the number of ANK repeats and high conformational changes in the finger loop ARD region contribute to the differing binding partner specificities, thereby leading to distinct IkB functions. In summary, our study has provided useful information about the phylogeny and structural and functional divergence <b>of</b> the <b>IkB</b> family. Additionally, we identified a number of amin...|$|R

40|$|The prosurvival {{transcription}} factorNF-kB specifically binds promoterDNA {{to activate}} target gene expression. NF-kB is regulated through interactions with IkB inhibitor proteins. Active proteolysis <b>of</b> these <b>IkB</b> proteins is, in turn, {{under the control}} <b>of</b> the <b>IkB</b> kinase complex (IKK). Together, these three molecules form the NF-kB signaling module. Studies aimed at charac-terizing the molecular mechanisms <b>of</b> NF-kB, <b>IkB,</b> and IKK {{in terms of their}} three-dimen-sional structures have lead to a greater understanding of this vital transcription factor system. NF-kB is a master transcription factor thatresponds to diverse cell stimuli by activat-ing the expression of stress response genes. Multiple signals, including cytokines, growth factors, engagement of the T-cell receptor, and bacterial and viral products, induce NF-kB transcriptional activity (Hayden and Ghosh 2008).

40|$|Aspirin {{has been}} {{reported}} to inhibit the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) through stabilization <b>of</b> inhibitor kB (<b>IkB).</b> This observation led us to investigate the role of aspirin in suppressing the activation of the NF-kB-regulated tumor ne-crosis factor-a (TNF-a) gene expression in primary macro-phages. We now report that therapeutic doses of aspirin sup-press lipopolysaccharide-inducible NF-kB binding to an NF-kB binding site in the TNF-a promoter, lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-a mRNA accumulation, and protein secretion. IkB is also stabilized under these conditions. The aspirin-initiated stabili-zation <b>of</b> <b>IkB,</b> suppression <b>of</b> induced TNF-a mRNA, and NF-kB binding to the TNF-a promoter are blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. These studies suggest that aspirin may exert significant anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the production of macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators...|$|R
40|$|Background: NF-kB, a major {{transcription}} factor involved in mammalian inflammatory signaling, is primarily involved in regulation {{of response to}} inflammatory cytokines and pathogens. Its levels are tightly regulated since uncontrolled inflammatory response can cause serious diseases. Mathematical models have been useful in revealing the underlying mechanisms, the dynamics, {{and other aspects of}} regulation in NF-kB signaling. The recognition that miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, and that a number of miRNAs target different components of the NF-kB network, motivate the incorporation of miRNA regulated steps in existing mathematical models to help understand the quantitative aspects of miRNA mediated regulation. Methodology/Principal findings: In this study, two separate scenarios of miRNA regulation within an existing model are considered. In the first, miRNAs target adaptor proteins involved in the synthesis of IKK that serves as the NF-kB activator. In the second, miRNAs target different isoforms <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> that act as NF-kB inhibitors. Simulations are carried out under two different conditions: when all three isoforms <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> are present (wild type), and when only one isoform (IkBa) is present (knockout type). In both scenarios, oscillations in the NF-kB levels are observed and are found to be dependent on the levels of miRNAs. Conclusions/Significance: Computational modeling can provide fresh insights into intricate regulatory processes. Th...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophils play {{a central}} role in asthma. The present study was {{performed}} to investigate the effect of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) on longevity of isolated human eosinophils. In contrast to Fas, TNF-a inhibited eosinophil apoptosis as evidenced by a combination of flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation assay and morphological analyses. The effect of TNF-a on eosinophil apoptosis was reversed by a TNF-a neutralising antibody. The anti-apoptotic effect of TNF-a was not due to autocrine release of known survival-prolonging cytokines interleukins 3 and 5 or granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor as their neutralisation did not affect the effect of TNF-a. The anti-apoptotic signal was mediated mainly by the TNF-receptor 1. TNF-a induced phosphorylation and degradation <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> and an increase in NF-kB DNA-binding activity. The survival-prolonging effect of TNF-a was reversed by inhibitors of NF-kB pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and gliotoxin and by an inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> kinase, BMS- 345541. TNF-a induced also an increase in AP- 1 DNA-binding activity and the antiapoptotic effect of TNF-a was potentiated by inhibitors of AP- 1, SR 11302 and tanshinone IIA and by an inhibitor of c-jun-N-terminal kinase, SP 600125, which is an upstream kinase activating AP- 1. Our results thus suggest that TNF-a delays human eosinophil apoptosis via TNF-receptor 1 and the resulting changes in longevity depend on yin-yang balanc...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian cancer, one of inflammation-associated cancers, is {{the fifth}} leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Inflammation in the tumor {{microenvironment}} is associated with peritoneal tumor dissemination and massive ascites, which contribute to high mortality in ovarian cancer. Tumor suppressor p 53 is frequently deleted or mutated in aggressive and high-grade ovarian cancer, probably aggravating cancer progression and increasing mortality. We therefore investigated the influence of p 53 on proinflammatory chemokines in ovarian cancer cells. A PCR array of the chemokine network revealed that ovarian cancer cells with low or mutated p 53 expression expressed high levels of proinflammatory chemokines such as CXCL 1, 2, 3 and 8. Transient transfection of p 53 into p 53 -null ovarian cancer cells downregulated proinflammatory chemokines induced by tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine abundantly expressed in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, p 53 restoration or stabilization blocked TNF-induced NF-kB promoter activity and reduced TNF-activated <b>IkB.</b> Restoration <b>of</b> p 53 increased ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>IkB,</b> resulting from concurrently reduced proteasome activity followed by stability <b>of</b> <b>IkB.</b> A ubiquitination PCR array on restoration of p 53 did not reveal any significant change in expression except for Mdm 2, indicating that the balance between p 53 and Mdm 2 is more important in regulating NF-kB signaling rather than the direct effect of p 53 on ubiquitin-related genes or IkB kinases. In addition, nutlin- 3, a specific inducer of p 53 stabilization, inhibited proinflammatory chemokines by reducing TNF-activated IkB through p 5...|$|R

40|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} an inflammation-associated {{malignancy}} {{with a high}} mortality rate. CXCR 2 expressing ovarian cancers are aggressive with poorer outcomes. We therefore investigated molecular mechanisms involved in CXCR 2 -driven cancer progression by comparing CXCR 2 positive and negative ovarian cancer cell lines. Stably CXCR 2 transfected SKOV- 3 cells had a faster growth rate as compared to control cells transfected with empty vector. Particularly, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), abundantly expressed in ovarian cancer, enhanced cell proliferation by decreasing the G 0 -G 1 phase in CXCR 2 transfected cells. TNF increased nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activity {{to a greater degree}} in CXCR 2 transfected cells than control cells as well as provided a greater activation <b>of</b> <b>IkB.</b> CXCR 2 transfected cells expressed higher levels of its proinflammatory ligands, CXCL 1 / 2 and enhanced more proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation. CXCR 2 positive cells also activated more EGFR, which led to higher Akt activation. Enhanced NF-kB activity in CXCR 2 positive cells was reduced by a PI 3 K/Akt inhibitor rather than an Erk inhibitor. CXCL 1 added to CXCR 2 positive cells led to an increased activation <b>of</b> <b>IkB.</b> CXCL 1 also led to a significantly greater number of invasive cells in CXCR 2 transfected cells, which was blocked by the NF-kB inhibitor, Bay 11 - 7082. In addition, enhanced cell proliferation in CXCR 2 positive cells was more sensitive to CXCL 1 antibody or an NF-kB inhibitor. Finally, CXCR 2 transfection of parental cells increased CXCL 1 promoter activity via an NF-kB site.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the consequences of overexpression of the IkBa and IkBb inhibitory proteins on the regulation of NF-kB-dependent beta interferon (IFN-b) gene transcription in human cells after Sendai virus infection. In transient coexpression studies or in cell lines engineered to express different forms <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> under tetracycline-inducible control, the IFN-b promoter (2281 to 119) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltrans-ferase reporter gene was differentially inhibited in response to virus infection. IkBa exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on virus-induced IFN-b expression, whereas IkBb exerted an inhibitory effect only at a high concentration. Despite activation <b>of</b> the <b>IkB</b> kinase complex by Sendai virus infection, overexpression of the double-point-mutated (S 32 A/S 36 A) dominant repressors of IkBa (TD-IkBa) completely blocked IFN-b gene activation by Sendai virus. Endogenous IFN-b RNA production was also inhibited in Tet-inducible TD-IkBa-expressing cells. Inhibition of IFN-b expression directly correlated with {{a reduction in the}} binding of NF-kB (p 50 -RelA) complex to PRDII after Sendai virus infection in IkBa-expressing cells, whereas IFN-b expression and NF-kB binding were only slightly reduced in IkBb-expressing cells. These experiments demonstrate a major role for IkBa in the regulation of NF-kB-induced IFN-b gene activation and a minor role for IkBb in the activation process.

40|$|SummarySUMO {{conjugation}} to proteins {{is involved}} in the regulation of diverse cellular functions. We have identified a protein, RWD-containing sumoylation enhancer (RSUME), that enhances overall SUMO- 1, - 2, and - 3 conjugation by interacting with the SUMO conjugase Ubc 9. RSUME increases noncovalent binding of SUMO- 1 to Ubc 9 and enhances Ubc 9 thioester formation and SUMO polymerization. RSUME enhances the sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> in vitro and in cultured cells, leading to an inhibition of NF-kB transcriptional activity. RSUME is induced by hypoxia and enhances the sumoylation of HIF- 1 α, promoting its stabilization and transcriptional activity during hypoxia.
