5|$|There is {{no single}} British {{language}}, though English {{is by far the}} main language spoken by British citizens, being spoken monolingually by more than 70% of the UK population. English is therefore the de facto official language of the United Kingdom. However, under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Welsh, <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic,</b> Cornish, Irish Gaelic, Ulster Scots, Manx, and Lowland Scots languages are officially recognised as Regional or Minority languages by the UK Government. As indigenous languages which continue to be spoken as a first language by native inhabitants, Welsh and <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic</b> have a different legal status from other minority languages. In some parts of the UK, some of these languages are commonly spoken as a first language; in wider areas, their use in a bilingual context is sometimes supported and/or promoted by central and/or local government policy. For naturalisation purposes, a competence standard of English, <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic</b> or Welsh is required to pass the life in the United Kingdom test. However, English is used routinely, and although considered culturally important, <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic</b> and Welsh are much less used.|$|E

5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic,</b> as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.

5|$|The Outer Hebrides have {{historically}} been a very strong <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic</b> (Gàidhlig) speaking area. Both the 1901 and 1921 census reported that all parishes were over 75% Gaelic speaking, including areas of high population density such as Stornoway. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 mandated English-only education, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school.

5|$|The two {{official}} {{languages of}} the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language {{has produced a}} noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for over two thousand years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{speakers}} of Goidelic languages in the Inner Hebrides {{since the time}} of Columba or before, and the modern variant of <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic</b> (Gàidhlig) remains strong in some parts. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. Children were being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school as late as the 1930s. More recently the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament in 2005 in order to provide continuing support for the language.|$|E
5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, popular {{education}} was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of <b>Scottish</b> <b>Gaelic,</b> the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the Highlands was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.|$|E

The practical part is based on research carried out by means of questionnaires. It contains a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the results which were obtained from the English respondents. The results of the research are represented in charts and graphs. Finally, the results of the research are interpreted and analyzed. The thesis contains a dictionary of <b>Scottish</b> and <b>Gaelic</b> expressions which was compiled for the creation of the questionnaire and is enclosed in the appendix...|$|R
