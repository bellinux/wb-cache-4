40|$|Dynamic {{localization}} {{failure of}} a thin sheet made of AISI 316 H steel is considered on the macroscopic and mesoscopic level for proportional and nonproportional stress paths. On the macroscopic level, we propose: (1) the replacement of time as independent variable by a function of plastic dissipation and (2) dependence of the initial equivalent yield stress on stress rate. On the mesoscopic level - the regularized Schmid model for description of the single grain behavior is used and the polycrystalline yield surface generated by the texture development enables to improve the Forming Limit Diagrams for the <b>sheet</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E
40|$|We present here a brief {{survey of}} vortex-dynamical {{simulations}} {{of the plane}} mixing layer using different forms of vortex elements. Points and blobs, which {{have been widely used}} in the past, suffer from irregular evolution of the vortex sheet approximating the shear layer, and the rather long time-averaging required to obtain meaningful statistics.

In particular, this technique avoids the singularity in induced velocity associated with point vortex techniques, and is therefore in no need of any form of the amp;ldquo;desingularizationamp;rdquo; that is often introduced in the latter.

However, the information about the discontinuity in normal direction is incorporated into the basis functions of the volume elements that are connected to the <b>sheet</b> <b>elements.</b> The determination of the normal variation can be reduced to a 1 D problem which can be solved analytically. No double layers or global asymptotic expansions are required. The advantages with respect to the condition number of the system matrix are shown for a magneto-quasistatic test scenario...|$|R

40|$|A resilient, flexible, pressure-activated, {{high-temperature}} seal {{is adapted}} to be interposed {{between high and low}} pressure regions to provide sealing between opposing surfaces of adjacent relatively movable structures. The seal comprises at least one C-shaped <b>sheet</b> <b>element.</b> The C-shaped element design enables the seal to be pressure-activated to provide a radially outward biasing force, responsive to a seal-activating pressure differential acting across the seal thereby increasing resiliency. A centrally-located, resilient core structure provides load bearing and insulating properties. In an exemplary embodiment where at least two seal elements are used, each layer has a cutout slot pattern and the remaining strip material pattern. The slots provide flexibility to the seal, enabling the seal to be manually contoured to seal around corners and curves. The strip material of each layer covers the slots in each adjacent layer to minimize leakage through the slots. Attached barrier strips can block interface leakage between the seal and the opposing surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} total construction and transportation cost and difficulties associated with handling massive structural components or assemblies, there has been increasing financial pressure to reduce structural weight. Furthermore, advances in material technology coupled with continuing advances in design tools and techniques have encouraged engineers to vary and combine materials, offering new opportunities to reduce the weight of mechanical structures. These new lower mass systems, however, {{are more susceptible to}} inherent imbalances, a weakness that can result in higher shock and harmonic resonances which leads to poor structural dynamic performances.

40|$|SummaryThe HIV {{envelope}} glycoprotein (Env) trimer undergoes receptor-induced conformational changes that drive fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Env conformational {{changes have been}} observed using low-resolution electron microscopy, but only large-scale rearrangements have been visible. Here, we use hydrogen-deuterium exchange and oxidative labeling to gain a more precise understanding of the unliganded and CD 4 -bound forms of soluble Env trimers (SOSIP. 664), including their glycan composition. CD 4 activation induces the reorganization of bridging <b>sheet</b> <b>elements,</b> V 1 /V 2 and V 3, much of the gp 120 inner domain, and the gp 41 fusion subunit. Two CD 4 binding site-targeted inhibitors have substantially different effects: NBD- 556 partially mimics CD 4 -induced destabilization of the V 1 /V 2 and V 3 crown, whereas BMS- 806 only affects regions around the gp 120 /gp 41 interface.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle filter elements can be used directly as inverted candle filter elements, {{and the development of a}} new type of filter element is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle filter elements were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle filter elements, and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle filter elements are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of <b>sheet</b> filter <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina <b>sheet</b> filter <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic <b>sheet</b> filter <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic <b>sheet</b> filter <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of <b>sheet</b> filter <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, filter element fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R
