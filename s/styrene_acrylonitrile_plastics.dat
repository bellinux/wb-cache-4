25|$|Several other {{copolymers}} {{are also}} used with <b>styrene.</b> <b>Acrylonitrile</b> butadiene <b>styrene</b> or ABS plastic is similar to HIPS: a copolymer of <b>acrylonitrile</b> and <b>styrene,</b> toughened with polybutadiene. Most electronics cases are made of this form of polystyrene, as are many sewer pipes. SAN is a copolymer of <b>styrene</b> with <b>acrylonitrile,</b> and SMA one with maleic anhydride. Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers; for example, divinylbenzene {{can be used for}} cross-linking the polystyrene chains to give the polymer used in Solid phase peptide synthesis.|$|R
50|$|ABS {{is derived}} from <b>acrylonitrile,</b> butadiene, and <b>styrene.</b> <b>Acrylonitrile</b> is a {{synthetic}} monomer produced from propylene and ammonia; butadiene is a petroleum hydrocarbon obtained from the C4 fraction of steam cracking; styrene monomer is made by dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene — a hydrocarbon obtained in the reaction of ethylene and benzene.|$|R

40|$|The {{initiation}} {{steps in}} the copolymerization of <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile</b> with t-butoxyl radicals have been investigated using the nitroxide trapping technique. t-Butoxyl radicals add to styrene Eve times more rapidly than to acrylonitrile whereas methyl radicals, formed by beta-fragmentation of t-butoxyl radicals, add to acrylonitrile about four times faster than to <b>styrene.</b> <b>Acrylonitrile</b> also reacts fast with first generation styryl radical end groups. Trapped products containing both monomers can only be observed, however, by operating at very low nitroxide trap concentrations. This has been achieved by using a syringe pump to feed nitroxide trap to the reaction mixture at a controlled rate. Some information on rate constants for second monomer addition has been obtained. Solvent effects on the relative rates of addition of t-butoxyl radicals have been observed and discussed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{concurrent}} use of <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile</b> {{as raw materials}} {{in the production of}} synthetic resins and plastic and their associated differences in physiochemical properties and biodegradability, our experiments were conducted in a three-stage downflow bench-scale biofilter to study the potential suppressive effects of <b>acrylonitrile</b> on <b>styrene</b> removal. A Mixture of yard waste compost and shredded plastics and activated sludge was used as bed media. Gas phase concentration of <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile</b> was determined via gas chromatographic analysis. Under steady-state conditions, maximum elimination capacity of <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile</b> was 44 and 120 g/ m 3 h, respectively. The effect of moisture was very significant in reducing the specific adsorptive capacity (µg/g of bed media) of <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile.</b> The bed media with 60 % moisture content lost styrene absorption capacities by more than one order of magnitude when compared to dry media. The existence of water increased the absorption capacity of medium for acrylonitrile about 95 %. Styrene elimination capacity of the biofilter during co-treatment was less as compared to pure styrene biodegradation indicating the likelihood of inhibitory kinetics. Introduction of acrylonitrile into the air stream reduced elimination capacity of styrene to 103 g/m 3 h. The adverse impact on removal rate of acrylonitrile due to the presence of styrene in the gas stream was minimal. Carbon...|$|R
40|$|Reductive demercuration of benzylmercuric {{chloride}} in CH_ 2 Cl_ 2 solutions affords toluene and bibenzyl {{as major}} products in {{a ratio of}} ca. 4 : 3. In similar solutions that contain <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile,</b> one obtains not only toluene and bibenzyl but also 1, 3 -diphenylpropane (ll), 1, 2, 4 -triphenylbutane (12), 4 -phenylbutyronitrile (13), and 2 -benzyl- 4 -phenylbutyronitrile (14). Each of these products can be rationalized {{on the basis of}} a reaction scheme in which addition of the benzyl radical to <b>styrene</b> or <b>acrylonitrile</b> is followed by trapping of the adduct by transfer of a hydrogen atom or a benzyl fragment. The product ratios 11 : 12 and 13 : 14 were found to be independent of reaction conditions within the range of conditions employed in this work. The relative rates of addition of <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile</b> (k_s/k_A) were determined by analysis of relative product yields as a function of the relative starting concentrations of <b>styrene</b> and <b>acrylonitrile.</b> We find k_s/k_A = 0. 33 ± 0. 04, a result that is consistent with the known selectivity of the 1 -phenylethyl radical and that falls within the range of published reactivity ratios for styrene in its copolymerization with acrylonitrile. These results support the use of the mercury method as a source of simple, reliable models for the macroradicals involved in the growth of copolymer chains...|$|R
50|$|A more {{specific}} example {{comes in the}} form of a piano key made from injection moulded <b>styrene</b> <b>acrylonitrile</b> (SAN). The key has a hook end which connects it to a metal spring, which causes the key to spring back into position after being struck. During assembly of the piano an adhesive was used, and excess adhesive which had spilled onto areas where it was not required was removed using a ketone solvent. Some vapour from this solvent condensed on the internal surface of the piano keys. Some time after this cleaning, fracture occurred at the junction where the hook end meets the spring.|$|R
50|$|Acrylonitrile is used principally as a monomer {{to prepare}} polyacrylonitrile, a homopolymer, or several {{important}} copolymers, such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), <b>acrylonitrile</b> butadiene <b>styrene</b> (ABS), <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>styrene</b> acrylate (ASA), and other synthetic rubbers such as acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR). Dimerization of acrylonitrile affords adiponitrile, {{used in the}} synthesis of certain polyamides. Small amounts are also used as a fumigant. Acrylonitrile and derivatives, such as 2-chloro-acrylonitrile, are dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions.
