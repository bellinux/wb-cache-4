Also, we show that every two close points of D <b>sufficiently</b> <b>close</b> to the boundary and whose difference is almost tangential to bD can {{be joined by a}} (unique up to reparameterization) complex geodesic of D which is also a holomorphic retract of D. The same continues to hold if D is a worm domain, as long as the points are <b>sufficiently</b> <b>close</b> to a strongly pseudoconvex boundary point. We also show that a strongly pseudoconvex boundary point of a worm domain can be globally exposed, this has consequences for the behavior of the squeezing function...|$|R
