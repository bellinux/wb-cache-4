50|$|The {{bridge was}} closed between May and July 1987 after three {{suspender}} cables (connecting the deck to the overhead suspension cable) failed. All of the suspender cables were X-rayed during the closure, {{and the three}} suspender cables, along with three neighboring suspender cables were replaced, with some damage noted to all suspender cables. A draft root cause investigation identified the potential for fatigue and corrosion damage in the overhead suspension cables. The final root cause concluded in 1990 that the suspender cables had failed in fatigue {{at the top of}} the <b>socket</b> <b>connector</b> to the bridge deck. Since the fatigue was caused by swaying in the overhead suspension cables relative to the bridge deck, all suspender cables were potentially vulnerable to fatigue failure. The most cost-effective repair that would maintain the aesthetic appearance of the current structure was complete replacement of the suspender cables on a periodic basis (estimated at 20-25 years).|$|E
50|$|The Model 4 has {{the ability}} to display 640×240 or 512×192 {{high-resolution}} monochrome graphics with an optional board which attaches to a <b>socket</b> <b>connector</b> on the logic board. The Radio Shack Model 4 graphics board retailed for $249 and included a modified version of Microsoft BASIC (called BasicG) with commands for drawing basic geometric shapes and manipulating arrays in graphics RAM. The graphics screen memory was separate from the usual character screen, and the two could be displayed together or separately. A third-party company called Micro Labs based in Richardson Texas sold a compatible graphics board which was popular because it was sold for only $199 (initially). It came with a different BASIC providing for graphics commands called GBasic. Whereas the Radio Shack board had 32KB of graphics RAM, the Micro Labs board had 20KB. Since only 19,200 bytes are required to render a 640 x 240 pixel screen, the additional RAM on the Radio Shack board was available for windowing the viewable screen around a larger virtual area. The graphics RAM was accessible through four Z-80 I/O ports and was especially easy to access for uses other than graphics. For example, there was a public domain utility called Grafdisk that added the graphics memory to regular banked memory to create a larger TRSDOS ramdisk (96K on the Radio Shack board).|$|E

30|$|Concerning the Extender modules, instead, the {{attention}} has been mainly focused on the Extender socket definition, since {{the design of a}} new Extender module is something that should be realized by people willing to add a new feature. In any case, a correct and simple design of the Extender socket is necessary to foster and facilitate the development of new Extender modules. For this reason, a popular and low-cost <b>socket</b> <b>connector</b> has been considered, while exporting 50 GPIOs related to the following communication buses: I 2 C, SPI, UART, and USB. GPIOs related to MiniPCIe and Ethernet have not been exported on the Extender socket since they are considered conventional buses and interfaces to be hosted on the main board. AMBER hosts three Extender sockets to let developers combine several functionalities. Moreover, their number allow keeping the AMBER dimensions reasonable, thus allowing its installation in real laboratory testbeds.|$|E

5000|$|NuBus {{was later}} {{selected}} by Apple Computer {{for use in}} their Macintosh II project, where its plug-n-play nature fit well with the Mac philosophy of ease-of-use. It was used {{in most of the}} Macintosh II series and Macintosh Quadras that made up the professional-level Mac lineup from the late 1980s into the mid-1990s, and was upgraded to NuBus90 starting with the Macintosh Quadras. Early Quadras only supported the 20 MHz rate when two cards were talking to each other, since the motherboard controller was not upgraded. This was later addressed in the NuBus implementation on the 660AV and 840AV models. This improved NuBus controller was used in the first generation Power Macintosh 6100, 7100 and 8100 models. Later Power Mac models adopted Intel's PCI bus. Apple's NuBus implementation used pin and <b>socket</b> <b>connectors</b> {{on the back of the}} card rather than edge connectors with Phillips screws inside the case that most cards use, making it much easier to install cards. Apple's computers also supplied an always-on +5 V [...] "trickle" [...] power supply for tasks such as watching the phone line while the computer was turned off. This was apparently part of an unapproved NuBus standard.|$|R
40|$|Implementation {{of digital}} systems is usually {{carried out in}} the form of printed circuit board (PCB) {{populated}} with active components such 180 Kung and Chuah as integrated circuits and passive components such as surface mount resistors, capacitors, <b>sockets,</b> <b>connectors,</b> cables, etc. These components together with the PCB traces and metal planes form the network which manifests as a digital PCB assembly. With the increase in operating frequency of devices in access of 100 MHz and switching speed of digital devices within sub-nanoseconds, electromagnetic interference, stray parameters of components and unintentional radiation have become a major concern, affecting the integrity of a system. To cope with the issues of system performance, analog and digital circuit simulation tools are used to verify system performance in terms of signal integrity, noise margin and bandwidth under various signal patterns (vectors) and biasing during CAD layout process to ensure first-time-working prototypes. This article illustrates a structural modeling approach in which the digital PCB is considered as an assembly of parts which are modeled as electrical networks with input and output ports. The networks are linked together to form a complete system of equivalent circuit in SPICE format. Various methods have been developed by many authors [1 – 19] for modeling a certain aspect of the digital PCB system. Based on their work, the authors consolidate the methods and propose a structural approach to derive a system level equivalent circuit model for a digital PCB system. Section 2 outlines the modeling procedures using the structural approach. Section 3 gives the EM Field Method for deriving equivalent circuit models of <b>sockets,</b> <b>connectors,</b> interconnecting traces and discontinuities in PCB. Section 4 contains circuit models of discontinuities and IC buffers using measurement techniques. In Section 5, the power planes are modeled using a planar circuit approach [20]. A simple digital PCB system modeling example is presented in Section 6 to illustrate the proposed approach. Detailed system simulation is carried out using SPICE Version 6. 1 on an IBM compatible PC. Both time and frequency domain simulations are performed. Areas of large current concentration in the power plane at any instance can be located. This allows one to determine the optimum location to install decoupling capacitors and filters to suppress EMI. An IC in the system is then replaced with a power validator. The power validator is a programmable load having the same footprint as the IC. It simulates the IC, drawing varying amount of current from the power distribution systems. An equivalent circuit is derived and SPICE simulation is performed to study the noise introduced by the die within the IC...|$|R
