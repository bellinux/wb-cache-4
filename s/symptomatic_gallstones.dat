40|$|Background: Previous small {{studies have}} shown either no {{difference}} or a lower risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians. Objectives: This study examined the incidence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease in a cohort of British vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and investigated the associations between nutrient intake and risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease. Subjects/Methods: Data were analysed from 49, 652 adults enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -Oxford study, one third of whom were vegetarian. Linked databases of hospital records were used to identify incident cases. Risk by diet group was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Further analysis quantified risk by intakes of selected macronutrients. Results: There were 1, 182 cases of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease during 687, 822 person years of follow-up (mean= 13. 85 years). There was a large significant association between increasing body mass index (BMI) and risk of developing <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease (overall trend p< 0. 001). After adjustment for BMI and other risk factors vegetarians had a moderately increased risk compared with non-vegetarians (HR 1. 22; 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 41; p= 0. 006). Although starch consumption was positively associated with gallstones risk (p= 0. 002 for trend) it did not explain the increased risk in vegetarians. Conclusion: There is a highly significant association of increased BMI with risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The authors prospectively {{examined}} {{the association between}} bowel movement frequency (used {{as a proxy for}} intestinal transit), laxative use, and the risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease. METHODS: A total of 79, 829 women, aged 36 – 61 yr, without a history of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease and free of cancer, responded to a mailed questionnaire in 1982 that assessed bowel movement frequency and use of laxatives. Between 1984 and 1996, 4, 443 incident cases of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease were documented. Relative risks (RRs) of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: After controlling for age and established risk factors, the multivariate RRs were, compared to women with daily bowel movements, 0. 97 (95 % CI 0. 86 – 1. 08) for women with bowel movements every third day or less, and 1. 00 (95 % CI 0. 91 – 1. 11) for women with bowel movement more than once daily. No trend was evident. As compared to women who never used laxatives in 1982, a significant modest inverse association was seen for monthly laxative use, with a multivariate RR of 0. 84 (95 % CI 0. 72 – 0. 98), and weekly to daily laxative use was associated with a RR of 0. 88 (95 % CI 0. 78 – 1. 02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support an association between infrequent bowel movements and risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease in women, and indicate that simple questions directed at bowel movement frequency are unlikely to enhance our ability to predict risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease. The slightly inverse association between use of laxatives and risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease may be due to a mechanism that is not related to bowel movement frequency...|$|R
40|$|Unconjugated {{bilirubin}} {{plays an}} important role in cholesterol gallstone formation. Patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease who have high bilirubin plasma levels and/or are homozygous for the rs 6742078 TT variant of the bilirubin glucuronidating gene UGT 1 A 1 should not undergo oral dissolution therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid. A large Danish study has shown that high bilirubin plasma levels and the genetic variant rs 6742078 TT of the enzyme bilirubin glucuronidase UGT 1 A 1 are associated with an increased risk of developing <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease. Recent reports regarding the significant association between bilirubin levels and <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease open a new chapter about the indication and exclusion criteria for oral dissolution therapy of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease. A highly select subgroup of patients with small, single, radiolucent cholesterol gallstones who received oral dissolution therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) had a reported recurrence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease of 50 % over five years. This is probably related to the persistence of other causal risk factors for gallstones in addition to that of cholesterol suprasaturation. A subgroup of patients with high plasma bilirubin levels and the UGT 1 A 1 genetic variant rs 6742078 have a greater risk of recurrence. In conclusion, oral dissolution therapy with UDCA might still be appropriate for patients that refuse laparoscopic cholecystectomy provided they have small (< 0. 5 cm), radiolucent cholesterol gallstones and a functioning gallbladder, and have mean plasma bilirubin levels below 1. 33 mg/dL and are not homozygous for the UGT 1 A 1 rs 6742078 TT genotype.

40|$|<b>Symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> are a compex {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} multiple interactions of various environmental and genetic risk factors. The {{present study was}} supposed to clarify if patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> show a higher predisposition to inflammation {{and if this is}} due to variations of genes that encode inflammation proteins. According to a murine quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, in which the distal CXC chemokine cluster on murine chromosome 5 was identified as a potential modifier of liver fibrosis, we searched for appropriate polymorphisms of the genes CXL 9, 10 and 11 on the human chromosome 4. To identify an association between genetic variations and <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> 8 SNPs that cover the distal CXC chemokine cluster were genotyped in three samples of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic gallstones and stone-free patients (106 persons, respectively). There was a significant association between the allel frequencies of patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> and stone-free patients for the SNP rs 3733236 on the gene CXL 9 (p= 0, 046). In a subsequent haplotype analysis we identified the fourth most frequent haplotype (dCXC_ 4) that is tagged by the SNP rs 3733236 as a functional haplotype. In patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> dCXC_ 4 was significant less frequent than in stone-free patients (p< 0, 03). The functionality of this haplotype was pointed up in a test series of healthy individuals in which CXCL 9 serum concentrations were significantly associated with the presence of this CXC haplotype (p< 0, 001). Furthermore there was a significant negative correlation with the serum concentration of glucose at the presence of dCXC_ 4 (p= 0, 036). At last we examined exogenous risk factors to show an influence on the pathogenesis of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones.</b> We found a significant association between <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> and the body-mass-index (BMI) (p= 0, 04) and an inverse association to the serum cholesterol level (p= 0, 005). The present study underlies the importance of genetic risk factors involved in the development of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> and contributes to the clarification of the molecular pathomechanism of this common disease. Prospective studies should focus on the identification of further candidate genes that contribute to this complex disorder.

40|$|Background: Since {{introducing}} laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) different centres {{have reported}} different conversion rate (CR) to open cholecystectomy (OC) and different reasons for conversion. Objective: To evaluate {{the role of}} LC {{in the treatment of}} <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> and establish the outcomes of this treatment modality in general, looking especially into the rate of conversion to OC, at a district hospital. Patients and methods: From July 1992 -July 1998, 751 patients who underwent LC were retrospectively reviewed. All patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> were offered LC with no exclusion criteria apart from anaesthetic opinion. No attempts were made at selection of patients for LC. Results: There were 751 patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> (617 females, 134 males) underwent LC. Chronic cholecystitis represented the majority of cases (83 &#x 0025;). The mean operative time was 65. 52 minutes: pre-operation and main hospital stay was 2. 46 days. Our total conversion rate was 0. 9 &#x 0025; and 0. 4 &#x 0025; if malignancy of the gallbladder is excluded. In comparison to the published data, there was obvious lower conversion rate, which was neither associated with increased morbidity nor mortality. Conclusion: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a reliable, safe and cost effective treatment modality for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones.</b> With growing experience in laparoscopic technique, proper settings and harmony of the operating team, it is possible to bring the conversion rate to OC to the minimum without any increment in mortality or morbidit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA best {{evidence}} topic in surgery was written {{according to a}} structured protocol. The question addressed was: in patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> and concomitant common bile duct (CBD) stones, is a single-stage surgical strategy (laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with common bile duct exploration) preferable, or a two-stage procedure involving LC with pre or post-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) ? Two hundred and six papers were found using the reported search, of which four presented the {{best evidence}} to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. A recent large meta-analysis concluded {{no significant difference in}} the clinical effectiveness or complication rate of either strategy. Three recent smaller studies concurred with this conclusion; however each noted improved cost-effectiveness of the single-stage approach advocating its use as the superior strategy when local resources and expertise are available. We conclude that for patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> and concomitant choledocholithiasis, a single-stage surgical procedure is equivalent to two-stage LC and ERCP in terms of clinical outcomes, is associated with a shorter overall hospital stay and may be more cost-effective. On this basis a single-stage procedure is recommended for management of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> and choledocholithiasis where local resources and expertise permit...|$|E

40|$|Background: Obesity is an {{established}} {{risk factor for}} gallstones, but whether abdominal adiposity contributes independently to the risk, particularly in men, remains unclear. Objective: The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the associations of abdominal circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, as measures of abdominal adiposity, with the risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease in men. Design: We prospectively studied measures of abdominal obesity in relation to the incidence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease in a cohort of 29 847 men who were free of prior gallstone disease and who provided complete data on waist and hip circumferences. Data on weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences were collected in 1986 and in 1987 through self-administered questionnaires. As part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, men reported newly diagnosed <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease on questionnaires mailed to them every 2 y. Results: We documented 1117 new cases of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease during 264 185 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for body mass index and other known or suspected risk factors for gallstones, men with a height-adjusted waist circumference 102. 6 cm (40. 4 in) had a relative risk of 2. 29 (95 % CI: 1. 69, 3. 11; P for trend 0. 001) compared with men with a height-adjusted waist circumference 86. 4 cm (34 in). Men with a waist-to-hip ratio 0. 99 had a multivariate relative risk of 1. 78 (1. 38, 2. 28; P for trend 0. 001) compared with men with a waist-to-hip ratio 0. 89. Conclusions: Our data suggest the presence of a significant asso-ciation between abdominal adiposity and the incidence of symptom-atic gallstone disease.

40|$|ObjectivesThe study {{sought to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that genetic variation in ABCG 5 / 8, the transporter responsible for intestinal and hepatobiliary cholesterol efflux, may simultaneously influence plasma and biliary cholesterol levels, and hence risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and gallstone disease in opposite directions. BackgroundHigh plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are a causal risk factor for MI, whereas high levels of biliary cholesterol promote gallstone formation. MethodsA total of 60, 239 subjects from Copenhagen were included, including 5, 647 with MI and 3, 174 with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease. Subjects were genotyped for 6 common, nonsynonymous and functional variants in ABCG 5 / 8, and a combined weighted genotype score was calculated. ResultsCombined, weighted genotype scores were associated with stepwise decreases in LDL cholesterol of up to 5. 9 % (0. 20 mmol/l) for individuals with a score ≥ 8. 0 (prevalence = 11 %) versus < 2. 0 (prevalence = 9 %; p for trend across 5 groups = 2  × 10 E- 35). The cumulative incidences of MI and gallstone disease as a function of age and increasing genotype score were decreased and increased (log-rank ps for trend: 6 × 10 E- 4 and 9 × 10 E- 45), respectively. The multifactorially adjusted odds ratios were 0. 83 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 73 to 0. 94) for MI and 2. 85 (95 % confidence interval: 2. 39 to 3. 39) for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease for individuals with a genotype score ≥ 8. 0 versus < 2. 0. ConclusionsGenetic variation in ABCG 5 / 8, which associates with decreased levels of plasma LDL cholesterol protects against MI, but increases the risk of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease.

40|$|Should {{persons with}} <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> (i. e., {{those that have}} caused biliary pain) be treated im-mediately? Or may they be managed expectantly until pain recurs or a biliary {{complication}} (i. e., acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis) occurs? To as-sess the mortality risk of different strategies, we performed a quantitative analysis. For the expec-tant management strategy that requires surgery only if a biliary complication occurs, the cumula-tive lifetime probability of gallstone disease death in a 30 -year-old man is about 2 %, and most deaths occur after age 65. In comparison, elective chole-cystectomy has only a 0. 1 % rate of gallstone dis-ease death, but all deaths occur at age 30. The av-erage amount of life expectancy gained by immediate cholecystectomy compared with expec-tant management is 52 days, which is reduced to 23 days using 5 % discounting. Thii gain could be in-creased only slightly by a 100 % effective and risk-free therapy such as perfected lithotripsy or medi-cal dissolution. Results are similar for women. The results suggest that, for persons with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones,</b> the life expectancy gain of immediate cholecystectomy is relatively small and that the po-tential incremental gain of nonsurgical therapy is also small. For patients and physicians who believe that life expectancy is of primary consideration, the decision about therapy may be made primarily on non-mortality considerations.

Aim: To study the prevalence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease and opportunity of cholecystectomy in La Florida, Santiago and among Mapuche Indians in Huapi Island. Patients and methods: In the period 2000 - 2001, we contacted to 71 % (1127 subjects) and to 61 % (145 subjects) patients of La Florida and Huapi Island, respectively, that had previously participated in an epidemiological study on cholelithiasis in 1993. We defined <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> patients as those {{with a history of}} biliary colic. Each patient was subjected to gallbladder ultrasound. Results: In 1993, 30 - 35 % of <b>gallstone</b> patients were <b>symptomatic</b> (~ 70 % women). During the lapse 1993 - 2001, only 50 % of subjects from La Florida and 25 % of patients from Huapi Island were cholecystectomized (p < 0. 05). Fifty percent of cholecystectomies were emergency operations. In 38 symptomatic Mapuche Indians from Huapi, cholecystectomy was indicated in 2001. After five months of the indication, only one of these subjects had been operated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy represented 40 % of all cholecystectomies performed in the National Health Service Hospitals. Conclusions: This study demonstrates an unacceptable high prevalence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> patients remaining non-operated in both the urban and rural communities.

In addition, there were 21 patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease, with mild biochemical and ultrasonographic signs of CBD involvement (group 2), of whom 19 underwent IOC, and 11 patients with symptomatic CBD stones (group 3), nine of whom had preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) following MRC. RESULTS: MRC showed that no patient in group 1 and three patients in group 2 had CBD stones. Three patients (one in group 1, two in group 2) did not undergo IOC because of technical or clinical problems. In group 3, ERCP confirmed the results of MRC in nine patients. Two patients underwent open surgery because of ultrasonographic, MRC and radiographic signs of pancreatic malignancy. CONCLUSION: MRC could replace IOC and ERCP for identification of asymptomatic CBD stones. In symptomatic patients MRC combined with other non-invasive imaging techniques can direct the surgeon to appropriate management...|$|R
40|$|Background : Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} (LC) is {{the most}} commonly performed minimal invasive surgery. However, practice of its use as an ambulatory surgery in our hospital settings is uncommon. Objective : To evaluate safety and cost effectiveness of LC as an ambulatory day care surgery. Study Design : Quasiexperimental. Setting : Department of surgery, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. Materials and Methods : Patients with uncomplicated <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> were selected for Ambulatory LC. They were admitted electively {{on the same day}} and operated on in the morning hours and discharged after a check by the surgeon 6 - 8 hrs later. Results : Of fifty (n = 50) patients selected for ambulatory LC, 92 &#x 0025; were discharged successfully after 6 - 8 hrs observation. No significant perioperative complications were noted. Unplanned admission and readmission rate was 8 and 2 &#x 0025;, respectively. Cost saving for the daycare surgery was Rs. 6, 200, Rs. 13, 300, and Rs. 22, 800 per patient as compared to in patient general, semiprivate, and private ward package, respectively. Conclusion : Practice ambulatory LC is safe and cost-effective in selected patients with uncomplicated <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones...</b>|$|E
40|$|After the {{widespread}} introduction of laparoscopiccholecystectomy in 1991, {{the rate of}} cholecystec-tomy in North America increased by 30 % to 60 %, 1 – 3 primarily because of higher rates of elective opera-tions. 1 Although cholecystectomy is not ordinarily indi-cated in people with asymptomatic gallstones, 4, 5 the deci-sion to perform the procedure is highly discretionary. 6 It is unclear whether the increased rate of elective cholecystec-tomy is due to overuse of surgery among people with asymptomatic or minimally <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones,</b> or whether more patients with clinically important gallbladder disease are willing to undergo cholecystectomy with the availability of laparoscopic surgery. 7, 8 Most cholecystectomies are done in people with uncom-plicated biliary colic, the most common presentation of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones.</b> 8 Severe complications of gallblad-der disease, such as acute cholecystitis, acute biliary pancre-atitis and acute cholangitis, are potentially life-threatening conditions that require hospital care. Greater use of elec-tive cholecystectomy in people at risk of severe gallstone complications should result in a lower incidence of such complications. We sought {{to determine whether the}} in-crease in the rate of elective cholecystectomy was associ-ated with a reduction in the incidence of severe complica-tions of gallbladder disease.

40|$|Objective The {{development}} of gallstones {{is influenced by}} obesity and alcohol. This study aimed to precisely quantify these risks and investigate whether the aetiological mechanism may involve serum lipids, {{for the first time}} using a European rospective cohort study. Methods The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer-Norfolk, recruited 25 639 men and women, aged 40 to 74 years, between 1993 and 1997. At enrolment weight, height and alcohol intake were recorded and nonfasting blood samples taken to measure serum triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins. The cohort was monitored for 14 years for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones.</b> Cox regression estimated sexspecific hazard ratios (HRs) for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> adjusted for covariates. Results <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>gallstones</b> developed in 296 people (67. 9 % women). For each additional unit of BMI, the HR in men was 1. 08 [95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 02 – 1. 14]; in women the HR was 1. 08 (95 % CI= 1. 06 – 1. 11). Every unit of alcohol consumed per week decreased risk in men by 3 % (HR = 0. 97, 95 % CI= 0. 95 – 0. 99) with no effect in women. Serum triglycerides increased risk in men (highest vs. lowest quarter HR= 2. 02, 95 % CI= 1. 03 – 3. 98) and women (HR = 2. 43, 95 % CI = 1. 52 – 3. 90). Increased high-density lipoprotein was associated with a decreased risk in men (highest vs. lowest quarter HR = 0. 22, 95 % CI= 0. 09 – 0. 52) and women (HR = 0. 55, 95 % CI = 0. 36 – 0. 85). No effects were found for serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Conclusion Obesity and alcohol influence gallstone formation, possibly in part through their effects on serum lipids. Reducing obesity may prevent gallstones in the population, as 38 % of incident cases of gallstones were associated with a BMI of more than 25...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to report the {{clinical}} and cosmetic results of transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy (TVC). BACKGROUND: Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been developed as a minimal invasive alternative for conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Although transvaginal NOTES procedures are becoming increasingly popular, data focussing on body image, cosmesis and sexual recovery are rare. METHODS: Our clinic started to perform the TVC in the beginning of 2011. Female patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease that were treated between January 2011 and April 2012 with TVC were entered in a prospective database. All patients received a survey postoperative with questions about recovery, cosmesis and body image. RESULTS: Fifty consecutive patients were treated with a TVC. There were no major complications. Mean operative time was 61 min. In five patients (10 %), a conversion to another type of cholecystectomy was necessary. None of the sexually active women observed dyspareunia postoperative. The results for cosmesis and body image after the transvaginal approach were excellent. CONCLUSIONS: TVC is a safe and feasible procedure when performed on selected patients. The transvaginal route seems to result in excellent cosmetic outcomes without gynaecologic complications after short-term follow up. Randomised trials are needed to specify the role of TVC in the treatment of patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease and to detect differences in cosmetic outcomes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{clinical}} and cosmetic results of transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy (TVC), single-port cholecystectomy (SPC), and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). Recently, single-incision laparoscopic surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery have been developed as minimally invasive alternatives for CLC. Few comparative studies have been reported. METHODS: Female patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease who were treated in 2011 with SPC, TVC, or CLC were entered into a database. Patients were matched for age, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgery. After the operation all patients received a survey with questions about recovery, cosmesis, and body image. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients, 30 in each group, were evaluated. Median operative time for CLC was significantly shorter (p < 0. 001). There were no major complications. Length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, and postoperative complications were not significantly different. The results for cosmesis and body image after the transvaginal approach were significantly higher. None of the sexually active women observed postoperative dyspareunia. CONCLUSIONS: Both SPC and TVC are feasible procedures when performed in selected patients. CLC is a faster procedure, but other clinical outcomes and complication rates were similar. SPC, and especially TVC, offer a better cosmetic result. Randomized trials are needed to specify the role of SPC and TVC in the treatment of patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>gallstone</b> disease...|$|R
