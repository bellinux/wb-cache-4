Two weeks later, Odex installed an online warning system developed by BayTSP that generated cease and desist emails intended for the alleged downloaders. The company did not obtain subscribers' information directly from ISPs, but relied on ISPs to forward such emails to their <b>subscribers.</b> <b>Sing</b> vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to continue its anti-piracy drive, and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} evaluation of communication protocols in broadband {{fixed wireless access}} (BFWA) networks needs the accurate description of the statistical properties of the packet error process. In BFWA networks mainly operating above 20 GHz, a clear line-of-sight (LOS) path is necessary between the base stations (BS) and the <b>subscribers</b> (<b>S).</b> Rain attenuation is the dominant fading mechanism at these frequencies. In this paper, a Markovbased method to estimate the packet loss rate (PLR) performance over a dynamically, due to propagation, varying LOS BFWA channel is presented and tested against simulation results. The proposed method {{is based on the}} firstorder Markovian modeling of the rain attenuation process. The proposed method can serve as a {{performance evaluation}} tool of various modulation and coding schemes (MCS) and is also applicable even when adaptive fade mitigation techniques are employed in the BFWA network. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Our {{modified}} version of T-CLAP snowballs from a random adopter with depth d (three, {{in the case of}} our paper) and keeps pruning subscribers from this sample while the resulting community has more than <b>s</b> <b>subscribers</b> (115, in the case of our paper). H is the social network graph. H. S is the set of subscribers in this graph and A the set of adopters. The algorithm identifies the subscribers in H that are not adopters with the lowest IER. These subscribers are kept in set V. If V is empty, then the algorithm identifies the subscribers in H that are adopters with the lowest IER. These subscribers are kept in V. This allows us to prune non-adopters with higher probability. A subscriber from V is then selected at random and removed from H. This can, however, separate H into disjoint graphs. If this is the case, then H keeps only the subgraph with the highest IER (ties decided at random) ...|$|R

40|$|Around 2. 4 {{million people}} in the {{mountain}} areas of Papua New Guinea depend on subsistence farming. For a long time this way of farming has been avoided, and sometimes derided, by many authorities and developers worldwide. Shifting cultivation and slash and burn techniques, in combination with population pressure, was leading to deforestation and soil degradation. The general belief was that investing in such a farming system wouldn t get us anywhere. Not so, say the authors of Subsistence agriculture improvement, whose practical manual has won many admirers since it was published 10 years ago. Now available to CTA <b>s</b> <b>subscribers,</b> it offers a worthy collection of ways to improve subsistence farming. It explains how to build an A-frame for making terraces and contour-ridges and how to recognise zinc deficiency in citrus, beans and potatoes. In between it provides information about composting, crafting, drying, cooking, planting and protecting. In addition it contains a section on commonly known plants for the mid-mountain subsistence garden. All in all, a manual useful for other tropical mountainous areas as well. Finally, Sally Shaw did a great job with the many attractive, clear and clarifying illustrations. Subsistence Agriculture Improvement.
