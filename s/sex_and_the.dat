60|$|It may {{be worth}} while to {{illustrate}} the above three modes by which, in the present class, <b>the</b> two <b>sexes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young may have come to resemble each other, by the curious case of the genus Passer.[261] In the house-sparrow (P. domesticus) the male differs much from <b>the</b> female <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> young. These resemble each other, and likewise {{to a large extent}} both <b>sexes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young of the sparrow of Palestine (P. brachydactylus), as well as of some allied species. We may therefore assume that <b>the</b> female <b>and</b> young of <b>the</b> house-sparrow approximately shew us the plumage of the progenitor of the genus. Now with the tree-sparrow (P. montanus) both <b>sexes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young closely resemble the male of the house-sparrow; so that they have all been modified in <b>the</b> same manner, <b>and</b> all depart from the typical colouring of their early progenitor. This may have been effected by a male ancestor of the tree-sparrow having varied, firstly, when nearly mature, or, secondly, whilst quite young, having in either case transmitted his modified plumage to <b>the</b> females <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young; or, thirdly, he may have varied when adult and transmitted his plumage to both adult <b>sexes,</b> <b>and,</b> owing to <b>the</b> failure of the law of inheritance at corresponding ages, at some subsequent period to his young.|$|R
