Published {{in the large}} broadsheet format, each issue was fronted by a two-page section of underground comix edited by Willy Murphy and printed in full color.

25|$|After many letter-writing campaigns {{demanding}} {{the removal of}} the strip were unsuccessful, conservatives changed their tactics, and instead of writing to newspaper editors, they began writing to one of the printers who prints the color Sunday comics. In 2005, Continental Features gave in to their demands, and refused to continue printing the Sunday Doonesbury, causing it to disappear from the 38 <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers</b> that Continental Features printed. Of the 38, only one newspaper, The Anniston Star in Anniston, Alabama, continued to carry the Sunday Doonesbury, though of necessity in black and white.|$|E
25|$|His debut came in 1905, {{the year}} he {{published}} his first verses in <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers</b> and minor magazines; in 1909, he managed to have poems featured in major periodicals, such as Sămănătorul. He worked in handcopying, and in 1909 made his mark by having his satirical Răspunsul micilor funcţionari ("A Reply from the Minor Civil Servants") in Viața Românească. In 1911 he moved to Iaşi, on Garabet Ibrăileanu's invitation, and became chief editor at Viaţa Românească. He later wrote his well-received articles - Cum am devenit moldovean ("How I Became a Moldavia Native") and Cum am devenit ieşean ("How I Became a Iaşi Native") which trace his meanderings within Romania.|$|E

500|$|On 27 April 2007, Grant {{accepted}} undisclosed {{damages from}} the Associated Newspapers over claims made about his relationships {{with his former}} girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which {{were published in the}} Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday on 18, 21 and 24 February. His lawyer stated that all of the articles' [...] "allegations and factual assertions are false." [...] Grant said, in a written statement, that he took the action because: [...] "I was tired of the Daily Mail and Mail on <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers</b> publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain." [...] He went on to take the opportunity to stress, [...] "I'm also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called 'close friends' or 'close sources' on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist." ...|$|E
500|$|The early 1890s saw an {{increasing}} use of dialect in Chicago's newspapers, sometimes to mock, but more often to give voice to the immigrant communities that filled Chicago's neighborhoods, and whose worth was being appreciated. By 1892, Dunne, who was still only aged 25, was editorial chairman of the Chicago Evening Post. Its management was marketing (unsuccessfully, as it proved) a smaller-size weekly edition {{to compete with the}} large <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers.</b> Cornelius McAuliff, Dunne's editor, asked him to write a humorous piece for each edition of the new periodical. Accordingly, Dunne wrote for the Sunday Post on December 4, 1892, a piece in Irish dialect called [...] "Frank's Visit to Grover", concerning the efforts of former congressman Frank Lawler to gain appointment as Chicago's postmaster, a political plum to be awarded by the new president, Grover Cleveland. Lawler's visit to New York to see Cleveland is described by another Irishman, Alderman Johnny Powers—Cleveland promises the post (Lawler did not in real life receive it) before Lawler and the president-elect settle down to drinking and playing pool.|$|E

Jimmy and Cliff {{are attempting to}} read the <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers,</b> plus the radical weekly, [...] "price ninepence, obtainable at any bookstall" [...] as Jimmy snaps, claiming it from Cliff.

2500|$|Upon {{graduation}} in 1932, Simon {{was hired}} by Rochester Journal-American art director Adolph Edler as an assistant, replacing Simon's future comics colleague Al Liederman, who had quit.

Shortly thereafter, for $60 a week, he succeeded Liederman as art director of a paper whose name Simon recalled in his 1990 autobiography as the Syracuse Journal American, although the [...] Syracuse Journal and the Syracuse Sunday American, were the separate weekday and <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers,</b> respectively. The paper soon closed, and Simon, at 23, ventured to New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{newspapers}} were adversely critical. [...] The Sunday Express headlined its review [...] "Another Brilliant Success." [...] The Sunday Times agreed {{and stated that}} the work was [...] "received with every demonstration of delight by a distinguished and representative audience." [...] The Observer also praised the piece, though allowing that it [...] "lacks something of the sustained brilliance" [...] of The Mikado. [...] The Daily News applauded the innovation of Sullivan (who conducted, as usual, on the first night), of conducting with a baton tipped with a small incandescent light. [...] Scholar Reginald Allen suggested that the reviews in the <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers</b> may have been better than the others because their critics, facing deadlines (the premiere was on Saturday night, and finished late because of the long interval), may not have stayed to the end. [...] Fun, having disparaged the libretto, said of the music, [...] "Sir Arthur has surpassed himself". [...] The Pall Mall Gazette praised the [...] "charming melodies, fresh and delightful as ever"; The Daily News wrote that [...] "Mr Gilbert retains in all its fulness his unique facility for humorous satire and whimsical topsy-turveydom" [...] and praised Sullivan's [...] "melodic genius which never fails".

2500|$|The {{museum was}} {{established}} during Soane's own lifetime by a Private Act of Parliament in 1833, which took effect on Soane's death in 1837. The Act required that No. 13 be maintained [...] "as nearly as possible" [...] {{as it was}} left {{at the time of}} Soane's death, and that has largely been done. The Act was necessary because Sir John had a living direct male heir, his son George, with whom he had had a [...] "lifelong feud" [...] due to George's debts, refusal to engage in a trade, and his marriage, of which Sir John disapproved. He also wrote an [...] "anonymous, defamatory piece for the <b>Sunday</b> <b>papers</b> about Sir John, calling him a cheat, a charlatan and a copyist". Since under contemporary inheritance law George {{would have been able to}} lay claim to Sir John's property on his death, Sir John engaged in a lengthy parliamentary campaign to disinherit his son via a private Act, setting out to [...] "reverse the fundamental laws of hereditary succession". according to some. The Soane Museum Act was passed in April 1833 and stipulated that on Soane's death his house and collections would pass into the care of a Board of Trustees, on behalf of the nation, and that they should be preserved as nearly as possible exactly as they were left at his death.|$|E
