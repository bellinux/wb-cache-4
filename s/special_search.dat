25|$|A new {{approach}} {{was used in}} 2010 for the selection of David Johnston as governor general-designate. For the task, Prime Minister Stephen Harper convened a <b>special</b> <b>search</b> group—the Governor General Consultation Committee—was instructed to find a non-partisan candidate who would respect the monarchical aspects of the viceregal office and conducted extensive consultations with more than 200 people across the country. In 2012, the committee was made permanent and renamed as the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments, with a modified membership and its scope broadened to include the appointment of provincial lieutenant governors and territorial commissioners (though the latter are not personal representatives of the monarch). However, Justin Trudeau did not make use of a selection committee when he chose Julie Payette as Johnston's successor in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of <b>special</b> <b>search</b> among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it looked so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E

25|$|Just as the Americans {{did with}} Operation Alsos, the Soviets {{inserted}} <b>special</b> <b>search</b> teams into Germany and Austria {{in the wake}} of their troops. Their objective, under the Russian Alsos, was also the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, materiel resources and scientific personnel {{for the benefit of the}} Soviet Union. One of the German scientists recruited under this Soviet operation was the nuclear physicist Heinz Pose, who was made head of Laboratory V in Obninsk. When he returned to Germany on a recruiting trip for his laboratory, Pose wrote a letter to Werner Heisenberg inviting him to work in the USSR. The letter lauded the working conditions in the USSR and the available resources, as well as the favorable attitude of the Soviets towards German scientists. A courier hand delivered the recruitment letter, dated 18 July 1946, to Heisenberg; Heisenberg politely declined in a return letter to Pose.|$|E
25|$|A <b>special</b> <b>search</b> {{committee}} convened by the Prime Minister recommended Johnston for the viceregal position; {{the group}} was headed by Sheila-Marie Cook, secretary to the Governor General, and further consisted of Kevin MacLeod, the Canadian Secretary to the Queen, Usher of the Black Rod of the Senate of Canada, and parliament's top protocol officer; Christopher Manfredi, dean of the Faculty of Arts at McGill University; Rainer Knopff, {{a political scientist at}} the University of Calgary; Father Jacques Monet, of the Canadian Institute of Jesuit Studies; and Christopher McCreery, historian and private secretary to the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. The committee conducted extensive national consultations with over 200 people including academics, sitting and retired political leaders of all political persuasions including provincial premiers, current and former political party leaders, former prime ministers and others in order to develop a short list of candidates for the position. Also on the short list were other distinguished Canadians, including John de Chastelain and John Fraser.|$|E

Georgij Nikolaevich Flerov had arrived earlier, although Kikoin did not recall a vanguard group.

There are plenty of draws back in these hills where a camp could be hidden and {{discovered}} only by chance, unless some one was making <b>special</b> <b>search</b> for it. The fact that that bloody-minded Injun was hanging around the beaver pond so late in the day is evidence enough for me that his camp isn't many miles away. I'll bet it's within five miles of us this blessed minute. They probably located our trap lines, then built their camp in a place we were not likely to visit and then by working back up through the hills kept their trail hidden, and crossed on the ice to work our long lines, as Alec suspects. They left our short lines alone, partly because they could not get at them without leaving a trail in the soft snow and partly so as not to arouse suspicion.|$|E

Here I made a bed, with some old cushions from the couches; got him into the place, first bandaging his wounds, as well as I could in the faint light that came in through a dormer window. I fetched a jug of water from my room, and placed it beside him; and then moved the furniture, so as to close up the spot at which he had entered. Against it I piled up tables and chairs; so that, to anyone who did not examine it very closely, it would seem that the heavy furniture was against the wall.|$|E

(2) Beginning {{with the}} last entry, and going backwards, I read over the names till I {{recognise}} one as having occurred already: I then link the two entries together, by giving the one, that comes first in chronological order, a 'foot-reference' (see Nos. 217, 225). I do not keep this 'up-to-date', but leave it till there are 4 or 5 pages to be done. I work back till I come among entries that are all supplied with 'foot-references', when I once more glance through the last few pages, {{to see if there}} are any entries not yet supplied with head-references: their predecessors may need a <b>special</b> <b>search.</b> If an entry is connected, in subject, with another under a different name, I link them by cross-references, distinguished from the head- and foot-references by being written further from the marginal line (see No. 229).

All will be fully occupied with the exciting events which have taken place, and as the casement by which we entered is closed it is scarcely likely to occur to any one that we have escaped by that means. I will listen first if the house is quiet. If so, we will descend and take refuge in some room below, where there is a better chance of concealment than here. Put the pieces of armour into that closet so that they may not catch the eye of any who may happen to come hither. The day is already closing. In half an hour it will be nightfall.

40|$|In the paper, {{aimed at}} the {{shortcoming}} of trust region method, we proposed a algorithm using negative curvature direction as its searching direction. The convergence of the algorithm was given. Furthermore, combing trust region method and curve-linear searching techniques, a trust region algorithm, using general curve-linear searching direction, was proposed. We proved its efficiency and feasibility. The algorithm has adjustability and can select or update its searching direction according to the iteration. This allows the algorithm that has the properties of curve-linear searching method and the global convergence of trust region method. Finally, we indicate that some searching directions of common methods can be as a <b>special</b> <b>searching</b> direction of the general method...|$|R
