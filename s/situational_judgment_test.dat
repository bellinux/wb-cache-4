40|$|To {{explain why}} {{situational}} judgment tests are often correlated with personality measures, Motowidlo, Hooper, and Jackson (2006 a, 2006 b) developed the implicit trait policy theory. Implicit trait policies are beliefs about causal relationships between personality traits and behavioral effectiveness. Among 180 employees, this field study examined whether a multimedia <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> that {{was intended to}} assess leadership skills can capture individual differences in such policies. Furthermore, it was examined whether these implicit trait policies were able to predict leadership behavior. Results confirmed that the <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> was able to capture individual differences in implicit trait policies for Extraversion and Conscientiousness. Furthermore, results showed that implicit trait policies for Extraversion can predict leadership behavior over and above leadership experience and the associated personality trait. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{factors are}} likely to {{influence}} response patterns to situational judgment tests, including agreeableness, leadership style, impression management, and job and organizational experience. This research presents background information and research on situational judgment tests and several constructs hypothesized to influence <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> responses. A <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> and manipulations to influence response patterns were developed and piloted with {{a small sample of}} management professionals and undergraduate students. Larger samples of management professionals and undergraduate students participated in the experimental research. Participants were asked to imagine that they are applying for a job. Each participant was presented with background information about a fictitious company, describing a company as either highly Participative/Supportive or highly Directive/Achieving in its leadership culture. A third description provided no information about leadership culture to serve as a control. Participants responded to a <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> consisting of some commercially developed items and some new items. Then participants responded to an inventory comprised of items that measure the factors hypothesized to influence response patterns, specifically Agreeableness and Experience. Significant differences in response patterns were determined to be attributable to the Agreeableness and Experience variables, and the Leadership Culture manipulations, as well as the interaction between Experience and the Leadership Culture manipulations. No significant differences were clearly attributable to the Agreeableness by Leadership Culture interaction. The ramifications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|E

Results showed that the Black-White differences in <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> performance and face validity reactions to the test were substantially smaller in the video-based method of testing than in the paper-and-pencil method. The Race x Method interaction effect on test performance was attributable to differences in reading comprehension and face validity reactions associated with race and method of testing.

First, there is a research and practice tradition in personnel selection that has used the item type that Sternberg uses to assess what he calls tacit knowledge. This item type is called <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> in the personnel selection field. There is an extensive literature on <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>tests</b> that can inform debate concerning practical intelligence. Second, we present evidence that <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>tests</b> do not measure a general factor, whether labeled practical intelligence, or something else. Both the individual test items and the tests are factorially complex and measure multiple known constructs. Third, since the measures assess multiple constructs (g and personality), they are best viewed as measurement methods. Fourth, we compare {{the validity of the}} measures with g for the prediction of job performance and examine the incremental validity of <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>tests.</b> We conclude that this research can help guide a revision to practical intelligence theory...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the suggestion that}} situational judgment is a multidimensional evaluation methodology that assesses task and/or contextual job knowledge, and in any given <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> (SJT), there may be items that better tap contextual knowledge while other items may better tap task knowledge. 233 undergraduate students completed questionnaires containing a <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test,</b> personality questionnaire, and cognitive ability test.

40|$|Although {{situational}} judgment {{tests have}} been found to be valid predictors of performance, they have rarely been used to measure particular constructs. In this study, we apply the <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> method to the measurement of personal initiative, a construct defined as situated action. We used respondents 2 ̆ 7 situated preferences in mental simulations of work scenarios as formative indicators of their overall level of personal initiative at work. Results from a validation study showed that the <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>test</b> of personal initiative (SJT-PI) had adequate validity and complemented a Likert-type self-report measure of personal initiative in predicting behavioral criteria. Situated preferences for personal initiative were hypothesized to be proximal predictors of actual behavior and were accordingly found to mediate the relationship between generalized self-efficacy, felt responsibility, and actual behavior. Furthermore, situated preferences for personal initiative could be differentiated empirically from organizational citizenship behavior. We conclude that situational judgment tests are a promising method for measuring personal initiative and may be a general means of improving the validity of measurement in organizations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>tests</b> {{are widely}} {{agreed to be}} a {{measurement}} technique. It is also widely agreed that SJTs are a questionable methodological choice for measurement of psychological constructs, such as behavioral competencies, {{due to a lack}} of evidence supporting appropriate factor structures and high internal consistencies. Nevertheless, both the peer review literature and applied instances of SJTs reveal no shortage of attempts to measure psychological constructs with SJTs. While acknowledging the lack of evidence supporting the ability of SJTs to assess psychological constructs, we see that a number of practical benefits would accrue to organizations if industrial psychologists were able to design SJTs that measure psychological constructs. Accordingly, this article presents a discussion of steps that psychologists can take to enhance the chances of observing validity evidence for construct based SJTs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Situational</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>tests</b> (SJTs) are {{typically}} conceptualized as contextualized selection procedures that capture candidate {{responses to a}} set of relevant job situations as a basis for prediction. SJTs share their sample-based and contextualized approach with work samples and assessment center exercises, although they differ from these other simulations by presenting the situations in a low-fidelity (e. g., written) format. In addition, SJTs do not require candidates to respond through actual behavior because they capture candidates' <b>situational</b> <b>judgment</b> via a multiple-choice response format. Accordingly, SJTs have also been labeled low-fidelity simulations. This SJT paradigm has been very successful: In the last 2 decades, scientific interest in SJTs has grown, and they have made rapid inroads in practice as attractive, versatile, and valid selection procedures. Contrary to their popularity and the voluminous research on their criterion-related validity, however, there has been little attention to developing a theory of why SJTs work.
