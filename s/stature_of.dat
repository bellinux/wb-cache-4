When Desplat later joined the team to write the music, he praised and defended Anwar's suggestion. Hooper further remarked that the <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> the piece helps elevate the status of the speech to a public event.|$|E

5|$|The Lowell System {{combined}} large-scale mechanization with {{an attempt}} to improve the <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> its female workforce and workers. A few girls who came with their mothers or older sisters were as young as ten years old, some were middle-aged, but the average age was about 24. Usually hired for contracts of one year (the average stay was about four years), new employees were given assorted tasks as spare hands and paid a fixed daily wage while more experienced loom operators would be paid by the piece. They were paired with more experienced women, who trained them {{in the ways of}} the factory.|$|E
40|$|Nineteenth-century U. S. {{state prison}} records contain {{information}} on European-American stature. The most commonly mentioned reasons for stature variation were diets, disease, and work effort. The <b>statures</b> <b>of</b> whites were {{positively associated with}} direct sunlight. Stature and insolation were associated with occupations, and white workers who spent more time outdoors produced more vitamin D and grew taller. The <b>statures</b> <b>of</b> whites also decreased throughout the nineteenth century, and this decrease is observed across the whole stature distribution. nineteenth-century U.

40|$|When human {{skeletal}} remains of unknown individuals are analysed, the estimation <b>of</b> ante-mortem <b>stature</b> forms {{a key part}} of the report. However, for many people it may be difficult to judge the height of their missing relative in metric values. In this paper, we report on the <b>statures</b> <b>of</b> 2052 black, 483 coloured and 880 white South Africans of both sexes, measured during the last few years. It is shown that the <b>statures</b> <b>of</b> whites are significantly higher than those of the other two groups. The <b>statures</b> <b>of</b> the black and coloured groups are similar. It is proposed that the stature estimates provided in forensic reports are interpreted as tall, medium or short, based on whether they fall in the upper 25 %, middle 50 % or lower 25 % of the distribution for the specific population...|$|R

5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.|$|E
5|$|With {{their loss}} to Auburn, Alabama {{completed}} the first winless season in Alabama football history, {{and since then}} they have had only two other winless seasons in 1895 and 1955. The losses of 1893 were attributed to the small <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> the Crimson players {{and not to the}} coaching and training of the team. As such, Abbott returned as head coach for the 1894 season and led Alabama to a winning season that included their first all-time win over Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind if he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape and they would have to give chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Wall was a {{specific}} {{piece of the}} Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. The Berlin Wall stretched approximately 28 miles (45km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120km) {{around the edges of}} West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> the Berlin Wall in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of the Berlin Wall reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for the number of visitors to the Berlin Wall, as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the Berlin Wall received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit the Berlin Wall, which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so long as they were presented as educational in nature.|$|E
5|$|The wars engendered {{an era of}} technological, cultural, and {{demographic}} changes in China. Battles between the Song and Jin brought about the introduction of various gunpowder weapons. The siege of De'an in 1132 was the first recorded use of the fire lance, an early ancestor of firearms. There were also reports of battles fought with primitive gunpowder bombs like the incendiary huopao or the exploding tiehuopao, incendiary arrows, and other related weapons. In northern China, the Jurchen tribes were the ruling minority of an empire that was predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the Northern Song. Jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture. The Jin government instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous Chinese dynasties, basing their legitimacy on Confucian philosophy. Song refugees from the north resettled in southern China. The north was the cultural center of China, and its conquest by the Jin diminished the international <b>stature</b> <b>of</b> the Song dynasty. The Southern Song, however, quickly returned to economic prosperity, and trade with the Jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare. The capital of the Southern Song, Hangzhou, expanded into a major city for commerce.|$|E

This study demonstrates that after comparing the <b>statures</b> <b>of</b> Mexicans born in Mexico and the US the primary source <b>of</b> the <b>stature</b> {{difference between the two groups}} was birth year, and the stature gap increased as the US economy developed while the Mexican economy stagnated. Moreover, the <b>stature</b> growth <b>of</b> Mexicans born in the US was related to vitamin D, and the Mexican relationship between stature and insolation was more like that of Europeans than Africans...|$|R
