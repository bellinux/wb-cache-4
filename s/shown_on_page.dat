Some ELNS areas combined three charge groups. Calls within the area code do not require the area code to be dialled, {{this is true even}} for calls between the charge groups.|$|E
50|$|Electric signal lamps are {{typically}} low power (35 watt) incandescent lamps running off of low voltage DC current or, more recently, high output LED arrays. Incandescent signals use a doublet lens combination to directionally focus their small power {{out over a}} long range (3,500 feet in daylight.) New LED signals may either use an unfocused array or act as a drop-in replacement behind a traditional lens. U.S. signal lenses have a standard diameter of 8.375 in. North American signals use a standard set of colors, defined in October 1905, and which became common to other modes of transportation as <b>shown</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 384 of the Simmons-Boardman 1911 Signal Dictionary.|$|E
50|$|As stated on a {{previous}} occasion, when I {{was a student at}} college I conceived a flying machine quite unlike the present ones. The underlying principle was sound but could not be carried into practice for want of a prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recent years I have successfully solved this problem and am now planning aerial machines devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers and other external attachments, which will be capable of immense speeds and are very likely to furnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future. Such a machine, sustained and propelled entirely by reaction, is <b>shown</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 108 and is supposed to be controlled either mechanically or by wireless energy. By installing proper plants it will be practicable to project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it almost on the very spot designated, which may be thousands of miles away. But {{we are not going to}} stop at this. Telautomata will be ultimately produced, capable of acting as if possest of their own intelligence, and their advent will create a revolution. As early as 1898 I proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of an automobile carriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgment. But my proposal was deemed chimerical at that time and nothing came from it.|$|E
