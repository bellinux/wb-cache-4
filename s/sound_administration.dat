40|$|BackgroundInsomnia is a {{major public}} health problem in western countries. Previous small pilot studies showed that the {{administration}} of constant white noise can improve sleep quality, increase acoustic arousal threshold, and reduce sleep onset latency. In this randomized controlled trial, we tested the effect of surrounding broadband <b>sound</b> <b>administration</b> on sleep onset latency, sleep architecture, and subjective sleep quality in healthy subjects. MethodsEighteen healthy subjects were studied with two overnight sleep studies approximately one week apart. They were exposed in random order to normal environmental noise (40. 1 [1. 3][*]dB) or to broadband <b>sound</b> <b>administration</b> uniformly distributed in the room by two speakers (46. 0 [0. 9][*]dB). To model transient insomnia, subjects went to bed (“lights out”) 90 [*]min before usual bedtime. ResultsBroadband <b>sound</b> <b>administration</b> reduced sleep onset latency to stage 2 sleep (time from lights out to first epoch of non-rapid eye movement-sleep stage 2) (19 [16] vs. 13 [23][*]min, p[*]=[*] 0. 011; median reduction 38 % baseline).

40|$|The United States District Courts {{employ a}} {{decentralized}} automation strategy. This strategy allows each federal district to utilize automation resources {{in such areas}} as case management, court financial services, and decision support systems. With changes in technology and increased demand for automation support courts have adopted additional hardware platforms and communications technology at the direction of the Administrative Office of the Courts in Washington, D. C. with an increased demand for automation technology increased technical expertise is also required. This expertise needs to be accompanied by <b>sound</b> system <b>administration</b> practices. The literature indicates that no administrative model exists for the courts that thoroughly deals with the administration of hardware, software, security, operations, and networks. The literature supports that the lack of procedural formalization in automation operations can put information resources at risk. Consequently, this study is designed to assess t e practice of system administration in the courts. The assessment is based on the development of a system administration model that allows the courts to conform to <b>sound</b> UNIX <b>administration</b> practices as well as federal regulations and guidelines. The assessment is based on a survey instrument that addresses general and specific areas of system administration. The results of the survey accept the basic hypothesis that United States District Court system administration practices do not presently conform to accepted data center operation practices. This indicates that court information resources are at risk and expected administration tasks are not entirely supported by court information systems. However, it could not be ascertained that the man-machine interface of court systems is unreliable. This study provided a means to assist the courts to strengthen their administration practices. From the assessment it is recommended that the courts adopt a control systems methodology that can support the various court environments.

40|$|Purpose – To {{explore the}} {{assumptions}} underlying the traditional “principles of administration” {{in the light}} of the rise of interest in corporate social responsibility, business ethics and corporate governance and to link revised principles to practical stakeholder models, using, for example, modern communications media. Design/methodology/approach – Using concepts of “fit” between traditional administrative principles and common problems of business administration, such as those identified in the corporate social responsibility, business ethics and corporate governance literature, the approach is to locate principles on which <b>sound</b> <b>administration</b> and “proper” expectations of stakeholders can be adjusted acceptably. Findings – Traditional lists of principles can be fruitfully replaced by methods for identifying and meeting the aspirations of stakeholders, within agreed principles, which may vary, depending on the level of generality and on circumstances. Research limitations/implications – The paper is based on observation and conceptual analysis. Developments appear to depend on willingness to replace codes and practices that are devised from the top and imposed on others by ones that are responsive to stakeholders. Practical implications – Responsive codes imply a need to respond in a principled way to differing aspirations, and a willingness to use modern digital media to identify the aspirations accurately. Originality/value – Traditional principles of administration are essentially principles for administering the internal labour market in large organisations. The proposed approach broadens the range of application and offers practical ways forward. Business administration, Corporate social responsibility, Stakeholder analysis...|$|E
