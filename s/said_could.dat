5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a dental drill on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter who said that he was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and <b>said</b> <b>could</b> not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E
5|$|By October 10, 2004, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, a surface low pressure system developed, and convection began to organize into slightly curved bands. The disturbance continued to in this manner, and at 1800 UTC on October 11, the low level circulation had become sufficiently organized to be designated as a tropical depression. At the time, the depression consisted of a well-defined circulation, with some deep thunderstorm activity. Despite weak steering currents, the system started what was initially {{thought to be a}} westward drift, though just a few hours later was found to be towards the northwest. A small cyclone, a burst of deep convection formed at around the same time, and was <b>said</b> <b>could</b> have produced tropical storm-force winds.|$|E
5|$|The {{screenplay}} for Ruma Maida {{was written by}} Ayu Utami, her first such work; mainly known for her novels, she had avoided screenplays as she thought they were generally too commercially oriented. She wrote the screenplay {{over a period of}} six months beginning in 2008, when Lamp Pictures – which produced the film with Karuna Pictures– requested that she write a story about nationalism; according to the director Teddy Soeriaatmadja, who was brought in while the screenplay was still on its first draft, he and Utami read seven drafts of the screenplay before they agreed on the story. Considering the screenplay a way to encourage the younger generation to study Indonesian history, which she <b>said</b> <b>could</b> be fun, Utami decided to focus on education, diversity, and history.|$|E

25|$|The filmmakers {{denied that}} the claims made in the film contradicted key teachings of Christianity, such as the resurrection and ascension. The film's {{religious}} consultant James Tabor stated {{that the fact that}} Jesus' tomb was discovered does not put in doubt biblical accounts of his resurrection, which he <b>said</b> <b>could</b> have been spiritual. With regard to the ascension, the documentary's website suggests that while the tomb's discovery does not render impossible the notion of a spiritual ascension, it does contradict the belief that Jesus physically ascended to heaven.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Representative Callegari {{supported}} {{the ban on}} abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents <b>said</b> <b>could</b> lead to the closure of many abortion clinics in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, Callegari did not vote on two other anti-abortion measures. One forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions. The other requires that a woman undergo a sonogram before procuring an abortion. This legislation {{is based on the}} view that a woman could change her mind about an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. The Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Callegari 41 percent favorable in 2013, 72 percent in 2011, and 100 percent in 2005. The National Abortion Rights Action League rated him 9 percent in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed {{that one should}} distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes {{are tied to the}} society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he <b>said</b> <b>could</b> not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E
25|$|Kilgore {{refused to}} debate Russ Potts, a {{decision}} which columnist Barnie Day <b>said</b> <b>could</b> strengthen Potts' underdog appeal {{and was a}} poor decision by Kilgore. It is unclear whether this had any effect on the election's outcome. Russ Potts polled 9% in a Mason-Dixon poll, but then dropped to 6% in a September poll. He needed to poll 15% in two separate polls to qualify {{for participation in the}} October Kaine-Kilgore debate. This poll was taken before Potts' TV ads ran. Although Potts was excluded from the final debate, he agreed to be sequestered in an office at Richmond's WTVR-TV during Sunday evening's debate and was not allowed to hear any of the questions nor any of the answers offered by his opponents. Minutes after the debate ended, Potts was taken into WTVR-TV studios where the station played back the debate in real time and recorded Potts' answers to each of the debate questions. WTVR-TV announced plans to air key segments of the 'virtual debate' on seven consecutive nights at 11 p.m., beginning Sunday October 16 through Saturday October 22. Each segment focuses on one or two debate topics and presented the complete, timed answers from Mr. Kaine, Mr. Kilgore and Mr. Potts. The station also announced plans to present a composite one-hour virtual debate among the three candidates at 11:30p.m. on Sunday, October 23.|$|E

25|$|The Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who {{saw that}} he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a {{prisoner}} to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, Ar-Pharazôn, urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. So it was that all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans to something more similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he <b>said</b> <b>could</b> grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on Ilúvatar for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky was {{highly critical of}} the episode, describing the Gabrielle story as predictable, the Susan subplot as boring and the overall Bolen story arc as too slow in developing. Stransky also felt the Katherine and Robin pairing was unbelievable, and questioned whether the show's audiences of families and midwesterners would respond well to a lesbian pairing. Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC praised Longoria for turning what he <b>said</b> <b>could</b> have been a gloomy story into [...] "a gleeful fantasy". Cooper said the character was fun and funny but ultimately heartfelt and caring. Conversely, Cooper said the subplots involving the other housewives were [...] "all pretty standard, and dreary, stuff".|$|E

[...] He went on to commend Manson's vocals, which he <b>said</b> <b>could</b> [...] "communicate pain, passion, fear, hate and euphoria in one mighty, ear-piercing roar." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune complimented the album's production, as did Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly, who also praised its [...] "ambitious" [...] concept.|$|E
