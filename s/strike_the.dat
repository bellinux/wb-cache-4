50|$|In {{a direct}} hit, <b>the</b> {{electrical}} charge <b>strikes</b> <b>the</b> person first.Splash hits occur when lightning jumps {{to a person}} (lower resistance path) from a nearby object that has more resistance, <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> person {{on its way to}} <b>the</b> ground.In ground <b>strikes,</b> <b>the</b> bolt lands near the person and is conducted by a connection to the ground (usually the feet), due to the voltage gradient in the earth. This can still cause substantial injury.|$|R

5|$|Overall, Amy caused {{at least}} an {{estimated}} $30million in damage throughout the central Philippines. However, {{the total number of}} fatalities directly associated with the effects of the typhoon remain disputed, and may range anywhere from 569 to 991, making Amy one of the deadliest typhoons to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> island nation in recorded history. An additional 50,000people were rendered homeless by the storm. The typhoon was characterized by the Philippine weather bureau to be the worst typhoon to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> Philippines in at least 70years. In the aftermath of Amy, then-president of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino declared a state of public calamity for eleven central Philippine provinces including the island of Camiguin, which was heavily affected by both the typhoon and Mount Hibok-Hibok. On December24, the American Red Cross granted $25,000to the Philippine Red Cross.|$|E

30|$|Although most {{musculoskeletal}} {{problems in}} swimming are overuse injuries due to chronic overload, {{there are several}} acute types of injury that can occur in swimmers. Most truly acute injuries occur due to contact or direct trauma and are thus uncommon in a non-contact sport such as swimming. However, this can happen in swimming due to <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> hand on the wall at the finish of a sprint. Metacarpal fractures requiring surgery have occurred in elite-level swimmers. Hand and finger contusions and fractures may also occur by <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> hand on the lane line or by <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> hand of another swimmer. Foot injuries can occur from <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> foot on the wall during a flip turn. These mechanisms of injury {{can also lead to}} lacerations.|$|R

5|$|The strongest {{hurricane}} to hit {{the state}} during the period was Hurricane Donna, which was the 8th strongest hurricane on record to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> United States. Additionally, Hurricanes Easy, King, Cleo, Isbell, and Betsy hit the state as major hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|There {{is no need}} {{to think}} of {{delivering}} <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> with a 'blade edge'.

That helps enormously in keeping the arm straight throughout.|$|R
