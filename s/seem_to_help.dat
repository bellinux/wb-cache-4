25|$|Mineo's role as {{a stalker}} in Who Killed Teddy Bear? (1965), which co-starred Juliet Prowse, did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> Although his {{performance}} was praised by critics, he found himself typecast anew, now as a deranged criminal. He never entirely escaped this characterization. One of his last roles was a guest spot on the TV series S.W.A.T. (1975), playing a cult leader similar to Charles Manson.|$|E
25|$|The {{changing}} {{economic environment}} {{has a significant}} impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of Johnson suffering from bouts {{of depression and}} what Johnson thought might be madness. As Walter Jackson Bate puts it, [...] "one of the ironies of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense—of the strong, imaginative grasp of concrete reality—should have begun his adult life, {{at the age of}} twenty, in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that, at least from his own point of view, it seemed the onset of actual insanity". To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> Taylor said that Johnson [...] "at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide". Boswell claimed that Johnson [...] "felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery".|$|E
500|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has identified}} the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan as major {{influences on the}} cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past Final Fantasy games {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the development team advance. While he was thinking of different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements. Sub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima's focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a [...] "strange and eccentric" [...] appearance, while the attire of the Ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle. Tidus' relationship with his father Jecht was based [...] "stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends." [...] This would eventually reveal the key of Sin's weakness and eventual defeat.|$|E
2500|$|Pica {{also affects}} domesticated animals. [...] While drugs like Prozac are often able to {{diminish}} troublesome behaviors in pet dogs, they don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> with this eating disorder. [...] The following story about Bumbley, a {{wire fox terrier}} who appeared on 20/20 {{as a result of}} his eating disorder, is taken from a book by Dr. Nicholas Dodman.|$|E

2500|$|He told John Paradise, a friend, that he [...] "could {{stare at}} the town clock {{without being able to}} tell the hour". To {{overcome}} these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> Taylor, in reflecting on Johnson's states, said that Johnson [...] "at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide".|$|E
2500|$|Middlesex put {{paid to the}} Dynamos' {{challenge}} with a convincing eight wicket win in the afternoon semi-final. Dale Benkenstein had won the toss and followed the earlier game in putting his own team in to bat first. Losing Michael Di Venuto for a third-ball duck didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> matters. [...] It was then left to Paul Collingwood, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Will Smith to hit the runs. However, as the innings wore on, the conditions began to favour the slower bowlers. This {{was reflected in the}} bowling of Shaun Udal and Murali Kartik. In the eight overs that they bowled, only 36 runs were conceded. The Dynamos were thus limited to just 138 off their twenty overs, Chanderpaul top scoring with 48.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{scientists}} {{believed that}} such a lightning protection system of air terminals and [...] "downleads" [...] directed the current of the lightning down into the earth to be [...] "dissipated". However, high speed photography has clearly demonstrated that lightning is actually composed of both a cloud component and an oppositely charged ground component. During [...] "cloud-to-ground" [...] lightning, these oppositely charged components usually [...] "meet" [...] somewhere in the atmosphere well above the earth to equalize previously unbalanced charges. The heat generated as this electric current flows through flammable materials is the hazard which lightning protection systems attempt to mitigate by providing a low-resistance path for the lightning circuit. No lightning protection system can be relied upon to [...] "contain" [...] or [...] "control" [...] lightning completely (nor thus far, to prevent lightning strikes entirely), but they do <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> immensely on most occasions of lightning strikes.|$|E

40|$|A constructivist {{learning}} experience using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology {{was conducted with}} second and third grade students in a public elementary school in Cupertino, California. The students made a map of their school by recording location information with handheld GPS devices and then graphing the data. The effort, performed by three classes of 20 pupils each, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> students gain intuition about the abstract relationship between maps and the physical spaces that maps represent. The experience also <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> students grasp complex concepts such as the accuracy of their data, the scale of their maps, {{as well as the}} utility of using technology to perform data collection and analysis...|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} end of the third quarter, coach Tom Landry {{replaced}} Morton with Roger Staubach, but it didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> [...] On his first drive, Staubach lost a fumble while being tackled by Bob Hoskins. [...] San Francisco was in prime position to put the game away with another score, but they couldn't get the ball into the end zone and Gossett missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, causing a huge reversal of momentum. [...] Now with the ball, Hill ripped off a 48-yard gain on a draw play to set up Fritsch's 27-yard field goal, trimming the lead to 28–16. [...] Later in the quarter, a poor punt from McCann gave Dallas the ball at the 49ers 45-yard line. [...] Staubach then led the team to the end zone, completing two passes to fullback Walt Garrison for 16 yards and two more to Billy Parks, the second a 20-yard touchdown completion to cut the score to 28–23 with less than two minutes left.|$|E

5000|$|Producer Ron Nevison <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> {{create a}} clearer {{sound and the}} album ranges from frantic guitar and drum solos to quiet ballads like [...] "Silver Dreams".

50|$|Lindsay's fame {{as a poet}} grew in the 1910s. Because Harriet Monroe showcased {{him with}} two other Illinois poets — Carl Sandburg and Edgar Lee Masters — his name became linked to theirs. The success of either of the other two, in turn, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the third.|$|R
