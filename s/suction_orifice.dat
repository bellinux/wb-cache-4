5000|$|A mix of oil {{and water}} is pumped {{constantly}} into a cone-shaped separating apparatus at an angle, which creates a spinning vortex. The filtration {{is a result of}} the force balance that occurs on fluids in a vortex. High-density liquids will move to the outside, along with any contaminant, displacing the lower-density liquids to the inside (center of rotation). Water, being the more dense liquid, sits on the outside and is removed through a discharge outlet. Any segregated oil can now safely be recovered through a <b>suction</b> <b>orifice</b> at the center. The process will continue to function in this fashion as long as sufficient oil is added to maintain coverage of the <b>suction</b> <b>orifice.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the hydrodynamic instability and optimal forcing {{of a number}} of incompressible flow cases. In the first part, the instabilities of three problems that are of great interest in energy and aerospace applications are studied, namely a Blasius boundary layer subject to localized wall-suction, a Falkner–Skan–Cooke boundary layer with a localized surface roughness, and a pair of helical vortices. The two boundary layer flows are studied through spectral element simulations and eigenvalue computations, which enable their long-term behavior as well as the mechanisms causing transition to be determined. The emergence of transition in these cases is found to originate from a linear flow instability, but whereas the onset of this instability in the Blasius flow can be associated with a localized region {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>suction</b> <b>orifice,</b> the instability in the Falkner–Skan–Cooke flow involves the entire flow field. Due to this difference, the results of the eigenvalue analysis in the former case are found to be robust with respect to numerical parameters and domain size, whereas the results in the latter case exhibit an extreme sensitivity that prevents domain independent critical parameters from being determined. The instability of the two helices is primarily addressed through experiments and analytic theory. It is shown that the well known pairing instability of neighboring vortex filaments is responsible for transition, and careful measurements enable growth rates of the instabilities to be obtained that are in close agreement with theoretical predictions. Using the experimental baseflow data, a successful attempt is subsequently also made to reproduce this experiment numerically. In the second part of the thesis, a novel method for computing the optimal forcing of a dynamical system is developed. The method is based on an application of the inverse power method preconditioned by the Laplace preconditioner to the direct and adjoint resolvent operators. The method is analyzed for the Ginzburg–Landau equation and afterwards the Navier–Stokes equations, where it is implemented in the spectral element method and validated on the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow and the flow around a cylinder.

40|$|The viewgraphs and {{discussion}} of lift enhancement by trapped vortex are provided. Efforts are continuously being made to find simple ways to convert wings of aircraft from an efficient cruise configuration to one that develops the high lift needed during landing and takeoff. The high-lift configurations studied here consist of conventional airfoils with a trapped vortex over the upper surface. The vortex is trapped by one or two vertical fences that serve as barriers to the oncoming stream and as reflection planes for the vortex and the sink that form a separation bubble {{on top of the}} airfoil. Since the full three-dimensional unsteady flow problem over the wing of an aircraft is so complicated {{that it is hard to}} get an understanding of the principles that govern the vortex trapping process, the analysis is restricted here to the flow field illustrated in the first slide. It is assumed that the flow field between the two end plates approximates a streamwise strip of the flow over a wing. The flow between the endplates and about the airfoil consists of a spanwise vortex located between the <b>suction</b> <b>orifices</b> in the endplates. The spanwise fence or spoiler located near the nose of the airfoil serves to form a separated flow region and a shear layer. The vorticity in the shear layer is concentrated into the vortex by withdrawal of fluid at the <b>suction</b> <b>orifices.</b> As the strength of the vortex increases with time, it eventually dominates the flow in the separated region so that a shear or vertical layer is no longer shed from the tip of the fence. At that point, the vortex strength is fixed and its location is such that all of the velocity contributions at its center sum to zero thereby making it an equilibrium point for the vortex. The results of a theoretical analysis of such an idealized flow field are described...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{high-order}} direct numerical simulations {{are summarized}} for {{the evolution of}} crossflow disturbances in incompressible wing-generic boundary-layers with suction at the wall. The concept of smart suction, an adapted combination of the upstream-flow-deformation (UFD) technique and suction, is presented for laminar flow control. In the UFD technique, relatively tightly spaced, useful crossflow vortices are excited once, grow to nonlinearly large amplitudes due to primary instability, and deform the baseflow thus suppressing otherwise naturally growing, nocent vortices with larger spanwise spacing, and do not cause secondary instability that otherwise rapidly invokes turbulence. They can also be excited repeatedly by specially ordered (groups of) <b>suction</b> <b>orifices,</b> leading to <b>suction</b> with distributed flow deformation (DFD), termed DFD suction. Results for suction panels are shown that have a significantly better performance than the otherwise ideal homogeneous suction at the same suction rate. Pinpoint suction can be used to directly attack secondary instability of nocent crossflow vortices: suction underneath the high-shear layer region causing the secondary instability is found to significantly attenuate secondary instability up to complete suppression, at relatively low suction rates...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} made of the performance capabilities of a lift concept that utilizes a spanwise vortex over the upper surface of the wing. The vortex is generated by a vertical flap near {{the leading edge of}} the wing and maintained by <b>suction</b> through <b>orifices</b> in endplates at the wingtip. The analysis approximates the three-dimensional flow field with a two-dimensional configuration that is mapped by conformal transformation into the flow about a circle. Theoretical solutions for a range of flap and orifice configurations predict that section lift coefficients up to around 10 can be achieved. It is concluded that such a lift concept is applicable to STOL aircraft if the vortex can be adequately stabilized and if the endplate suction can be generated efficiently...|$|R

This paper concerns the following questions: Which techniques of pneumatic pest control are available and how may these techniques be improved in terms of technical and physical parameters? Hypothesis: Analysis of pneumatic pest control techniques supports improvement of present available implements. Method: Literature review, process analysis, and evaluation in respect of agricultural engineering parameters (air flow rate, air speed, working hours, energy input, process costs). Results: Success of pneumatic pest control varies in a wide range, and the technique does not always grant satisfying results. Collection of eggs and larvae is more difficult than collection of adult insects. Usually weekly treatment is necessary. Frequent treatments may cause soil compaction. Pneumatic pest control may distribute fungal infection. Beneficial organisms may suffer from pneumatic techniques. Investment costs of pneumatic implements are high (ca. 5000 - 12000 €/row). Simultaneously blowing and sucking hoods work better than common suction hoods. Both the interrelationship and the control of physical parameters is almost not subject of research. An analysis of physical parameters and their interrelationships reveals that airflow rate, working width, and travel speed can be comprised within the term air requirement L=te*V where: te is the effective working time and V the airflow rate. The air requirement correlates with the success of the treatment and is an objective evaluation criterion for the implement and its pneumatic efficiency. The latter may be improved by the following measures: 1) High travel speed prevents pests from escaping the suction hood. 2) Pests sitting upon the plant should start to fly before suction. This may be achieved pneumatically by blowing nozzles and/or mechanically by chains, brushes or similar devices. 3) A suction hood stretched in direction of travel may prolong the duration of pneumatic treatment to ensure successful control. To minimize the tractor power required, the suction airflow velocity under the suction hood should be as low as possible. However, the suction airflow velocity must always be greater than the flying speed of the pest. Low airflow velocity may also contribute to go easy on useful insects.

50|$|Most {{analytical}} pneumatic nebulizers use {{the same}} essential principle (induction) to atomize the liquid: When gas at a higher pressure exits from a small hole (the orifice) into gas at a lower pressure, it forms a gas jet into the lower pressure zone, and pushes the lower pressure gas away from the orifice. This creates a current in the lower pressure gas zone, and draws some of the lower pressure gas into the higher pressure gas jet. At the orifice, the draw of the lower pressure gas creates considerable suction, the extent depending on the differential pressures, {{the size of the}} orifice, and the shape of the orifice and surrounding apparatus. In all pneumatic induction nebulizers, the <b>suction</b> near the <b>orifice</b> is utilized to draw the liquid into the gas jet. The liquid is broken into small droplets in the process. Present induction pneumatic nebulizer designs fit into 5 categories: 1. Concentric: Liquid flow surrounded by a Gas flow or Gas flow surrounded by a Liquid flow; 2. Cross Flow: Gas flow at right angles to the Liquid flow; 3. Entrained: Gas and Liquid mixed in the system and emitted as a combined flow. 4. Babington and V Groove: Liquid is spread over a surface to decrease the surface tension, and passed over a gas orifice; 5. Parallel Path: Liquid is delivered beside a gas orifice and induction pulls the liquid into the gas stream.|$|R
40|$|In most {{industrial}} applications involving flow the Reynolds number is typically sufficiently high {{such that the}} boundary layer is turbulent. Flow instabilities within the turbulent boundary layer can result in an excessive drag penalty which {{is considered to be}} the main parameter affecting the aerodynamic efficiency in numerous applications including aircraft and pipelines. The aim of this research is manipulation of the turbulent boundary layer through the oscillatory flow created by a flow-excited Helmholtz resonator for the purpose of minimising the flow instabilities. Attention has been given here to a cylindrical Helmholtz resonator as a possible alternative flow control device. The energy required to activate the Helmholtz resonator comes from the grazing flow and it can be fitted to existing airframes with minimal manufacturing requirements. Hence it can potentially be an ideal solution for a wall-based flow control device. This research provides an insight into the behaviour of the flow {{in the vicinity of the}} resonator and assesses the capability of a flow-excited Helmholtz resonator for reduction of disturbances within the boundary layer. The excitation of flow in the vicinity of the Helmholtz resonator is associated with both the external pressure fluctuations within the turbulent boundary layer and the acoustic response of the resonator cavity. A model of the relationship between the pressure inside the cavity and the boundary layer was developed based on a momentum balance equation and combination of the vortex sheet with discrete vortex models. A parametric study of the resonator showed that when the orifice length is increased the pressure fluctuations within the resonator are reduced, potentially due to the larger skin friction inside the orifice. To understand the boundary layer features over a flow-excited Helmholtz resonator a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the three dimensional flow over a wide range of flow velocities was also conducted. It was demonstrated that when the boundary layer thickness equals the orifice length and is twice the orifice diameter, the flow <b>suction</b> within the <b>orifice</b> is greater than the flow injection area which results in a reduction in the turbulence intensity of up to 10 %. Detailed investigation of the characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer downstream of the resonator has also been accomplished through an extensive experimental study in a subsonic wind tunnel with a low turbulence intensity level of 0. 5 %, for free stream velocities between 15 and 30 m/s. Similar to the results of the numerical modelling, the experimental results showed that a resonator with an orifice length equal to the boundary layer thickness modifies near-wall structures such that the intensity of sweep is reduced by up to 5 % and its duration by up to 8 %. It was also demonstrated that when the orifice diameter approximately equals the thickness of the inner layer, ｙ⁺ ≈ 400, the velocity fluctuations normal to the grazing flow can penetrate the boundary layer, which in turn causes the large eddies to transfer their energy to the smaller eddies within the logarithmic region, resulting in attenuation of turbulence production. The results of this study provide an improved understanding for the further development of flow-excited Helmholtz resonators as a flow control device, an area that warrants further investigation in the future.
