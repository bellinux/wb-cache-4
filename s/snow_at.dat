This video is shown on a small on-stage television screen at live shows, including the band's 2008 Viva la Vida tour.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural <b>snow</b> <b>at</b> ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E

5|$|Scientists study <b>snow</b> <b>at</b> a {{wide variety}} of scales that include the physics of {{chemical}} bonds and clouds; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river hydraulics and ground hydrology. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by agronomists, who address the availability of snowmelt to agriculture, and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is avalanches, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{flies to}} the Mana Fortress and confronts Thanatos, who is {{preparing}} to transfer his mind into Dyluck. With {{the last of his}} strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his soul to the underworld and must not be allowed to have the Fortress. Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal lich form, which the party defeats. The Mana Beast finally flies in and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish. With the sprite's encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into <b>snow.</b> <b>At</b> the conclusion of the game, the hero is seen returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the Potos waterfall.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-two nations—the {{largest number}} of {{participating}} Winter Olympic countries to that point—competed in the four sports and twenty-four events. The Soviet Union made its Winter Olympics debut and won more medals than any nation. Austrian Toni Sailer became {{the first person to}} sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games. Logistically, the only problem encountered was a lack of <b>snow</b> <b>at</b> the alpine skiing events. To remedy this, the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{contingent}} did {{not reach}} {{in time for the}} fighting, the city's capital was taken. Aside from some farm life, the town had been largely abandoned. The taking of the region marked a continuous swath of territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper, a total of 3,000 square kilometers. In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced to walk through the heavy <b>snow</b> <b>at</b> freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 unaccounted for. Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and hostage-taking.|$|E
5|$|Charlie is {{accepted}} by Sam and Patrick's {{group of friends}} and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, {{who died in a}} car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the <b>snow.</b> <b>At</b> a regular Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a desultory relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of the room in response. Following this, Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while, {{and the rest of the}} friend group shuns him. His flashbacks of Aunt Helen return.|$|E
5|$|Like the extinctions {{of other}} New Zealand birds {{such as the}} piopio in the 19th century, {{the decline of the}} huia was poorly studied. Massive {{deforestation}} occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatu and the Wairarapa, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in old-growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, secondary forests. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape <b>snow</b> <b>at</b> higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.|$|E

25|$|One of the mildest climates in Canada, {{the region}} has a mean annual {{temperature}} of 9°C with a summer mean of 15°C and a winter mean of 3.5°C. Annual precipitation ranges from an annual mean of 850mm in the west end to 2000mm in {{the eastern end of}} the Fraser Valley and at higher elevations. Maximum precipitation occurs as rain in winter. Less than ten percent falls as <b>snow</b> <b>at</b> sea level but the amount of snowfall increases significantly with elevation.|$|E
25|$|Flooding {{can cover}} {{much of the}} Lower Mainland.

25|$|According to {{traveler}} John Muir, on {{his visit}} to Diomede Islands in the 1880s they found the natives eager to trade away everything they had. The village was perched on the steep rocky slope of the mountain which drops at once sheer into deep water. The huts were mostly built of stone with skin roofs.
