The construction pit {{featured in the}} episode was dug out by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district in Los Angeles. [...] The producers went door-to-door to neighboring residents to seek their permission, then rented construction equipment to dig {{the hole in the}} ground. The pit was guarded 24 hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, and several of the hallway scenes, were shot at the Pasadena city hall building. The interior parks and recreation department scenes were filmed on a sound stage. The windows could drop water that would simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. [...] The cold open scene was filmed in an actual playground in Los Angeles. The <b>spiral</b> <b>tube</b> slide used in the scene {{was the only one of}} its type left in the city, because the rest had been deemed too dangerous and removed. The public forum scenes were filmed in a Los Angeles middle school. The script originally called for the meeting to be held in a classroom because the auditorium door was locked. However, Daniels said the writers thought the school's auditorium was such a [...] "cool location" [...] that they added a scene in which the auditorium lights were turned off in the middle of the meeting.|$|E

40|$|Different {{techniques}} as angled spiraling tape inserts, a round tube in side a twisted square <b>tube</b> and <b>spiraled</b> <b>tube</b> in side the annulus {{have been used}} to enhance heat transfer in the annulus of tube-in-tube heat exchangers. The heat transfer enhancement in the shell can be supplemented by heat transfer augmentation in tubes using twisted tape inserts or micro-finned tubes. The effect of the thermal resistance of the condensing refrigerant could also be taken into consideration. To assess the benefit of using these techniques extended performance evaluation criteria have been implemented at different constraints. The decrease of the entropy generation can be combined with the relative in crease of the heat transfer rate or the relative reduction of the heat transfer area to find out the geometrical parameters of the tubes for optimal thermodynamics performance. The results show that in most of the cases considered, the angled <b>spiraling</b> <b>tube</b> insert technique is the most efficient...|$|R

50|$|The {{tubes in}} the Illingworth boiler design are spirals, but {{wrapped around the}} central steam drum, rather than sitting {{alongside}} it.

There are thus fewer tubes, sixteen in this case, but each one is longer (between 260-280 bore diameters is suggested) and so the boiler is still a dense arrangement of heating area in a small space.|$|R
