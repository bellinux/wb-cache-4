40|$|The {{objective}} of this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), was to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} vapor-phase bioreactor system for the destruction of trichloroethylene (TCE) from contaminated groundwater. A field demonstration was per-formed using groundwater at the Oak Ridge K- 25 Site contaminated with a complex mixture of organic chemicals. This site is managed and operated by Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. for the Department of Energy (DOE). Analysis of the data generated during the test can be summarized in three major observations. First, TCE was degraded in the presence of all the organics found in the <b>steam</b> <b>strip</b> condensate. This was observed during treatment of both the <b>steam</b> <b>strip</b> condensate and condensate amended with TCE to increase its concentration relative to the other components. The conclusion that TCE was being biodegraded was supported by performing mass balance control experiments with the reactor and by tracking recalcitrant chemicals also present in the steam stripper condensate. Second, there appeared to be an initial lag period of up to 24 hours before onset of TCE degradation in the reactor. The source of this lag was not determined but could be related to either an acclimation of the microorganisms to other chemicals found in the condensate or reversible inhibitory effects on TCE degradation. The duration of TCE degradative activity was relatively short for only 2 to 5 days. compared to previous demonstrations where TCE was the sole contaminant. However, several of the runs were interrupted due to mechanical and not biological issues. Third, other chemical contaminants were also degraded. by the bacteria used in the vapor phase reactor which is consistent with previous work performed both at ENVIROGEN and elsewhere...|$|R

During the manufacturing process, the dark-colored solids of the cocoa bean are separated from its fatty content, as with milk, semi-sweet, and dark chocolate. But, unlike those other chocolate types, the cocoa solids are not recombined. As a result, this fat, cocoa butter, is the only cacao ingredient in white chocolate. Because it contains no cocoa solids, white chocolate contains only trace amounts of the stimulants theobromine and caffeine, while lacking the antioxidant properties or many characterizing ingredients of chocolate, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and phenylethylamine. Often, the cocoa butter is deodorized to remove its strong flavor.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) Savannah River Site is {{currently}} immobilizing high level nuclear waste sludge by vitrification in borosilicate glass. The processing strategy involves blending a large batch of sludge into a feed tank, washing the sludge {{to reduce the}} amount of soluble species, then processing the large ''sludge batch'' through the DWPF. Each sludge batch is tested by the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) using simulants and tests with samples of the radioactive waste to ''qualify'' the batch prior to processing in the DWPF. The DWPF pretreats the sludge by first acidifying the sludge with nitric and formic acid. The ratio of nitric to formic acid is adjusted as required to target a final glass composition that is slightly reducing (the target is for {approx} 20 % of the iron to have a valence of two in the glass). The formic acid reduces the mercury in the feed to elemental mercury which is <b>steam</b> <b>stripped</b> from the feed. After a concentration step, the glass former (glass frit) is added as a 50 wt% slurry and the batch is concentrated to approximately 50 wt% solids. The feed slurry is then fed to a joule heated melter maintained at 1150 C. The glass must meet both processing (e. g., viscosity and liquidus temperature) and product performance (e. g., durability) constraints The alkali content of the final waste glass is a critical parameter that affects key glass properties (such as durability) as well as the processing characteristics of the waste sludge during the pretreatment and vitrification processes. Increasing the alkali content of the glass has been shown to improve the production rate of the DWPF, but the total alkali in the final glass is limited by constraints on glass durability and viscosity. Two sources of alkali contribute to the final alkali content of the glass: sodium salts in the waste supernate and sodium and lithium oxides in the glass frit added during pretreatment processes. Sodium salts in the waste supernate can be reduced significantly by washing the solids to remove soluble species. The ''washing strategy'' for future sludge batches can be controlled to limit the soluble sodium remaining in the waste stream while balancing the alkali content of the frit to maintain acceptable glass properties as well as improve melter processing characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Work was {{performed}} to identify a process to vitrify the contents of F- canyon Tank 17. 1. Tank 17. 1 contains the majority of americium (Am) and curium (Cm) contained in the DOE Complex. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has made a formal request for this material as fuel for production of Cf 252 and other transplutonium actinides. The Am and Cm (and associated lanthanide fission products) are currently in nitric acid solution. Transportation of the intensely radioactive Am/Cm in liquid form is not considered possible. As a result, the material will either be solidified and shipped to ORNL or discarded to the Tank Farm. Nuclear Materials Processing Technology (NMPT), therefore, requested Defense Waste Processing Technology (DWPT) {{to determine if the}} Tank 17. 1 material could be vitrified, and if it was vitrified could the americium and curium be successfully recovered. Research {{was performed}} to determine if the Tank 17. 1 contents could indeed be mixed with glass formers and vitrified. Additional studies identified critical process parameters such as heat loading, melter requirements, off-gas evolution, etc. Discussions with NMPT personnel were initiated to determine existing facilities where this work could be accomplished safely. A process has been identified which will convert the Am/Cm material into approximately 300 kg of glass. This will be done by initially removing the large quantities of transition metals and aluminum. Oxalic acid will be added to Tank 17. 1 and the actinides and lanthanides will be precipitated as oxalates. The remaining aqueous fraction will be removed and the lanthanides and actinides will then be redissolved. The solution will be evaporated and <b>steam</b> <b>stripped</b> down to approximately 100 g/I solids and 1 N nitric acid prior to being transferred into a receipt/feed tank in the Multi- Purpose Processing Facility (MPPF - formerly Section 18 of F-Canyon). The Am/Cm solution will then be fed directly into a bushing melter. Glass beads will be added simultaneously alongside the solution and the mixture will be vitrified and cast into stainless steel canisters. The filled glass canisters will be allowed to cool and deconned prior to packaging for transport to ORNL. The melter will be capable of a minimum 1 - 2 kg/hr glass output, so total processing time will be on the order of a few hundred hours. The glass is a borosilicate composition designed to be selectively attacked by nitric acid.

30|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with steam flooding. In steam flooding, as the steam zone grows, more oil moves from the steam zone to the unheated zone ahead of the steam front. The oil gets accumulated to form an oil bank. The condensed hot water also moves across the steam front, heating and displacing the accumulated oil. The heated oil with reduced viscosity moves toward the producing well and is produced usually by artificial lifting. There are many factors that promote high displacement efficiency of a steam drive. Firstly, there is expansion of oil and reduction in oil viscosity with temperature (Willman et al. 1961). Secondly, steam distillation of oil left behind the hot water flood increases the overall oil recovery. When a vapor phase (steam) is {{in the presence of}} two immiscible liquids (oil and water), each liquid phase exerts its own vapor phase at the temperature of the system. Distillation begins when the sum of the vapor phase (oil and water) equals the total pressure on the system. As a result, oil starts distilling at a temperature much lower than the normal boiling point of its constituents. Thirdly, miscible displacement of residual oil takes place due to the solvent extraction process (Volek and Pryor 1972): <b>Steam</b> distillation <b>strips</b> the more volatile component from residual oil. Steam, enriched with these hydrocarbons, flows through the steam zone and gets condensed at the condensation front. The condensed hydrocarbon contains lighter constituents than the oil resident in that region and can displace some of the oil miscibly. Finally, steam drive is inherently more stable than hot water floods (Prats 1982).|$|R
40|$|Failure {{investigation}} {{was done on}} a 321 stainless steel charge heater tube which failed in a refinery unit processing heavy crude oil. Crude oil was the charge in the radiant and convection sections; while saturated <b>stripping</b> <b>steam</b> is present in convection section. After a leak was detected, visual inspection revealed that nine convection tubes had black oil/coke deposits on their external surfaces. The deposits were seen on the first three rows of tubes. When one of the tubes was lightly ground at the black colored area, a circumferential crack was visually observed. The investigation revealed that long-term aging, coupled with localized deposition of salts and coke from the heavy crude led to sensitization of the tube surface layers. This in turn resulted in sulphidation of the internal surface grain boundaries, formation of grooves, and cracking of the material. Thus, cracking was intergranular in nature in the initial stage, but became transgranular at later stages. It was concluded that cracking was due to chloride stress corrosion cracking catalyzed {{by the presence of}} sulphur-bearing species. It was recommended that the desalter operation be improved and frequent decoking and scale removal be carried out, with emphasis on the convection section at the refinery...|$|R
