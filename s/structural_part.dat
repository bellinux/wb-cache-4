Substantial part of the temples were damaged resulting in many broken parts seen lying scattered around the temple. Further, the heterogeneous structural compactness of the sandstone rock mass, from which the temples have been carved out, {{has contributed to the}} damage. A particular <b>structural</b> <b>part</b> of the temple which {{is not part of the}} main monolithic temple complex suffered severe damage to most of its circular columns which resulted in collapse of the mandapa and the roof (probably made of local timber) of the structure.|$|E
25|$|Sculpture {{in stone}} is {{seemingly}} the most permanent way of creating images. Because stone is durable to the weather, {{it is the}} favoured way of adding figurative decoration to the exteriors of church buildings, either with free-standing statues, figures that form a <b>structural</b> <b>part</b> of the building, or panels of pictorial reliefs. Unfortunately with the pollution and acid rain of the 19th and 20th centuries, much architectural sculpture that had remained reasonably intact for centuries has rapidly deteriorated and become unrecognizable in the last 150 years. On the other hand, much sculpture that is located within church buildings is as fresh as {{the day it was}} carved. Because it is often made of the very substance of the building which houses it, narrative stone sculpture is often found internally to be decorating features such as capitals, or as figures located within the apertures of stone screens.|$|E
25|$|After {{the merger}} between Square and Enix in 2003, many rookie staff members {{had to be}} trained and there were more new {{platforms}} to develop for {{with the release of}} the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Toriyama decided to assemble and direct a team of scenario writers and joined various game projects. He later collaborated with Final Fantasy X main programmer Koji Sugimoto and supervisor Yoshinori Kitase to create a Final Fantasy VII tech demo for the PlayStation 3. Development of this took around 6 weeks. During the first year after the development start of Final Fantasy XIII in April 2004, Toriyama thought up a story premised on the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythology created by Kazushige Nojima. In March 2006, when the <b>structural</b> <b>part</b> of the narrative started to come together and lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team, Toriyama showed him a rough outline of what he had written and asked him to flesh out the story and to correct how everything would connect.|$|E

500|$|In March 2006, {{when the}} <b>structural</b> <b>part</b> of the {{narrative}} started to come together, lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes {{that needed to be}} kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say [...] "Snow and Hope reconcile". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a [...] "reliable and calm leader type" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was [...] "almost a little too dark", he wanted to include something like it in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.|$|E
