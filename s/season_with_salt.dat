25|$|In {{the late}} 14th century, {{the first known}} waffle recipe was penned in an {{anonymous}} manuscript, Le Ménagier de Paris, written by a husband {{as a set of}} instructions to his young wife. While it technically contains four recipes, all are a variation of the first: Beat some eggs in a bowl, <b>season</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> and add wine. Toss in some flour, and mix. Then fill, little by little, two irons at a time with as much of the paste as a slice of cheese is large. Then close the iron and cook both sides. If the dough does not detach easily from the iron, coat it first with a piece of cloth that has been soaked in oil or grease. The other three variations explain how cheese is to be placed in between two layers of batter, grated and mixed in to the batter, or left out, along with the eggs. However, this was a waffle / gaufre in name only, as the recipe contained no leavening.|$|E

50|$|For 700 g of fish, finely chop {{an onion}} and saute it with oil, parsley, and two whole cloves of garlic. The moment the onion starts to brown, add 300 g of chopped from {{tomatoes}} or tomato paste, and <b>season</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong vinegar or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted {{in a large}} glass of water. Let boil {{for a few more}} minutes, then discard the garlic and strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including sole, red mullet, gurnard, dogfish, mantis shrimp, and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add a little olive oil, since the amount of soffritto was quite small. When the fish is cooked, the cacciucco is usually brought to the table on two separate platters: on one you place the fish, strained from the broth, and on the other you arrange enough finger-thick slices of bread to soak up all the broth.|$|E
