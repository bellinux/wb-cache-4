50|$|The Cherry Mine {{had been}} opened in 1905 by the St. Paul Coal Company to supply coal for the trains of its {{controlling}} company, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. The mine {{consisted of three}} horizontal veins, each deeper than the last. The veins were connected vertically by two shafts set some 100 yards apart. Both the main shaft and the <b>secondary</b> <b>shaft</b> contained wooden stairs and ladders. The main shaft was capped by an 85-foot steel tower which controlled a mechanical hoisting cage.

The two shafts were then closed off to smother the fire, but this also had the effect of cutting off oxygen to the miners, and allowing the “black damp,” a suffocating mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, to build up in the mine.|$|E

5000|$|The {{steering}} {{actually had}} the same [...] "assist" [...] at all speeds — the steering was hydraulically locked against steering movement of the wheels from the road ("feedback") up to {{the capacity of the}} unit. The reduction in 'assist' was achieved by a piston/roller pushing on a heart shaped cam geared to the steering shaft (hence the one turn to full lock), which was fed with system pressure so that as its pressure rose with increasing road speed, the steering assistance seemingly reduced and the steering centering effort rose. However, full steering wheel turning was available at all speeds, though considerable force was necessary to turn the steering wheel at high road speed. Enough pressure was admitted to the centering unit to return the wheels to the straight ahead position when the car was not moving. The centering pressure was regulated by a flyweight centrifugal governor driven by the pinion (<b>secondary)</b> <b>shaft</b> of the manual gearbox and by a proportioning valve connected to the fluid pressure in the automatic gearbox, which pressure was proportional to the speed of the output shaft. The pressure increased all the way to 120 mph, and a subsidiary function of this feed was to turn off the air conditioning fans above 50 km/h.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, a new twin {{converter}} transmission, the L 620 reU2, {{was developed}} for high-performance, main-line locomotives. The new L 620 reU2 was equipped with both a start-up converter, having a diameter of 525 mm, {{as well as a}} travel-phase converter, having a diameter of 434 mm. The design of the new L 620 re U2 was based on its successful predecessor, the L 520 rzU2 which had a power rating of 1,400 kW. This new transmission however was rated significantly higher at 2,700 kW and therefore virtually all of its components had to be enlarged as well as reinforced. In the standard version of the transmission, two gears were mounted on the <b>secondary</b> <b>shaft</b> rather than using the idler wheel found in the older L 520 rzU2. As a result, the drive shaft's output speed could be adjusted to suit the locomotive's power requirements. The drive shaft's main bearing was also enlarged to 550 mm. In general, this new high-performance transmission clearly illustrated the enormous capability of hydrodynamic couplings. With a weight-to-power ratio of only 2.06 kg/kW, the new L 620 reU2 set a record for locomotive transmissions. By comparison, the similar L 520 rzU2 transmission had a far higher weight-to-power ratio of 2.4 kg/kW. In addition, a newly designed hydrodynamic retarder, the KB 385, was available as an optional component. At Vossloh, the locomotive manufacturer based in Kiel, these transmissions were installed in both its G1700 and G2000 main-line locomotives. Finally, the latest development is the LS 640 reU2 transmission which will be used {{for the first time in}} the Voith Maxima locomotive having 3,600 kW. The LS 640 reU2 is a so-called split turbo-transmission which uses two drive shafts from the L 620 reU2 to power both bogies of a six axle diesel locomotive.|$|E

An argument could be made that the average 38.5  mL increase in estimated blood loss and 18.5  min increase in operative time with implantation of a long versus short CMN is not clinically significant.

40|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the I.

The paper presents a theoretical study on the dynamic behaviour of automotive transmissions focusing {{on the presence of}} oil between the impacting tooth of the meshing gears. This rattle phenomenon is particularly audible at low regimes and regards all the gear pairs different from the gear inserted to transmit the power. Another operating condition that manifests the gear rattle phenomenon is typically the “idle condition”, when all the gear pairs are meshing but without loading. The presence of oil between the impacting tooth of the gear pairs can play a positive role to decrease the vibrations and than the rattle noise level. In the paper some driveline complete models comprising many components as flywheel, clutch, primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>shafts,</b> are described accounting for the presence of oil lubricant between the teeth of the unloaded gear pairs.

During earth moving works {{the sides of}} digging area have to be supported by sheet pile walls to maintain constant earth pressure conditions against existing foundations. The piles and sheet piles are very often driven by vibratory methods, {{in which case the}} ground vibration is a risk for neighboring old buildings. The purpose of the present research work is to find a new, theoretically well established way to use vibratory pile drivers environmentally friendly especially in urban environments.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{phenomena}} compromising {{the comfort of the}} passenger vehicles is jerk. Jerk occurs {{as a response to the}} transient in the driver torque demand. The transient provokes torsional oscillation of the drivetrain, which results in oscillations and jerk of the vehicle. These oscillations and jerk are transmitted to the driver and can cause discomfort to the driver and thus affecting the drivability of the vehicle. The aim of this work is to develop an anti-jerk controller to achieve smooth response of the vehicle and enhance the drivability metrics. The drivability analysis in this thesis focused on the longitudinal dynamic response during the tip-in manoeuvre. The anti-jerk controller introduced in this work is an optimisation-based controller. It is developed by using two models, i. e. a linear model and non-linear model.

To achieve high confidence of the models fidelity, the models were verified by experimental data which ensures that the models are accurate and characterised by the required details. The anti-jerk controller is an optimised controller and uses a gain scheduling where the gain scheduling optimisation was performed off-line to reduce the engineering time in the controller gain tuning. The simulation results of the models with the controller show a significant improvement of the drivability, which is measured by the overshoot and the rise time on the acceleration profile...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Research on {{damage of}} gears and gear pairs using {{vibration}} signals remains very attractive, because vibration signals from a gear pair are complex {{in nature and}} not easy to interpret. Predicting gear pair defects by analyzing changes in vibration signal of gears pairs in operation is a very reliable method. Therefore, a suitable vibration signal processing technique is necessary to extract defect information generally obscured by the noise from dynamic factors of other gear pairs. This article presents the value of cepstrum analysis in vehicle gearbox fault diagnosis. Cepstrum represents the overall power content of a whole family of harmonics and sidebands when more than one family of sidebands is present at the same time. The concept for the measurement and analysis involved in using the technique are briefly outlined. Cepstrum analysis is used for detection of an artificial pitting defect in a vehicle gearbox loaded with different speeds and torques. The test stand is equipped with three dynamometers; the input dynamometer serves asthe internal combustion engine, the output dynamometers introduce the load on the flanges of the output joint shafts. The pitting defect is manufactured on the tooth side of a gear of the fifth speed on the <b>secondary</b> <b>shaft.</b> Also, a method for fault diagnosis of gear faults is presented based on order Cepstrum.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{conditions}} {{leading to the}} indefinite termination of production in four critical primary panels at an underground coal mining operation, the observed shortcomings in the mining approach, and the proposed strategy to mine through the affected panels. Initial assessment of the abandoned panel conditions indicated time-dependent strata failure, (i. e. bolted roof failure overrunning intersections), which occurred from mere minutes to up to four weeks post-production, with and without prior warning of failure. This prompted the constant re-supporting of back areas, which raised safety and productivity concerns. Investigation of the initial mining conditions revealed that the failures were due to a critical combination of factors, the chief of which was isolated horizontal stress. Other factors that were initially overlooked by the mine (i. e. influence of hydraulic stress, misinterpretation of borehole data), resulted in the conditions being described as abnormal.
