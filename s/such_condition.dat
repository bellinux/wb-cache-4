Hoffa had been released from prison on December 23, 1971, when President Richard Nixon commuted his sentence to time served. According to the United States Department of Justice and White House officials, Hoffa's release was granted on the condition that he not participate directly or indirectly in union activities until 1980. But Hoffa contended that he had never agreed to any <b>such</b> <b>condition,</b> and unsuccessfully sued to have the restriction overturned. But Fitzsimmons supported the government's position, and Charles Colson, special counsel to President Nixon who helped negotiate Hoffa's release, backed Fitzsimmon's interpretation of the release agreement.|$|E

25|$|Neovascular {{glaucoma}} {{results when}} new, abnormal vessels begin developing in {{the angle of}} the eye that begin blocking the drainage. Patients with <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures. A new treatment for this disease, as first reported by Kahook and colleagues, involves the use of a novel group of medications known as anti-VEGF agents. These injectable medications can lead to a dramatic decrease in new vessel formation and, if injected early enough in the disease process, may lead to normalization of intraocular pressure. Currently, there are no high-quality controlled trials demonstrating a beneficial effect of anti-VEGF treatments in lowering IOP in people with neovascular glaucoma.|$|E

Both are carvel built and sailing, contrary to Anna Karoline which is on land. The Holvikejekta located at Sandane in Western Norway is also ashore and as Anna Karoline she is also clinker built.|$|E

In regards to the move, Gillis stated he felt Malhotra was vulnerable to serious injury because of an eye injury he suffered in 2011. The decision was made despite Malhotra playing in 78 games in the 2011–12 season and nine games in 2013. Gillis further noted that he had reservation about him playing in the previous season, but wanted to give Malhotra a chance to adapt. After watching him play, Gillis did not see the types of changes that would not put him at a higher risk of injury. Upon placing Malhotra on IR, Gillis called it the hardest thing he had done as a GM. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly released a statement on the situation, saying [...] "the League is satisfied and has approved the team's and player's joint decision to discontinue the player's participation in NHL games at this time on the basis of the player’s current medical condition and the risk of injury that <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> poses." [...] The Canucks also announced that Malhotra would remain with the team in some capacity, but would not return to the ice including in the playoffs.|$|E

2500|$|During Congressional {{debate in}} [...] 1820 on the {{proposed}} Tallmadge Amendment, which sought to limit slavery in Missouri as it became a state, Rufus King declared that [...] "laws or compacts imposing any <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> [...] upon any human being are absolutely void, because contrary {{to the law of}} nature, which is the law of God, by which he makes his ways known to man, and is paramount to all human control."

2500|$|Even before Davis {{questioned}} {{the idea of}} a belief system centering on human-jaguar copulation, scholars like Michael Coe looked for biological causes for the fleshy lips, cleft head, and toothless mouths that make up the were-jaguar motif. Genetic abnormalities like Down syndrome and spina bifida have been common explanations. People afflicted with spina bifida in particular present developmental defects that coincide with the were-jaguar characteristics. One <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> is encephaloceles, which among other things, can cause separation of the cranial sutures and result in a depression, or cleft, in the head. Cranium bifidum can produce similar results. In addition, there is a higher chance of these conditions occurring within the same family than randomly throughout the population, and there might have been considerable inbreeding among the elite. [...] If children born with this affliction were seen as divine or special in some way, multiple births of affected children within a family or familial line would have reinforced that family's political and religious power.|$|E
2500|$|Money {{market funds}} seek a stable net asset value, or NAV per share (which is {{generally}} [...] $1.00 in the United States); they aim to never lose money. The $1.00 is maintained through {{the declaration of}} dividends to shareholders, typically daily, at an amount equal to the fund's net income. If a fund's NAV drops below $1.00, {{it is said that}} the fund [...] "broke the buck." [...] For SEC registered money funds, maintaining the $1.00 flat NAV is usually accomplished under a provision under Rule 2a-7 of the 40 Act that allows a fund to value its investments at amortized cost rather than market value, provided that certain conditions are maintained. One <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> involves a side-test calculation of the NAV that uses the market value of the fund's investments. The fund's published, amortized value may not exceed this market value by more than 1/2 cent per share, a comparison that is generally made weekly. If the variance does exceed $0.005 per share, the fund could be considered to have broken the buck, and regulators may force it into liquidation.|$|E
