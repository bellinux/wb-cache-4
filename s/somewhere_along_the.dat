5|$|The 1827 North Carolina {{hurricane}} caused severe impacts {{along its}} track through the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{and up the}} East Coast of the United States in late August1827. First observed over the Leeward Islands on August17, the storm continued northwest, passing over Puerto Rico and the northern coastline of Hispaniola. It moved through the Turks and Caicos Islands and then the Bahamas by August21 and curved northward. Although there is some discrepancy in its track, the hurricane moved ashore <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> North Carolina coastline on August25, perhaps at Category4 intensity on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The cyclone emerged back into the Atlantic Ocean around Norfolk, Virginia, and grazed the New England coastline before last being observed offshore Nova Scotia on August28. Along its track, numerous vessels were damaged, capsized, or run aground. The combination of heavy rainfall and ferocious winds caused severe crop damage, damaged or destroyed structures, and snapped and uprooted trees. Overall, the storm was responsible {{for more than six}} deaths and at least two injuries.|$|E

5000|$|The {{asteroid}} {{itself is}} an elongated prolate spheroid {{which appears to}} be virtually identical to Juno, a large asteroid in the main belt. It has been hollowed out along its long axis, and subdivided into seven vast cylindrical chambers, and rotates to provide artificial gravity. The chambers are terraformed, with the second and third containing vast abandoned cities which have been maintained by automatic systems for centuries. As the Earth investigators explore the asteroid's interior, they make an even more stunning discovery — the end of the Stone's seventh chamber opens out into a vast cylindrical corridor ("The Way"), a [...] "pocket universe" [...] that extends far beyond the physical limit of the asteroid, and may possibly be infinite. These discoveries indicate both that the Stone's creators (who are dubbed the [...] "Stoners") have mastered the technology to open portals into other dimensions and alternate universes, and that, for unknown reasons, these original inhabitants had been evacuated from the Stone at some time in its past, and could well be living <b>somewhere</b> further <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Way.|$|R

Considering it unlikely that the dead men had been alone, O'Donnell assessed that {{the remainder of}} a Viet Cong squad was located <b>somewhere</b> further <b>along</b> <b>the</b> track and he subsequently requested artillery fire to block any escape, while 2 Platoon was ordered to sweep forward. Under the command of Second Lieutenant Graham Ross, 2 Platoon commenced its advance before coming under automatic fire [...] <b>along</b> <b>the</b> track by a Viet Cong squad which then went to ground after the Australians returned fire. Attempting to take the initiative, Ross began to manoeuvre for a quick attack, moving two sections to the high ground on the right flank, while the third section provided fire support. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong force, {{which turned out to be}} larger than first thought by the Australians, also attempted a flanking manoeuvre, moving one squad into a defensive position while two squads moved to their left flank. Deploying to the high ground at about the same time the two assault groups came face to face and a fierce fire-fight followed at close range, with both sides throwing grenades in an attempt to gain the initiative. Two Australians were killed and several more were wounded in the initial clashes.|$|R
