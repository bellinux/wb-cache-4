5|$|In 2009, Dal Sasso et al.. {{reported}} {{the results of}} X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 snout. As the foramina on the outside all communicated with a space {{on the inside of}} the snout, the authors speculated that Spinosaurus had pressure receptors inside the space that allowed it to hold its snout at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to detect swimming prey species without seeing them.|$|E
5|$|Open {{water is}} {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has direct vertical access to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{in contact with the}} atmosphere. Open water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air.|$|E
5|$|Since cats lack lips {{to create}} suction, {{they use a}} lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths. Lapping {{at a rate of}} four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.|$|E
6000|$|My Conjecture, That <b>the</b> unequal height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> {{proceeded}} from <b>the</b> greater pressure made upon <b>the</b> <b>water</b> by <b>the</b> Air {{without the}} Pipes ABC, then by that within them[8]; I shall endeavour to confirm from <b>the</b> truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two following Propositions: ...|$|R
5000|$|Dancing <b>Water</b> - <b>The</b> illegitimate {{daughter}} <b>of</b> Avalanche {{whose body}} {{is made of}} water. She can manipulate her body as a weapon and also open gateways on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{so that she can}} teleport herself and others across great distances.|$|R
50|$|Zantman's Rock {{is located}} 34 mi to <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> Land's End, Cornwall, and 6 mi west from <b>the</b> Isles <b>of</b> Scilly. Viewed from a distance, it is barely visible on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> It is 2 mi north of Bishop Rock Lighthouse, and about 0.25 mi {{northeast}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crim Rocks.|$|R
5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip {{down to the}} <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{to catch}} prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, {{in spite of their}} small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targetedâ€”conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lhamo Latso ... is a {{brilliant}} azure jewel set in a ring <b>of</b> grey mountains. <b>The</b> elevation and the surrounding peaks combine {{to give it a}} highly changeable climate, and <b>the</b> continuous passage <b>of</b> cloud and wind creates a constantly moving pattern on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> On that <b>surface</b> visions appear to those who seek them in <b>the</b> right frame <b>of</b> mind.|$|R
5000|$|Lower <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> emulsifies oil, lipid and fat food deposits, {{prevents}} droplet spotting on drying.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Simon {{said that}} on the fourth day, the Israelites encamped by <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea. The Egyptians were {{floating}} like skin-bottles upon <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> and a north wind cast them opposite the Israelites' camp. The Israelites saw the Egyptians and recognized them, saying that these were officials of Pharaoh's palace, and those were taskmasters. The Israelites recognized every one, as [...] says, [...] "And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore." ...|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the {{responsibility}} to keep possession of the ball {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or above the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E
50|$|Pink Lake is a {{meromictic}} lake {{located in}} Gatineau Park, Quebec, Canada. <b>The</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> are a deep green during <b>the</b> month <b>of</b> August and September due to <b>the</b> abundance <b>of</b> algae in <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> lake {{is in danger}} of eutrophication due to human activities. Park management forbids swimming in the lake, walking domestic animals near it, straying from the wooden boardwalk for sight-seers, and throwing stones into the lake. <b>The</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake has no oxygen and it is believed that some prehistoric species live there.|$|R
60|$|DENUDATION.--The wearing away <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land by <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|The sun was no {{more than}} a degree or so above the horizon, and from <b>the</b> heated <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> a slight low mist began to rise; a mist thin, {{invisible}} to the human eye; yet strong enough to change the sun into a mere glowing red disc, a disc vertical and hot, rolling down to <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal and cold-looking disc <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shining sea. Then the edges touched and <b>the</b> circular expanse <b>of</b> <b>water</b> took on suddenly a tint, sombre, like a frown; deep, like <b>the</b> brooding meditation <b>of</b> evil.|$|R
5|$|The red-legged running frog (Kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It {{can move}} fast {{by using a}} running gait {{in which the two}} hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion {{photography}} shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run across the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> for several metres (yards).|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the defence further, by 1881, mines were {{laid in the}} waters between the two forts and the eastern entrance of the harbour. The mines were tethered to the seabed but floated dangerously under the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> unseen to any enemy marine vessels. To enable safe passage of ships, a 'friendly safe channel' was created through the minefields. The work involved in the laying of minefields under the narrow channel (just 240 m apart) had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under the channels were constructed to link the two forts. There are, however, no archival records to prove that these tunnels were ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it forward into the water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E
50|$|The {{buttercup}} lucine is {{a filter}} feeder, drawing water into its mantle cavity {{through a long}} siphon that extends to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediment. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> passes over its gills where both oxygen and food particles are extracted and is expelled through another siphon. These molluscs are eaten by fish, crustaceans and birds.|$|R
5|$|A sign <b>of</b> global warming, <b>the</b> average <b>surface</b> {{temperature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at Scripps Pier in the California Current {{has increased}} by almost 3 degrees since 1950, according to scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> river <b>water</b> {{is lighter}} than <b>the</b> {{receiving}} <b>water,</b> as is typically {{the case when}} fresh river <b>water</b> flows into <b>the</b> sea, <b>the</b> river <b>water</b> will float along <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiving <b>water</b> as an overflow.|$|R
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just below the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1946, {{the ship}} was in very bad condition; on 21 December, she began to list severely. A salvage team could not be brought to Kwajalein in time, so the US Navy {{attempted}} to beach the ship to prevent her from sinking, but on 22 December, Prinz Eugen capsized and sank. Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when the ship rolled over. The ship's stern, including her propeller assemblies, remains visible above the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The US government denied salvage rights {{on the grounds that}} it did not want the irradiated steel entering the market. In August 1979, one of the ship's screw propellers was retrieved and placed in the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany. The ship's bell is currently held at the National Museum of the United States Navy, while the bell from Tegetthoff is held in Graz, Austria.|$|E

50|$|If <b>the</b> river <b>water</b> is denser than <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{receiving}} <b>water,</b> <b>the</b> river <b>water</b> will plunge {{below the}} surface at the plunge curve. <b>The</b> river <b>water</b> will then either form an underflow or an interflow within the lake.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a regular}} swallow dive, from {{a height of}} 75 feet is twice <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> Olympic diving, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was less than half as deep ! Also, <b>the</b> small <b>surface</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> tank hardly {{compared}} to any swimming pool.|$|R
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|Frank and {{the group}} reach the sub, and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge. Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack's bag. Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 {{as far away from}} the others as he could until it explodes. The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E
50|$|This type of burn bed {{is similar}} in {{construction}} to a typical <b>water</b> bed, except <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> covering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pool has {{a large amount of}} slack and extra folds <b>of</b> material around <b>the</b> perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool.|$|R
60|$|That {{night we}} abode in <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Rartoo, a hospitable old chief. It {{was right on}} <b>the</b> shore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake; and at supper we looked out through a {{rustling}} screen <b>of</b> foliage upon <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> starlit <b>water.</b>|$|R
50|$|Obstacles include {{ensuring}} that the bond is to the substrate rather than <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Another is {{that in order to}} cure, glues need to dry out. Most either do not cure underwater or set too quickly.|$|R
