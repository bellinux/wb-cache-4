40|$|There is a {{well-known}} intuition linking prospect theory with the disposition effect, the tendency of investors to sell assets that have risen in value rather than fallen. Recently, several authors have studied rigorous models {{in an attempt to}} formalize the intuition. However, some have found it difficult to predict a disposition effect while others produce a more extreme prediction where investors never voluntarily <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> We solve <b>a</b> model of asset liquidation where investors realize utility over gains and losses, and utility is concave over gains and convex over losses. Under the preferences of Tversky and Kahneman (Tversky, A., D. Kahneman. 1992. Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty. J. Risk Uncertainty 5 (4) 297 - 323) and lognormal asset prices, investors exhibit a disposition effect as gains are realized <b>at</b> <b>a</b> greater rate than losses.

50|$|In {{mainstream}} economics, economic surplus, {{also known}} as total welfare or Marshallian surplus (named after Alfred Marshall), refers to two related quantities.

40|$|While {{conventional}} wisdom is that dumping is <b>selling</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss,</b> {{this is not necessarily}} the case. Dumping is exporting a product at a lower price than that charged on the home market (the dumping margin (see Glossary)). As a result, a company may be making money on the export of a product, but if it is making a greater profit on its home market than it is making on a foreign market, it may be dumping. A company may engage in dumping as part of a deliberate strategy (for instance, it may be protected from competition on its home market and may use this advantage to push competitors out of other markets). Alternatively, price differences between domestic and imported products may be explained by different demand curves or other normal business behaviour. Either way, dumping can affect competition in markets that import these lower priced products, and has the potential to eliminate local competitors...|$|E
