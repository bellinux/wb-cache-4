5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was <b>successful,</b> <b>because</b> the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was a parallelogram arrangement, to provide stiffness without weight. This device {{was not entirely}} <b>successful,</b> possibly <b>because</b> of having so many rose-joint linkages.|$|R
5|$|DNK {{carried out}} tests {{with the system}} in 2010 for firefighters using {{self-contained}} breathing apparatus in structure fires, and found the system to be sufficient. Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year, and {{they found that the}} radio system was insufficient for their needs. Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> of the use of additional directional gateway/repeater-radio equipment. Because of this firefighters in Oslo continued to use the old ultra-high frequency radios during indoor fires. Both the Norwegian Police Security Service's bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal family have opted to not use the new radio system, citing poor coverage indoors and while lying on the ground, even in downtown Oslo. The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies, which is a drawback in case of major incidents. Also the joint rescue coordination centers, the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage. During the 2011 Norway attacks at Utøya, located in northern Buskerud, police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the brand and the entrenchment of the breast cancer movement has been uniquely <b>successful,</b> <b>because</b> no countermovement opposes the breast cancer movement or believes that breast cancer is desirable.|$|E

25|$|Rome would rely on {{brute force}} and sheer numbers when in doubt. The {{soldiers}} {{were trained to}} memorize every step in battle, so discipline and order could not break down into chaos. They were largely <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> of this.|$|E
25|$|In the post–war period, during Coco Chanel’s Swiss exile from France, Pierre Wertheimer {{returned}} to Paris, and regained formal administrative {{control of his}} family’s business holdings — including control of Parfums Chanel, the parfumerie established with his venture capital, and <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> of the Chanel name.|$|E
25|$|These moves proved <b>successful,</b> <b>because</b> after {{dropping}} {{the season opener}} to the Wizards, the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and the Phoenix Suns which was something that the Mavericks {{had been unable to}} do the last two seasons.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{most widely}} held {{today that the}} Wright Brothers {{were the first to}} make {{controlled}} sustained heavier-than-air flights. Brazil still officially regards Santos-Dumont as the first <b>successful</b> aviator <b>because</b> his craft did not use an external launch system.|$|R
50|$|Hughes {{purchased}} extensive properties on the River Murray, {{including one}} near Wellington where he ran sheep {{in conjunction with}} his brother Edmund Chauntrell Hughes, S.M., which was quite <b>successful,</b> largely <b>because</b> of careful breeding and the attention they paid to prevention of diseases.|$|R
50|$|Heiningen's {{market was}} quite <b>successful.</b> Probably <b>because</b> of this, under the {{administration}} of the Counts of Württemberg, a reconstruction and fortification of gothic Michael's Church began.

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{low-cost}} calculators was the Sinclair Cambridge, launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 ($), or £5 ($) less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of transcendental functions.|$|E
25|$|While {{waiting for}} the spring thaw, Sampo was camouflaged with tree {{branches}} to resemble a small island. This was not very <b>successful,</b> <b>because</b> during the last weeks of the Winter War the Soviet bombers made several attempts to destroy the ship. However, despite dropping at least 250 bombs on the grounded icebreaker the enemy pilots never scored a hit.|$|E
25|$|In Arizona, field {{observations}} {{indicated that a}} delay in planting until late October to November may help decrease BCTV incidence; however, changing the planting dates {{may not always be}} <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> the movements of beet leafhoppers are inconsistent and unpredictable. Many weeds are also host for the beet leafhoppers; therefore, proper weed control can help decrease the incidence of BCTV.|$|E
5000|$|According to film {{historian}} Randor Guy, {{the film}} was commercially <b>successful</b> mainly <b>because</b> of the music.

50|$|The Tokyo Friends Premium Box {{was also}} {{released}} which includes all 5 episodes, a bonus DVD, and 12 postcards. Although {{this is a}} very typical Tokyo-story and was never aired on TV, it was quite <b>successful</b> probably <b>because</b> it was Ai Otsuka's debut as an actress.|$|R
25|$|The market {{introduction}} of noninvasive blood glucose measurement by spectroscopic measurement methods, {{in the field}} of near-infrared (NIR), by extracorporal measuring devices, has not been <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> the devices measure tissue sugar in body tissues and not the blood sugar in blood fluid. To determine blood glucose, the measuring beam of infrared light, for example, has to penetrate the tissue for measurement of blood glucose.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the raids}} were <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> {{of the fast}} {{watercraft}} in the employ of the raiders. It {{was not until the}} commission of the vapor, fast steamships, in the mid-18th century that the Spanish navy successfully patrolled the archipelagic waters, and fared well against the wind-powered native seacraft of the pirates. Many pirate fleets were sunk at sea, or confined to their hiding places.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of LWFC, Common {{continued}} collaborating with the Soulquarians for his next album, Electric Circus. It featured the Soulquarians more prominently than Like Water for Chocolate, but {{was not nearly as}} <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> of its more eclectic vision, and relatively poor promotion from MCA Records. Electric Circus was considered a commercial disappointment, selling just over 200,000 copies, whereas its predecessor sold over twice as many.|$|E
50|$|The {{television}} {{version of}} Kitty Foyle {{did not go}} well with viewers. Some sources speculate {{that part of the}} reason why the show was not <b>successful</b> was <b>because</b> of the fact that the main character, Kitty Foyle, was not introduced until five weeks into the program.|$|R
5000|$|... "Boots on the Ground is <b>successful</b> {{precisely}} <b>because</b> it avoids polemic, {{on either}} side. It aims {{to show us}} the human cost of war, and it succeeds. Then it wisely lets us reflect on whether the cost is worth it, rather than telling us what to feel." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{family was}} part of a {{national}}-wide debate in the summer of 2015, about more Swedish national players coming from well-educated families in wealthier neighborhoods. Critics have stated that players like Augustinsson are <b>successful</b> today <b>because</b> of the amount of money the families invest in private training sessions.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the mass}} media {{generally}} declared the March <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> of its high turnout, organizers were not confident that it would create change. Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would need to call greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967–1968, he organized a Poor People's Campaign to occupy the National Mall with a shantytown.|$|E
25|$|For this transfer, the {{posterior}} {{part of the}} deltoid muscle is released from its origin and attached to the triceps muscle (usually {{by means of a}} tendon graft or a synthetic graft) leaving the rest of the deltoid muscle intact. This transfer is usually very <b>successful</b> <b>because</b> the line of pull of {{the posterior}} deltoid muscle is {{in the same direction as}} the triceps muscle. Also, there is hardly any loss of function.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{infectious}} disease {{has been the}} leading cause of death in the human population.
