5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large <b>shop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower to the side of the building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Telephone {{services}} reached Whitemore in 1918, initially {{with only}} three subscribers. Telephone switching was done at the post office. Whitemore {{was connected to the}} State's electricity system in 1929. The electricity was fed from the Hydro-Electric scheme and was connected to twelve buildings, in Whitemore and several nearby farms, by August of the same year. There may have been blacksmiths in Whitemore from the mid-19th century. A blacksmith established a <b>shop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main road in 1895 that was, by 1900, the only blacksmith in the area. Shaw Contracting's office is on the site of this former blacksmith's shop.|$|E

Homer and Bart start their magic show {{as a way to}} make money, but the act becomes a failure, and Homer leaves Bart to do the rest of the act on his own. Bart is left out on the street, and people begin giving him money so he can get home on public transportation.|$|E
