5|$|Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested {{that it is not}} <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone</b> and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.|$|E
5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E

50|$|The knot-work {{spans the}} length of the cross. Celtic knot-work is {{timeless}} and is generally considered the interconnectedness of, and eternal quality of, all life. The Celtic cross was a form which would normally be encountered <b>in</b> an outdoor <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> as <b>in</b> a traditional church burial yard in Ireland. Some of the textual and patina qualities in bronze were developed to evoke this feeling.|$|R
50|$|Parthian {{victories}} {{broke the}} tenuous link with Greeks {{in the west}} that had sustained the Hellenistic kingdom of Greco-Bactria. It is a misconception that Mithridates I actively promoted Hellenism in the areas he controlled and titled himself Philhellene ("friend of the Greeks") on his coins. This was a political motive to subdue any Greek or Seleucid hegemony and claim himself as a patron of the Persian Empire. In essence, Mithridates I upheld Persian culture above any foreign ones, <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone</b> an evolved era of Persian autonomy and civilization.|$|R

According to the Edicts of Ashoka, <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> some of them written in Greek, he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia {{and as far as the}} Mediterranean.

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, the NCAA had a tight grip on {{television}} contracts for Division I-A college football games. Compared {{to the current}} plethora of college football games on television, only two (on rare occasions, three) college football games were televised each week and the schedule of games was <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone</b> {{well in advance of}} the season opening. The NCAA reasoned that televised games cut into attendance, and more TV games would cost more money in lost gate receipts than could be gained with television contracts.|$|E

25|$|The {{organizational}} {{structure of the}} ICRC is not well understood by outsiders. This is partly because of organizational secrecy, {{but also because the}} structure itself is highly mutable and has been prone to change. The Assembly and Presidency are two long-standing institutions, but the Assembly Council and Directorate were created only {{in the latter part of}} the twentieth century. Decisions are often made in a collective way, so authority and power relationships are not <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone.</b> Today, the leading organs are the Directorate and the Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His stance is <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks {{to be full of}} anxiety as if he knows that he should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E
25|$|The {{form and}} ornametics of the {{contemporary}} garments preserved {{a part of the}} language of signs and symbols specific to the mythical thinking of those times. Thus, the first testimonies about Romanian traditional port are <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> on Tropaeum Traiani monument in Adamclisi and Trajan's Column in Rome. For example, women portraits carved on Trajan's Column after the Dacian wars provide information about their clothing. Dacian women wore shirts rippled at the neck related to the Romanian ie. Sleeves were either long and wide or short. The dress was long to the ground, over which sometimes was attached a wide draped mantle. In the feet they wore leather sandals in summer and fur sandals in winter.|$|E

However, the Waja lagged behind its main competitors and failed to gain the support of customers in the domestic market. The Waja also marked the downfall of the Proton marque, and inadvertently lead to the rise of Perodua, the second Malaysian vehicle manufacturer. In 2002, Proton introduced the Jumbuck, a ute based on the Proton Wira platform and thus far the only Proton model to enjoy significantly more popularity in its export markets (specifically Australia) than domestically. The Proton Gen-2 {{was launched in}} late 2004. It was the first Proton car equipped with the Malaysian-made Campro engine.|$|E
25|$|At {{least some}} of our {{behaviour}} must be influenced by our genes because behaviour depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions {{are a result of}} our genes code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work together. Like a computer, the hardware is <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> but the software can change how they work, just like our environment. Genes indirectly influence our behaviour as the nervous system and our brain is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or behaviour. The way our neurons connect is dependent on the environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{for each}} of the above {{definitions}} there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function {{in the context of a}} body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone</b> and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.|$|E

500|$|In 136 BC, Emperor Wu of Han {{named the}} Zhou yi [...] "the first among the classics", dubbing it the Classic of Changes or I Ching.

While the Zhou yi does not contain any cosmological analogies, the I Ching was read as {{a microcosm of the}} universe that offered complex, symbolic correspondences. The official edition of the text was literally <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> as one of the Xiping Stone Classics.
