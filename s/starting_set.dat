25|$|Although {{not every}} claw-free graph is perfect, claw-free graphs satisfy another property, related to perfection. A graph is called {{domination}} perfect {{if it has}} a minimum dominating set that is independent, and if the same property holds in all of its induced subgraphs. Claw-free graphs have this property. To see this, let D be a dominating set in a claw-free graph, and suppose that v and w are two adjacent vertices in D; then the set of vertices dominated by v but not by w must be a clique (else v would be the center of a claw). If every vertex in this clique is already dominated by at least one other member of D, then v can be removed producing a smaller independent dominating set, and otherwise v can be replaced by one of the undominated vertices in its clique producing a dominating set with fewer adjacencies. By repeating this replacement process one eventually reaches a dominating set no larger than D, so in particular when the <b>starting</b> <b>set</b> D is a minimum dominating set this process forms an equally small independent dominating set.|$|E

This notion of fixed set is analogous to the notion of a fixed point for a multivalued map and not for a classical single-valued map. We also introduce the new concept of the <b>start</b> <b>set</b> of a graph whose vertices are closed and bounded subsets of a metric space. Characterizations for such a graph to have a <b>start</b> <b>set</b> are given. Further, the notion of a self-path set valued map is defined and its relation with the <b>start</b> <b>set</b> is established. Finally, the existence of fixed sets is established in this context.|$|R

In this paper, we show how to optimize multiple queries on the same program (each with a different <b>starting</b> <b>set</b> of states) for better overall running time. After a preprocessing phase, we obtain an asymptotic improvement in answering dataflow queries. We use weighted pushdown systems as the abstract model of a program. Our techniques are interprocedural. They are general, yet provide an impressive speedup. We applied our algorithm to three very different applications, one based on finding affine relations using linear algebra, and others for model checking Boolean programs, and obtained 1. 5 -fold to 7 -fold speedups...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} about {{molecular}} simulation. However, the theoretical results apply for general overdamped Langevin dynamics simulations. Molecular simulation {{is often used}} for determining the stability of a complex (e. g., ligand-receptor). The stability can be measured by computing the expected holding time of the complex before its dissociation. This dissociation {{can be seen as}} an exit event from a certain part S of the conformational state space. Determining exit rates (i. e, for SDE-based simulations exiting from a given <b>starting</b> <b>set</b> S) for a stochastic process in which the exit event occurs very rarely is obviously hard to solve by straight forward simulation methods. Finding a low variance procedure for computing rare event statistics is still an open problem. Imagine now, e. g., a simulation of a diffusion process. As long as the time-dependent state trajectory is inside the <b>starting</b> <b>set</b> S, no information is gained about the rare event statistics. Only at that point of time, when the process leaves the <b>starting</b> <b>set,</b> a piece of information about the exit rate is collected. If S, however, is a fuzzy set given by a membership function, then there might be additional information of the kind "the process is about to leave the set". However, how to define an exit rate from a fuzzy set...|$|E
