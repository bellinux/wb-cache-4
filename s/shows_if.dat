5|$|The oldest known tetrapodomorph is Kenichthys from China, dated {{at around}} 395 million years old. Two of the {{earliest}} tetrapodomorphs, dating from 380 Ma, were Gogonasus and Panderichthys. They had choanae and used their fins to move through tidal channels and shallow waters choked with dead branches and rotting plants. Their fins {{could have been used}} to attach themselves to plants or similar while they were lying in ambush for prey. The universal tetrapod characteristics of front limbs that bend forward from the elbow and hind limbs that bend backward from the knee can plausibly be traced to early tetrapods living in shallow water. Pelvic bone fossils from Tiktaalik <b>shows,</b> <b>if</b> representative for early tetrapods in general, that hind appendages and pelvic-propelled locomotion originated in water before terrestrial adaptations.|$|E

25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final <b>shows</b> <b>if</b> the network objected to the content (i.e., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{braking force}} of {{standard}} upright bikes {{comes from the}} front wheel. As the analysis above <b>shows,</b> <b>if</b> the brakes themselves are strong enough, the rear wheel is easy to skid, while the front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip the rider and bike over the front wheel. This is called a stoppie if the rear wheel is lifted but the bike does not flip, or an endo (abbreviated form of end-over-end) if the bike flips. On long or low bikes, however, such as cruiser motorcycles and recumbent bicycles, the front tire will skid instead, possibly causing a loss of balance. [...] Assuming no loss of balance, {{it is possible to}} calculate optimum braking performance depending on the bike's geometry, the location of center of gravity of bike and rider, and the maximum coefficient of friction.|$|E

500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people... We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in <b>shows.</b> <b>If</b> you're asking how it makes us feel?

2500|$|Kacelnik et al. {{wanted to}} {{determine}} if this species does indeed optimize net energy gain per unit time as hypothesized. They designed an experiment in which the starlings were trained to collect mealworms from an artificial feeder at different distances from the nest. The researchers artificially generated a fixed curve of diminishing returns for the birds by dropping mealworms at successively longer and longer intervals. The birds continued to collect mealworms as they were presented, until they reached an [...] "optimal" [...] load and flew home. As Figure 5 <b>shows,</b> <b>if</b> the starlings were maximizing net energy gain per unit time, a short travel time would predict a small optimal load and a long travel time would predict a larger optimal load. In agreement with these predictions, Kacelnik found that the longer {{the distance between the}} nest and the artificial feeder, the larger the load size. In addition, the observed load sizes quantitatively corresponded very closely to the model's predictions. Other models based on different currencies, such as energy gained per energy spent (i.e. energy efficiency), failed to predict the observed load sizes as accurately. [...] Thus, Kacelnik concluded that starlings maximize net energy gain per unit time. This conclusion was not disproved in later experiments.|$|E
