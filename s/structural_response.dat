40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>{{response}}s</b> {{and response}} sensitivities {{are widely used}} in the finite element model updating, damage identification and optimization design. Calculation of the responses and response sensitivities of a large-scale structure consumes considerable computation storage and is usually time-consuming. This paper proposes an improved dynamic condensation approach to calculate the <b>structural</b> <b>responses</b> and response sensitivities. The condensed vibration equation is achieved by a simplified iterative scheme. By selecting the DOFs associated with the concerned element to be master DOFs, the response sensitivity is rapidly calculated from the derivatives of the master stiffness and mass matrices. Since the condensed vibration equation has a much smaller size than the original vibration equation, the proposed method is quite efficient in calculating the <b>structural</b> <b>responses</b> and response sensitivities. Finally, applications of the proposed method to an eight-storey frame and a cantilever plate demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in the calculation of <b>structural</b> <b>responses</b> and response sensitivities.

25|$|Unexpected lateral {{vibration}} (resonant <b>structural</b> <b>response)</b> {{caused the}} bridge to be closed on 12 June 2000 for modifications. Attempts were made {{to limit the number}} of people crossing the bridge. This led to long queues but was ineffective to dampen the vibrations. Closure of the bridge only two days after opening attracted public criticism of it as another high-profile British Millennium project that suffered an embarrassing setback, akin to how many saw the Millennium Dome. Vibration was attributed to an under-researched phenomenon whereby pedestrians crossing a bridge that has a lateral sway have an unconscious tendency to match their footsteps to the sway, exacerbating it. The tendency of a suspension bridge to sway when troops march over it in step was well known, which is why troops are required to break step when crossing such a bridge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{mathematical}} methods for prediction of uncertain <b>structural</b> <b>responses</b> {{with the aid}} of fuzzy time series are presented. Uncertain measurments of <b>structural</b> loads and <b>responses</b> respectively at equally spaced discrete time points are modeled as fuzzy variables. Hence uncertain measurments over time are considered as time series with fuzzy data. The fuzzy variables are processed on the basis of generally applicable numerical methods for descriptive analysis as well as for stochastic analysis. Algorithms of stochastic analysis are used to forecast fuzzy time series. At this the new fuzzy-ARMA-process is introduced. Forecasts of fuzzy time series provides informationen about future <b>structural</b> <b>responses.</b> The algorithm of analysis and forecast of fuzzy time series are presented in detail and demonstrated by way of numerical examples...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} {{provides no}} systematic, limited information procedure for handling non-invertibility, despite the well-known inference problem it causes {{as well as}} its presence in many types of dynamic systems. Non-invertibility means that structural shocks cannot be recovered from a history of observed variables. It arises from a form of delayed responses due to, among other things, time-to-plan, sticky information or news shocks. Structural VARs rule out non-invertibility by assumption. Inference about <b>structural</b> <b>responses</b> can, in turn, be incorrect. We develop a four-step procedure to partially, and sometimes fully, identify <b>structural</b> <b>responses</b> whether or not non-invertibility is present. Our method combines structural VAR restrictions, e. g. recursive identification, with ”agnostic ” identification, e. g. sign restrictions and bounds on forecast error contributions. In two model-generated examples, our procedure recovers the <b>structural</b> <b>responses</b> where <b>structural</b> VARs cannot. Also, we apply our procedure to real world data. We show that non-invertibility is unlikely in Fisher’s (2006) study of technology shocks in the U. S. J. E. L. Classification: E 3.
