2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Thayer Conference, school {{psychology}} was still a very young profession with only about 1,000 school psychology practitioners.

[...] School psychologists use this knowledge to assist <b>school</b> <b>personnel</b> in enriching the lives of all children. This knowledge is also used to help identify and work with children with exceptional needs. It was discussed that a school psychologist must be able to assess and develop plans for children considered to be at risk. [...] A school psychologist is also expected to better the lives of all children in the school; therefore, it was determined that school psychologists should be advisors in the planning and implementation of school curriculum.|$|E

Salk saw an opportunity to extend this project towards developing a vaccine against polio, and, together with the skilled research team he assembled, devoted himself to this work for the next seven years. The field trial set up to test the Salk vaccine was, according to O'Neill, [...] "the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 <b>school</b> <b>personnel,</b> and 220,000 volunteers." [...] Over 1,800,000 school children took part in the trial.

Around the world, an immediate rush to vaccinate began, with countries including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium planning to begin polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine.|$|E
