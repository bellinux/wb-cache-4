500|$|Griswold {{continued}} {{editing and}} contributing literary criticism for various publications, both full-time and freelance, including 22months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with The International Magazine. There, {{he worked with}} contributors including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt and John R. Thompson. In the November 10, 1855, issue of The Criterion, Griswold anonymously reviewed {{the first edition of}} Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, declaring: [...] "It is impossible to image how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth". Griswold charged that Whitman was guilty of [...] "the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license", a [...] "degrading, beastly sensuality." [...] Referring to Whitman's poetry, Griswold said he left [...] "this gathering of muck to the laws which... must have the power to suppress such gross obscenity." [...] Whitman later included Griswold's review in a new edition of Leaves of Grass. He ended his review with a phrase in Latin referring to [...] "that horrible sin, among Christians not to be named", the <b>stock</b> <b>phrase</b> long associated with Christian condemnations of sodomy. Griswold was the first person in the 19th century to publicly point to and stress the theme of erotic desire and acts between men in Whitman's poetry. More attention to that aspect of Whitman's poetry would only surface late in the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Kathryn Griffith, [...] "The {{importance}} of Learned Hand's philosophy in terms of practical application to the courts lies generally in {{his view of the}} pragmatic origin of all law, but most specifically in his unique interpretation of the Bill of Rights." [...] Hand proposed that the Bill of Rights was not law at all but a set of [...] "admonitory" [...] principles to ensure the fair exercise of constitutional powers. He therefore opposed the use of its [...] "due process of law" [...] clauses as a pretext for national intervention in state legislation. He even advocated the removal of those clauses from the Constitution. In Hand's analysis, [...] "due process" [...] {{is no more than a}} <b>stock</b> <b>phrase</b> to cover a long tradition of common law procedure. He contended that the term had inflated in scope beyond the meaning intended in the Bill of Rights. The result was the misuse of due process to invade rights that the Constitution was designed to protect. For Hand, a law passed by an elected body should be presumed to meet the test of due process. A court that decides otherwise and strikes down such a law is acting undemocratically. Hand maintained this stance even when the Supreme Court struck down anti-liberal laws that he detested. His reasoning has never been widely accepted. Critics of his position included his colleague on the Second Circuit, Jerome Frank, who wrote: [...] "t seems to me that here, most uncharacteristically, Judge Hand indulges in a judgement far too sweeping, one which rests on a too-sharp either-or, all or nothing, dichotomy. ...Obviously the courts cannot do the whole job. But just as obviously, they can sometimes help to arrest evil popular trends at their inception." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{the long}} winter and tedious wait, {{following}} upon {{the two previous}} long winters, were telling upon him. The superintendence {{of the men and}} the pursuit of the pay streak could not break the irk of the daily round, and the end of January found him making occasional trips to Dawson, where he could forget his identity for a space at the gambling tables.

6000|$|Bacon {{wrote down}} 'Good morrow' {{just because it}} WAS in common use. All the {{formulae}} were in common use; probably 'Golden sleepe' was a regular wish, like 'Good rest.' Bacon is making a list of commonplaces about beginning the day, about getting out of bed, about sleep. Some are in English, some in various other languages. He is not, as in Mrs. Pott's ingenious theory, making notes of novelties to be introduced through his plays. He is cataloguing the commonplace. It is Mrs. Pott's astonishing contention, as we have seen, that Bacon probably introduced the phrase 'Good morrow!' Mr. Bucke, following her in a magazine article, says: 'These forms of salutation were not in use in England before Bacon's time, {{and it was his}} entry of them in the [...] "Promus" [...] and use of them in the plays that makes them current coin day by day with us in the nineteenth century.' This is ignorant nonsense. 'Good morrow' and 'Good night' were as familiar before Bacon or Shakespeare wrote as 'Good morning' and 'Good night' are to-day. This we can demonstrate. The very first Elizabethan handbook of phrases which we consult shows that 'Good morrow' was the <b>stock</b> <b>phrase</b> in regular use in 1583. The book is 'The French Littelton, A most Easie, Perfect, and Absolute way to learne the Frenche Tongue. Set forth by Claudius Holyband. Imprinted at London by Thomas Vautrollier, dwelling in the blacke- Friers. 1583.' (There is an edition of 1566.) ...|$|E
