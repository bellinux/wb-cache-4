40|$|It is the individualistic {{approach}} which {{prevails in}} previous {{analysis of the}} problem of ethics in economy. The problem of the ethical attitude concerns individuals, business people, managers, politicians and economists. The publications about business ethics lack analysis of system circumstances in which individuals and companies act. If capitalism is just the power of capital owners over workers and if, according to Schumpeter, it is “the civilization of inequality and of the family fortune”, than it can be easily judged as a system of predominantly unethical tendencies. Nevertheless, it is worth raising questions about ethical character of various types of capitalism. Participation capitalism is one which ensures (nearly) full employment, a <b>social</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> for everyone and the real power of society including workers’ participation in decision processes. The structural conditions of such capitalism force and even encourage ethical behaviour. The capitalism of the protective state was founded by J. M. Keynes, W. Beveridge and Will Hutton with his stakeholder capitalism. Many European countries approach this standard of capitalism. Predacious capitalism (turbo-capitalism) is a maximum-profit-oriented capitalism with no regard to social costs. The nearest example is the post-Reagan American capitalism.

Progressives believe that a fair market should result in a normal distribution of wealth, but in most countries, the wealthy earn heavily disproportionate incomes. Hence, progressives advocate controlling the markets through public protections that they believe will favor upward mobility and diminish income inequality. Specific economic policies that are considered progressive include: progressive taxes and mandatory income redistribution aimed at reducing inequalities of wealth, a comprehensive package of public services, universal health care, public education, <b>social</b> security, <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> laws, anti-trust laws, legislation protecting workers' rights and the rights of trade unions, and a welfare state.|$|R

A number of conceptual and identification questions is here discussed. Various strategies on how to best measure the effect of a constant (national) <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> are summarized in a “menu” of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> variables. Also, an employment decomposition that separately estimates the hours worked and the number of jobs effects is used.

30|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the stronger spillover effects of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> increases on the wages of employees earning above the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> in Bulgaria may be that the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> system is linked to the practice of determining <b>minimum</b> <b>social</b> security thresholds by economic activity and occupation in that country. The stronger wage spillover effect may therefore indirectly lead to a stronger relevance of other adjustment channels in companies without employees on the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> in Bulgaria. It should also be remembered for Bulgaria that the question about adjustment to the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> rise was related to the strategies of companies {{over a longer period of}} time, 2010 – 2013, and not only to the most recent change as in other countries.

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{features}} worth noticing about <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> {{policies in}} China. First, the level of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is relatively low, about 32 % of the workers’ average wages, while the international ratio of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> to average wage is about 40 – 60 % (Han and Wei 2006). Second, {{the growth rate of}} <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is lower than that of average wage, with their relative ratio reduced from 0.44 in 1995 to 0.31 in 2011 (Du and Pan 2009). This statistical trend is shown in the list of provincial <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> standards in Appendix A 1. The effectiveness of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> policy might be limited if the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> standard are too low compared with the equilibrium market <b>wages.</b> Third, <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> standards are set by provincial governments. The minimum level, frequency, and timing of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> adjustments may vary between regions. Therefore, studying the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> effects at the country level is not likely to obtain reliable results.|$|R
30|$|We {{also need}} to collect {{accurate}} <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> data for each county. As discussed, provinces in China have considerable autonomy and flexibility in setting their <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> standards according to local economic conditions, which creates several levels of standards across counties within the same province. Moreover, the adjustment date of a county’s new <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> standard can also differ from its geographically contiguous neighbors within the same province, making the estimation of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> effects more challenging. To effectively address this issue, we collected our own <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> data from every local government website and carefully recorded the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> information for approximately 2, 000 counties every year from 1994 to 2012. As such, our data contain monthly <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> for full-time employees, hourly <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> for part-time employees, the effective dates of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> standards {{and the extent to}} which social security payments and/or housing provident funds were included as part of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> calculations to assure that they are on a comparable basis.|$|R

In this paper, we use cross-state differences in the impact of adjustments in federal <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> on effective <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> in each state- the maximum of federal and state minimum wages- to reassess this question and explain biases in past research. A rise in the federal <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> will have a larger impact on a state’s effective <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> in states in which federal <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> are binding. Using CPS data for 1977 - 2007, we find notable wage impacts and large corresponding disemployment effects, yet only when we utilize the differential influences of federal <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> to instrument for state wage floors.
