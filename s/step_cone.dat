The garden was not so much a garden as a sculpture to walk through, abstract earth shapes independent of place, with sharp arises foreign to the nature of their material.” Just a few years later a new radical form of art called Land Art or Earthworks came on the U.S. art scene, creating impressive, almost archaic geometrical earth sculptures, which are among the most important sources of inspiration for present-day landscape architects.|$|R
40|$|The {{harmonic}} {{balance method}} (HBM) was originally developed for finding periodic solutions of electronical and mechanical systems under a periodic force, but has later been adapted to self-sustained musical instruments. Unlike time-domain methods, this frequency-domain method does not capture transients {{and so is}} not adapted for sound synthesis. However, its independence of time makes it very useful for studying every periodic solution of the model, whether stable or unstable without care of initial conditions. A computer program for solving general problems involving nonlinearly coupled exciter and resonator, Harmbal, has been developed based on the HBM. The method as well as convergence improvements and continuations facilities are thorougly presented and discussed in the present paper.

However, they have not as yet been fully exploited in this field. This thesis investigates the possible microengineering applications of microstereolithography systems, specifically {{in the areas of}} active microfluidic devices and microneedles. The fields of micropumps and microvalves, stereolithography and microneedles are reviewed, and a variety of test builds were fabricated using the EnvisionTEC Perfactory Mini Multi-Lens stereolithography system in order to define its capabilities. A number of microneedle geometries were considered. This number was narrowed down using finite element modelling, before another simulation was used to optimise these structures. 9 × 9 arrays of 400 μm tall, 300 μm base diameter microneedles were subjected to mechanical testing. Per needle failure forces of 0. 263 and 0. 243 N were recorded for the selected geometries, <b>stepped</b> <b>cone</b> and inverted trumpet. The 90 μm needle tips were subjected to between 30 and 32 MPa of pressure at their failure point - more than 10 times the required pressure to puncture average human skin. A range of monolithic micropumps were produced with integrated 4 mm diameter single-layer 70 μm-thick membranes used as the basis for a reciprocating displacement operating principle. The membranes were tested using an oscillating pneumatic actuation, and were found reliable (> 1, 000, 000 cycles) up to 2. 0 PSIG. Pneumatic single-membrane nozzle/diffuser rectified devices produced flow rates of up to 1, 000 μl/min with backpressures of up to 375 Pa. Another device rectified using active membrane valves was found to self-prime, and produced backpressures of up to 4. 9 kPa.

40|$|ABSTRACT RATE-LIMITING <b>STEP</b> OF <b>CONE</b> PHOTOTRANSDUCTION RECOVERY AND OGUCHI DISEASE MECHANISMS By Frank Sungping Chen Advisor: Ching-Kang Jason Chen, Ph. D. Retinal photoreceptors {{provide the}} first gateway in which light {{information}} from the environment is transformed into neuronal signals. The cone and rod photoreceptors are responsible for day and night vision, respectively. Understanding rod and cone phototransduction {{is to figure out}} how these cells differ in their temporal and spatial sensitivities to allow perception of a broad dynamic range of stimuli. Phototransduction is mediated through a Gprotein signaling cascade. Light absorption by visual pigment triggers the isomerization of 11 - cis-retinal covalently attached to these pigments, which are heptahelical transmembrane Gprotein- coupled receptors. Isomerization of 11 -cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal activates the receptor, which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit of heterotrimeric Gprotein called transducin. Activated transducin relieves inhibitory constraint on cGMP-PDE, leading to rapid hydrolysis of cGMP, closure of cGMP gated cation channels, and membrane hyperpolarization. In order for photoreceptor to be responsive to light again, this robust phototransduction pathway must be deactivated in a timely fashion and this involves several reactions simultaneously. First, the activated opsin must be phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and capped by arrestin binding. Second, activated transducin must hydrolyze bound GTP through intrinsic GTPase activity, which is accelerated by a GTPase accelerating protein (GAP) complex comprised of RGS 9 - 1 /Gβ 5 -L/R 9 AP. Mutations in human genes involved in these reactions cause various visual defects. Cone, by and large, uses the same set of genes for pigment and transducin deactivations but it has lower sensitivity and faster kinetics than rod and is responsible for high visual acuity. During phototransduction recovery in which multiple reactions take place, the slowest reaction will determine the overall rate of recovery. In rod, this so-called, rate-limiting step has been determined to be transducin deactivation. It is unknown whether cone transducin deactivation also controls the timing of conerecovery, although we and others have shown that cone possesses a higher level of GAP concentration. In this thesis, the rate-limiting <b>step</b> in <b>cone</b> phototransduction recovery has been unequivocally determined by overexpressing RGS 9 - 1 by 2. 7 fold in mouse cones, which results in accelerated cone recovery. Complementarily, we find that ectopically expressing a human cone opsin kinase GRK 7 in mouse cones does not affect cone recovery. These results altogether demonstrate that the rate-limiting <b>step</b> of <b>cone</b> recovery is the GTP-hydrolysis of cone transducin, not the opsin phosphorylation by GRKs. By elucidating the rate-limiting step of photoreceptor recovery, we have revealed the importance of G-protein cycling in timing of both rod and cone photoreceptors. This may further be generalized to other physiological processes controlled by heterotrimeric G-proteins. The proper shutoff of phototransduction is essential for normal vision as recovery defects lead to visual impairment. Even though the reaction catalyzed by GRK 1 is not rate-limiting, mutations of this important gene render rhodopsin phosphorylation and deactivation the slowest step in rod recovery and create a pathological condition. GRK 1 mutations have been found in Oguchi disease patients, who suffer from congenital stationary night blindness. One of the mutations, V 380 D, is investigated in detail in this study. Transgenic expression of GRK 1 V 380 D mutant in rods reveals a kinase with reduced expression and catalytic activity. While V 380 D GRK 1 is found capable of inactivating rhodopsin, the reduction in kinase activity leads to a delayed dark adaptation, and is congruent with the night blindness phenotype observed in Oguchi disease patients. Finally, we have also investigated the role of post-translational isoprenylation on GRK 1 function. We found that isoprenylation is required for GRK 1 membrane association and outer segment targeting. Altogether our data add significantly to understanding the structure and function of GRK 1, {{which is one of the}} least understood molecules involved in vertebrate phototransduction...|$|R

These highly specialised neuronal cells convert energy from incident light into changes in cellular membrane potential. Action potentials are then relayed and processed within the inner retina and the cerebral cortex. Loss of function in the cone photoreceptors is the direct cause of visual loss for millions o f patients. Yet {{for many of the}} most common causes of blindness cone photoreceptor dysfunction occurs late on in the disease and is secondary to inherited and/or environmental influences that primarily affect other cell types. Cone photoreceptors are then secondarily affected and it is once their function is lost that the patient becomes visually disabled.

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of microtubules in growth cone turning, we observed fluorescently labeled microtubules in neurons as they encountered a substrate boundary. Neurons growing on a laminin-rich substrate avoided growing onto collagen type IV. Turning growth cones assumed heterogeneous morphologies and behaviors that depended primarily in their extent of adhesion to the substrate. We grouped these behaviors into three categories-sidestepping, motility, and growth-mediated reorientation. In sidestepping and motility-mediated reorientation, the growth cone {{and parts of the}} axon were not well attached to the substrate so the acquisition of an adherent lamella caused the entire growth cone {{to move away from the}} border and consequently reoriented the axon. In these cases, since the motility of the growth cone dominates its reorientation, the microtubules were passive, and reorientation occurred without significant axon growth. In growth-mediated reorientation, the growth cone and axon were attached to the substrate. In this case, microtubules reoriented within the growth cone to stabilize a lamella. Bundling of the reoriented microtubules was followed by growth cone collapse to form new axon, and further, polarized lamellipodial extension. These observations indicate that when the growth cone remains adherent to the substrate during turning, the reorientation and bundling of microtubules is an important, early <b>step</b> in growth <b>cone</b> turning...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of flow {{separation}} is very essential for proper understanding of both {{external and internal}} aerothermodynamics of bodies. Because of unique flow features such as thick boundary layers, merged shock layers, strong entropy layers, {{flow separation}} in the flow field of bodies at hypersonic speeds, is both complex as well as interesting. The problem of flow separation is further complicated at very high stagnation enthalpies because of the real gas effects. Notwithstanding the plethora of information available in open literature even for simple geometric configurations the experimentally determined locations of flow separation and re-attachment points do not match well with {{the results from the}} computational studies even at hypersonic laminar flow conditions. In this backdrop the main aim of the present study is to generate a reliable experimental database of classical separated flow features around generic configurations at hypersonic laminar flow conditions. In the present study, flow visualization using high speed camera, surface convective heat transfer rate measurements using platinum thin film sensors, and direct skin friction measurements using PZT crystals have been carried out for characterizing the separated flow field around backward facing <b>step,</b> double <b>cone</b> and double wedge models. The numerical simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations have also been carried out to complement the experimental studies. The generic models selected in the present study are simple configurations, where most of the classical hypersonic separated flow features of two-dimensional, axi-symmetric and three dimensional flow fields can be observed. All the experiments are carried out in IISc hypersonic shock tunnel (HST 2) at Mach 5. 75 and 7. 6. For present study, helium and air have been used as the driver and test gases respectively. The high speed schlieren flow visualization is carried out on backward facing step (2 and 3 mm <b>step</b> height), double <b>cone</b> (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350 and 250 / 680) and double wedge (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) models by using high speed camera (Phantom 7. 1). From the visualized shockwave structure in the flow field the flow reattachment point after separation has been clearly identified for backward facing <b>step,</b> double <b>cone</b> and double wedge models at hypersonic Mach numbers while the separation point could not be clearly identified because of the low free stream density in shock tunnels. However the flow visualization studies helped clearly identifying the region of flow separation on the model. Based on the results from the flow visualization studies both the physical location and distribution of platinum thin film gauges was finalized for the heat transfer rate measurements. Surface heat transfer rates along the length of two backward facing step (2 and 3 mm step height) models have been measured using platinum thin film gauges deposited on Macor substrate. The Eckert reference temperature method is used along the flat plate for predicting the heat flux distribution. Theoretical analysis of heat flux distribution down stream of the backward facing step model has been carried out using Gai’s dimensional analysis. The study reveals {{for the first time that}} at moderate stagnation enthalpy levels (~ 2 MJ/kg) the hypersonic separated flow around a backward facing step reattaches rather smoothly without any sudden spikes in the measured values of surface heat transfer rates. Based on the measured surface heating rates on the backward facing step, the reattachment distance was estimated to be approximately 10 and 8 step heights downstream of 2 and 3 mm step respectively at nominal Mach number of 7. 6. Convective surface heat transfer experiments have also been carried out on axi-symmetric double cone models (semi-apex angles of 15 / 35  and 25 / 68 ), which is analogous to the Edney’s shock interactions of Type VI and Type IV respectively. The flow is unsteady on the double cone model of 25 / 68  and measured heat flux is not constant. The heat transfer experiments were also carried out on the three-dimensional double wedge model (semi-apex angles of 15 / 35 ). The separation and reattachment points have been clearly identified from the experimental heat transfer measurements. It has been observed that the measured heat transfer rates on the double wedge model is less than the double cone model (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) for the identical experimental conditions at the same gauge locations. This difference could be due to the three-dimensional entropy relieving effects of double wedge model. PZT- 5 H piezoelectric based skin friction gauge is developed and used for direct skin friction measurements in hypersonic shock tunnel (HST 2). The bare piezoelectric PZT- 5 H elements (5 mm × 5 mm with thickness of 0. 75 mm) polarized in the shear mode have been used as a skin friction gauge by operating the sensor in the parallel shear mode direction. The natural frequency of the skin friction sensor is ~ 80 kHz, which is suitable for impulse facilities. The direct skin friction measurements are carried out on flat plate, backward facing step (2 mm step height) and double wedge models. The measured value of skin friction coefficient (integrated over an area of 25 sq. mm; sensor surface area) at a distance of 23 mm from the leading edge of the sharp leading edge backward facing step model is found to be ~ 0. 0043 while it decreases to ~ 0. 003 at a distance of 43 mm from the leading edge at a stagnation enthalpy of ~ 2 MJ/kg. The measured skin friction matches with the Eckert reference temperature within ± 10 %. The skin friction coefficient is also measured on the double wedge at a distance of 73 mm from the tip of the first wedge along the surface and is found to be 4. 56 × 10 - 3. Viscous flow numerical simulations are carried out on two-dimensional backward facing <b>step,</b> axi-symmetric double <b>cone</b> and three-dimensional double wedge models using ANSYS-CFX 5. 7 package. Navier-Stokes Simulations are carried out at Mach 5. 75 and 7. 6 using second order accurate (both in time and space) high resolution scheme. The flow is assumed to be laminar and steady throughout the model length except on the double cone (semi-apex angles of 250 / 680) model configuration, which represents the unsteady flow geometry. Analogous Edney Type VI and Type IV shock interactions are observed on double cone, double wedge (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) and double cone (semi-apex angles of 250 / 680) models respectively from the CFD results. Experimentally measured convective heat transfer rates on the above models are compared with the numerical simulation results. The numerical simulation results matches well with the experimental heat transfer data in the attached flow regions. Considerable differences are observed between the measured surface heat transfer rates and numerical simulations both in the separated flow region and on the second cone/wedge surfaces. The separation and reattachment points can be clearly identified from both experimental measurements and numerical simulations. The results from the numerical simulations are also compared with results from the high speed flow visualization experiments. The experimental database of surface convective heating rates, direct skin friction coefficient and shockwave structure in laminar hypersonic flow conditions will be very useful for validating CFD code...|$|R
40|$|Axons {{exhibit a}} rich variety of behaviors, such as elongation, turning, branching, and fasciculation, all {{in service of}} the complex goal of wiring up the brain. In order to {{quantify}} these behaviors, I have developed a system for in vitro imaging of axon growth cones with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Image tiles are automatically captured and assembled into a mosaic image of a square millimeter region. GFP-expressing mouse cortical neurons can be imaged once every few minutes for up to weeks if phototoxicity is minimized. Looking at the data, the trajectories of axon growth cones seem to alternate between long, straight segments and sudden turns. I first rigorously test {{the idea that the}} straight segments are generated from a biased random walk by analyzing the correlation between growth <b>cone</b> <b>steps</b> in the time and frequency domain. To formalize and test the intuition that sharp turns join straight segments, I fit a hidden Markov model to time series of growth cone velocity vectors. (cont.) The hidden state variable represents the bias direction of a biased random walk, and specifies the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution from which velocities are drawn. Rotational symmetry is used to constrain the transition probabilities of the hidden variable, as well as the Gaussian distributions for the hidden states. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters shows that the most probable behavior is to remain in the same hidden state. The second most probable behavior is to turn by about 40 degrees. Smaller angle turns are highly improbable, consistent with the idea that the axon makes sudden turns. When the same hidden Markov model was applied to artificially generated meandering trajectories, the transition probabilities were significant only for small angle turns. This novel application of stochastic models to growth cone trajectories provides a quantitative framework for testing interventions (eg. pharmacological, activity-related, etc.) that can impact axonal growth cone movement and turning. For example, manipulations that inhibit actin polymerization increase the frequency and angle of turns made by the growth cone. More generally, axon behaviors may be useful in deducing computational principles for wiring up circuits. by Neville Espi Sanjana. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} the study was the {{clinical}} implementation of a kV cone beam CT (CBCT) for setup correction in radiotherapy. Patients and methods For evaluation of the setup correction workflow, six tumor patients (lung cancer, sacral chordoma, head-and-neck and paraspinal tumor, and two prostate cancer patients) were selected. All patients were treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, five of them with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). For patient fixation, a scotch cast body frame or a vacuum pillow, each in combination with a scotch cast head mask, were used. The imaging equipment, consisting of an x-ray tube and a flat panel imager (FPI), was attached to a Siemens linear accelerator according to the in-line approach, i. e. with the imaging beam mounted opposite to the treatment beam sharing the same isocenter. For dose delivery, the treatment beam has to traverse the FPI which is mounted in the accessory tray below the multi-leaf collimator. For each patient, a predefined number of imaging projections over a range of at least 200 degrees were acquired. The fast reconstruction of the 3 D-CBCT dataset was done with an implementation of the Feldkamp-David-Kress (FDK) algorithm. For the registration of the treatment planning CT with the acquired CBCT, an automatic mutual information matcher and manual matching was used. Results and discussion Bony landmarks were easily detected and the table shifts for correction of setup deviations could be automatically calculated in all cases. The image quality was sufficient for a visual comparison of the desired target point with the isocenter visible on the CBCT. Soft tissue contrast was problematic for the prostate of an obese patient, but good in the lung tumor case. The detected maximum setup deviation was 3 mm for patients fixated with the body frame, and 6 mm for patients positioned in the vacuum pillow. Using an action level of 2 mm translational error, a target point correction was carried out in 4 cases. The additional workload of the described workflow compared to a normal treatment fraction led to an extra time of about 10 – 12 minutes, which can be further reduced by streamlining the different <b>steps.</b> Conclusion The <b>cone</b> beam CT attached to a LINAC allows the acquisition of a CT scan of the patient in treatment position directly before treatment. Its image quality is sufficient for determining target point correction vectors. With the presented workflow, a target point correction within a clinically reasonable time frame is possible. This increases the treatment precision, and potentially the complex patient fixation techniques will become dispensable. </p...|$|R
