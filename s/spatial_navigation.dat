25|$|Blocking {{plasticity}} in {{this region}} results in problems in goal-directed navigation and impairs the ability to remember precise locations. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus cannot learn or remember spatial layouts and patients having undergone hippocampal removal are severely impaired in <b>spatial</b> <b>navigation.</b> Monkeys with lesions to this area cannot learn object-place associations and rats also display spatial deficits by not reacting to spatial change. In addition, rats with hippocampal lesions were shown to have temporally ungraded (time-independent) retrograde amnesia that is resistant to recognition of a learned platform task only when the entire hippocampus is lesioned, but not when it is partially lesioned. Deficits in spatial memory are also found in spatial discrimination tasks.|$|E

40|$|How {{does the}} grid scale support {{accurate}} <b>spatial</b> memory and <b>navigation?</b> This critical {{piece of the}} puzzle is currently missing from experimental work on grid cells. Previous research has demonstrated that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is required for accurate <b>spatial</b> memory and <b>navigation.</b> But few studies have examined the importance of grid scale in these same processes. Here, we examine how the topographical organization of grid scale contributes to <b>spatial</b> memory and <b>navigation</b> by using behavioral pradigms combined with optogenetic manipulations. Multiple tasks were utilized; object exploration, the Barnes maze and a spatial delay non-match-to sample task in an 8 -arm radial maze. We hypothesize that optogenetic photoinhibition of the smallest grid scale will reduce spatial accuracy, resulting in mice showing impairments when asked to discriminate between spatial locations at a fine spatial resolution. The results indicate that the dorsalmost MEC is crucial for <b>spatial</b> memory and <b>navigation,</b> and might be especially impotant for recognizing and relating to a novel spatial change in the evironment. We also demonstrate behavioral experimental designs that may be used in further experimentation with optogenetics. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Patients with {{acquired}} chronic bilateral vestibular loss {{were recently}} {{found to have}} a significant impairment in <b>spatial</b> mem-ory and <b>navigation</b> when tested with a virtual Morris water task. These deficits were associated with selective and bilateral atrophy of the hippocampus, which suggests that <b>spatial</b> memory and <b>navigation</b> also rely on vestibular input. In the present study 16 patients with unilateral vestibular deafferentation due to acoustic neurinoma were examined 5 - to 13 -yrs post-surgery. Volumetry of the hippocampus was performed in patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls by manually tracing the structure and by an evaluator-independent voxel-based morphometry. <b>Spatial</b> memory and <b>navigation</b> were assessed with a virtual Morris water task. No significant deficits in <b>spatial</b> memory and <b>navigation</b> could be demonstrated in the patients with left vestibular failure, whereas patients with right vestibular loss showed a tendency to perform worse on the respective tests. Impairment was significant only for one computed measure (heading error). The subtle deficiencies with right vestibular loss are com-patible with the recently described dominance of the right labyrinth and the vestibular cortex in the right hemisphere. Volumetry did not reveal any atrophy of the hippocampus in either patient group...|$|R

Later versions would have 254 scintillators so a two-dimensional image could be produced on a color monitor. It allowed them to construct images reflecting brain activation from speaking, reading, visual or auditory perception and voluntary movement.

2500|$|Problems with {{spatial memory}} and {{navigation}} {{are thought to}} be one of the early indications of Alzheimer's Disease. Delpolyi and Rankin compared thirteen mild Alzheimer's patients and twenty-one mild-cognitive impairment patients, with twenty-four subjects with normal brain functioning through a series of spatially related tasks. The first task entailed route memory and the study found that the non-control group could not find their location on the map, or recall the order in which they had seen landmarks. The overall results showed that only 10% of the control group got lost on the route while 50% of the non-control group got lost. The demonstrated issues with <b>spatial</b> <b>navigation</b> among Alzheimer's and MCI patients indicates a malfunctioning with the firing of place cells and that abnormalities within the hippocampus may be an early indicatory of disease onset. [...] O'Keefe who originally found the existence of place cells said that, [...] "We suspect we'll begin to see signs of changes in the functions of cells before we see changes in behavioral tasks." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} REM sleep {{deprivation}} (RSD) on neurotrophic [...] factors, specifically nerve growth factor (NGF) and {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF), were assessed in 2000 by Sie et el. [...] Neurotrophins are proteins found {{in the brain and}} periphery that aid in the survival, functioning and generation of neurons; this is an important element in the synaptic plasticity process, the underlying neurochemical foundation in forming memories. Sei et al., inserted electrodes into the skulls of seven pairs of rats to measure Electroencephalogram (EEG), and inserted wire into the neck muscles of the rats to measure Electromyogram (EMG), a technique used to measure the amount of muscle activity. [...] Half the rats experienced a six-hour REM sleep deprivation period, while the other half experienced a six-hour sleep period, containing all sleep cycles. [...] Results showed that in the rats in the REM sleep deprivation group showed decreased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the cerebellum (coordination, motor learning) and brainstem (sensory and motor ascending pathway), conversely the hippocampus (long-term memory, <b>spatial</b> <b>navigation),</b> showed decreases in nerve growth factor levels. [...] BDNF protein {{has been shown to be}} necessary for procedural learning (form of non-declarative memory). [...] Since procedural learning has also exhibited consolidation and enhancement under REM sleep, it is proposed that the impairment of procedural learning tasks is due to the lack of BDNF proteins in the cerebellum and brainstem during RSD. [...] In regards to NGF, the basal forebrain (production and distribution of AcH in the brain), more specifically the medial septal area, sends cholinergic (excitatory in hippocampus) and GABAinergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters through fibres to the hippocampus target cells. [...] These target cells then secrete NGF which plays a key role in the physiological state of the hippocampus and its functions. [...] It has been noted that REM sleep increases the secretion of NGF, therefore it has been proposed that during RSD cholinergic activity decreases leading to a decrease in NGF and impairment in procedural learning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Spatial {{cognition}} researchers must, at present, choose be-tween {{the relevance}} of the real world and the precision of the lab. Here I introduce cognitive surveying as a framework of computational tech-niques to enable the automated and precise study of <b>spatial</b> knowledge and <b>navigation</b> practices in everyday environments. I draw on surveying engineering to develop the framework’s components: a hardware plat-form, data structures and algorithms for mobile data collection, and routines for data analysis and visualization. The cognitive surveying sys-tem tracks users with GPS, allows them to label meaningful points as landmarks, and asks them to point toward or estimate the distance to out-of-sight landmarks. The data from these and other questions is then used to produce specific analyses and comprehensive overviews of the user’s <b>spatial</b> knowledge and <b>navigation</b> practices, which will be of great interest to spatial cognition researchers, the developers of location-based services, urban designers, and city planners alike...|$|R
40|$|Hypermedia {{structured}} {{in terms of}} the higher-level intent of its author can be adapted to a wider variety of final presentations. Many multimedia systems encode such highlevel intent as constraints on either time, <b>spatial</b> layout or <b>navigation.</b> Once specified, these constraints are translated into specific presentations whose timelines, screen displays and navigational structure satisfy these constraints. This ensures that the desired <b>spatial,</b> temporal and <b>navigation</b> properties are maintained no matter how the presentation is adapted to varying circumstances. Rhetorical structure defines author intent at a still higher level. Authoring at this level requires that rhetorics can be translated to final presentations that properly reflect them. This paper explores how rhetorical structure can be translated into constraints, which are then translated into final presentations. This enables authoring in terms of rhetorics and provides the assurance that the rhetorics will remain properly conveyed in all presentation adaptation...|$|R
