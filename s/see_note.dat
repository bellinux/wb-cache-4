500|$|Oswald of Bernicia became king of Northumbria {{after his}} victory over Cadwallon at Heavenfield. [...] Penda's status and {{activities}} {{during the years of}} Oswald's reign are obscure, and various interpretations of Penda's position during this period have been suggested. It has been presumed that Penda acknowledged Oswald's authority in some sense after Heavenfield, although Penda was probably an obstacle to Northumbrian supremacy south of the Humber. Higham accepts that Penda acknowledged Oswald's supremacy, but points to what he calls [...] "the apparent failure of Bernician Christianity to penetrate the central Midlands" [...] as evidence against assuming a great deal of authority exercised by Oswald over the Mercians during this period. It has been suggested that Penda's strength during Oswald's reign could be exaggerated by the historical awareness of his later successes. Stancliffe also has a favourable impression of Brooks' interpretation of Penda's position at this time (pages 55–56); <b>see</b> <b>note</b> 29. Kirby says that, while Oswald was as powerful as Edwin had been, [...] "he faced a more entrenched challenge in midland and eastern England from Penda".|$|E
