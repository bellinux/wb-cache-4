It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humor to appeal to children. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's success prompted DreamWorks to create three sequels—Shrek 2 (2004), <b>Shrek</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010), two holiday specials—Shrek the Halls (2007) and Scared Shrekless (2010), and a spin-off film—Puss in Boots (2011).

5000|$|Kyle Smith of the New York Post {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "After <b>Shrek</b> <b>the</b> <b>Thirds</b> {{flatulence}} jokes, <b>the</b> return of that Seinfeldian wit brings animation up a level." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "It's on the easygoing level of Surf's Up, and a full tick up from, say, Over the Hedge or The Ant Bully. But given the Seinfeld pedigree it's something of a disappointment." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "At its relaxed best, when it's about, well, nothing, the slyly comic Bee Movie is truly beguiling." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post said, [...] "Bee Movie feels phoned in on every level. The images, usually computer animation's biggest draw, are disappointingly average. And as for the funny stuff, well, that's where you were supposed to come in." [...] A.O. Scott of the New York Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The most genuinely apian aspect of Bee Movie is that it spends a lot of its running time buzzing happily around, sniffing out fresh jokes wherever they may bloom." [...] Claudia Puig gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Bee Movie is certainly not low-budget, but it has all the staying power and creative value of a B-movie. The secret life of bees, as told by Seinfeld, is a bore with a capital B." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four, saying [...] "Bee Movie is not Shrek, and it is not Ratatouille either (by far the standout computer-animated feature of the year). But it has enough buzzing wit and eye-popping animation to win over the kids—and probably more than a few parents, too." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "This is a beautifully animated, cleverly executed, warm and funny adventure." ...|$|R

25|$|Studio alliances shifted over time. Before October 2005 and {{the release}} of either format, each had the {{exclusive}} support of three of the Big Six. HD DVD had Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Bros Pictures, while Blu-ray Disc started out with Columbia Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, and 20th Century Fox.

Then HD DVD supporters Warner Bros. and Paramount added support for Blu-ray. But in August 2007, after supporting Blu-ray for over a year, Paramount announced it would release all high-definition content (except titles directed by Steven Spielberg) exclusively on HD DVD.
