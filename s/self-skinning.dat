50|$|In 1954, Harper was {{introduced}} to a salesman from a Long Island plastics company. The salesman offered a product that created 12 inch diameter <b>self-skinning</b> discs. George Nelson embraced the idea {{as a way to}} manufacture low-cost furniture. Over a weekend Harper designed a sofa incorporating 18 of the discs in a whimsical pattern. The salesman's product didn't live up to expectations, but Harper's design was put into production by Herman Miller as the Marshmallow sofa.|$|E

Fifteen car assembly workers became sensitized to <b>self-skinning</b> neoprene foam weather strips by contact with the bare forearms for the greater part of the working day. A series of patch tests showed 11 out of 11 tested to be sensitive to diethyl thiourea present in the neoprene as an accelerator. The condition cleared on modification of the assembly process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Current {{prosthetic}} hands, although functional, {{have the}} potential of being improved significantly. We report here the design and development of a novel prosthetic hand that is lighter in weight, less expensive, and more functional than current hands. The new prosthesis features an endoskeleton embedded in <b>self-skinning</b> foam that provides a realistic look and feel and obviates {{the need for a}} separate cosmetic glove. The voluntary-closing mechanism offers variable grip strength. Placement of joints at three locations (metacarpophalangeal and proximal and distal interphalangeal) within each of four fingers affords realistic finger movement. High-strength synthetic cable attached to the distal phalanx of each finger is used to effect flexion. A multiposition passive thumb provides both precision and power grips. The new prosthesis can securely grasp objects with various shapes and sizes. Compared to current hands, weight has been reduced by approximately 50 %, and cable excursion required for full finger flexion by more than 50 %. The new endoskeletal prosthesis requires approximately 12 - 24 % less force input to grasp a variety of everyday objects, largely due to its adaptive grip. Production cost estimates reveal th...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Mortalities due to {{skin cancer}} are escalating, but early {{detection}} via skin examinations can be beneficial. To date, dermatologists {{have not been}} isolated as a high-risk population for developing skin cancer, although some evidence suggests {{that they are a}} high-risk group. Therefore, the specific aims of this study were to measure the frequency at which dermatologists perform <b>self-skin</b> examination and receive full-body skin examination. Patients and methods: A sample of 476 respondents provided data for this cross-sectional, nine-item survey, which was e-mailed to all registered members in the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. The initial invitation was sent in the summer of 2007, with reminders sent at four and eight weeks. E-mails contained a unique identifier, and each member could only respond once to the survey sent to that particular e-mail address. Results: 71. 7 percent of the respondents reported that they routinely gave themselves a <b>self-skin</b> examination, 25. 4 percent reported a monthly exam, 24. 5 percent every six months, 17. 2 percent once per year, and 4. 6 percent every five years. Performing a <b>self-skin</b> examination was not related to age, gender, or history of skin malignancy. Seventy-six percent of all respondents never had a full-body skin examination conducted by another dermatologist, which persisted when analyzed by age (p = 0. 0490) and gender (p = 0. 0184). Conclusion: Dermatologists are more likely to perform <b>self-skin</b> examination rather than visit another dermatologist for a full-body skin examination...|$|R
50|$|Integral skin foam, {{also known}} as <b>self-skin</b> foam, {{is a type of}} foam with a {{high-density}} skin and a low-density core. It can be formed in an open-mold process or a closed-mold process. In the open-mold process, two reactive components are mixed and poured into an open mold. The mold is then closed and the mixture is allowed to expand and cure. Examples of items produced using this process include arm rests, baby seats, shoe soles, and mattresses. The closed-mold process, more commonly known as reaction injection molding (RIM), injects the mixed components into a closed mold under high pressures.|$|R
40|$|Objective - To {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of an educational}} intervention encouraging <b>self-skin</b> examinations for early detection of skin cancers among men aged over 50 years. Methods - A lifetime Markov model was constructed to combine data from the Skin Awareness Trial and other published sources. The model incorporated a health system perspective and the cost and health outcomes for melanoma, squamous and basal cell carcinomas and benign skin lesions. Key model outcomes included Australian costs (2015), quality-adjusted life years (QALYS), life years and counts of skin cancers. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address parameter uncertainty. Results - The mean cost of the intervention was AU 5, 298 compared with AU 4, 684 for usual care while mean QALYs were 7. 58 for the intervention group and 7. 77 for the usual care group. The intervention was thus inferior to usual care. When only survival gain is considered, the model predicted the intervention would cost 1, 059 per life year saved. The likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective up to AU 50, 000 per QALY gained was 43. 9...|$|R
40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} {{represents the}} most dangerous type of skin cancer. In this study we present an ensemble classification scheme, employing the mutual information, the cross-correlation and the clustering based on proximity of image features methods, for early stage assessment of melanomas on plain photography images. The proposed scheme performs two main operations. First, it retrieves the most similar, to the unknown case, image samples from an available image database with verified benign moles and malignant melanoma cases. Second, it provides an automated estimation regarding {{the nature of the}} unknown image sample based on the majority of the most similar images retrieved from the available database. Clinical material comprised 75 melanoma and 75 benign plain photography images collected from publicly available dermatological atlases. Results showed that the ensemble scheme outperformed all other methods tested in terms of accuracy with 94. 9 ± 1. 5 %, following an external cross-validation evaluation methodology. The proposed scheme may benefit patients by providing a second opinion consultation during the <b>self-skin</b> examination process and the physician by providing a second opinion estimation regarding the nature of suspicious moles that may assist towards decision making especially for ambiguous cases, safeguarding, in this way from potential diagnostic misinterpretations...|$|R
40|$|Patients who {{are already}} {{diagnosed}} with cutaneous melanoma {{are at increased risk}} of developing another primary melanoma. The occurrence of multiple primary melanoma is a rare phenomenon, varying in frequency, with an estimated incidence ranging from 0. 2 % to 8. 6 %. The authors are presenting data on the patients with multiple primary melanoma from the Croatian Referral Melanoma Centre. The clinical, histological and epidemiological characteristics of 36 (3. 6 %) patients, identified from 991 patients with histologically confirmed melanoma, are analyzed in this study. Twenty-eight of the patients (78 %) had two primary melanomas, six had three melanomas (16, 7 %) and two (5, 6 %) had four melanomas. Diagnosis was established synchronously in 11 patients (30 %) and, {{in the rest of the}} patients, time interval between the diagnosis of the first and second melanoma varied from 1 month to the longest interval of 16 years. However, the majority of subsequent melanomas were removed within 2 years of the initial operation. The mean Breslow’s thickness of the first melanoma was significantly higher than the mean Breslow’s thickness of the second primary melanoma. The proportion of in situ to invasive melanomas was greater for the second melanomas compared with the first melanomas. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of regular follow-up as well as the education in regular <b>self-skin</b> examinations in melanoma patients in order to detect subsequent primary melanomas in the early phase...|$|R

Risk factors for melanoma include ultraviolet exposure, genetic predisposition, and phenotypic characteristics (eg, fair skin and blond hair). Whites have a 27 -fold higher incidence of melanoma than African-Americans (AA), but the 5 -year survival is 17. 8 % lower for AA than Whites. It is reported continuously that AA have more advanced melanomas at diagnosis, and overall lower survival rates. This minority melanoma paradox is not well understood or studied. Objective: To explore further, the possible explanations for the difference in melanoma severity and survival in AA within the US. Methods: Qualitative review of the literature. Results: Lack of minority-targeted public education campaigns, low self-risk perception, low <b>self-skin</b> examinations, intrinsic virulence, vitamin D differences, and physician mistrust {{may play a role}} in the melanoma survival disparity among AA. Conclusion: Increases in public awareness of melanoma risk among AA through physician and media-guided education, higher index of suspicion among individuals and physicians, and policy changes can help to improve early detection and close the melanoma disparity gap in the future.

40|$|Ao nascer nos encontramos em uma solidão {{primordial}} que é aliviada com o encontro do corpo materno. Ao mesmo tempo precisamos também de alguém que assegure o bem-estar e a sobrevivência do nosso próprio corpo, enquanto dispomos de tempo para crescer e amadurecer. A primeira forma de comunicação que permite esse encontro tão fundamental para a dupla mãe-bebê ocorre de modo visceral através das experiências corpo a corpo. Desse modo, o corpo constitui não só nossa primeira forma de expressão, como também o meio através do qual entramos em contato com o mundo externo e com o nosso próprio mundo interno, repleto de necessidades e desejos. A mãe, inicialmente, tem a função de tornar as estimulações corporais toleráveis, para que o bebê possa ter um desenvolvimento saudável, sem nenhuma interrupção prejudicial à sua continuidade de existência. Portanto, este trabalho visa demonstrar o papel preponderante do corpo na constituição daquilo que nos tornamos, na medida em que a quantidade e a qualidade das trocas e experiências sensoriais deixam marcas significativas que serão levadas ao longo da vida. São enfatizadas principalmente as experiências que ocorrem entre o corpo da mãe e o corpo do bebê, já que, no início, não existe separação entre o eu e o não-eu, e a trajetória para se conquistar a percepção dessa distinção é imprescindível para nos tornarmos sujeitos. As referências básicas que dão consistência ao eixo teórico deste trabalho são o conceito do eu corporal de Freud; a importância dada por Winnicott ao vínculo mãe-bebê, como assegurador da saúde mental; o conceito do eu-pele desenvolvido por Anzieu; a importância da tomada de consciência gradativa da separação física da mãe e os efeitos apontados por Tustin quando esta separação ocorre de forma traumática. As we {{are born}} {{we find ourselves}} in primordial loneliness which it is relieved with the meeting of the mother´s body. At the same time we also need someone to ensure the well-being and the survival of our own body, while there is time for us to grow and to mature. The first kind of communication that allows this meeting so fundamental for the couple mother-baby occurs in a visceral way through the experience body to body. This way, the body is not only our first form of expression, but also the way by which we {{get in touch with the}} outside world and our own inner world, full of needs and desires. The mother initially, has the duty of making the body stimulation tolerable for the baby to have a healthy development, without any interruption detrimental to their continued existence. Therefore, this study demonstrates the role of the body in the constitution of what we become, as far as the quantity and quality of exchanges and sensory experiences leave significant marks that will be taken lifelong. Experiences that occur between the mother´s body and the baby s body are mainly emphasized, since in the beginning, there is no separation between self and non-self, and the path to achieve the perception of this distinction is essential for us to become a person. The basic references that makes the theoretical basis of this study consistent are the Freud´s concept of body-ego; the importance Winnicott gives to the link mother-baby, as a granter of the mental health; the concept of <b>self-skin</b> developed by Anzieu; the importance of the gradual awareness of the physical separation from the mother and the effects mentioned by Tustin when this separation occurs in a traumatic way...|$|R
