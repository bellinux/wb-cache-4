60|$|WISE. In {{our town}} {{there was one}} W. S., a man of a very wicked life; and he, when {{there seemed to be}} countenance given to it, would needs turn informer. Well, so he did, and was as diligent in his {{business}} as most of them could be; he would watch of nights, climb trees, and range the woods of days, if possible, to find out the meeters, for then they were forced to meet in the fields; yea, he would curse them bitterly, and swear most fearfully what he would do to them when he found them. Well, after he had gone on like a bedlam in his course awhile, and had done some mischiefs to the people, he was stricken by the hand of God, and that in this manner: 1. Although he had his tongue naturally at will, now he was taken with a flattering in his speech, and could not for weeks together speak otherwise than just like a man that was drunk. 2. Then he was taken with a drauling, or slabbering at his mouth, which <b>slabber</b> sometimes would hang at his mouth well nigh half-way down to the ground. 3. Then he had such a weakness in the back sinews of his neck, that ofttimes he could not look up before him, unless he clapped his hand hard upon his forehead, and held up his head that way, by strength of hand. 4. After this his speech went quite away, and he could speak no more than a swine or a bear. Therefore, like one of them, he would gruntle and make an ugly noise, according as he was offended, or pleased, or would have anything done, &c.|$|E

50|$|He was {{a generous}} patron of men of letters. When Dryden was {{dismissed}} from the laureateship, he {{made him an}} equivalent pension from his own purse. Matthew Prior, in dedicating his Poems on Several Occasions (1709) to Dorset's son, affirms that his opinion was consulted by Edmund Waller; that the Duke of Buckingham deferred {{the publication of his}} Rehearsal until he was assured that Dorset would not rehearse upon him again; and that Samuel Butler and Wycherley both owed their first recognition to him. Prior's praise of Dorset is no doubt extravagant, but when his youthful follies were over he appears to have developed sterling qualities, and although the poems he has left are very few, none of them are devoid of merit. Dryden's Essay on Satire and the dedication of the Essay of Dramatick Poesie are addressed to him. Walpole (Catalogue of Noble Authors, iv.) says that he had as much wit as his first master, or his contemporaries Buckingham and Rochester, without the royal want of feeling, the duke's want of principles or the earl's want of thought; and Congreve reported of him when he was dying that he <b>slabbered</b> more wit than other people had in their best health.|$|R

40|$|Title: Slab City Stories Author: Jessica Lum   "Slab City Stories" is a {{multimedia}} visual journalism project documenting {{the people and}} residents of Slab City, a squatter community in southern California.   The project can be viewed online at [URL]   Slab City, located about two miles east of Niland, California, {{is home to a}} few dozen during blistering summers, but draws thousands during the temperate winter season. These migrating snowbirds seek the sun and warmth of the California desert, as well as the alternative lifestyle that flourishes here. Slab City is named for the remains of concrete foundations that dot the area, once part of the military naval reservation, Camp Dunlap. The site was decommissioned in 1956 and deeded to the state of California in 1961.   Residents of “The Slabs,” as it is called, are squatters living in trailers and recreational vehicles in various stages of upkeep: broken-down or brand new "land yachts" worth several hundred thousands. Many people also build their own structures, tents and shacks.   Most subsist off of food stamps or social security benefits: usually for retirement or disability. Some support themselves through barter, trade and odd jobs from other <b>Slabbers,</b> or Slab City residents.   Slab City is a vibrant community, home to artists and musicians who create and display their work in places like East Jesus' art garden or Builder Bill's stage, The Range, which hosts a weekly open mic show every Saturday night. Residents join social clubs like the Oasis Club or Loners on Wheels where they meet for morning coffee, meals and happy hours. Others prefer to live on the edge of it all, because even in the desert, quiet can be hard to find...|$|R
6000|$|This day, dear Bec, is thy nativity; Had Fate a luckier one, she'd give it ye. She chose {{a thread}} of {{greatest}} length, And doubly twisted it for strength: Nor will be able with her shears To cut it off these forty years. Then who says care will kill a cat? Rebecca shows they're out in that. For she, though overrun with care, Continues healthy, fat, and fair. [...] As, if the gout should seize the head, Doctors pronounce the patient dead; But, if they can, by all their arts, Eject it to the extremest parts, They give the sick man joy, and praise The gout that will prolong his days. Rebecca thus I gladly greet, Who drives her cares to hands and feet: For, though philosophers maintain The limbs are guided by the brain, Quite contrary Rebecca's led; Her hands and feet conduct her head; By arbitrary power convey her, She ne'er considers why or where: Her hands may meddle, feet may wander, Her head is but a mere by-stander: And all her bustling but supplies The part of wholesome exercise. Thus nature has resolved to pay her The cat's nine lives, and eke the care. [...] Long may she live, and help her friends Whene'er it suits her private ends; Domestic business never mind Till coffee has her stomach lined; But, when her breakfast gives her courage, Then think on Stella's chicken porridge: I mean when Tiger[2]has been served, Or else poor Stella may be starved. [...] May Bec have many an evening nap, With Tiger <b>slabbering</b> in her lap; But always take a special care She does not overset the chair; Still be she curious, never hearken To any speech but Tiger's barking! [...] And when she's in another scene, Stella long dead, but first the Dean, May fortune and her coffee get her Companions that will please her better! Whole afternoons will sit beside her, Nor for neglects or blunders chide her. A goodly set as can be found Of hearty gossips prating round; Fresh from a wedding or a christening, To teach her ears the art of listening, And please her more to hear them tattle, Than the Dean storm, or Stella rattle. [...] Late be her death, one gentle nod, When Hermes,[3] waiting with his rod, Shall to Elysian fields invite her, Where {{there will be no}} cares to fright her! ...|$|R

Moreover, Slabber’s description contains details not consistent with ctenophore morphol-ogy. Most probably, <b>Slabber</b> described a juvenile specimen of Pleurobrachia pileus (O. F.

Combined with the fact that this genus was based on a poorly described specimen, this throws doubts on the validity of the genus Callianira...|$|E
