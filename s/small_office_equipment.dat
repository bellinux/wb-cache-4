5000|$|Mr. Steinberg {{was born}} August 1939 in Brooklyn, NY, and {{received}} a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania in 1959. In 1961, at the age 22, he founded Leasco Data Processing <b>Equipment</b> Corporation, a <b>small</b> <b>office</b> data-processing <b>equipment</b> firm that leased IBM computers. The company grew rapidly, expanded its capabilities, and in 1965 went public. As Leasco grew, Steinberg sought to diversify the company. In 1968 Leasco bought 91% of Reliance Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (Steinberg bought {{the balance of the}} company in the winter of 1981). A year later in 1969 Steinberg attempted to take over the $9 billion Chemical Bank, then one of the nation's largest financial institutions. [...] The attempt failed and earned Steinberg the enmity of the New York financial community and a reputation for brashness. Mr. Steinberg remarked at the time, [...] "I always knew there was an establishment; I just thought I was part of it." [...] Fifteen years later Steinberg would make another legendary run at another fabled American institution, The Walt Disney Co. He failed in this bid too, but forced Disney to pay him $60 million in [...] "greenmail" [...] for his shares.|$|R
40|$|<b>Office</b> <b>equipment</b> is {{expected}} to be the fastest-growing segment of commercial energy use over the next 20 years, yet many aspects of <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> energy use are poorly understood. User behavior, such as turning off devices at night or enabling power management, influences energy use to a great extent. The computing environment also plays a role both in influencing user behavior and in the success of power management. Information about turn-off rates and power management rates for <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> was collected through a series of after-hours audits in commercial buildings. Sixteen businesses were recruited, including <b>offices</b> (<b>small,</b> medium and large offices in a variety of industries), schools, and medical buildings in California, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. The types and power states of <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> found in these buildings were recorded and analyzed. This article presents these data for computers, monitors, printers, copiers, fax machines, scanners and multi-function devices. These data can be used to improve estimates of both energy consumption for these devices and savings from energy conservation efforts...|$|R

40|$|There {{is concern}} that {{potentially}} harmful pollutants may be emitted from <b>office</b> <b>equipment.</b> Although <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> {{has been a}} focal point for governmental efforts to promote energy efficiency through programs such as the US EPA's Energy Star, {{little is known about the}} relationship between <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> use and indoor air quality, and information on pollutant emissions is sparse. In this review, we summarize available information on emission rates and/or ambient concentrations of various pollutants that are related to <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> use. Experimental methods used in the characterization of emissions are briefly described. The <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> evaluated in this review includes computers (desktops and notebooks), printers (laser, ink-jet and all-in-one machines) and photocopy machines. Reported emission rates of the following pollutant groups are summarized: volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), ozone, particulate matter and several semivolatile organic chemicals (SVOCs). The latter include phthalate esters, brominated flame retardants, organophosphate flame retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We also review studies reporting airborne concentrations in indoor environments where <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> was present and thought to be a significant contributor to the total pollutant burden (offices, residences, schools, electronics recycling plants). For certain pollutants, such as organophosphate flame retardants, the link between emission by <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and indoor air concentrations is relatively well established. However, indoor VOCs, ozone, PAHs and phthalate esters can originate from a variety of sources, and their source apportionment is less straightforward. This literature review identifies substances of toxicological significance, with the purpose of serving as a guide to evaluate their potential importance with respect to human exposures...|$|R

40|$|Electronic <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> has proliferated rapidly {{over the}} last twenty years and is {{projected}} to continue growing in the future. Efforts to reduce the growth in <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> energy use have focused on power management to reduce power consumption of electronic devices when not being used for their primary purpose. The EPA ENERGY STAR[registered trademark] program has been instrumental in gaining widespread support for power management in <b>office</b> <b>equipment,</b> and accurate information about the energy used by <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> in all power levels is important to improving program design and evaluation. This paper presents the results of a field study conducted during 2001 to measure the power levels of new monitors and personal computers. We measured off, on, and low-power levels in about 60 units manufactured since July 2000. The paper summarizes power data collected, explores differences within the sample (e. g., between CRT and LCD monitors), and discusses some issues that arise in m etering <b>office</b> <b>equipment.</b> We also present conclusions to help improve the success of future power management programs. Our findings include a trend among monitor manufacturers to provide a single very low low-power level, and the need to standardize methods for measuring monitor on power, to more accurately estimate the annual energy consumption of <b>office</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as actual and potential energy savings from power management...|$|R

30|$|The {{improvement}} in <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and lighting {{has a large}} impact on electricity, heating energy and cooling energy, as was shown in Figure 6. When using more efficient <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and lighting, with reduced installed powers (EPD 55 [*]W/room, LPD 8 and 4 [*]W/m 2) and improved control (no standby losses at night and lighting with daylight dimming control). Compared to the base case, approximately 10 kWh/m 2 /year of electric energy is saved when improving the <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and another 10 kWh/m 2 /year is saved when improving the lighting system. Meanwhile, the cooling energy decreases and the heating energy increases due to reduced internal heat gains. The total energy saving potential, compared to the base case, is 12 kWh/m 2 /year when both <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and lighting are improved. This result shows that it is desirable to reduce the internal gains even though the heating load increases. Furthermore, {{the results show that}} the available amount of daylight in Sweden is sufficient to reduce the electricity use for lighting to the same level as in Germany [7].|$|R
