For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers.

40|$|Abstract This work aims at proposing an {{innovative}} {{way to approach}} music education, focusing performance games and advanced natural interfaces. The key idea is coupling the power of IEEE 1599, an XML-based international <b>standard</b> <b>for</b> <b>music</b> description, {{with the concept of}} music meta-instrument. Meta-instruments are ad hoc interfaces which allow a simplified interaction among the student and music contents. The proposed framework will provide a tool <b>for</b> <b>music</b> practice, powered by the typical features of an IEEE 1599 document. Both a brief overview of the standard and a meta-instrument case study will be presented...|$|R

5000|$|By {{mid to late}} 1930s, North Texas {{had already}} {{acquired}} sizable music collections that included orchestral scores, sheet music, phonograph recordings, and a Carnegie funded reproducing unit. [...] But concerted growth of music collections at North Texas {{was the culmination of}} (i) several national initiatives (late 1930s) and (ii) the 1938 appointment of Wilfred Bain to head its College of Music, which at that time had been a deanless School of Music. On the national level in the late 1930s, the newly formed National Association of Schools of Music, the newly formed Music Library Association, and music educators in higher education were collaborating to develop national curricular <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>music</b> schools. Wilfred Bain, through his involvement with the NASM was part of that movement.|$|E
5000|$|Finding {{the band}} {{exploring}} further territory, Take It from the Man! was another change of style for the band, taking a large influence from 1960s British garage rock, particularly the early work of The Rolling Stones. The Phoenix New Times characterized the album as [...] "psychedelic garage rock". Under the Radar said {{the album was}} [...] "Rolling Stones-referencing," [...] whilst Consequence of Sound said the record carried a [...] "mid '60s era Stones rock & roll feel." [...] Laut more broadly said the album [...] "deals with British music from the 60s," [...] noting [...] "(David Bowie I Love You) Since I Was Six" [...] as an example. Angel Fire said the album was [...] "inspired by the gritty R&B of Aftermath or 12x5. The feedback and production is total 90's, but the style is straight 1964, and a glorious style it is." [...] Joel Gion talked down the recognized similarities, saying [...] "Take it from the Man was largely described as a December's Children nuts and bolts Rhythm & Blues sound. We don't purposely go out for that. We just like that music. I think there were higher <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>music</b> during the '60s. You could take Top 40 music from then {{and check out the}} quality." ...|$|E

40|$|When {{you hear}} reggae music {{you might imagine}} scenes from a Caribbean beach or the feeling of balmy ocean breezes. Reggae music usually sounds easygoing and gentle with a cheerful, upbeat rhythm. Reggae dancers move with {{the flow of the}} songs, as though they are just walking down the beach. This {{seemingly}} cheerful music is noteworthy for music educators, because there can be great value in the study of “folk-turned-pop ” music.

Four of the National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> Education have achievement standards for K– 4 that refer to the music of diverse cultures.

However, since some children {{do not seem to}} sing naturally, teachers are continually searching for means of helping all children learn to sing.

In 1959 Enoch Light began releasing a series of high fidelity albums recorded on film through his label Command Records, along with albums by Dick Hyman, the Ray Charles Singers, Doc Severinsen and others. [...] These LPs were marketed as audiophile recordings, and boasted superior sound quality, but with few popular artists using this technology and the expensive cost of film, optical sound never took hold as a standard in the music industry.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to identif the music skills and {{understanding}} taught during preservice training that in-service preschool classroom teachers perceived as practical and beneficial. A 31 -item questionnaire was developed and mailed to direc-tors of 89 public and private preschool programs where music specialists were not used. The mailing resulted in a return of 210 individually returned forms, representing 66 % of the total mailing. Results demonstrated that the teacher skills and understandings that were considered most useful were those that provided students with direct music expe-riences. These skills, which teachers learned in preservice training, included movement activities, using rhythm instruments, and singing experiences. More traditional music skills and understandings, such as those taught in courses such as music theary and his-tory, were not perceived to be useful to preschool instructors. Descriptive information revealed that although most teachers held a college degree and a teaching certificate, the majority were unaware of and none had read the Performance <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music...</b>|$|E
