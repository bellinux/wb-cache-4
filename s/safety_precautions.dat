5|$|Patients {{often ask}} {{if they need to}} have special <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> around family and friends after {{receiving}} brachytherapy. If temporary brachytherapy is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, an {{oxidizing}} agent, and is categorised as probably carcinogenic {{to humans}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Consequently, {{it must be}} handled and stored with the appropriate <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> to prevent inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Due to its hazardous nature, the limited applications of lead(II) nitrate are under constant scrutiny.|$|E
5|$|Operators and {{authorities}} state that numerous measures {{had been taken}} {{to ensure the safety}} of passengers, and SBS Transit publicised the <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> on the driverless North East Line before and after its opening. Safety campaign posters are highly visible in trains and stations, and the operators frequently broadcast safety announcements to passengers and to commuters waiting for trains. Fire safety standards are consistent with the strict guidelines of the US National Fire Protection Association.|$|E

5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} mine was hot {{with high levels of}} coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E
5|$|When local {{fishermen}} catch a large tiger shark, {{the mayor}} proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes it being the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable great white shark's tooth {{embedded in the}} submerged hull. He drops it after finding a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added <b>safety</b> <b>precautions.</b> On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists fill the beaches. Following a juvenile prank, the real shark enters a nearby estuary, killing a boater and causing Brody's son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody finally convinces a devastated Vaughn to hire Quint.|$|E
5|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>precautions</b> {{were also}} enacted {{elsewhere}} in {{and near the}} storm's path; council members and citizens at Moore City Hall − where a council meeting {{was scheduled to be}} held that evening − sheltered in place in the building's first-floor restrooms, away from the multiple large-pane windows at its facade. In downtown Oklahoma City, spectators attending sporting events held that evening involving two of the city's minor league teams – a regular season baseball game between the Oklahoma RedHawks and Memphis Redbirds (which was suspended during the second inning) and Game 2 of the Ray Miron President's Cup series between the Oklahoma City Blazers and the Huntsville Channel Cats – were also evacuated to shelter in an underground storage area connected to the Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark and Myriad Convention Center amid concerns that the storm would jog northward and place Oklahoma City itself in the tornado's path. Flights were grounded at Will Rogers World Airport as the northern edge of the supercell approached the area; the tornado turned right, away from southwestern parts of the city proper, shortly before airport officials began evacuating employees and visitors at the terminals. Traffic on Interstate 35 in south Oklahoma City and north Moore became backed up for several miles, as drivers evacuated from their vehicles to seek shelter under an overpass overlooking South Shields Boulevard.|$|E

25|$|Material Safety Data Sheets {{recommend}} {{a number of}} <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> be taken when handling or working with fly ash. These include wearing protective goggles, respirators and disposable clothing and avoiding agitating the fly ash in order to minimise the amount which becomes airborne.|$|E

25|$|OsO4 also stains {{the human}} cornea, {{which can lead}} to {{blindness}} if proper <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> are not observed. The permissible exposure limit for osmium(VIII) oxide (8 hour time-weighted average) is 200µg/m3. Osmium(VIII) oxide can penetrate plastics and therefore is stored in glass under refrigeration.|$|E
25|$|Mooring {{lines and}} hawsers {{may also be}} made by {{combining}} wire rope and synthetic line. Such lines are more elastic and easier to handle than wire rope, {{but they are not}} as elastic as pure synthetic line. Special <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> must be followed when constructing a combination mooring line.|$|E
25|$|When inhaled, lead(II,IV) oxide irritates lungs. In case of high dose, {{the victim}} {{experiences}} a metallic taste, chest pain, and abdominal pain. When ingested, it is dissolved in the gastric acid and absorbed, leading to lead poisoning. High concentrations can be absorbed through skin as well, {{and it is}} important to follow <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> when working with lead-based paint.|$|E

25|$|In most circumstances, Kodiak bears {{keep away}} {{and attempt to}} avoid {{encounters}} with people. The most notable exceptions to this behavior pattern occur when bears are surprised, threatened, or attracted by human food, garbage, or hunter-killed game. Bear <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> aim at avoiding such situations, understanding bear needs and behavior, {{and learning how to}} recognize the warning signs bears give when stressed.|$|E
25|$|After the Whitman event, the {{observation}} deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following {{a series of}} suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other <b>safety</b> <b>precautions,</b> the tower observation deck reopened to the public. There is a turtle pond park near the tower dedicated to those affected by the tragedy.|$|E
25|$|Transformer-less power {{supplies}} required <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> in their design {{to limit the}} shock hazard to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an interlock tying the power cord to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A cheater cord was a power cord ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.|$|E

25|$|Storm Surge Watch – Life-threatening {{inundation}} {{from rising}} water being forced inland by an ongoing or potential tropical, subtropical or post-tropical cyclone is possible within the specified area, generally within 48 hours. It may be issued {{in advance of}} the cyclone's landfall if other hazardous tropical conditions (such as the onset of tropical storm-force winds) are expected to limit enactment of <b>safety</b> <b>precautions,</b> and may also be issued for adjacent locations that could potentially be isolated by surge inundation.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{reception}} to Burj Khalifa {{has been}} generally positive, {{and the building}} has received many awards. However, labour issues during construction were controversial, since the building was built primarily by migrant workers from South Asia with several allegations of mistreatment. Poor working conditions were common, {{a consequence of the}} lack of minimum wage laws in the United Arab Emirates. Several instances of suicides have been reported, which is not uncommon for migrant construction workers in Dubai despite <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> in place.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of {{radioactivity}} became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> and provided with protective gear. In particular, dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them (which caused some ingestion of radium salts). Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s, but there were no further injuries to dial painters. This highlighted that the harm to the Radium Girls could easily have been avoided.|$|E
