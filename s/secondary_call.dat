All the interrupted <b>secondary</b> <b>calls</b> look for available rented resources at the RS sub-network.

30|$|The {{unencumbered}} call {{interruption time}} {{is defined as}} the period of time from the instant a <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> establish a radio link with a cell until the time it would be interrupted due to the arrival of a PU assuming that the network has unlimited resources and the service time is of infinite duration. Physically, this time represents the period of time that a <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> last before it would be abruptly terminated due to a primary call arrival under the assumption that both the cell dwell time and the unencumbered service time are of infinite duration. The call interruption time is said to be “unencumbered” because the interruption of a <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> in progress by a primary user arrival can or cannot occur, depending on the values of the CDT and the UST. Thus, a particular <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> is interrupted in the current cell if and only if its potential call interruption time is smaller than both the unencumbered service time and residual cell dwell time (or both the unencumbered residual service time and cell dwell time). Therefore, notice that this call interruption time is not a measurable physical quantity. Indeed, in case that the user leaves the cell or completes its call before the call is interrupted, {{it is not possible to}} know the actual value of this interruption time since, in this case, call interruption due to the arrival of primary users actually never happens.|$|E

30|$|This event {{happens when}} there are n SUs, {{each one of them}} occupying bn {{channels}} in either the PS or RS. Thus, this event will happen with rate nμn; as such, a higher number of ongoing <b>secondary</b> <b>calls</b> implies a higher death rate.|$|R

30|$|At any time, PUs have {{priority}} {{to acquire the}} channels of the PS that are used by SUs. A PU request is accepted if bmm[*]≤[*]N[*]−[*]bm, meaning that there are enough resources to course a PU session; otherwise, it is rejected. When a PU is accepted, and the channels assigned to it are being occupied by calls of SUs, those calls must be relinquished. Every SU call that was preempted is transferred to an idle channel, if available, to resume its transmission. If there are no idle channels in the PS, preempted <b>secondary</b> <b>calls</b> are transferred to the RS and are assigned to idle leased channels. If there are no enough leased channels available to continue {{the service of the}} preempted <b>secondary</b> <b>calls,</b> then, part of these calls are forced to terminate.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{spectrum}} degradation procedure described above is also {{triggered by the}} arrival of a PU to mitigate forced termination of interrupted SU calls. Again, it is taken advantage of the flexibility and delay tolerance of elastic traffic in benefit of QoS satisfaction of SvUs at the price of transmission delay for SdUs. In this case, if the degradation procedure (as well as the preemptive priority mechanism used to protect SvU calls) fails, the interrupted <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> is forcedly terminated (that is, no victim buffer is considered for voice sessions).|$|E

The study carried out in this work allows us to investigate the performance improvement due to the use of these resource management mechanisms commonly separately employed in the literature. All of the strategies studied in this work consider the use of spectrum handoff.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA single link in a {{circuit-switched}} {{network is}} considered. The link hasCcircuits,Rof which {{are reserved for}} the primary (directly offered) traffic. Offered calls arrive in independent Poisson streams with mean rates λ and ν for the primary and secondary (rerouted) traffic, respectively, and corresponding independent and exponentially distributed holding times with means 1 and 1 /κ. A primary call requires just 1 circuit, whereas a <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> requirestcircuits, wheretis a positive integer. A primary call is blocked on arrival if allCcircuits are busy, whereas a <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> is blocked if more thanC−R−tcircuits are busy. Blocked calls are lost to the link. The critically loaded case in which λ⪢ 1,C−λ=O($Rλ$t),R=O($Rλ$T), and ν=γ $Rλ$T, where γ=O(1), is investigated. Asymptotic approximations toB 1 andB 2, the blocking probabilities for the primary and secondary traffic, are derived. The results are explicit if κ= 1, but involve expansions in powers of γ for κ≠ 1, {{in which it is}} shown how to determine the coefficients recursively. The first two terms in powers of γ are given explicitly. An alternate approach, which involves truncation rather than power series expansions, is presented. The caseR=O(1) is also considered, and explicit results are obtained. Finally, an approximation proposed by J. W. Roberts is investigated. The approximation is shown to be asymptotically correct if κ= 1, or ifR=O(1), but not if κ≠ 1 andR=O($Rλ$T). Interestingly, Roberts' approximation corresponds to truncation with just 2 coefficients. Truncation with more coefficients leads to refinements of his approximation...|$|E

30|$|This {{behavior}} {{is due to}} the following two facts. First, the handoff arrival rate increases as the user mobility increases in detrimental of call forced termination probability. Thus, in order to achieve the required forced call termination probability (i.e., 0.2 %), as the user mobility increases, more channels to prioritize intra- and inter-cell handoff call attempts over new call requests need to be reserved in detrimental of new call blocking probability. Consequently, in order to achieve the required new call blocking probability (i.e., 2 %), system Erlang capacity is sacrificed (mobility/capacity conversion [41]). Second, increasing the relative service time implies that the mean value of the secondary service time relative to the mean value of the primary service time increases. In this sense, as the relative service time increases (while the utilization factor of the primary channels remains unchanged), {{it is more likely that}} an ongoing <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> is interrupted due to the arrival of primary sessions in detrimental of forced call termination probability. Because of its larger duration, each <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> is exposed to a larger number of interruptions. Thus, as explained above, in order to guarantee the required QoS, in terms of the forced call termination, more channels need to be reserved in detrimental of the maximum achievable system Erlang capacity. Also, for a given value of the utilization factor of the primary channels, as the relative service time increases, the departure rate of successfully terminated calls decreases relative to the arrival rate of primary sessions; thus, the average number of idle channels decreases in detrimental of the new call blocking probability and, consequently, in detrimental of system capacity. The joint effect of these facts leads us to the behavior explained above and illustrated in Fig.  8.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of a wireless system that allows opportunistic spectrum sharing. The system consists of a set of primary users sharing a set of channels over a coverage area. The resources allocated to the primary users are shared opportunistically with a set of secondary users. The secondary users are capable of detecting channels that are unused by the primary users and then making use of the idle channels. If no channel is available for a <b>secondary</b> <b>call,</b> the call waits in a buffer until either a channel becomes available or a maximum waiting time is reached. We compute the blocking probabilities, mean reconnection probability, channel utilization, and total carried traffic in the system. Our results suggest that opportunistic spectrum sharing can significantly improve the efficiency of a wireless system, without negatively impacting the performance seen by the primary users. I...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, the Erlang {{capacity}} {{achieved by}} the separate or joint use of several resource management mechanisms commonly considered in the literature (spectrum aggregation, spectrum adaptation, call buffering, channel reservation, selective interruption, and preemptive prioritization) to mitigate the effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> interruptions in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is evaluated and compared. Heterogeneous traffic is considered, and service differentiation between real-time and elastic (data) traffic is done {{in terms of their}} different delay tolerance characteristics. The aim of our investigation is to identify the most relevant resource management mechanisms to improve the performance of the considered networks. As such, both the individual and joint effect of each resource management mechanisms on system performance are evaluated with the objective of comparing the gains in capacity achieved by each resource management mechanism studied in this work. For this purpose, the different resource management mechanisms studied are carefully combined and, for each resulting strategy, optimization of its configuration is presented to maximize the achievable Erlang capacity. For the performance evaluation of the considered strategies in heterogeneous traffic CRNs, a general teletraffic analysis is developed. Numerical results show that spectrum adaptation and call buffering are the mechanisms that best exploit the elasticity of delay-tolerant traffic in heterogeneous traffic CRNs and, therefore, most significantly improve system performance.|$|E

30|$|The Erlang {{capacity}} {{achieved by}} the separate or joint use of different resource management mechanisms commonly considered in the literature to mitigate the effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>call</b> interruptions in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with heterogeneous traffic was evaluated and compared. Novel adaptive spectrum allocation strategies that jointly employ different resource management techniques {{to take advantage of}} the flexibility and delay tolerance features of elastic traffic for the considered networks were analyzed and evaluated. To this end, a general teletraffic analysis was developed. For the mathematical modeling, spectrum handoff, channel reservation, elastic-traffic buffering, spectrum adaptation, and non-homogenous channels were considered. Because the proposed analysis reduces the number of state variables employed in [10], this is a major contribution of this work. The performance of the considered system was evaluated in terms of maximum Erlang capacity. Numerical results show that call buffering and spectrum adaptation are the mechanisms that best exploit the elasticity of delay-tolerant traffic in heterogeneous traffic CRNs and, therefore, most significantly improve their performance. Also, it concluded that channel reservation for ongoing secondary calls allows a slow decreasing rates of Erlang capacity as the utilization factor of primary channels increases. Finally, our numerical results show that the Erlang capacity of delay-sensitive secondary users is very low even for reduced primary traffic loads (such that the blocking probability is lower than 1 %). As previously commented, the most effective mechanism for guarantee QoS for real-time and interactive applications in CRNs is to reserve spectrum band for exclusive use of the secondary network (CCRNs) [3, 5 – 8]. The use of spectrum partitioning is not considered in this work; however, the extension of the resource management mechanisms considered in the paper for CCRNs is straightforward and subject of future research work.|$|E
