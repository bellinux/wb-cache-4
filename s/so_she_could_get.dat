This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance so she slightly resembled a South Dakota from a distance. Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. Nevada then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11–18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at a former Chili's in the San Fernando Valley, {{in the city}} of Burbank. The episode was filmed [...] "from dawn, until very late at night", {{according}} to Kaling. During filming breaks, Kaling later joked that she took [...] "ladylike" [...] naps, while Paul Lieberstein made notes on the episode and its script. While filming, many parts of the script were changed so the restaurant would allow the shoot to continue. For instance, in the original script, Pam vomits at Chili's and Dwight responds, [...] "A woman has vomited!" [...] Because the completed script was not available for Chili's to review until shooting had already started, when they were finally given a chance to read it, they objected to a customer vomiting in their restaurant. Chili's withdrew its permission to shoot, but, after a few hours, Steve Carell developed a compromise: Pam would fall off her bar stool and Dwight would respond, [...] "A woman has had a seizure!" [...] In the original version, Pam was also to be over-served alcohol by the Chili's staff, but Chili's—feeling that this would reflect poorly on their character as a company—did not want this in the episode either. To solve this issue, the writers had Pam steal drinks off other tables. The writers and producers also agreed to include a scene in which the actual owner of the Chili's restaurant (Jon Bosshart, not an actor) makes it clear that the restaurant does not over-serve alcohol to its customers. [...] Since Jenna Fischer does not drink much in real life, B. J. Novak took her out <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> drunk while Novak described to her how she was behaving and how it did not match her own perception. She drew upon this experience for her performance.|$|E
500|$|Stephen James Walker, {{a writer}} of {{reference}} works on Doctor Who, gave an unfavourable review to Rose's return in [...] "Turn Left" [...] in his [...] "unauthorised guide to Doctor Whos fourth series," [...] Monsters Within. He thought that Billie Piper was [...] "distinctly below par", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised {{her role in the}} episode, stating it had been [...] "far less well worked out" [...] than Donna's. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy also noted a change in Piper's enunciation; he compared her accent to [...] " [...] her mouth numbed with local anaesthetic". In Rawson-Jones' review of the series finalé he notes that whilst having the Doctor and Rose 'cop off' would be divisive with the shows audience, [...] "Davies wisely managed to please both parties" [...] by pairing her off with a human Doctor instead. However, IGN's Travis Fickett reacted unfavourably towards Rose's return and her pairing with the part human Doctor. He thought that it undermined her [...] "perfect send off" [...] in [...] "Doomsday" [...] as she was on the sidelines for much of [...] "Journey's End", and her ending up with the part human, part Time Lord Doctor [...] "feels like an insult to the character". Io9's Charlie Jane Anders also reacted unfavorably to Rose returning and wrote [...] "it was pretty clear that she was only there <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> her pet faux-Doctor at the end." [...] Reviewers generally reacted positively to Piper's 2013 appearance in 50th anniversary episode [...] "The Day of the Doctor". Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph called her performance as the [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] Rose [...] "transfixing". Neela Debnath of The Independent praised the chemistry between Hurt and Piper and compared Piper's performance to Suranne Jones' portrayal of the TARDIS in [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly eccentric", [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "off-the-wall". Daniel Martin of the Guardian praised Steven Moffat's decision not to extend Rose Tyler's story or re-unite her with the Tenth Doctor. He called Piper [...] "a true and unending legend of Doctor Who" [...] and stated that [...] "her wise rendition of the Bad Wolf avatar made a passable stab at the stealing of the show".|$|E

50|$|Hampered {{by lack of}} {{materials}} and almost constant air alerts, Haggard’s crew succeeded in repairing her <b>so</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> underway. <b>She</b> departed Kerama Retto 18 June 1945 and arrived Pearl Harbor via Saipan and Guam 12 July. From there she steamed to San Diego and the Panama Canal Zone, arriving at Norfolk 5 August 1945. Decommissioned 1 November 1945, Haggard was scrapped because of war damage.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the NDP {{leadership}} {{convention on}} October 14, 1995, McDonough was {{widely viewed as}} an also-ran behind the leading contenders, Svend Robinson and Lorne Nystrom, but at the convention she placed second on the first ballot, ahead of Nystrom in what was almost a three way vote split. Although Robinson had placed first on that ballot, he felt that most of Nystrom's supporters would go to McDonough on the second ballot, giving her the victory. Thus, he conceded to McDonough before a second ballot could be held, and moved a motion to formally appoint her as the new leader. [...] McDonough became the first person from Atlantic Canada to lead a major party since Robert Stanfield retired as the Progressive Conservatives' leader in 1976. [...] Unusually for a major-party leader, {{she did not have}} one of her MPs in a safe seat resign <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into Parliament via a by-election, opting instead to make a third bid for her home riding of Halifax in the next general election.|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was asked}} how Callum does not {{remember}} Sonya, Morey explained that Sonya had fallen in with a bad crowd, was an alcohol and drugs addict and was suffering from post-natal depression. She chose to leave Callum with her grandmother, Hilda, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> herself cleaned up. Hilda then had everything related to Sonya removed from the family. Callum was around four or five when Sonya left and Morey believed that he had blocked out the bad memories of her. Morey commented that Sonya's relationship with Callum would have been [...] "a love-hate one" [...] because she was only 16 when she had him. He would have become like a younger brother to her rather than a son. Executive producer Susan Bower defended the storyline when asked why Sonya and Callum's history had been rewritten. She told an Inside Soap columnist that they worked with the character's established backgrounds and found reasons and motivations for Sonya to act the way she did. Bower admitted that the only discrepancy that could be pointed out was Callum's age. When Hilda dies, Sonya becomes concerned that her secret will be revealed when Callum attends the funeral. However, Callum chooses {{to say goodbye to}} his great-grandmother privately, much to Sonya's relief.|$|E
