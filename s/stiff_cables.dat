40|$|ADC counts Figure 1 : ADC {{spectrum}} for a fibre detector with SSPM read-out fitted {{by physical}} model {{to determine the}} basic SSPM operation parameters. Solid state photomultipliers (SSPM) consist of a pixelised array of micrometric avalanche photodiodes connected in parallel. Despite the digital character of the signals from the individual pixels the device as a whole behaves analogically {{as long as the}} number of incoming photons remains small compared to the quantity of pixels. SSPM technology reduces even further the complexity and price of fibre tracking detectors by getting rid of voluminous high voltage power supplies and <b>stiff</b> <b>cables</b> used for conventional photomultipliers. In addition, such a detector will be insensitive to magnetic fields. The price to pay is a MHz dark count rate at room temperature. These events are generated by thermal electrons. Internal cross-talk between adjacent pixels can bring that noise to high amplitudes competing with real signals generated by a small number of photons. A small fibre barrel read-out by SSPM has been discussed as an option for a time-of-flight start detector in PANDA and as an active target for the hypernuclear physics programme in PANDA. Such a detector can be used for the particle identification, for a time reference for the DIRC detector, and for track deconvolution of the TP chamber [1]. The main purpose of the active hypernuclear target is the tracking and stopping of the produced Ξ hyperons and their decay products [1]. The detection efficiency has been measured using a Sr radioactive source for a two metres long cylindrical fibre, 0. 89 mm in diameter and double cladding read out in bot...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} software {{package for the}} static and dynamic analyses of cable networks has been developed. The algorithm involves the Newton-Raphson method and Newmark 2 ̆ 7 s α-method.

In addition, an optimization subroutine based on the Neider and Mead Simplex method has been incorporated into the software to enable designers to determine the optimal design values of pretensioned forces leading to a <b>stiffer</b> <b>cable</b> network.

5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and <b>stiff</b> control <b>cables.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since {{knitted fabric}} is {{generally}} elastic, it conforms readily to the wearer's body without shaping. However, some shaping {{may be necessary}} when the knitted fabrics are unusually <b>stiff</b> (e.g., thick <b>cable</b> designs or heavily overstitched designs) or in regions of high curvature (e.g. sock heels). Ironically, shaping is much easier and less obvious with knitted fabrics than with woven cloth. Instead of cutting out wedges and sewing the edges together, knitters can add or subtract stitches; work short rows; or, most subtly of all, change the needle size to produce smaller/larger stitches in the desired [...] "wedge" [...] region.|$|R

50|$|Fox {{discontinued}} the 4Kids TV {{block on}} December 27, 2008, due to {{conflicts between the}} network and 4Kids Entertainment that were later settled, regarding 4Kids' failure to pay Fox for the programming lease rights, and the network's inability to fulfill a promise guaranteeing clearance on 90% of its stations and to get other stations to carry the block in certain markets where a Fox station declined it (an issue that plagued Fox's children's program blocks {{since the start of}} its affiliation deal with New World Communications). Fox had earlier announced, on November 23, that it would no longer carry children's programming in the time period, citing <b>stiff</b> competition from <b>cable</b> channels aimed at the demographic; the network instead turned over two of the four vacant Saturday morning hours to its affiliates to allow them to air local newscasts or educational programs purchased from the syndication market, while it retained the remaining two hours to run a network-managed paid programming block, Weekend Marketplace, which debuted on January 3, 2009.|$|R
40|$|Since 1870, {{only about}} 25 highway bridges have been {{executed}} as a self-anchored suspension bridge. The {{rise of the}} cable stayed bridge since 1955 made this suspension type an obsolete alternative {{for a long period}} of time. The largest existing main span for a self-anchored suspension bridge is 300 metres and dates from 1999. Main difficulties for this bridge type to reach spans over 300 metres can be blamed on erection problems and the buckling stability of the girder. Erecting the deck structure prior to the main cable makes this bridge technically and economically less attractive than for instance the cable stayed bridge. A dimensional inventory has shown that the deck slenderness is limited to about ? = 1 / 95 and the sag ratio varies between 1 / 5 - 1 / 8. The deck slenderness is related to the required bending stiffness to have sufficient resistance against buckling. Also the relatively high sag ratios, compared to conventional suspension bridges, are mainly chosen to reduce the normal force in the deck that is imposed by the main cable. A parameter study into the structural behaviour has revealed that the most important bridge parameters are the bending stiffness EIdeck of the deck and the axial stiffness EAmain cable of the main cable. A well chosen ratio between the EIdeck and EAmain cable influences the maximum bending moments and the deflections in the girder. In the pre-design process of a suspension bridge type it is favourable to consider: -A slender stiffening girder, to reduce the maximum bending moment in the girder -A <b>stiff</b> main <b>cable,</b> to increase the global stiffness of the bridge and to reduce the maximum bending moment in the girder -A high sag to span ratio, to reduce the normal force in the deck and the maximum bending moment in the deck.

40|$|This project {{concerns}} large {{cable drums}} made of steel. Cable drums are cylindrical structures used to transport {{different kinds of}} cables or wires. The ones in focus in this work are used to transport very <b>stiff</b> and heavy <b>cables</b> to offshore sites in the oil industry. To reduce weight in structures is always of great interest, and for cable drums, that are designed according to standards, {{there is much that}} can be improved. The aim of this project is to predict the loads acting on a drum during the winding of cables. This was accomplished by performing explicit finite element simulations of the winding sequence. Modeling and meshing were done using LS-PrePost and ANSA, and the winding was simulated using LS-DYNA. LS-PrePost was also used to analyze the results, together with mETApost. A number of simplifications and delimitations have been made {{in order to make the}} simulation possible within the time frame of the project. Simplified models of both the cable and the drum have been used. Winding velocities in real life are really slow, so in order to reduce simulation times, the winding velocity had to be increased while still avoiding dynamic effects. From this, contact forces between the drum and the cable could be obtained. The contact forces were investigated with respect to different friction values between the cable and the drum, for the cable itself and also for different cable stiffnesses. The results obtained from the simulations provide contact force distributions for different parts of the drum. Much fewer rows and layers of cable were winched than in real life, and it is therefore hard to see any clear trends in the obtained forces. However, one important result of the contact forces, is that a previously used assumption, namely that the pretension of the cable only applies loads to a small fraction of the drum, was a bit too conservative. According to the simulations it actually gets distributed over the whole drum. It is hard to draw any conclusions from the obtained contact forces, due to the small size of the simulations. The conclusion one can draw from this report, is that it is fully possible to use finite element tools to simulate the winding sequence of cable drums and this report presents a methodology on how to achieve this. LS-DYNA handles the contact definitions in an adequate way and is, according to the authors, a strong candidate for future work in this area. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Positioning {{accuracy}} in cable driven mechanisms with motor position sensing is limited because the stiffness in these manipulators {{is less than}} rigid links. By applying Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and considering system dynamics in addition to motor sensing, the position estimation in these systems can be improved. To further improve the accuracy, additional observation was provided to the UKF by tracking the robot end-effector position with a camera. Furthermore, in cable driven systems the knowledge of cable's pre-tension not only improves {{the performance of the}} mechanism but can also be used as a measure to determine if the system is safe and robust to operate (e. g. too loose causes slack while too <b>stiff</b> causes the <b>cable</b> to wear and break). Thus, knowing the cable's pre-tension is important particularly in applications such as surgical robotics. To measure this initial tension, a special force gauge sensor can be used; however, these sensors are expensive and in some applications, such as surgery, it is not practical due to sterilization requirement. It is found that the stiffness parameter of cables has the highest correlation with tension. Therefore, we estimated the stiffness parameter to indirectly estimate cable's pre-tension. To estimate cable's pre-tension indirectly, first the initial tension in the cables were measured with a sensor and then the UKF was used to estimate system states and stiffness parameter simultaneously. The stiffness parameter was estimated at different tensions to find a mapping between tension and stiffness. This mapping was later used to estimate tension with UKF without a need for force sensor. Moreover, in surgery, haptic feedback is vital for surgeons. Without haptic feedback, surgeons may exert excessive force to a healthy tissue. To address this issue, we developed a novel approach to estimate external forces acting on cable driven robots by measuring the stretch in cables caused by external force similar to Series Elastic Actuators (SEA) without actually placing an elastic element in series with the motor and load. In our approach, we took advantage of the elasticity of cables. In our method, we used two encoders to precisely measure the cable stretch. The first encoder is mounted on the shaft of the motor while the second encoder is mounted on the Joint. With the first encoder, we used robot kinematics to estimate Joint angle (q_kin) and with the second encoder we measured the actual Joint angle (q). Then, by subtracting these two angles we measured the stretch. Once the stretch in cables are known, either linear Hooke's law or a non-linear spring model can be used to estimate external forces...|$|R
