40|$|Beam {{loss and}} {{emittance}} dilution during ramping from injection to collision energy is {{observed in the}} Tevatron, now in its collider run-II stage. Imperfect control of the machine chromaticity during the injection porch and the ensuing ramp to collision could contribute to the beam loss. Dipole magnets are {{the main source of}} chromaticity in the Tevatron. Sextupole correctors are distributed around the ring to compensate for the sextupole from the dipole magnets. Furthermore, the sextupole component in the superconducting Tevatron dipole magnets decays during the injection plateau and snaps back to the value {{before the start of the}} decay at the start of the ramp. The chromaticity correctors also correct for this so-called dynamic sextupole behavior. To determine if the sextupole compensation is working successfully in the Tevatron a thorough investigation of the sextupole (b 2) in Tevatron dipole magnets was recently conducted. This included an extensive series of off-line magnetic measurements on several Tevatron dipole magnets from the <b>spare</b> <b>pool.</b> Traditionally one differentiates between three different b 2 components, geometric, hysteretic and dynamic.

40|$|Thesis (M. S) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"December 2007. "Controlling {{spare parts}} {{inventory}} {{of a product}} is a major effort to many companies. The problem becomes more challenging when the installed base of the product changes over time. In order {{to cope with the}} situation, the inventory value needs to be adjusted according to the resulting non-stationary maintenance demand. This problem is usually encountered when a manufacturer starts selling a new product and agrees to provide spare parts for maintenance. In this research, a special case involving a new non-repairable product with a single <b>spare</b> <b>pool</b> is considered. It is assumed that the new sales follow some popular stochastic processes, and the product. s failure time follows the Weibull distribution or Exponential distribution. The mathematical model for the resulting maintenance demand is formulated and calculated through simulation. Based on the maintenance demand, a dynamic (Q, r) - (lotsize/reorder-point) restocking policy is formulated and solved using a multi-resolution approach. Finally, numerical examples with the objective of minimizing the inventory cost under a service level constraint are provided to demonstrate the proposed methodology in practical use...|$|R
40|$|Operation of the Tevatron {{at lower}} temperatures, {{for the purpose}} of {{allowing}} higher energies, has resulted in a renewed interest in thermal modeling of the magnet strings. Static heat load and AC loses in the superconducting coils are initially transported through subcooled liquid helium. Heat exchange between the subcooled liquid and a counter flowing two-phase stream transfers the load to the latent heat. Stratification of the two-phase helium stream has resulted in considerably less heat exchange compared to the original design. Spool pieces have virtually no heat transfer to the two-phase resulting in a ''warm'' dipole just downstream. A model of the magnet string thermal behavior has been developed. The model has been used to identify temperature profiles within magnet strings. The temperature profiles are being used in conjunction with initial magnet quench performance data to predict the location of quench limiting magnets within the Tevatron. During thermal cycles of magnet strings, the model is being used to ''shuffle'' magnets within the magnet string in order to better match the magnets quench performance with its actual predicted temperature. The motivation for this analysis is to raise the operating energy of the Tevatron using a minimal number of magnets from the <b>spares</b> <b>pool...</b>|$|R

Motor neuron degeneration caused by ageing similarly affects FF types but not S types; ageing also seems to <b>spare</b> ocular motor <b>pools.</b> These similar patterns of neurodegeneration in three different diseases have led researchers to speculate that slow-twitch motor neurons, along with motor pools of the eyes and excretory muscles, have intrinsic neuroprotective properties that are not disease-specific.

40|$|Inventory pooling is at {{the root}} of many celebrated ideas in {{operations}} management. Postponement, componentcommonality, and resource flexibility are some examples. Motivated by our experience in the aftermarket services industry, we propose a model of inventory pooling to meet differentiated service levels for multiple customers. Our central research question is the following: What are the minimum inventory level and optimal allocation policy when a pool of inventory is used in a single period to satisfy individual service levels for multiple customers? We measure service by the probability of fulfilling a customer’s entire demand immediately from stock. We characterize the optimal solution in several allocation policy classes; provide some structural results, formulas, and bounds; and also make detailed interpolicy comparisons. We show that the pooling benefit is always strictly positive, even when there are an arbitrary number of customers with perfectly positively correlated demands.

We analyze the following type of control policy: there is a support level, say K > 0, such that when the level of on hand stock reaches K, all low priority demands are backordered while high priority demands continue to be filled. Both continuous review and periodic review systems are considered. The objective of the analysis is to develop methods for comparing fill rates when there is rationing and when there is no rationing for specified values of the reorder point, order quantity and support level. inventory/production: policies, issuing, inventory/production: approximations, inventory/production: stochastic models...|$|R

40|$|Maintenance {{outsourcing}} is {{a strategic}} driver for asset intensive industries pursuing to enhance supply chain performance. Spare parts management plays a relevant {{role in this}} premise since its significant impact on equipment availability, and hence on business success. Designing critical spares policies might therefore seriously affect maintenance contracts profitability, yet service receivers and external providers traditionally attempt to benefit separately. To coordinate both chain parties, we investigated whether the <b>spare</b> components <b>pool</b> should be managed in-house or contracted out. This paper provides a decision-making framework to efficiently integrate contractual conditions with critical spares stockholding. Using an imperfect maintenance strategy over a finite horizon, the scheme maximizes chain returns whilst evaluating the impact of an additional part to stock. As result, an original joint value - preventive interval and stock level - sets the optimal agreement to profitably allocate the components pool within the service contract. Subsidization bonuses on preventive interventions and pooling costs are also estimated to induce the service provider to adjust its policy when needed. The proposed contractual conditions motivate stakeholders to continuously improve maintenance performance and supply practices, thus obtaining higher joint benefits...|$|R

40|$|The Eisenberger-Maiocco {{algorithm}} (EMA) is {{an efficient}} Markov sparing algorithm {{to aid in}} the provisioning of spare parts. There are two calculations performed by EMA: 1) forecasting the availability of a system with a given <b>spare</b> parts <b>pool,</b> and 2) determining the most cost effective spares package. EMA was used in NASA's Deep Space Network project to calculate the probability that a system would be up and operational with the spares available at each location. The system to be analyzed is defined in terms of modules, which are any pieces of equipment which may fail, be repaired, or be replaced. A module can be in one of three states: working, spare, or failed and waiting for repair. For each module type in the system configuration, there is an actual number in use by the system, and a minimum number for the system to be operational. A module type is considered 'down' when there are fewer than the required minimum number working, and there are no spares in the stockpile. Input to EMA includes module data such as mean time between failure, mean time to repair, number of spares, and cost of the item. EMA determines the overall system availability, or uptime ratio, as the probability the system will be operational during a given time. EMA can also calculate the most cost effective spares package for a given range of uptime ratios. EMA is written in interpreter PC-BASIC and is for interactive execution.

By lateral transshipment spare parts can be moved from one location with excess inventory to another location, at the same echelon, in shortage, {{with the aim of}} reducing supply delays of spare parts. This paper will examine the relative effectiveness of two lateral shipments approaches in reducing the mean supply delay (MSD) of a non-repairable item, with respect to a classical policy of no lateral shipments. A simulation model of a two echelon supply network has been implemented and an experiment has been performed by varying different parameters of the supply network, such as the number of warehouses (locations at the lower echelon), the supply lead time from the central depot, the spare parts demand uncertainty, and the size variability of the warehouses. Results show appreciable reductions of MSD when lateral shipments are allowed with respect to the classical policy, in almost every network configuration.
