5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

However, it is likely that many other smokers are doing the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> and taking those same precautions.|$|E

25|$|If X is an affine {{algebraic}} variety, {{then the}} set of all regular functions on X forms a ring called the coordinate ring of X. For a projective variety, there is an analogous ring called the homogeneous coordinate ring. Those rings are essentially the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> as varieties: they correspond in essentially a unique way. This may be seen via either Hilbert's Nullstellensatz or scheme-theoretic constructions (i.e., Spec and Proj).|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{spends more}} than other {{countries}} for the <b>same</b> <b>things.</b> Drugs are more expensive, doctors are paid more, and suppliers charge more for medical equipment than other countries. Journalist Todd Hixon reported on a study that U.S. spending on physicians per person is about five times higher than peer countries, $1,600 versus $310, as much as 37% of the gap with other countries. This was driven by a greater use of specialist doctors, who charge 3-6 times more in the U.S. than in peer countries.|$|E
25|$|Based on his {{experimental}} results, Wolfram {{developed the}} principle of computational equivalence (PCE): the principle states that systems found {{in the natural world}} can perform computations up to a maximal ("universal") level of computational power. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating input and outputs from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.|$|E

25|$|The show {{captured}} a key feature of Britain in the 1960s—the widening generation gap. Alf (and {{to a lesser}} degree his wife) represented the old guard, the traditional and conservative attitudes of the older generation. Alf's battles with his left-wing son-in-law were not just ideological but generational and cultural. His son-in-law and daughter represented the younger generation. They supported the aspects of the new era such as relaxed sexual mores, fashions, music, etc. The <b>same</b> <b>things</b> were anathema to Alf—and indicative of everything that was wrong with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced.|$|E
25|$|Further {{economic}} success {{continued through the}} 1980s onwards, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% during this time until 1999. In the 1980s, Singapore faced the challenge of needing to upgrade its industries to higher-technology industries, in order to compete with its neighbours which were exporting the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> at a lower price. Originally, Singapore manufactured goods such as textiles. A skilled workforce with an aptitude for learning helped ease the transition, for example, to new jobs in the wafer fabrication industry, which was quickly being established in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|To make various yarns, besides adding novelty elements, spinners {{can vary}} all the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> as in a {{machined}} yarn, i.e., the fibre, the preparation, the colour, the spinning technique, {{the direction of}} the twist, etc. A common misconception is yarn spun from rolags may not be as strong, but the strength of a yarn is actually based on the length of hair fibre and the degree of twist. When working with shorter hairs, such as llama or angora rabbit, the spinner may choose to integrate longer fibres, such as mohair, to prevent yarn breakage. Yarns made of shorter fibres are also given more twist than yarns of longer fibres, and are generally spun with the short draw technique.|$|E

The OECD reported that in 2013 the U.S. spent $1,026 per capita on pharmaceuticals (drugs) versus an OECD average of around $515.

25|$|In {{food and}} wine pairings, the {{diversity}} of Merlot can lend itself to {{a wide array of}} matching options. Cabernet-like Merlots pair well with many of the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> that Cabernet Sauvignon would pair well with, such as grilled and charred meats. Softer, fruitier Merlots (particularly those with higher acidity from cooler climate regions like Washington State and Northeastern Italy) share many of the same food-pairing affinities with Pinot noir and go well with dishes like salmon, mushroom-based dishes and greens like chard and radicchio. Light-bodied Merlots can go well with shellfish like prawns or scallops, especially if wrapped in a protein-rich food such as bacon or prosciutto. Merlot tends not to go well with strong and blue-veined cheeses that can overwhelm the fruit flavors of the wine. The capsaicins of spicy foods can accentuate the perception of alcohol in Merlot and make it taste more tannic and bitter.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become a better man.|$|E

Comparing Heaven Up Here with Joy Division's 1980 album Closer, Reynolds said they are [...] "harrowed by the <b>same</b> <b>things</b> [...] hypocrisy, distrust, betrayal, lost or frozen potential". However, he said that [...] "Closer shows Ian Curtis fatally mesmerized by his own dread visions, Heaven Up Here ultimately turns its face towards the light" [...] with the tracks [...] "No Dark Things"– which he describes as renouncing [...] "death-wishful thinking"– and [...] "All I Want"– which he describes as [...] "a blasting celebration of desire for desire's sake" [...] and [...] "pure intransitive exhilaration".|$|E
