40|$|The humanized {{monoclonal}} anti-IgE antibody omalizumab {{is currently}} the only biologic drug approved for asthma treatment. Omalizumab inhibits allergic responses by binding to <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>E</b> (IgE), thus preventing their interactions with cellular IgE receptors. Omalizumab is also capable of down-regulating the expression of high affinity IgE receptors on inflammatory cells, {{as well as the}} numbers of eosinophils in both peripheral blood and induced sputum. The clinical effects of omalizumab include relevant improvements in respiratory symptoms and quality of life, paralleled by a marked reduction of asthma exacerbations, emergency room visits, and use of systemic corticosteroids and rescue bronchodilators. Moreover, some recent studies suggest potential benefits of omalizumab also in non allergic phenotypes of severe asthma. Very interesting are also further recent reports referring to the potential inhibitory effect of omalizumab with regard to bronchial structural changes, especially occurring in severe asthma and globally defined as airway remodeling. Omalizumab is relatively well tolerated, and only very rarely induces anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, this drug represents a valid option as add-on therapy for patients with severe persistent asthma, inadequately controlled by high doses of standard inhaled treatments...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} BACKGROUND: Allergen-specific <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> {{detection and}} quantification {{have become an}} important step in allergy diagnosis and follow-up. In line with the current trend of laboratory test accreditation to international standards, we set out to design and assess an accreditation procedure for allergen-specific serum IgE. METHODS: Method validation according to the accreditation procedure under the EN ISO 15189 standard was carried out for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E determination using the fluoroimmunoenzymatic method ImmunoCAP(®) (ThermoFisher). Data were produced by 25 hospital laboratories in France. A total of 29 allergen specificities including mixes, extracts, and molecular allergens were assayed. Allergen-specific <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> concentrations ranged from 0. 1 to 100  kUA /l. RESULTS: Repeatability, reproducibility, and accuracy results fulfilled method validation criteria for automated laboratory tests and proved similar irrespective of the allergen specificity, allergen-specific <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> concentration, or individual laboratory. CONCLUSION: Allergen-specific <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> determination with the fluoroimmunoenzymatic method ImmunoCAP(®) is a highly repeatable, reproducible, and accurate method which may be considered as a single analyte assay in view of the EN ISO 15189 accreditation procedure. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{autosomal}} dominant (AD) hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES, Job syndrome) {{is a primary}} immunodeficiency with multiple systemic involvements. It is characterised by grossly raised <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> (IgE) level with recurrent cutaneous and pulmonary infections, eczema, pneumatocoeles, dental and musculoskeletal problems. The occurrence of the classic triads, namely recurrent cold abscesses, pneumatocoele formation and raised <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> should alert the clinicians on the diagnosis of HIES. Mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) gene have been identified recently to {{be the cause of}} AD HIES.
