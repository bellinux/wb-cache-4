50|$|The second {{generation}} Festiva {{continued to be}} sold in Australia until 2000 when it {{was replaced by the}} Ford Ka. Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> cut-outs {{on each side of the}} vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange side indicator repeater (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.|$|E

25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> and headrests.|$|R
50|$|Because their styling {{changed little}} from 1958 through 1982, many film {{producers}} were not careful to use period-correct Checker cars in their work. Often, a later model Checker (with <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> late-1970s bumpers, etc.) {{was used in}} 1950s or 1960s settings.|$|R
50|$|There are subtle design {{differences}} between the years. Noticeable differences have included: change over from non-synchro to synchro first gear in 1967; a grill and bumperette change in 1968; and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> in 1969. The basic body design, however, remained unchanged.|$|R
25|$|Like all 1968 {{passenger}} vehicles {{sold in the}} United States, GTOs now featured front outboard shoulder belts (cars built after January 1, 1968) and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.|$|R
5000|$|... 1970: Mid-cycle {{update with}} many detail changes {{including}} {{a completely new}} grille including wraparound front turn signals, exterior trim changes, and new <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> [...] "Sport Custom" [...] trim replaces [...] "Custom Cab", and [...] "Ranger XLT" [...] added as top trim level.|$|R
50|$|While the {{equivalent}} U.S. Market Chevy Nova featured changes in safety and emissions equipment during its relatively short 1968-1974 run (it {{had a total}} restyle for 1975), the Argentina version retained the 1968 car's features throughout its entire run, including a dash-mounted ignition switch and smaller <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> {{and trim}} around the tail lamps. Also, the only G series vans that had chrome grille and round {{headlamps}} from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option.|$|R
50|$|The front turn signals were {{relocated}} {{from underneath}} the bumper on USA versions to their new location next to the headlights, as in the Japanese, Australian and European versions. Side repeater lenses were also added to the USA version, but they were used as <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> and not turn signal repeaters.|$|R
50|$|The 1968 Furys {{received}} only minor grille and taillight trim updates, along with <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> and shoulder belts for front outboard occupants (except the convertible). Parking lights now illuminated with the headlights, {{which meant that}} if one headlight was inoperative in low beam, that other drivers wouldn't mistake your car for a motorcycle in the dark.|$|R
2500|$|Regular Chevelle engines {{started with}} a [...] Turbo-Thrift six or the new [...] Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a [...] version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual {{transmission}} cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.|$|R
50|$|The show {{also used}} 1968 Chargers (which {{shared the same}} sheet metal) by {{changing}} the grille and taillight panel to the 1969 style, and removing the round <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, {{almost all of them}} resulting in a completely destroyed car. The 1970 Chargers were modified by removing the chrome bumper and changing the taillights.|$|R
2500|$|... "Front {{position}} lamps", {{known as}} [...] "parking lamps" [...] or [...] "parking lights" [...] in the US, Canada and Australia and [...] "front sidelights" [...] in the UK provide nighttime standing-vehicle conspicuity. They {{were designed to}} use little electricity, {{so they could be}} left on for periods of time while parked. Despite the UK term, these {{are not the same as}} the <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> described below.|$|R
2500|$|The car {{incorporated}} several safety innovations including interior windshield posts {{that were}} [...] "the first industry use of fiberglass safety padding", and the flush-mounted paddle-style door handles. To comply with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards there were exterior <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> and three-point seat belts and headrests {{for the front}} seats, while the interior was devoid of bright trim to help reduce glare.|$|R

2500|$|The 1968 models {{featured}} additional safety features, including <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> {{and shoulder}} belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model's large {{steering wheel hub}} {{was replaced by a}} soft [...] "bar" [...] spoke that ran though the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic horn ring was also featured.|$|R

50|$|The 1969 model {{kept the}} same basic look, but with slight changes to the tail <b>lights</b> and grille, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> {{optional}} bucket seats, and new Road Runner decals. The Road Runner added a convertible option for 1969 with 2,128 such models produced that year. All were 383 CID L engine cars, except for ten which were equipped with a 426 CID L Hemi.|$|R

50|$|For the 1965 model year, the {{full-size}} Ford platform {{was given}} a redesign. To improve ride and handling, the rear leaf springs (a design unchanged since the 1949 Ford) were replaced by a three-link coil-spring design. To comply with federal safety mandates, in 1967 the full-size Fords were updated with a padded dashboard, recessed controls, collapsible steering column with padded steering wheel, and 3-point seatbelts; 1968 models gained <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1966, Cadillac had {{its best}} annual sales yet, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an {{increase}} of more than 60%. This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time. 1967 and 1968 saw {{the introduction of a}} host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, front shoulder belts, and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late 1967 (1968 model year), US-spec cars {{received}} several safety additions: a padded fascia (dashboard) with smaller main gauges, collapsible steering column, scissor-type hood hinges, a third windshield wiper, additional <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> and anti-burst door latches. The rear axle gear ratio was increased from 4.22:1 to 3.9:1, giving 16.5 mph for every 1000 rpm. This increased {{final drive ratio}} gave the 1275 model slightly better fuel economy than the 1098 model.|$|R
50|$|A {{batch of}} several hundred VH Charger 770 318 V8s were {{exported}} to Japan along with CH sedans. The Chargers had a CH-like nose with VH sheet metal surrounding the CH four headlights and grille, a combination that NZ assembler Todd Motors would later use to create its unique VJ Valiant Regal 770 sedan. The Japanese cars also had air conditioning, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> and separate white reversing lights as well as mirrors conforming to Japanese market regulations.|$|R
50|$|In February 1968, the S800M (aka S800MK2) was {{introduced}} with flush mounted interior door handles, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> outside, dual-circuit brakes, lean burn carburetion under the bonnet and safety glass. These {{changes were made}} for the American market, but the car was never imported there officially. Production ended in May 1970 with 11,536 S800s produced. Honda did not manufacture another S roadster for nearly thirty years until {{the release of the}} S2000 for the 2000 model year.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 {{model was}} {{redesigned}} with enhanced Coke bottle styling that featured Corvette-inspired {{front and rear}} fender bulges. The curves were the most pronounced with the 1967-1968 models. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> and shoulder belts for closed models. The L72 engine was not available in 1967, but a L36 Turbo-Jet V8 was optional.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, front and rear position lamps, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> and reflectors, turn signals, stop (brake) lamps, and reversing lamps. School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R
5000|$|The North American-spec {{version of}} the M {{roadster}} is visually {{very similar to the}} European version, but can be identified by its amber <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> (and turn signal lenses on cars built before September, 1998) in the front bumper, [...] "free form" [...] headlights in place of the ellipsoid units and twin side-mounted rear license plate illumination lights instead of the single bumper-mounted design. Later year US spec cars came stnadard with clear headlights and are visually indistinguishable from their European counterparts.|$|R
2500|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{continued}} to produce five well appointed 98 body styles. Standard equipment included: dual master cylinder, four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up <b>lights,</b> <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Engine displacement was increased to the Rocket [...] V8 with 365 horsepower. Ninety-Eight production was in Lansing.|$|R
50|$|As U.S. Federal {{safety rules}} {{increased}} throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Checkers kept pace and despite {{having the same}} basic body design, Checker enthusiasts can often identify the year of a Checker based on its safety equipment. For example, starting in 1963, amber parking/directional lights were used up front. 1964 models introduced lap belts in front, energy-absorbing steering columns came in 1967. 1968 models featured round <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> on fenders along with shoulder belts, and 1969s introduced headrests for front outboard seating positions.|$|R
