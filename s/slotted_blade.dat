Once the required pressure is reached, an internal spring is triggered, and the blade pushes the wire into the slot, simultaneously cutting the insulation and securing the wire. [...] The tool blade does not cut through the wire insulation to make contact, but rather the sharp edges of the slot in the contact post itself slice through the insulation.|$|E

It makes the magnitude {{and direction of the}} velocity change, and resulting in flow separation. The impact produced by flow separation causes the loss of the flow's energy. This paper takes the blade of G 4 - 73 No. 8 D centrifugal fan as the research object. The flow and aerodynamic characteristics of the blades under different incidence angles are analyzed and researched by means of CFD. The slotted technique on centrifugal fan blade with slots cut along the blades pressure side to suction side is adopted. And <b>slotted</b> <b>blade</b> models data are compared with generic models. The results show that the method to create a slot in blade can control the stall of centrifugal fan flow passage availably. And under the appropriate parameters, slotted model can decrease the blade surface resistance and increase lift force effectively. Slotted model also has a role of control and mitigation of boundary layer separation, improving blade aerodynamic performance observably. The slot plays a similar role as the balancing hole, and make the high pressure low speed fluid flow into low-pressure side where the fluid is accelerated and has no extra energy be consumed. The research shows that slotted technique on centrifugal fan blade is useful to improve the characteristics of blade surface flow field, resulting in significant energy saving...|$|E

The experimental test rig which concludes a centrifugal blower, pressure sensors and measurement instrumentations are design and constructed for the present work. The experimental study has been carried out by measuring the static pressure variation and pressure fluctuation for two cases of impeller (with and without slots). Measuring of static values has been completed at various points prepared on the front-wall of the volute casing along one path for two cases of impeller. Enhancement in pressure distribution adds <b>slots</b> to the <b>blades</b> comparison with cases without slots at values of mass flow rate between non-flow and 0. 02254 kg/s. The pressure fluctuations increase with decrease values of mass flow rates. We concluded also that pressure fluctuations decrease with adding <b>slots</b> to <b>blades.</b> This led to decrease occur of rotating stall phenomenon and increase stability of centrifugal blower. Numerical simulation has been carried out on present centrifugal blower to analyze both flow field and pressure fluctuations by using FLUENT 14 package.

Through an extensive 2 D-numerical study, the effects of location, width and slope of slots were analysed and the best configuration was identified. Based on the optimal slot, the 3 D aerodynamic performances of cascade were studied {{and the influence of}} slotted blading to control endwall flow was investigated. Both 2 D and 3 D calculations are performed on steady RANS solver with standard k-epsilon turbulence model and low Mach number regime. The total loss coefficient, turning angle and flow visualizations on the blade and end-wall surfaces are adopted to describe the different configurations. The obtained results show, for 2 D situation, that a maximum of 28. 3 % reduction in loss coefficient had been reached and the flow turning was increased with approximately 5 °. Concerning 3 D flow fields the slots marked their benefit at large incoming flow angles which delays the separation on both end wall and blade suction surface at mid span.

Seal <b>slots</b> in <b>blades</b> of compressors and turbines are one example. Manufacturers of EDM machine tools do not provide adapted technologies for processing γ-TiAl alloys, so end users are forced to configure and develop specific EDM processes by themselves.

To acquire this knowledge the interdependency of material, process-related parameters and productivity is examined. The analysis is focusing on two different γ-TiAl alloys...|$|R
