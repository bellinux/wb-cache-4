5|$|During the 20th century, {{blackbuck}} numbers declined sharply due {{to excessive}} hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. Some blackbucks are killed illegally especially {{where they are}} sympatric with nilgai. Until India's independence in 1947, blackbuck and chinkara were hunted in many princely states with <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> captive Asiatic cheetahs. By the 1970s, blackbuck were extinct in several areas. Nevertheless, populations in India have increased from 24,000 in the late 1970s to 50,000 in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The RLI {{was formed}} in February 1961 as a light {{infantry}} battalion made up exclusively of white recruits. After first seeing action in September 1961 on the Northern Rhodesian border with Katanga, it relocated to Cranborne Barracks, Salisbury the following year and remained there {{as part of the}} Southern Rhodesian Army after the Federation dissolved on 31 December 1963. Violent political intimidation of black Rhodesians by two rival communist-backed revolutionary parties, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), necessitated a <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> counter-insurgency unit, and the RLI was accordingly reformed into a commando regiment during 1964 and 1965 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Walls.|$|E

5|$|As the two armies {{faced the}} {{stalemate}} of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864, Burnside {{agreed to a}} plan suggested by a regiment of former coal miners in his corps, the 48th Pennsylvania: dig a mine under a fort named Elliot's Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough. The fort was destroyed on July 30 in {{what is known as}} the Battle of the Crater. Because of interference from Meade, Burnside was ordered, only hours before the infantry attack, not to use his division of black troops, which had been <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> for this mission. He was forced to use untrained white troops instead. He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement, so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{raised on}} a reduced scale of only two rifle companies, the battalion's {{personnel}} were mainly drawn from volunteers from other Army units—mostly the independent companies {{that had been set}} up in 1941–42 to carry out irregular warfare—and as a result, most of the battalion's personnel had seen active service prior to being accepted. These volunteers completed their parachute training with 1st Parachute Training Unit before joining the battalion, and upon completion of their training qualified to wear the maroon beret, which was adopted by the 1st Parachute Battalion as a symbol of their elite status. In April 1943, while based at Scheyville Farm, the battalion raised a troop of engineers. Consisting of six officers and 51 other ranks, the 1st Parachute Troop, Royal Australian Engineers, was <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> to undertake clandestine demolitions work alongside the battalion's rifle companies.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Bittrich's II SS Panzer Corps—comprising {{the remains}} of Walter Harzer's 9th SS and Heinz Harmel's 10th SS Panzer Divisions—had moved into the area north of Arnhem to refit and reorganise. Although badly mauled after {{escaping}} the Falaise pocket, the Korps {{was made up of}} seasoned veterans and made available significantly more forces to the Germans than the allies had been led to expect. The divisions were also <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> in anti-airborne operations; during their formation both divisions had undergone month-long anti airborne exercises whilst waiting for their heavy equipment, and had also spent the last 15 months studying the best reactions to a parachute attack in classroom and field exercises. The 9th SS had a Panzergrenadier brigade, a reconnaissance battalion, an artillery battalion, two batteries of self-propelled guns and a company of tanks. Exactly how many men were available after the withdrawal from Normandy is unclear. Some sources suggest that the 9th had up to 6,000 men, others suggest that the combined total of the 9th and 10th SS was only 6,000–7,000 men.|$|E

5|$|During the Principate {{period of}} the Roman Empire (30 BC – AD 284), the all-mounted alae ("wings") {{contained}} the elite cavalry of the army. They were <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> in elaborate manoeuvres, such as those displayed to the emperor Hadrian during a documented inspection in Numidia. They were best-suited for large-scale operations and battle, during which they {{acted as the primary}} cavalry escort for the legions, which had almost no cavalry of their own. Roman alares were normally armoured, with mail or scale body armour, a cavalry version of the infantry helmet (with more protective features, such as completely covered ears) and oval shield or hexagonal. Their weapons could be a lance, javelins, or bow and arrow but all Roman horseman had a sword called a (spatha) and the ubiquitous pugio. The elite status of an alaris is shown {{by the fact that he}} received 20% greater pay than his counterpart in an auxiliary cohort, and than a legionary infantryman.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich {{held the}} title of Chef des Sicherheitspolizei und SD (Chief of the Security Police and SD) until 27 September 1939, when he became chief of the newly {{established}} Reich Main Security Office (RSHA). From that point forward, the RSHA {{was in charge of}} SS security services. It had under its command the SD, Kripo, and Gestapo, as well as several offices to handle finance, administration, and supply. Heinrich Müller, who had been chief of operations for the Gestapo, was appointed Gestapo chief at this time. Arthur Nebe was chief of the Kripo, and the two branches of SD were commanded by a series of SS officers, including Otto Ohlendorf and Walter Schellenberg. The SD was considered an elite branch of the SS, and its members were better educated and typically more ambitious than those within the ranks of the Allgemeine SS. Members of the SD were <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> in criminology, intelligence, and counter-intelligence. They also gained a reputation for ruthlessness and unwavering commitment to Nazi ideology.|$|E
5|$|Some Commandos were {{designated}} for different tasks from the start. No. 2 Commando was always {{intended to be}} a parachute unit. In June 1940 they began parachute training and were re-designated the 11th Special Air Service (SAS) Battalion, which eventually became the 1st Parachute Battalion. After their re-designation a new No. 2 Commando was formed. Other Commandos were grouped together in a larger formation known as Layforce and sent to the Middle East. The Special Air Service and the Special Boat Squadron were formed from the survivors of Layforce. The men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando were <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> for operations in the Arctic Circle and specialised in using small boats and canoes to attack shipping. The joint service unit No. 30 Commando was formed for intelligence gathering. Its members were trained in the recognition of enemy documents, search techniques, safe cracking, prisoner handling, photography, and escape techniques.|$|E

Many officials themselves owned a large number of slaves, although the Sultan himself owned by far the largest amount.

5|$|The 2nd Panzer Army was {{monitoring}} the operation closely. The {{report of a}} special troop, which had been sent into the Partisans’ rear {{with the help of}} disguised Chetniks several days earlier, drew particular attention from Rendulic. According to this report, received late on 25 May, Tito was in the area of Potoci, halfway between Drvar and Ribnik. Rendulic ordered the commander of the 7th SS Division to immediately form a special company-strong detachment, with a mission to infiltrate behind the Partisan lines in order to kill Tito and destroy the Partisan Supreme Command. The detachment was formed on the night of 25/26 May from the 11th Company of the 13th SS Regiment, a number of pioneers, and a group of <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> personnel from the Brandenburg Division. As the detachment failed to penetrate into the Partisan territory that night, it tried again the following night.|$|E
5|$|To {{eliminate}} the North Korean {{threat in the}} UN rear, Almond ordered all X Corps units on Route 29 to launch aggressive patrols to destroy the North Korean supply bases and guerrilla bands. <b>Specially</b> <b>trained</b> irregular forces, such as X Corps' Special Action Group, also hunted North Korean units by operating as guerrillas themselves. The constant UN pressure slowly depleted the ammunition and the manpower of the KPA II Corps, while Major General Yu Jai Hung rallied the ROK III Corps and sealed the gap between Wonju and the east coast by January 22. On January 20, a patrol {{carried out by the}} US 9th Infantry Regiment of the US 2nd Infantry Division managed to reoccupy Wonju without much resistance. Lacking reinforcements and supplies, the KPA II Corps was scattered by the end of January, and only 8,600 soldiers from the KPA II Corps managed to survive and retreat back to North Korea. The KPA 10th Division, vanguard of the KPA II Corps, was also annihilated during the UN anti-guerrilla operations.|$|E
5|$|Volunteers {{from the}} Mexican Red Cross quickly went to {{disaster}} areas with {{search and rescue}} teams, including using <b>specially</b> <b>trained</b> dogs to search for hurricane victims trapped under muddy areas of Acapulco. By {{four days after the}} storm each team was finding one or two corpses per day, with officials stating the search could take weeks. In Guerrero, the teams rescued a total of 35people from hazard. Hours after the hurricane passed through the area, relief works traveled by boat through flooded areas to assist the worst-hit areas. The Red Cross provided food, water, clothing, blankets, water purification supplies, milk powder and other non-perishable foods, and medical supplies to those staying in government shelters in Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chiapas. The Mexican Red Cross also set up shelters to house and feed hundreds of displaced people, and by four days after the storm, the Red Cross distributed 100 tonnes of relief supplies to hurricane victims. Medical workers were also deployed to the area to aid the injured.|$|E
