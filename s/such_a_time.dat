5|$|The Association {{itself has}} a long history, and in fact predates Manor Hall being {{originally}} formed in 1925 as the ‘Elton House Old Students’ Association’ by Winifred Armstead. In 1932, when the ladies from Elton House relocated to the newly built Manor Hall, the Association was renamed accordingly. The Association {{is run by a}} committee of volunteers and was wound up pro tem in 2005 due to incumbent committee growing too old to continue its work with members being transferred to the Wills Hall Association until <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as new officers could be found to continue its work.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

And it had been hard to live, so. Without desire, without any movement of passionate love, only gripped back in recoil! That was an experience to endure.|$|R

25|$|To {{allow the}} {{government}} to act quickly {{in case of a}} major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the President is permitted to call extraordinary sessions of one or both Houses of Congress.

25|$|From 1960 to 1995, the northward equinox always fell at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> that New Year's Day in Iran {{occurred}} on the day called 21 March in the Western calendar. But this equivalence was not always true before March 1960, and the exact correspondence broke down again in 1996.

In 1996, and subsequent Gregorian leap years, Iranian New Year's Day falls on 20 March. The pattern will shift back to a matching set of leap years in AD 2096.|$|E

25|$|Cao Cao had {{originally}} wanted {{to follow up}} his victory over Yuan Shao by turning south to attack Liu Biao and Sun Quan, the latter who had newly inherited his domain from his deceased brother Sun Ce. Cao Cao's strategist Xun Yu cautioned against such action, reasoning that Cao Cao should {{take the opportunity to}} settle the matter with Yuan Shao, who was now facing internal turmoil after his recent defeat. Xun Yu also realized the danger of turning the focus to the south at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> since the remnants of Yuan Shao's men might band up and attack Cao Cao's rear.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 10 May, Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. Chamberlain {{initially}} felt that a change of government at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> would be inappropriate, but upon being given confirmation that Labour would not serve under him, he announced to the War Cabinet his intention to resign. Scarcely more than three days after he had opened the debate, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to resign as Prime Minister. (Despite resigning as PM, he continued {{to be the leader}} of the Conservative Party.) He explained to the King why Halifax (who, the King thought, was the obvious candidate) did not want to become Prime Minister. The King then sent for Churchill and asked him to form a new government; according to Churchill, there was no stipulation that it must be a coalition government.|$|E
25|$|The halachic equinox usually jumps a day every century {{because the}} {{algorithm}} that established the Gregorian calendar dictates that leap years {{do not occur}} in years divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400. Jewish law, however, provides no means for changing the established calendar until <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as the Sanhedrin might be reconvened, and compensates for it by moving {{the date of the}} equinox almost every century. There was no shift between 1909 and 2009, however, because of the exception regarding years divisible by 400; thus, the year 2000 did contain a February 29 and no compensation was necessary. The table at right depicts all the vernal equinoxes from 1981 to 2009, two years in which Birkat Hachama occurs; note that the equinox does not occur at sunset (time=0) on the fourth day (Tuesday) any other years in the entire 28-year cycle.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2005, Karam {{released}} a new single and video clip called Shu Jani. Shu Jani was a contemporary pop song, with the use of traditional Lebanese instruments. The video was filmed in the Faraya ski resort in Lebanon by director Sa'aed el-Marouk. It was to be on her upcoming 2005 album. The timing of the new clip was criticised in some tabloids, because it was released during the tense electoral season in Lebanon, and the so-called Cedar Revolution (Independence Intifada). It was argued by these tabloids that it was disrespectful for Karam to release new material at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Karam defended herself by putting the claim on her Saudi production company, Rotana, who she says fast tracked the release against her wishes. Even though there was some controversy surrounding Shu Jani, it fared well with the public.|$|E
25|$|Turning to {{the years}} before Zumárraga's death, there is no known {{document}} securely dated to the period 1531 to 1548 which mentions Juan Diego, a cult to the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, or the Guadalupe event. The lack of any contemporary evidence linking Zumárraga with the Guadalupe event is particularly noteworthy, but, of the surviving documents attributable to him, only his will {{can be said to}} be just such a document as might have been expected to mention an ermita or the cult. In this will Zumárraga left certain movable and personal items to the cathedral, to the infirmary of the monastery of St. Francis, and to the Conceptionist convent (all in Mexico City); divided his books between the library of the monastery of St Francis in Mexico City and the guesthouse of a monastery in his home-town of Durango, Spain; freed his slaves and disposed of his horses and mules; made some small bequests of corn and money; and gave substantial bequests in favour of two charitable institutions founded by him, one in Mexico City and one in Veracruz. Even without any testamentary notice, Zumárraga's lack of concern for the ermita at Tepeyac is amply demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} building said to have been erected there in 1531 was, at best, a simple adobe structure, built in two weeks and not replaced until 1556 (by Archbishop Montúfar, who built another adobe structure on the same site). Among the factors which might explain a change of attitude by Zumárraga to a cult which he seemingly ignored after his return from Spain in October 1534, the most prominent is a vigorous inquisition conducted by him between 1536 and 1539 specifically to root out covert devotion among Indians to pre-Christian deities. The climax of the sixteen trials in this period (involving 27 mostly high-ranking Indians) was the burning at the stake of Don Carlos Ometochtli, lord of the wealthy and important city of Texcoco, in 1539 – an event so fraught with potential for social and political unrest that Zumárraga was officially reprimanded by the Council of the Indies in Spain and subsequently relieved of his inquisitorial functions (in 1543). In such a climate and at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as that he can hardly have shown favour to a cult which had been launched without any prior investigation, had never been subjected to a canonical inquiry, and was focussed on a cult object with particular appeal to Indians at a site arguably connected with popular devotion to a pre-Christian female deity. Leading Franciscans were notoriously hostile to – or at best suspicious of – Guadalupe throughout the second half of the 16th century precisely on the grounds of practices arguably syncretic or worse. This is evident in the strong reaction evinced in 1556 when Zumárraga's successor signified his official support for the cult by rebuilding the ermita, endowing the sanctuary, and establishing a priest there the previous year (see next sub-section). It is reasonable to conjecture that had Zumárraga shown any similar partiality for the cult from 1534 onwards (in itself unlikely, given his role as Inquisitor from 1535), he would have provoked a similar public rebuke.|$|E
500|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} siege of Demmin, {{a contingent of}} crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack Pomerania instead.
