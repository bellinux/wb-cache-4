5|$|By 1911, two dams {{had been}} {{constructed}} on Glen Brook (a subtributary of Briar Creek) in Briar Creek Township two {{miles north of}} Berwick. In 1911, the first dam, known as Number One, had a capacity of 15 million gallons. The second dam, known as Number Two, had a capacity of 7.5 million gallons. In 1911, a third dam was under construction <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> downstream of the two aforementioned dams. It was intended to have a capacity of 23.8 million gallons.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{divide the}} iron-bearing rocks {{of the eastern}} Mesabi Iron Range into several layers. The four main divisions, from the top down, are the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty and Lower Cherty. Below these are {{quartzite}} and granite, and Virginia Slate and Duluth gabbro lie above. The slate is from 50 to <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> thick, and the four iron-bearing layers are from 400 to 600 feet thick.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet.</b> It took workers several days to clean the buildings and remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|The east face of Steens Mountain is {{composed}} mainly of basalts stacked one upon another. Lava flows <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>feet</b> thick inundated the region between 17 and 14 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The river {{runs into}} the Cuyahoga River in Sagamore Hills Township near the now-abandoned Jaite Paper Mill. Discharge volume is {{extremely}} seasonal, usually a few cubic feet per second, and peaking at <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> cubic <b>feet</b> per second under flood conditions.|$|R
50|$|Brickell Financial Centre Phase II, {{which was}} {{scheduled}} for completion in 2011, {{would have been the}} tallest building in Miami and Florida upon completion, at 903 feet (275 m). It was planned to contain 68 floors. The Brickell Financial Centre complex was always planned to be done in two phases, with the second building being constructed after the first, so the second building may still be built, presumably under a different, new name. The second phase was planned to be a mixed-use building, containing <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand <b>feet</b> of office space, as well as <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand <b>feet</b> of condominium and hotel space, and would be a substantially larger building than the Brickell World Plaza. The area where BFC II would stand was turned into a parking lot in late 2011 with the completion of Brickell World Plaza and included a small valet structure.|$|R
5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> in the air, with wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} motor {{was equipped with}} <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When the engine was tested, it gave very good results, {{and is now in}} use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in Ampere, New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric fire engine of the same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient.|$|E
5|$|The land {{upon which}} Avery Point Light was {{constructed}} {{was owned by}} Morton F. Plant's estate; his Branford Manor is located <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> away. Twenty four years after Plant's death the estate was sold {{to the state of}} Connecticut before being transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's deed required the construction and maintenance of beacon lights or other navigational aids as part of the Coast Guard's new training facility. The Avery Point Light was named for Captain James Avery of New London, Connecticut.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the great}} glaciers of the north, then, are {{continually}} {{moving down the}} valleys, of course their ends are pushed into the sea. These ends, or tongues, are often <b>hundreds</b> of <b>feet</b> thick. In some places they present a clear glittering wall to the sea of <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>feet</b> in height, with perhaps as much again lost to view down in the deep water. As the extremities of these tongues are shoved farther and farther out they chip off and float away. These chips are ice-bergs! I have already said that ice-bergs are sometimes miles in extent--like islands; that they sink seven or eight <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> below the surface, while their tops rise more than a <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> above it--like mountains. If these, then, are the [...] "chips" [...] of the Greenland glaciers, what must the [...] "old blocks" [...] be? ...|$|R
50|$|For {{most of the}} year, the Escalante River is a small stream, easily stepped across or waded. During spring runoff and {{the summer}} monsoon, however, the river can become a raging, muddy torrent ten to one hundred times bigger. In some years, the river can be run using kayaks or canoes (rafts are too large), but this {{requires}} both good timing — water which is too high or too low can make travel impossible, stranding boaters — and the willingness to portage boats <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> vertical <b>feet</b> {{at the end of}} the trip.|$|R

Unaware of the sabotage against the Orbital Disintegration Cannon the President realizes the racers are on the planet after the cannon fails, and sends his troops en masse at the racers. The President becomes increasingly desperate as the racers evade them and approach the mine-laden Zone XXXXXXX (pronounced, [...] "Seven-Ex"), lair of a secret illegal biological weapon named 'Funky Boy' (a derogatory of someone with a terminal odor) who awakens from its stasis as the racers and the rebellious miners converge on it. With the <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>foot</b> tall Funky Boy awakening and subsequent destruction of the base coinciding with the orbital cannon coming back online, the President orders Funky Boy fired upon. The explosion takes out most of the Roboworld troops while JP pushes to right his overturned car off its side.

5|$|Upon leaving Sullivan County, West Branch Fishing Creek enters Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. Immediately after {{entering}} Columbia County, the creek {{flows through the}} community of Elk Grove. It flows east-southeast for a short distance before reaching the communities of Central and Jamison City. The creek then makes a sharp turn south and flows between Central Mountain and Huckleberry Mountain and into a plain. After some distance, it turns southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 118. <b>Several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> downstream, it and East Branch Fishing Creek merge to form Fishing Creek.|$|E
5|$|Mug House {{is located}} on Wetherill Mesa; it {{contains}} 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House {{is one of the}} stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.|$|E
5|$|The {{thousands}} of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations {{to the thousands}} left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to several days of power outages. By {{three weeks after the}} hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai. By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well. One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane. Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in Poipu, where the hurricane flooded areas <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> inland. Hurricane Iniki struck the same area ten years later. Officials estimate a hurricane similar to Iwa striking Oahu in 1992 could cause up to $7.5billion in damage (USD).|$|E

5|$|This 150-year period next saw the {{eruption}} of less silica-rich lava {{in the form of}} andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers. Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank. Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit. Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with talus. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, about 1647. The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout the 1970s, {{the theater}} was {{operated}} as [...] "The Victory Theater". It staged legitimate theatrical shows, rock concerts and movies. The theatre was {{also home to}} the nationally-known Dayton Ballet Company. A mainstay through the period was its screening of [...] "Midnight Movies", offered by a local independent producer, on Friday and Saturday nights that drew a, largely, teen audience for films with counter-cultural themes. [...] During revitalization efforts in the late 1970s, the stage manager, Gary Kuzkin, overhauled much of the stage's technical capabilities. Crews from the Stagehands Union (IATSE) local restored much of the theatre's ancient hemp-and-sandbag fly galley, replacing <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand <b>feet</b> of rope—along with miles of electrical wiring.|$|R

When the Commission counsel pressed him to be more specific, Tague testified that he was wounded by the second shot. When the Commission counsel asked Tague where he sensed was the source of the gunshots, Tague testified the shots were fired and [...] "coming from my left," [...] "by the, whatever you call the monument," [...] which was the area of the North Pergola Monument that is located on the north grassy knoll, <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>feet</b> apart from and west of the Book Depository building.|$|R
50|$|Edwardsville High School {{was first}} located on North Kansas Street in {{downtown}} Edwardsville, and today that building is Columbus Elementary School, with <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>feet</b> of {{space on the}} third floor which is used primarily as additional District 7 offices. The second Edwardsville High School was completed in 1925. It was expanded over the years creating a labyrinth of halls to form what is today Lincoln Middle School, on 145 West Street. The current Edwardsville High School complex was completed in 1996 by the Korte Company of Highland, Illinois, and is located by the intersection of Illinois Route 157 and Center Grove Road, near the entrance to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, the largest university in the U.S. In terms of property space. While the current building was completed in 1996, it sat empty and unused until 1997 because the brick facing used on the building was lighter than what had been asked for in the design.|$|R
25|$|The Saint John River itself {{flows into}} the Bay of Fundy through a narrow gorge <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> wide at {{the centre of the}} city. It {{contains}} a unique phenomenon called the Reversing Falls where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.|$|E
25|$|Iowa is {{generally}} not flat; {{most of the state}} consists of rolling hills. Iowa can be divided into eight landforms based on glaciation, soils, topography, and river drainage. Loess hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> thick. Northeast Iowa along the Mississippi River is part of the Driftless Zone, consisting of steep hills and valleys which appear almost mountainous.|$|E
25|$|Trains often raced {{one another}} {{so as to}} be the first to arrive at their destination. Racing was {{encouraged}} by the fact that in many areas, the two lines were only <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> apart.

50|$|The {{home was}} very modern for its time. It had {{electric}} lighting throughout, an internal bell system for calling the staff, a central vacuum system, and radiator and forced air heating. Originally {{the home was}} designed with an elevator in it; however, during construction {{it was decided to}} instead use the elevator shaft to increase the size of the safes. With time this would prove to be an important choice. The main safe on the second floor encompasses <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>feet</b> of storage. All the safes were provided by the Mosler Safe Company of Cincinnati Ohio. The mansion featured several prized woods including, African mahogany, birds eye maple, and teak. Several of the rooms had large murals hand painted on silk. The first floor dining room had an Italianate scene, the library had a depiction of the birth of Christ from Ben Hur, and the breakfast room had a sunrise motif.|$|R
50|$|The red warbler is an insectivore. It gleans {{primarily}} in understory shrubs at low to middle levels, moving slowly and deliberately through more open {{areas of the}} vegetation, and feeding with quick jabs into cracks in bark and pine needle clusters. It sometimes hover gleans to feed at pine needle clusters. Though it lacks any obvious adaptations for climbing, it regularly does so in its search for prey items on bark and epiphytes on branches, often hanging head-down as it probes. In areas of deciduous growth, it typically flycatches, making brief aerial sorties from a perch in pursuit of flying insects. While it seldom associates with mixed-species flocks, it feeds alongside other birds with no signs of conflict, displaying no hostility towards other species with which it competes. Its foraging area is quite small, often amounting to only a few dozen square meters (<b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>feet)</b> per day. Late in the afternoon, its rate of foraging declines, and it rests, often taking brief naps, in the forest understory. Though it does not generally feed after sunset, it may do so {{to take advantage of}} transient food sources, such as hatching Neuroptera.|$|R
60|$|From {{this place}} the {{squatter}} found the ascent still difficult, partly by nature and partly by artificial impediments, {{until he reached}} a sort of terrace, or, to speak more properly, the plain of the elevation, where he had established the huts in which the whole family dwelt. These tenements were, as already mentioned, of that class which are so often seen on the borders, and such as belonged to the infancy of architecture; being simply formed of logs, bark, and poles. The area on which they stood contained <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>feet,</b> and was sufficiently elevated above the plain greatly to lessen if not to remove all danger from Indian missiles. Here Ishmael believed he might leave his infants in comparative security, {{under the protection of}} their spirited mother, and here he now found Esther engaged at her ordinary domestic employments, surrounded by her daughters, and lifting her voice, in declamatory censure, as one or another of the idle fry incurred her displeasure, and far too much engrossed with the tempest of her own conversation to know any thing of the violent scene which had been passing below.|$|R
