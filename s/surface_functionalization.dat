The structured silane monolayers on silicon oxide substrates were fabricated {{by a combination of}} liquid- and gas-phase deposition of different trialkoxysilanes with a photolithographic patterning technique. By using this method various types of <b>surface</b> <b>functionalizations</b> such as regions with amino functions next to areas of the bare silica surface or positively charged regions of a quaternary ammonium silane surrounded by a hydrophobic octaclecylsilane film could be obtained. Furthermore, a triethoxysilane with a photoprotected amino group was synthesized, which allowed direct photopatterning after monolayer preparation, leading to free NH 2 groups at the irradiated regions. The different silane monolayer patterns were used to study the surface assembly behavior of carboxylated methacrylate particles by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In dependence of the assembly conditions (different <b>surface</b> <b>functionalizations,</b> pH, and drying conditions), a selective preference of the particles for a specific surface type versus others was found. Site-specific colloid adsorption could be observed also on the photosensitive silane layers after local deprotection with light.

40|$|The {{miniaturization}} {{and integration}} of assay processes in lab-on-chip devices is a key challenge for point-of-care diagnostics. Assay processes based on magnetic particles are particularly suited for miniaturization and integration, because the particles can be actively controlled using external magnetic fields. Here we study the interaction of magnetic particles with fluid-fluid interfaces. We use a magnetic tweezers setup to apply a well-controlled mechanical torque using out-of-plane rotating magnetic fields. The particle position at the interface {{is controlled by the}} particle-surface functionalization and it is measured using z-stack particle imaging. Out-of-plane rotation induces an asymmetric deformation of the interface due to contact line pinning and eventually a contact line displacement. By reconstructing the angular trajectory of the particle and by comparison with numerical simulations, we quantify the interface deformation and contact line friction forces on the microparticle surfaces.

30|$|Carvacrol, an {{aromatic}} terpenic compound, {{known to}} be antimicrobial was grafted onto gold surfaces via two strategies based on newly-synthesized cross-linkers involving either an ester bond which can be cleaved by microbial esterases, or a covalent ether link. <b>Surface</b> <b>functionalizations</b> were characterized at each step by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). The two functionalized gold samples both led {{to a loss of}} culturability of the yeast Candida albicans, higher than 65 %, indicating that the activity of the freshly-designed surfaces was probably due to still covalently immobilized carvacrol. On the contrary, when a phenyl group replaced the terpenic moiety, the yeast culturability increased by about 30 %, highlighting the specific activity of carvacrol grafted on the surfaces. Confocal microscopy analyses showed that the mode of action of the functionalized surfaces with the ester or the ether of carvacrol was, in both cases, fungicidal and not anti-adhesive.

50|$|Silica {{membranes}} are mesoporous {{and can be}} {{made with}} high uniformity (the same structure throughout the membrane). The high porosity of these membranes gives them very high permeabilities. Synthesized membranes have smooth surfaces and can be modified on the surface to drastically improve selectivity. Functionalizing silica membrane surfaces with amine containing molecules (on the surface silanol groups) allows the membranes to separate CO2 from flue gas streams more effectively. <b>Surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> (and thus chemistry) can be tuned to be more efficient for wet flue gas streams as compared to dry flue gas streams. While previously, silica membranes were impractical due to their technical scalability and cost (they are very difficult to produce in an economical manner on a large scale), there have been demonstrations of a simple method of producing silica membranes on hollow polymeric supports. These demonstrations indicate that economical materials and methods can effectively separate CO2 and N2. Ordered mesoporous silica membranes have shown considerable potential for surface modification that allows for ease of CO2 separation. <b>Surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> with amines leads to the reversible formation of carbamates (during CO2 flow), increasing CO2 selectivity significantly.|$|E

Second, a hydrophobic coating was used to concentrate the analyte adsorbed on gold colloidal nanoparticles, thus increasing the sensitivity of the measurement by an order of magnitude. In this experiment, Au nanoparticles and analyte were mixed just before SERS measurements and were concentrated by drop-drying on the super-hydrophobic b-Si.
