5000|$|Inadimplenti non est adimplendum : [...] "One has no need {{to respect}} his {{obligation}} if the counter-party has not respected his own." [...] This is used in civil law to briefly indicate a principle (adopted in some systems) {{referred to as the}} <b>synallagmatic</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{civil law}} systems, a <b>synallagmatic</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> is a contract {{in which each}} party to the contract is bound to provide something to the other party. [...] Its name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek συνάλλαγμα (synallagma), meaning mutual agreement. Examples of synallagmatic contracts include contracts of sale, of service, or of hiring.|$|E
50|$|The English {{contracts}} scholar Richard Austen-Baker {{has suggested}} that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a consensus ad idem ("agreement to the same thing") which is an undoubted requirement of <b>synallagmatic</b> <b>contracting,</b> and that this confusion {{may be the result of}} recent ignorance of Latin.|$|R
40|$|<b>Synallagmatic</b> <b>contracts</b> {{represents}} the category that fits most contracts and is, first and foremost, characterized, {{by the fact}} that these contracts present certain specific effects which, with the exception for non-performance, constitute a means of defense available for the party who is claiming nonperformance by the other party but has not accomplished its own obligations. The New Civil Code, following the opinions formulated in the doctrine under the authority of the Civil Code from 1864, legislatively consecrates this institution, for the first time, under Art. 1556. Despite the clear specification of the indicated norm, recently, opinions following the French doctrine have been expressed especially regarding the field of exception for non-performance, to which we do not acquiesce, even if a part of Romanian doctrine has approved the latter. Our opinion is based primarily on the legal interpretation of the new legal provisions but also on “traditional” approaches of the old regulations concerning performance, which interested both theoreticians and legal practitioners. Our study shows that the old regulations as well as the interpretations to where the law did not state were not clearly formulated, allowing for different interpretations...|$|R
50|$|<b>Synallagmatic</b> or {{reciprocal}} <b>contracts</b> {{are subject}} to the principle of reciprocity. In terms of this principle, a party is not entitled to claim performance of a reciprocal obligation from another party where the former has to perform his obligation first or simultaneously, unless he has already performed or is tendering performance of his obligation. If, in a basic example, Warne sells a car to Cullinan, and Cullinan has not {{the money to pay for}} it, Warne may refuse to hand over the car. In contracts of mandate, similarly, to a real-estate agent claiming commission before the sale of a house, one may deploy the exceptio to refute her claim for specific performance.|$|R
50|$|This {{unilateral}} contract (between A M Satterthwaite (shippers and original plaintiffs)) and the stevedores (NZ Shipping Co Ltd) was activated by performance (unloading of the drill) and {{relied on the}} pre-existing contractual obligation between the stevedores and the carrier to provide good consideration; {{at the point of}} performance the {{unilateral contract}} become a mutual (<b>synallagmatic)</b> <b>contract</b> (see Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada (CI) Ltd).|$|E
40|$|In this paper,we {{are debating}} {{the problem of}} the {{relationship}} between the civil juristic document and the contract. The civil juristic document was defined as [...] . „a manifestation of will with the intention of producing juristic effects, meaning the birth, change and cancel of an concrete civil juristic relation ” or … “the manifestation of will occurred for the realization of juristic effects materialized in the creation, the change, the transfer or the canceling of an concrete civil juristic relation ” (Art. 1166 C. civ.). The contract was defined 1 in the doctrine as the agreement of a will between two or more persons for the purpose of producing juristic effects, in other words giving birth, changing, transferring or canceling juristic relations. The contract is the main form of the juristic act, and the new civil code made the classification from more points of view (art. 1171 - 1177) in <b>synallagmatic</b> and unilateral <b>contracts,</b> contracts with onerous title and contracts with costless title, contracts with immediate or successive fulfillment, named or no-named contracts, consensual, solemn and real contracts, etc...|$|R
