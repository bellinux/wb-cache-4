September 15, 1961, the National Conference of Standards Laboratories (NCSL) was formally established with NBS as its sponsor.

5000|$|It was contended {{on behalf}} of the {{plaintiff}} that any amendment of the Treaties establishing the Communities made after 1 January 1973, when Ireland joined those Communities would require a further amendment of the Constitution. It was contended {{on behalf of}} the defendants that the authorisation contained in the first sentence of Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 was to join Communities which were established by Treaties as dynamic and developing entities and that it should be interpreted as authorising the State to participate in and agree to amendments of the Treaties which are within the original <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of the Treaties. It is the opinion of the Court that the first sentence in Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 of the Constitution must be construed as an authorisation given to the State not only to join the Communities as they stood in 1973, but also to join in amendments of the Treaties so long as such amendments do not alter the essential scope or objectives of the Communities. To hold that the first sentence of Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 does not authorise any form of amendment to the Treaties after 1973 without a further amendment of the Constitution would be too narrow a construction; to construe it as an open-ended authority to agree, without further amendment of the Constitution, to any amendment of the Treaties would be too broad.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of four EU regions’ European policies and programmes. It evaluates {{the extent to which}} regions’ European engagement is targeted to achieving regional economic development {{on the one hand and}} European social integration and identity construction on the other hand. The analysis starts with a comparative evaluation of the four case study regions’ European policies and is substantiated by the findings of over 60 interviews with regional political elites and civil servants in the four case study regions: Germany’s Brandenburg; Belgium’s Wallonia; France’s Nord – Pas de Calais; and the South West of England. This thesis advances a more comprehensive understanding of regional governments as European actors, whether political elites and civil servants aim to promote European identity-building through their policies, as well as which regional characteristics further impact the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of their European policies. This thesis provides evidence-based answers to the research question posed: What are the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of regions’ European policies and what role does European identity play in them? The thesis research has grown out of the context of regions’ EU integration; the multi-level governance approach; the increase of regions’ political authority vis-à-vis European politics; and the uncertainty on whether regional political actors (political elites and civil servants) aim to foster a European identity. Research has not yet observed, compared and analysed the objectives of regions’ European policies in terms of European identity-building. This thesis research has taken an important step in pioneering this area of research by undertaking case studies in four EU regions...|$|E
40|$|Metamodels {{have proven}} {{be very useful}} {{when it comes to}} {{reducing}} the computational requirements of Evolutionary Algorithm-based optimization by acting as quick-solving surrogates for slow-solving fitness functions. The relationship between metamodel <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> function varies between applications, that is, in some cases the metamodel acts as a surrogate for the whole fitness function, whereas in other cases it replaces only a component of the fitness function. This paper presents a formalized qualitative process to evaluate a fitness function to determine the most suitable metamodel scope so as to increase the likelihood of calibrating a high-fidelity metamodel and hence obtain good optimization results in a reasonable amount of time. The process is applied to the risk-based optimization of water distribution systems; a very computationally-intensive problem for real-world systems. The process is validated with a simple case study (modified New York Tunnels) and the power of metamodelling is demonstrated on a real-world case study (Pacific City) with a computational speed-up of several orders of magnitude...|$|R
