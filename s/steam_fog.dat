5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
25|$|Sea smoke, {{also called}} <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> or {{evaporation}} fog, {{is the most}} localized form and is created by cold air passing over warmer water or moist land. It often causes freezing fog, or sometimes hoar frost.|$|E
500|$|A {{precondition}} {{for the formation}} of steam devils is the presence of a layer of moist air on the water with the misty air (called arctic <b>steam</b> <b>fog)</b> being drawn upwards into fog streamers (non-rotating columns of <b>steam</b> <b>fog).</b> [...] For this to happen the body of water must be unfrozen, and thus relatively warm, and there must be some wind of cold, dry air to form the fog. [...] The cold air is warmed by the water and is humidified by evaporation. [...] The warmed air begins to rise, and as it does so is cooled adiabatically by the falling pressure causing the water vapour content to condense out into fog streamers.|$|E

500|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> {{tends to}} form {{irregular}} hexagonal {{cells in the}} horizontal plane which are elongated {{in the direction of}} the wind. [...] In this honeycomb arrangement, three cells meet at a junction, and it is in these places that the steam devils form. [...] This effect of vortex formation at the vertices of hexagonal cells is an example of vertex vortices.Zurn-Birkhimer et al., p.2431 ...|$|E
500|$|The {{layer of}} cumulus seen above steam devils during cold air {{outbreaks}} on Lake Michigan and elsewhere {{may not be}} coincidental. [...] Airborne radar studies during cold air outbreaks on the lake have shown that some steam devils penetrate through the thermal internal boundary layer (below which convective circulation takes place) and may be more significant for thermal mixing than normal convection, transporting moist air vertically above the convection boundary. [...] The resulting large scale view is a layer of arctic <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> close to the water surface, a layer of cumulus just above the convection boundary and a regular array of steam devils joining the two.|$|E
500|$|Small steam devils {{occur at}} some of the larger hot springs in Yellowstone Park where a layer of <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> hangs over the pools and wind can start to lift it up into fog streamers. [...] One such example is the Grand Prismatic Spring in the Yellowstone Midway Geyser Basin. [...] The air {{temperature}} can be high in terms of human comfort when the steam devils form. [...] In 1982 a cluster of seventeen steam devils was observed when the air temperature was between 17 and 21°C. [...] Although this is much higher than, for instance, the temperature of the air over the Great Lakes, the water temperature is also proportionately higher, being very close to boiling, so the temperature difference is still 79°C.|$|E
25|$|In April 1908, Irresistible {{transferred}} to the Channel Fleet, where she collided with a schooner while <b>steaming</b> in <b>fog</b> on 4 May 1908, suffering no damage. She {{was assigned to the}} Nore Division in 1909, and was reduced to a nucleus crew in May 1910. Her Channel Fleet service ended on 1 June 1910, when she paid off at Chatham Dockyard for a refit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} enquiry {{found that}} the commanding officer, Lieutenant William Speke, had failed to exercise proper precautions while <b>steaming</b> in <b>fog.</b> In particular, he had not ensured that an accurate record of the courses steered was maintained. He was reprimanded. The navigating officer, Sub-Lieutenant Kenneth Mackenzie Grieve, was informed that he had [...] "incurred their Lordships' displeasure", having inserted the missing data into the log following the wreck.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 the {{lighthouse}} board {{decided that a}} manned light was required, and in 1903 obtained a $75,000 appropriation. Construction was protracted: the crib and concrete pier foundation were not completed until 1905. Atop this was erected a three story octagonal brick house with a tower in the center to hold a fourth order Fresnel lens. The original <b>steam</b> whistle <b>fog</b> signal was replaced with diaphone foghorns in the mid-1920s. The new tower was placed at {{the eastern edge of}} the reef, and upon its activation the old beacon was abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|Evaporation fog or <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> forms over {{bodies of}} water overlain by much colder air; this {{situation}} {{can also lead to}} steam devils forming. [...] Lake effect fog is of this type, sometimes in combination with other causes like radiation fog. [...] It tends to differ from most advective fog formed over land in that it is, like lake-effect snow, a convective phenomenon, resulting in fog which can be quite a bit denser, deeper, and looks fluffy from above. [...] Most other fog is stratiform; steam devils, which look like their dust counterparts, are often seen in this situation.|$|E

5000|$|Artistic use of <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> was pioneered in the {{collaborative}} Center Beam artwork by the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT. First shown in 1977 at documenta 6 in Kassel, Germany, it included steam works by Joan Brigham, Otto Piene, and Paul Earls. For Center Beam, a low pressure hot water <b>steam</b> <b>fog</b> became a medium to project lasers, holograms, films and text onto.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} morning of 29 May 1914, Storstad {{collided}} with the RMS Empress of Ireland in the Saint Lawrence River near Pointe-au-Père, while both ships were <b>steaming</b> through <b>fog,</b> tearing a 14 ft hole in the Empresss starboard side. The Empress capsized and sank in just 14 minutes, killing 1,012 of her passengers and crew. There were 465 survivors. On duty {{at the time was}} Chief Officer Alfred Toftenes. Storstad did not sink and stood by to assist with rescue before limping into the port of Quebec with minor damage to her bow.|$|R
50|$|In 1880 {{the light}} keeper erected a fence around {{the station in}} order to reduce {{drifting}} snow and sand, which were making access to the property difficult at times; this was supplemented in 1892 with a network of wooden walkways joining the various station buildings. More substantial changes commenced in 1895 {{with the addition of a}} <b>steam</b> whistle <b>fog</b> signal, which was replaced in 1929 with a diaphone horn; at the same time the beacon was converted from kerosene to electricity. A wooden house was erected for an assistant keeper in 1898; this was replaced by a red brick duplex in 1910.|$|R
2500|$|Irresistible was {{commissioned}} at Chatham Dockyard on 4 February 1902 by Captain George Morris Henderson and a complement of 870 officers and men for Mediterranean Fleet service.

In May 1902 she visited Augusta, Sicily, and in August that year Piraeus. She suffered two mishaps during her years in the Mediterranean, colliding with the Norwegian merchant steamer [...] while <b>steaming</b> in <b>fog</b> {{on her way to}} her commission on 3 March 1902, sustaining considerable side-plate damage, and running aground at Malta on 5 October 1905.

5000|$|Frequent {{and oppressive}} fog made the passage hazardous; and also made duty {{at the light}} to be {{considered}} a hardship in an extremely lonely and forbidding place. [...] A fog bell signal was installed in 1862. In 1864 it was replaced by a foghorn. In 1875 it was converted to a <b>steam</b> powered <b>fog</b> siren. In 1880 a separate fog building was built for a [...] "duplicate" [...] fog siren. This began a 10 in steam whistle and new building in 1900 (which still exists near water's edge). [...] In 1904, there came a realization that the whistles were [...] "less than effective' and they were replaced by dual diaphones. [...] The horns made living there difficult; fertilized eggs would be destroyed by the sounds.|$|R

2500|$|Emmy was the ship's cat on [...] She was {{an orange}} tabby cat who {{never missed a}} voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy jumped ship while in port in Quebec City.
