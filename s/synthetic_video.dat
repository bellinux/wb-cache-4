40|$|Traditionally, Markovian {{models have}} been used to {{statistically}} represent variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic. These models exhibit short-range dependence (SRD). However, recent measurements show that VBR video traffic possesses self-similar characteristics, meaning that long-range dependence (LRD) in the traffic stream lasts much longer than traditional models can capture. This paper investigates the relative performance impacts of SRD and LRD in VBR video traffic, by conducting a simulation study using four sets of VBR video data: (1) a real video trace, with both SRD and LRD, (2) a <b>synthetic</b> <b>video</b> trace with only LRD, (3) a <b>synthetic</b> <b>video</b> trace with only SRD, and (4) a <b>synthetic</b> <b>video</b> trace without SRD and LRD. The performance study suggests that video traffic models must capture both SRD and LRD. 1 Introduction Variable bit rate (VBR) video is expected {{to become one of the}} major applications used on high-speed networks such as ATM-based B-ISDN [Huang et al., 1995], [Heyman and [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the efficient temporal propagation of correspondences between frames of two video sequences, an integral component of many video processing tasks. The main contribution of the paper is a framework for the recursive propagation of these correspondences. The propagation consists of a time update step and a measurement update step. The time update depends only on the dynamics of the rotating source cameras, while the measurement update can be tailored to any member of a general class of image correspondence algorithms. Using these results, the correspondence between points of each frame pair can be propagated and updated in a fraction of the time required to estimate correspondences anew at every frame. We discuss an application of the recursive correspondence propagation framework to the creation of virtual video. Previous virtual view algorithms have been used to generate <b>synthetic</b> <b>video</b> of a static scene, in which objects seem frozen in time. In contrast, the algorithms described here allow the creation of "true" virtual video, {{in the sense that the}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>video</b> evolves dynamically along with the scene. While virtual video is our motivating application, the recursive correspondence propagation framework applies to any two-camera video application in which correspondence is difficult and prohibitively time-consuming to estimate by processing frame pairs independently. 2.

We adopt a spread-spectrum approach for watermark embedding, i. e., the watermark is inserted by perturbing some of the significant wavelet coefficients.

Among the filters examined the 9 / 7 F filter achieves the best performance. 1...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{learning}} for human action recognition in videos is making significant progress, but is slowed down by its dependency on expensive manual labeling of large video collections. In this work, we investigate {{the generation of}} synthetic training data for action recognition, as it has recently shown promising results {{for a variety of}} other computer vision tasks. We propose an interpretable parametric generative model of human action videos that relies on procedural generation and other computer graphics techniques of modern game engines. We generate a diverse, realistic, and physically plausible dataset of human action videos, called PHAV for "Procedural Human Action Videos". It contains a total of 39, 982 videos, with more than 1, 000 examples for each action of 35 categories. Our approach is not limited to existing motion capture sequences, and we procedurally define 14 synthetic actions.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} human action recognition in realistic videos. We follow the recently successful local approaches and represent videos by means of local motion descriptors. To overcome the huge variability of human actions in motion and appearance, we propose a supervised approach to learn local motion descriptors - actlets - from a large pool of annotated video data. The main motivation behind our method is to construct action-characteristic representations of body joints undergoing specific motion patterns while learning invariance with respect to changes in camera views, lighting, human clothing, and other factors. We avoid the prohibitive cost of manual supervision and show how to learn actlets automatically from <b>synthetic</b> <b>videos</b> of avatars driven by the motion-capture data.

We describe an improved method to track and quantify the speed of moving objects in AOSLO videos, which is necessary for characterizing the hemodynamics of retinal capillaries. During video acquisition, the objects of interest are in constant motion relative to the background tissue (object motion). The background tissue is in constant motion relative to the AOSLO, due to continuous eye motion during video recordings (eye motion). The location at which AOSLO acquires data is also in continuous motion, since the imaging source is swept in a raster scan across the retina (raster scanning). We show {{that it is important}} to take into consideration the combination of object motion, eye motion, and raster scanning for accurate quantification of object speeds.

Our approach {{is based on a}} state-of-the-art 2 D dense appearance descriptor which we extend in time by means of optical flow priors, and can be applied to wide-baseline stereo setups. The basic idea behind our approach is to capture the changes around a feature point in time instead of trying to describe the spatiotemporal volume. We demonstrate its effectiveness on very ambiguous <b>synthetic</b> <b>video</b> sequences with ground truth data, as well as real sequences.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{to detect and}} localize periodic movements in video is presented. The distinctive feature of the technique is that it requires neither feature tracking nor object segmentation. Intensity patterns along linear sample paths in space-time are used in estimation of period of object motion in a given sequence of frames. Sample paths are obtained by connecting (in space-time) sample points from regions of high motion magnitude {{in the first and}} last frames. Oscillations in intensity values are induced at time instants when an object intersects the sample path. The locations of peaks in intensity are determined by parameters of both cyclic object motion and orientation of the sample path with respect to object motion. The information about peaks is used in a least squares framework to obtain an initial estimate of these parameters. The estimate is further refined using the full intensity profile. The best estimate for the period of cyclic object motion is obtained by looking for consensus among estimates from many sample paths. The proposed technique is evaluated with <b>synthetic</b> <b>videos</b> where ground-truth is known, and with American Sign Language videos where the goal is to detect periodic hand motions. 1...|$|R
