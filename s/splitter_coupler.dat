However, it is well known that multi-radio Mesh platforms face many limitations such as interference, radiation leakage, crosstalk and limited computing resource etc. A misperception among researchers is that the so called “crosstalk” is one of the limiting factors to the performance decrease in multi-radio Mesh networks, but through a series of experiments the results shows otherwise.

Several optical devices have already been demonstrated, e. g. optical waveguides, waveguide amplifiers and lasers, beam <b>splitters,</b> <b>couplers,</b> stacked waveguides and three-dimensional waveguide arrays and gratings. The investigations were mainly focused on glasses where the laser irradiation causes a rise in refractive index. However, for different applications the realization of waveguides in crystalline media is interesting.

We show that the irradiation leads to a refractive index decrease {{which is due to}} amorphization of the focal volume. A detailed analysis of the structures is performed with transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and topography. Our investigations show that the irradiated amorphous core creates a stress field in the surrounding material that possesses a positive index change and therefore supports the guiding of light. The results of the X-ray experiments allow a quantitative characterization of the stress field. We are able to simulate the stress distribution by a simple model based on the density difference between the amorphous and crystalline material. From this the refractive index profile can be calculated and compared to experimental results. The light guiding properties of the compressed regions and the fact that only one polarization is guided can be verified by the simulation results...|$|R

This can be improved by increasing the reflectivities of the fiber ends by dielectric coating. In this case, multiple reflection at the fiber ends should be taken into account.

One {{of them is the}} widespread use of the Internet, which has brought a sharp increase in traffic, forcing suppliers to continuously expand the capacity of networks. In the near future, Internet will be composed of long-range highspeed optical networks; a number of wireless networks at the edge; and, in between, several access technologies. Today one of the main problems of the Internet is the bottleneck in the access segment. To address this issue the Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are very likely to succeed, due to their simplicity, low-cost, and increased bandwidth. A PON is made up of fiber optic cabling and passive <b>splitters</b> and <b>couplers</b> that distribute an optical signal to connectors that terminate each fiber segment. Among the different PON technologies, the Ethernet-PON (EPON) is a great alternative to satisfy operator and user needs, due to its cost, flexibility and interoperability with other technologies.

In the recent decade, research has proven that plasmonic devices have exciting characteristics and performance for next generation on chip structures.

This work numerically investigates the performance of plasmonic waveguide designs made of TiN, a CMOS compatible material with optical properties similar to gold. Through our work, we demonstrate that TiN nanophotonic devices can be useful for inter-chip connections. A series of simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics were performed to test the performance of these structures. 2 D simulations were completed to gain insights into {{the relationship between the}} mode size, propagation length trade-off and how additional parameters such as cladding material, a slight mismatch in refractive index of super and substrate, and the thickness of the metal inside the waveguide, affect performance. We found that waveguides using materials of higher refractive will have better mode confinement, albeit with larger losses.

40|$|Abstract. High-power {{applications}} of rf often {{require the use}} of overmoded waveguide to reduce the probability of rf breakdown by lowering surface fields, as well as to reduce the attenuation due to ohmic losses in transporting the power from the point of generation to the point of use. This is particularly true in the development of warm linear collider designs, such as NLC, JLC, and CLIC, especially the former two which involve extensive rf pulse compression / power distribution systems. Transitioning to and from overmoded waveguide and manipulating rf in such systems requires specialized components in whose design care must be taken to avoid parasitic mode loss and excessive field enhancement. Although fixed frequency operation means modest bandwidth requirements, power levels up to several hundred megawatts must be accommodated, and efficiency is important. Consequently, physicists working at laboratories engaged in the above efforts have produced a number of novel waveguide components in the past several years. These include tapers, mode converters, bends, directional couplers, power splitter/combiners, switches, phase shifters, etc. Often the circular TE 01 mode is used for its lack of surface electric field and low attenuation.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Terahertz {{technologies}} have been attracting attention {{over the past}} few years due to their unique applications in bio-chemical sensing, bio-imaging, spectroscopy, security, and communications. Traditionally, these applications are steering electromagnetic (EM) waves in free space and result in bulky and diffraction-limited systems. The maximum spatial resolution of the system is defined by an inherent constraint, the Abbe diffraction limit. In order to minimize the sizes of the systems and to increase the spatial resolution of the system beyond the diffraction limit, the active and tunable devices for the EM wave steering and confinement with subwavelength beam sizes are studied. The devices are applied on to two major applications, a multifunctional waveguide and a gradient flat lens; however, finalizing the design requires that the constitutive parameters and material properties of unit cells of metamaterials be determined and characterized. First, investigations are conducted to retrieve the material constitutive parameters of the proposed active metamaterials, such as effective permittivity and permeability. Classical methods for determining these properties are not robust. In this study, improved methods for single-layered and multi-layered MMs are proposed to fully retrieve effective material properties and constitutive parameters of the MMs at all frequencies of the interest, including the values in the resonant band. Second, a new kind of active tunable MM structures is invented, based on a passive gradient dielectric substrate and partially disconnected electrodes. This creates a system capable of actively reconfiguring a beam profile by tuning the material properties of individual unit cells as desired. This active gradient MMs technology has great potential in multiple fields, such as optical communications, quantum computing, and as an in-situ reconfigurable mask for photolithography. Finally, a novel subwavelength waveguide and a multifunctional flat lens based on the proposed active tunable MMs are investigated.

40|$|A {{research}} on polymer based optical waveguides and devices {{have been a}} topic of great interest in optical communications due to its pertinent advantages which include versatility and reduction in fabrication cost. This thesis is significantly devoted towards the first ever development of single mode optical waveguides and multimode interference (MMI) interconnecting devices based on photosensitive BenzoCyclobutene (BCB 4024 - 40) polymer. The developed MMI optical devices are <b>splitters,</b> splitter-combiner, cross <b>couplers</b> and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) coupler. These development process {{can be divided into}} four essential stages; material characterization, design and modelling, fabrication and device characterization. In each stage, several important techniques and equipments have been employed. The devices are fabricated on BK 7 glass substrate and thin film of silica as a clad using soda lime glass mask of ± 0. 2 µm resolution. A relatively high propagation loss of 3. 55 dB/cm has been observed for single mode waveguide structure, which is due to the resulting sidewall roughness. The splitting uniformity of symmetric MMI splitters were found to be better than 0. 6 dB and the insertion loss for all splitter structures were measured to be less than 1. 5 dB at 1550 nm wavelength. The 1 × 2 splitters were interconnected to function as a splitter-combiner which is ideally used as a basic building block for Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. The measured structure yielded an insertion loss of 1. 85 dB for device size of 4. 2 mm. The insertion loss of the 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 cross couplers based on general and paired interference were measured and found to be between 2. 5 to 3. 5 dB for 6 mm to 10 mm of cavity size. A 1310 nm and 1550 nm WDM coupler is demonstrated in which the device is designed based on a combination of general interference and paired interference mechanisms. The measured crosstalk at 1310 nm is - 14. 42 dB and at 1550 nm is - 20. 61 dB. The measured insertion losses were in the range of 3. 2 to 3. 5 dB for MMI cavity size of 7 mm. A novel 1 × 2 MMI thermal photonics switch is proposed. The switch uses a ridge waveguide of BCB 4024 - 40 polymer on silica clad. The proposed structure works well with crosstalk level of - 28 dB and low switching power.

In this attracting scenario, the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) market {{represents one of the}} main interesting targets for semiconductor industry. The availability of newer and larger bandwidth in the frequency spectrum (60 GHz and 77 GHz) opens to the possibility of higher bitrates communications. The technology cost reduction is made possible by the use of silicon as semiconductor substrate in the place of classical heterojunction materials. The rapid reduction of the technological node (seen as the thinning of the gate channel) in the new generation of CMOS transistors allows obtaining faster transistors that become usable on V band applications. Therefore, the digital origin of the technology yields two additional advantages. First of all, the facilities for the circuits' production already exist as well as the recipe to create the devices on the substrate. The only additive cost remains the characterization of the technology at mm-wave frequencies. The second fundamental advantage is the possibility to have a complete integration of the system in the same dies with a substantial reduction of packaging and interconnection costs. The objectives of this thesis is the design and the modeling of a complete 60 GHz UWB transceiver starting from the characterization and the optimization of the single subcomponents. The main feature that constitutes the principal constraint of the entire work of this thesis is the high efficiency required for the transceiver front - end.
