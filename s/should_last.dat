5|$|Ganteaume {{selected}} 11 {{ships of}} the line for the operation, including the 120-gun first rate Impérial, flagship of Vice Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, who was to sail to the Caribbean with four other ships {{of the line}}, two frigates and a corvette. His squadron carried over 1,000 French soldiers to augment the garrison on Santo Domingo under General Jean-Louis Ferrand, and was then required to spend two months blockading Jamaica before cruising along the American Eastern Seaboard to Newfoundland, returning to France when food supplies ran low. The other squadron was given to Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez in Foudroyant, with orders to cruise the shipping lanes of the South Atlantic before sailing to the Leeward Islands, communicating with the French colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Cayenne and blockading Barbados. When British opposition became too strong, he was {{to return to the}} South Atlantic off Saint Helena, also returning to France once food supplies ran low. His squadron consisted of six ships of the line, two frigates and two brigs, and included among its captains Jérôme Bonaparte, the Emperor's younger brother. Although both squadrons carried six months provisions, they were expected to capture more during their voyages and it was intended that their raiding operations <b>should</b> <b>last</b> as long as 14 months, causing severe indirect damage to the British economy by restricting the movement of trade.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{maintenance}} is to rinse {{inside and out}} with clean, fresh water after each day's use, and allow to dry out of direct sunlight before storage. Ultraviolet light degrades the synthetic materials of the skirt and frame. A well-maintained mask <b>should</b> <b>last</b> for several years. The strap is the most stressed component and is often the first part to fail, but can usually be replaced. Inspection of the strap for cracks and tears before use can {{reduce the risk of}} failure during a dive.|$|E
25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action {{is to seek}} follow-up care. Using denture adhesive may improve the fit, but it tends to work better when {{only a small amount}} is used as covering the denture fitting surface in adhesive makes it stay in less well. Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, but it is only a temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new dentures. Overall, a well-made denture <b>should</b> <b>last</b> about 5 years or more.|$|E

25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} {{is more likely}} in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes of vertigo <b>should</b> <b>last</b> less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In Ménière's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In labyrinthitis the onset of vertigo is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.|$|E
25|$|Erdoğan {{formally}} tasked Davutoğlu with {{forming a}} new government on 9 July, with the Constitution granting Davutoğlu 45 days (until 23 August) to form {{a new government}}. The first round of coalition talks involved discussions between the AKP with the CHP, MHP and HDP, after which the AKP announced that they would no longer pursue any negotiations with the HDP. The second round of negotiations mainly focused on the CHP, while the MHP declared their support for an early election and closed their doors on any form of deal soon after. Negotiations between the AKP and CHP continued into August, lasting collectively over 35 hours. The CHP unveiled 14 principles upon which a coalition government involving them would stick to, involving many of their manifesto pledges. The MHP later backtracked on their support for an early election and supported the formation of an AKP-CHP government. On 13 August 2015, the leaders of the AKP and CHP met for a final time in a meeting that had been perceived to be where a final decision would be made on whether to form a coalition government. The meeting ended after the AKP proposed a three-month interim government followed by fresh elections, despite the CHP's insistence that the government <b>should</b> <b>last</b> four years.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} set for {{the fictional}} Albert Square {{is located in the}} permanent backlot of the BBC Elstree Centre, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at , and is outdoors and open to the weather. It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it <b>should</b> <b>last</b> for at least fifteen years at a cost of £750,000. The EastEnders lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr. The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames. The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look {{as if it had been}} standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared to sag. The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a telephone box, telegraph pole that was provided by British Telecom, lampposts that were provided by Hertsmere Borough Council and a number of vehicles parked on the square. On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and The Queen Victoria beer pumps.|$|E

500|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} reanalysis {{project of}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration seeks to correct and add new information about past North Atlantic hurricanes. [...] It was started around 2000 to update HURDAT, the official hurricane database for the Atlantic Basin, which has become outdated since its creation due to various systematic errors introduced into the database over time. [...] This effort has involved reanalyses of ship observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as well as reanalyses done by other researchers over the years. [...] It has been ongoing as of 2016, and <b>should</b> <b>last</b> another four years.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, {{the study}} by Horner [...] tried {{to account for the}} fact that within a limited {{geological}} period of time (about half a million years) there had been a quick succession of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. Normally, this would be interpreted as a series of invasions, with the new animal types replacing the old ones. But Horner noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later fauna was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. The various types found were not distinct species but transitional forms developed within a process of anagenesis. This conformed to the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species <b>should</b> <b>last</b> about two to three million years. A further indication, according to Horner, was the failure to identify true autapomorphies – unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species. The fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal (or ancestral) into more derived characters.|$|E
500|$|Wright was {{a skilled}} {{designer}} of mathematical instruments. According to the 1615 Caius annals, [...] "e was excellent both in contrivance and execution, {{nor was he}} inferior to the most ingenious mechanic {{in the making of}} instruments, either of brass or any other matter". For Prince Henry, he made models of an astrolabe and a pantograph, and created or arranged to be created out of wood a form of armillary sphere which replicated the motions of the celestial sphere, the circular motions of the sun and moon, and the places and possibilities of them eclipsing each other. The sphere was designed for a motion of 17,100years, if the machine <b>should</b> <b>last</b> that long. In 1613 Wright published The Description and Use of the Sphære, which described the use of this device. The sphere was lost during the English Civil War, but found in 1646 in the Tower of London by the mathematician and surveyor Sir Jonas Moore, who was later appointed Surveyor General of the Ordnance Office and became a patron and the principal driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Moore asked the King to let him have it, restored the instrument at his own expense and deposited it at his own house [...] "in the Tower".|$|E

500|$|Vollmer {{unveiled}} Close Castles in June 2014. Players {{start in}} corners of a [...] "grid map" [...] and {{are represented by}} castles. Vollmer explained that the game's name is from castles built too close to one another, starting a mutually assured destruction scenario. Players can build three structure types out from their castle: towers that fire at incoming enemies (defense), houses that make [...] "loyal subjects" [...] (offense), and markets that make money (economy). The [...] "A" [...] button with a direction constructs a path directing followers to the enemy. Followers capture enemy structures as denoted by a [...] "defense bar" [...] that fills as followers enter the structure and that destroys the structure when filled. Markets are the weakest structure, and two towers can defend against one house. Player turf grows as player structures approach {{the limits of their}} area. Players earn five units of money a second, which increases by five for every market. Polygon called the game's simple visual design [...] "horrifyingly deceptive". Vollmer has said that games <b>should</b> <b>last</b> around three minutes apiece and that the local multiplayer's lack of [...] "hidden information" [...] should make interactions with other players less of a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] game of waiting for an opponent to concede. The game was demoed on an Xbox 360 but was planned for release on the PlayStation 4. Vollmer put the project on hold while he worked out [...] "fundamental flaws" [...] in the gameplay.|$|E
