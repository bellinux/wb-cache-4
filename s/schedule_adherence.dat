30|$|Therefore, the {{mechanism}} described in Sect.  3.2 is also utilised for the accurate {{calculation of the}} due date of a new order. It is reasonable that the manufacturing of two similar ETO products in a similarly configured manufacturing system will {{require the use of}} similar resources and will be completed in approximately the same time. Utilising the similarity mechanism, accurate estimations about the delivery dates can be produced for ETO products manufacturing. Once the complete set of attributes is submitted as described above, a sales agreement is achieved, the order is considered active, and the calculation of lead time initiates. The proposed due date estimation method reuses previous knowledge from executed orders, which are stored as cases in a case base. First, previous cases are retrieved and a pairwise comparison between the new order and each of the stored ones is performed. Based on the procedure described previously, the most similar case is obtained together with the calculated similarity index. The obtained case is revised in order to fit the new case requirements. Then, the manufacturing lead time of the past case is multiplied with the similarity index to derive the estimated lead time for the new case. The estimated manufacturing lead time is essentially the due date of the order. The estimation is finally checked by the planner and if accepted is inserted in the scheduling module as the due date of the order. If rejected, the procedure described in Sect.  3.2 is followed. Finally, after production is completed, multiple <b>scheduling</b> <b>adherence</b> methods (integration with an MES system, machine monitoring techniques, manual reporting, etc.) can be utilised in order to validate the accuracy of this estimation. If the accuracy is acceptable, the case is retained and stored in the case base. The mechanism which is shown to yield high-quality results is a similar industrial case as reported by Mourtzis et al. [38].|$|R

This study {{is the first to}} estimate if such nonadherence is also associated with bia sed salivary testosterone concentration estimates.; Using a standard ambulatory saliva-sampling protocol, we instructed pregnant women to collect saliva samples on two consecutive days at awakening, 1100 h, 1500 h, 2000 h, and 2200 h. We estimated testosterone concentrations in the saliva samples and participants' actual sampling times with an electronic medication event-monitoring system. We classified a saliva sample as adherent if it was sampled within a specific time window relative to its scheduled sampling time. We used a mixed-model analysis to distinguish between trait (number of adherent saliva samples per participant) and state (adherence status of a specific sample) adherence.; We included 60 pregnant women in this study. Seventy-five percent (448 of 600) of the <b>scheduled</b> samples indicated <b>adherence</b> with the sampling <b>schedule.</b> Participants' trait <b>adherence</b> was associated with their diurnal profiles of salivary testosterone estimates; that is, adherent participants had higher salivary testosterone estimates compared with nonadherent participants, F(1, 58) = 5. 41, p= 0. 023, Cohen's d= 0. 67. The state adherence of a sample was associated with the salivary testosterone estimate of the related sample, F(1, 469) = 4. 48, p= 0. 035, Cohen's d= 0. 20, with delayed sampling associated with lower salivary testosterone estimates.; The results suggest that common ambulatory nonadherence with scheduled saliva sampling is associated with biased salivary testosterone estimates.

We compared HCWs from our institution (Group 1) and HCWs from independent institutions that contract our postexposure management program (Group 2). Compliance with standard precautions in Group 1 was inadequate in 77 %, 23 %, and 16 % of nurses, physicians, and others, respectively. A greater proportion of HCWs in Group 1 (74 % vs. 40 %) reported occupational accidents within two hours after exposure (p = 0. 0001).

40|$|Abstract Background Successful {{antiretroviral}} {{treatment is}} dependent on sustaining high rates of adherence. In the southern African context, {{only a handful of}} studies (both quantitative and qualitative) have looked at the determinants including a health behaviour theory of adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess factors including the information, motivation and behavioural skills model (IMB) contributing to antiretroviral (ARV) adherence six months after commencing ARVs at three public hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods Using systematic sampling, 735 HIV-positive patients were selected prior to commencing on ART from outpatient departments from three hospitals and followed-up at six months and interviewed with a questionnaire. Results A good proportion of patients were found to be adherent using both adherence instruments (visual analog scale = VAS 82. 9 %; Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group = AATCG 70. 8 %). After adjusting for significant socio-economic variables, both the VAS and the dose, <b>schedule</b> and food <b>adherence</b> indicator found levels of adherence amongst urban residents to be almost 3 times greater than that of rural residents. After adjusting for health-related variables, for both indicators better adherence was associated with low depression and poorer adherence was associated with poor environmental factors. Adjusted odds ratios for adherence when taking into account different behavioural variables were for both adherence indicators, discrimination experiences were associated with lower adherence, and higher scores in adherence information and behavioural skills were associated with higher adherence. For the VAS adherence indicator, higher social support scores were associated with higher adherence. For the dose, <b>schedule</b> and food <b>adherence</b> indicator, using herbal medicines for HIV was associated with lower adherence. Conclusion For the patients in this study, particularly those not living in urban areas, additional support may be needed to ensure patients are able to attend appointments or obtain their medications more easily. Adherence information and behavioural skills as part of the IMB model should be strengthened to improve adherence. Further psychological support is also required and patients' perceived need for ARTs should be routinely assessed. </p...|$|R

Methods: A meta-analysis was performed based on relevant articles identified from a comprehensive literature review using MEDLINE® and Embase®. The review included studies assessing adherence with OD, twice-daily (BID), thrice-daily (TID), and four-times daily (QID) dosing schedules and costs associated with optimal/suboptimal adherence among patients with acute and chronic diseases. Effect estimates across studies were pooled and analyzed using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect model. Results: Forty-three studies met inclusion criteria, and meta-analyzable data were available from 13 studies. The overall results indicated that OD schedules were associated with higher adherence rates (odds ratio [OR] 3. 07, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 80 – 5. 23; P OD dosing) and compliance rates (OR 3. 50, 95 % CI 1. 73 – 7. 08; P OD dosing); persistence rates showed the same direction but were not statistically significant (OR 1. 43, 95 % CI 0. 62 – 3. 29; P = 0. 405 for OD versus BID dosing). Results for each of the conditions were consistent with those observed overall with respect to showing the benefits of less frequent dosing. From a health economic perspective, higher adherence rates with OD relative to multiple dosing in a number of conditions were consistently associated with corresponding lower costs of health care resources utilization. Conclusion: Current meta-analyses suggested that across acute and chronic disease states, reducing dosage frequency from multiple dosing to OD dosing may improve adherence to therapies among patients. Improving adherence may result in subsequent decreases in health care costs. Keywords: compliance, dosage frequency, persistence, random-effect meta-analyse...|$|R

The main focus of this thesis is on the impact of various classes of antiretroviral drugs that target different stages of the viral replication cycle. Age-structured models are developed to study the influence of drug therapy on the within-host virus dynamics. The effectiveness of different drug combinations is compared. Two-strain models are also developed to study the mechanisms underlying the emergence of drug resistance during therapy. The influence of time-varying drug efficacy due to dosing <b>schedule</b> and suboptimal <b>adherence</b> on antiviral responses is investigated. Finally, the eclipse stage of HIV- 1 infection is incorporated into mathematical models to study the evolution of drug resistant viral strains with consideration of trade-offs between viral enzyme function and drug susceptibility.

40|$|With {{improved}} {{accessibility to}} life-prolonging antiretroviral therapy, {{the treatment and}} care requirements of people living with HIV and AIDS resembles that of more established chronic diseases. As {{an increasing number of}} people living with HIV and AIDS in Kenya have access to ART, the primary caregivers of poor resource settings, often children, face the challenge of meeting the requirements of rigid ART <b>adherence</b> <b>schedules</b> and frequent relapses. This, and the long-term duty of care, has an impact on the primary caregiver's experience of this highly stigmatised illness – an impact that is often described in relation to psychological deprivation. Reflecting the meanings attached to caregiving by 48 children in Western Kenya, articulated in writing, through photography and drawing, individual and group interviews, this paper presents three case studies of young caregiving. Although all the children involved in the study coped with their circumstances, some better than others, we found that the meanings they attach to their circumstances impact on how well they cope. Our findings suggest that only a minority of young caregivers attach either positive or negative meanings to their circumstances, whilst the majority attaches a mix of positive and negative meanings depending on the context they are referring to. Through a continuum of psychosocial coping, we conclude that to provide appropriate care for young carers, health professionals must align their understanding and responses to the psychosocial cost of chronic care, to a more nuanced and contextual understanding of children's social agency and the social and symbolic resources evident in many African communities...|$|R

40|$|Background: Insufficient {{physical}} activity {{is a public}} health problem. Nordic healthcare professionals use {{physical activity}} on prescription (PaP) to increase physical activity. Purpose: This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of PaP that includes organized exercise. Method: Prospective data was obtained from four Swedish counties during fall 2009 and spring 2010. The study population comprised 98 patients whose healthcare professional prescribed PaP to prevent or treat disease. Questionnaires administered at baseline, three and six months after initiating PaP evaluated self-reported physical activity levels, adherence, factors influencing adherence, and experience of PaP. Results: Although the majority of patients receiving PaP including organized exercise are middle-age women, there are a wide distribution regarding e. g., age, socioeconomic status and reason of receiving PaP. Most participants received initial support from healthcare providers and activity organizers, and most were satisfied with the support they got. Approximately 70 % participated in several activities at all measuring points. Although PaP including organized exercise increased activity levels only marginally, sedentary behavior decreased significantly. Six months after initiating PaP including organized exercise, 68 % adhered to the prescribed physical activity level. Most participants deemed PaP including organized exercise a good method for becoming physically active. However, there is a need for regularly and longer support. Importantly, individualized instruction, adjusted exercise regimens, and support from other participants provide positive reinforcement. On the other hand, PaP with organized exercise imposes additional costs and decreases flexibility including both time commitment and <b>scheduling</b> constraints. Conclusion: <b>Adherence</b> levels to PaP with organized exercise are similar to those achieved by other chronic disease treatments.

40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHBackground: Adherence of {{patients}} on antiretroviral therapy to lifelong treatment {{is a major}} challenge within the public health system in Namibia. Missed appointments {{have been shown to}} contribute to poor clinical outcomes and treatment failure, which may necessitate switching to more expensive antiretroviral regimens. In resource limited settings monitoring of appointments for antiretroviral medication pick up is a documented and feasible method for assessing minimum levels of adherence to antiretroviral medication. Aim: This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of telephonic short message service reminders influence on <b>adherence</b> to <b>scheduled</b> antiretroviral medication pick up appointments. It was also aimed at evaluating how socio-demographic parameters might moderate the effectiveness of short message service reminders. Study design: A randomized double blind controlled study design was employed. Methodology: Stable patients attending the ART clinic were recruited and randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group, until the sample size of 398 was reached in the two arms of the study. The study populations were adult patients’ ≥ 18 years who have been enrolled on treatment for ≥ 3 months. The intervention group received an unasked for single short message service reminder, sent 48 hours before their scheduled appointments and continued with standard care, while the control group received standard care without any reminder. The study participants were blinded to their study group. Also, research assistants involved in collecting baseline and outcome data were blinded to study participants study group. Baseline data was collected through a structured questionnaire. Study participants were followed up for four consecutive scheduled ARV pick up appointments. The following outcome data were collected at each follow up visit; number of days late after <b>scheduled</b> appointment, <b>adherence</b> measured by pill count and 3 days self-report recall of adherence. Main results: The pre-intervention survey revealed that only 60 % of the study participants were willing to be reminded of their medication pick up appointment. Overall, the SMS reminder improved adherence to medication pick up appointments by 1. 6 times as compared to no reminder and also reduced the risk of missing medication pick appointments by 22 % as compared to no SMS reminder. Study participants that received a reminder were also two times more likely to achieve optimal adherence to their medication, compared to those who received no reminder. The SMS reminder improved adherence to antiretroviral medication by 11 % in this study, while the mean difference in the number of days late to collect antiretroviral medication was significantly reduced by about 4 days by the intervention. Participants that are employed were more likely to adhere to antiretroviral medications as compared to the unemployed. Ironically participants that were on ART for less than one year and those that had treatment supporters reminding them of their medication appointments were significantly less likely to honour their medication pick up appointments. Conclusion: Being employed was significantly associated with attaining optimal adherence to antiretroviral medication. There were no other significant associations between the patients socio- economic and demographic characteristics and <b>adherence</b> to <b>scheduled</b> medication pick up appointments, or to adherence to medication. Recommendations: The Ministry of Health and Social Services should consider rolling out SMS reminders to ART sites with similar settings as Swakopmund State Hospital ART Clinic. Patients that are willing to receive the reminder should be targeted in the scaling up of the roll out. Late and missed medication pick up appointments could be used as an easy proxy measurement for assessing adherence to ART...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} {{morbidity and mortality}} among HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa. Isoniazid prophylaxis can reduce tuberculosis incidence in this population. However, for the treatment to be effective, adherence to the medication must be optimized. We investigated adherence to isoniazid prophylaxis administered daily, compared {{to three times a}} week, and predictors of adherence amongst HIV-infected children. Methods We investigated adherence to study medication in a two centre, randomized trial comparing daily to three times a week dosing of isoniazid. The study was conducted at two tertiary paediatric care centres in Cape Town, South Africa. Over a 5 year period, we followed 324 HIV-infected children aged ≥ 8 weeks. Adherence information based on pill counts was available for 276 children. Percentage adherence was calculated by counting the number of pills returned. Adherence ≥ 90 % was considered to be optimal. Analysis was done using summary and repeated measures, comparing adherence to the two dosing <b>schedules.</b> Mean percentage <b>adherence</b> (per child during follow-up time) was used to compare the mean of each group as well as the proportion of children achieving an adherence of ≥ 90 % in each group. For repeated measures, percentage adherence (per child per visit) was dichotomized at 90 %. A logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations, to account for within-individual correlation, was used to evaluate the impact of the dosing schedule. Adjustments were made for potential confounders and we assessed potential baseline and time-varying adherence determinants. Results The overall adherence to isoniazid was excellent, with a mean adherence of 94. 7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 93. 5 - 95. 9); similar mean adherence was achieved by the group taking daily medication (93. 8 %; 95 % CI 92. 1 - 95. 6) and by the three times a week group (95. 5 %; 95 % CI 93. 8 - 97. 2). Two-hundred and seventeen (78. 6 %) children achieved a mean adherence of ≥ 90 %. Adherence was similar for daily and three times a week dosing schedules in univariate (odds ratio [OR] 0. 88; 95 % CI 0. 66 - 1. 17; P = 0. 38) and multivariate (adjusted OR 0. 85; 95 % CI 0. 64 - 1. 11; P = 0. 23) models. Children from overcrowded homes were less adherent (adjusted OR 0. 71; 95 % CI 0. 54 - 0. 95; P = 0. 02). Age at study visit was predictive of adherence, with better adherence achieved in children older than 4 years (adjusted OR 1. 96; 95 % CI 1. 16 - 3. 32; P = 0. 01). Conclusion Adherence to isoniazid was excellent regardless of the dosing schedule used. Intermittent dosing of isoniazid prophylaxis can be considered as an alternative to daily dosing, without compromising adherence or efficacy.
