500|$|The word carom, which {{simply means}} any strike and rebound, was {{in use in}} {{reference}} to billiards by at least 1779, sometimes spelled [...] "carrom". Sources differ on the origin.

Some etymologists have suggested that carambola, in turn, was derived from a yellow-to-orange, tropical Asian fruit also known in Portuguese as a carambola (which was a corruption of the original name of the fruit, karambal in the Marathi language of India), also known as <b>star</b> <b>fruit.</b> But this may simply be folk etymology, as the fruit bears no resemblance to a billiard ball, and there is no direct evidence for such a derivation.|$|E

[...] Gibney Beach lies on the eastern coast of the island and is characterized by dry forest vegetation. [...] Cacti such as the Barbed-wire Cactus (Acanthocereus tetragonus), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), Organ Pipe Cactus (Pilosocereus royenii) and Turk's Cap Cactus (Melocactus intortus) are prominent in the area. [...] These cacti grow alongside shrubs, such as Maran (Croton flavens var. rigidula), and thorn bushes like Casha (Acacia tortuosa) and Catch-and-Keep (A. retusa). [...] The thorny nature of these forests make them difficult to navigate. [...] Mangrove forests can also be found off Gibney Beach. Mangrove trees alter the shoreline, changing salinity, tidal inundation and oxygenation of the soil. [...] Red Mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) are the most common and grow in the ocean. [...] They have specialized prop roots that protect shorelines and serve as nurseries for many marine animals. [...] Other mangrove species that {{can be found on the}} coast are the Black Mangrove (Avicennia germinans), White Mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), and Buttonwood Mangrove (Conocarpus erectus). Other more exotic and beautiful trees can be found in residential areas off Gibney Beach.

Os frutos colhidos fisiologicamente maturos apresentaram coloração verde-amarelada, sólidos solúveis (SS) médios de 6, 8 ºBrix e massa média de 185 g. Antes da aplicação dos tratamentos, os frutos foram selecionados, higienizados em solução de hipoclorito de sódio (NaOCl) a 100 mg. L- 1, resfriados por 12 horas a 15 ± 0, 5 °C, seccionados transversalmente, sendo então novamente higienizados em solução de NaOCl a 10 mg. L- 1, por 3 minutos. em seguida, os pedaços em forma de estrelas foram acondicionados em bandejas rígidas de poliestireno, com capacidade para 250 g, e revestidas com os seguintes materiais: T 1 : filme plástico perfurado de polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), de 0, 006 mm; T 2 : filme plástico poliolefínico com antiembassamento da Dupont® (AGF), de 0, 015 mm; T 3 : filme plástico poliolefínico da Dupont® (HF), de 0, 015 mm; T 4 : filme plástico de PEBD, de 60 µm; T 5 : filme plástico de PEBD, de 80 µm; T 6 : filme plástico de polipropileno (PP), de 22 µm, e T 7 : bandeja rígida de polietileno tereftalato (PET), com capacidade para 500 mL, com tampa do mesmo material. As embalagens foram então armazenadas em câmara frigorífica a 12 ± 0, 5 °C e 90 ± 3 % de U. R, por 18 dias. Observou-se que não houve diferença significativa quanto aos sólidos solúveis (SS) e acidez titulável (AT). O maior número de microrganismos e valor de pH foram observados nos frutos embalados nos filmes plásticos de PEBD de 0, 006 mm, AGF e HF de 0, 015 mm da Dupont®. Entretanto, os frutos acondicionados nas embalagens PET apresentaram o maior teor de ácido ascórbico. da mesma forma, somente nas embalagens PET é que se conseguiu modificação atmosférica eficiente do ponto de vista da manutenção dos atributos de qualidade durante o AR. Assim, esse tratamento proporcionou adequado controle microbiológico e manutenção das características de qualidade por 18 dias para as carambolas minimamente processadas. This work {{aimed to}} evaluate the potential of cold storage of <b>star</b> <b>fruits</b> cv.

The fruits harvested in nature-green stage showed green-yellowish coloration, soluble solids (SS) an average of 6, 8 ºBrix and an average mass of 185 g. Before the treatments were set, the fruits had been selected, cleaned in solution of NaOCl at 10 mg. L- 1, cooled for 12 hours at 15 ± 0, 5 °C, cut transversally, and cleaned in solution of NaOCl at 10 mg. L- 1, for 3 minutes. After, the pieces in form of stars had been displayed in rigid polystyrene trays, with capacity for 250 g, and coated with the following materials: T 1 : perforated film plastic of low density polyethylene (LDPE), with 0, 006 mm; T 2 : polyolephinic plastic film with anti-fog of DuPont® (AGF), with 0, 015 mm; T 3 : polyolephinic plastic film of Dupont® (HF), with 0, 015 mm; T 4 : LDPE plastic film, with 0, 060 mm; T 5 : LDPE plastic film, with 0, 080 mm; T 6 : polypropylene plastic film (PP), with 0, 022 mm and T 7 : rigid polyethylene terephtalat tray (PET), with capacity for 500 mL, with cover of the same material. The treatments had been conditioned in refrigerating chamber at 12 ± 0, 5 °C and 90 ± 3 % of R. U., for 18 days. At the end, it was not observed significant difference in the tested treatments in the analysis of soluble solids (SS) and titratable acidity (TA). The biggest microbiological activity and the greater pH had been detected in the fruits packed in LDPE films with 6 µm, AGF and HF with 15 µm from Dupont. However, the fruits conditioned in packing PET had shown the biggest contents of ascorbic acid. In the same way, only in PET packing was obtained an efficient atmospheric modification in the point of maintaining the quality of sensorial attributes during RA. Thus, this treatment provided the adequate microbiological control and maintenance of the sensorial attributes for 18 days for minimally processed <b>star</b> <b>fruits...</b>|$|R
