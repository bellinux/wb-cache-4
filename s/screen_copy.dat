40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{provide the}} medical {{students}} involved in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) with a remotely accessible training tool for the self acquisition of information retrieval skills. CONTENT: Access to the training tool is made trough a portal Web site. The tool is initiated with a clinical case. A selection of relevant electronic resources such as dictionaries, encyclopaedias, textbooks, and bibliographical databases is proposed. Each resource comes with search examples achieved by librarians concerning {{the subject of the}} clinical case. Each step of the strategy is described, commented and illustrated with a <b>screen</b> <b>copy</b> of the original resource. To reinforce the realism, users are invited to click on the appropriate areas of the <b>screen</b> <b>copy</b> to progress in the search. A catalogue is created with the documents retrieved from the different resources. The catalogue is searchable independently and provides links to full-text when available. The technical support for the training tool consists of a set of related databases (FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Inc., USA). Data concerning the clinical case, including medical imaging, is contained in a first database. Description of â€“ and links to resources are collected in a second database as well as basic user instructions. For every search example in a specific resource, a database is created from a template, containing all the searched terms and screen copies necessary to provide an interactive demonstration. The catalogue of documents constitutes the last database. The prototype must now be presented to teachers and students and evaluated for quality, performance and user-friendliness. Results will help us to improve the design and content of the training tool...|$|E

40|$|Pixel-based methods emerge to {{be a new}} and {{promising}} way for developing new interaction techniques on top of existing user interfaces. However, in order to maintain platform independence, other available low-level information about GUI widgets, such as accessibility metadata, was neglected intentionally. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework, PAX, which correlates the visual representation of user interfaces (i. e. the pixels) and their internal hierarchical metadata (i. e. the content, role, and value). We identify challenges to build such a framework. We also develop and evaluate two new algorithms for detecting text at arbitrary places on the screen, and for segmenting a text image into individual word blobs. Finally, we validate our framework in implementations of three applications. We enhance an existing pixel-based system, Sikuli Script, and preserve the readability of its script code at the same time. Further, we create two novel applications, Screen Search and <b>Screen</b> <b>Copy,</b> to demonstrate how PAX can be applied to developing desktop-level interactive systems.

40|$|We used {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) to compare {{the contribution of the}} cerebellum and basal ganglia to the sensory guidance of movement. In one condition the subjects used a computer mouse to draw a series of lines on a computer screen (DRAW). In the second condition the same lines were presented to the subjects, and they had to track the lines with a mouse pointer on the <b>screen</b> (<b>COPY).</b> In a third condition the subjects were again presented with the same lines, and they simply followed movements of the pointer with their eyes (EYES). In the fourth condition, the subjects fixated a central point, ignoring the sequence of presented lines (FIX). The pons and cerebellum were activated more during visually guided tracking than in freely generated drawing (COPY vs DRAW). The basal ganglia were activated equally in both DRAW and COPY. The prefrontal and inferior temporal cortex were activated more when subjects drew lines freely (DRAW) than when they copied them (COPY). We conclude that the cerebellum is specialized for using sensory information to correct movements, but that the basal ganglia are involved both in movements that are self-generated and in movements that are guided by external cues...|$|E
