500|$|Drummer Omar Hakim {{recalled}} {{being asked}} by Daft Punk {{to perform on}} the album, and was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>what</b> they wanted of him. He at first assumed that the duo wanted electronic drum work, since Hakim had done some drum programming in his career. Daft Punk instead specified {{that they were looking}} to record Hakim performing acoustic drum riffs that the duo had conceived. Rather than play out the entire structure of a song, Hakim would perform individual patterns for extended periods, thus creating a library for the duo to cull from. Daft Punk conveyed their ideas to session musicians via sheet music and in some instances by humming melodies. Bangalter recalled an example in which he hummed a complex drum and bass line to Hakim, who replicated and improved upon it for the track [...] "Giorgio by Moroder".|$|E

He mocked the coverage, [...] "I think {{for the most part}} everything was wonderful. Some maniac Cohos got wild, went down on the field. Which you shouldn't have done. Bad little Cohos." [...] Tigers manager Anderson stated of the events, [...] "Beer and baseball go together, they have for years. But I think those kids were doing things other than beer." [...] Columnist David Israel of the Chicago Tribune commented on July 12 that he was not <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>what</b> had occurred, [...] "It would have happened any place 50,000 teenagers got together on a sultry summer night with beer and reefer."

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. James Hunt {{reviewed}} the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he [...] "went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun". [...] He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was [...] "interesting", stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010. He too was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>what</b> he found. Handlen said that [...] "last time I saw it, I thought Riker and Minuet's interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn't bother me so much now, because they don't go on very long, and there's something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions". But he said, [...] "I had fun with this, which I wasn't expecting", and [...] "thought this was solid". He gave the episode a B grade.|$|E

50|$|Seismologists at the Athens Seismological Institute {{were once}} again taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>what</b> turned into an {{unprecedented}} riddle concerning {{whether or not these}} were in fact foreshocks of a major event. The chances are, nonetheless, that this was just a phenomenon known as earthquake swarm, characterized by a pattern of a considerable amount of magnitude-wise similar tremors, all occurring within a limited number of days or weeks. As a result of the recurring jolts, moderate damage was reported to a total of sixty residencies and one library, while a small crack appeared on {{the eastern part of the}} capital's port. In addition, several rocks tumbled down onto one of the island's main roads, running through its mountainous areas.|$|R

2500|$|Harper's Magazine {{published}} a brief telephone interview with Desmond Travers {{in which he}} was asked to respond to criticism of the mission and the report. He rejected the criticism that insufficient weight was given to the difficulties of fighting in the urban environment, and said that he was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>what</b> he called [...] "the intensity and viciousness of the personal attacks aimed at members of the Mission". He also said that the mission found no evidence that mosques were used to store munitions; in two cases investigated, neither was used as anything but a place of worship. He added that he had seen no credible criticism of the report itself or of the information in it.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 October 2004, Blasko {{released}} her debut studio album, The Overture & the Underscore, {{which had been}} recorded in Hollywood at the studio of engineer Wally Gagel {{during the first half}} of the year. She co-produced the album with Gagel and fellow songwriter Robert F. Cranny. Gagel engineered and mixed the album, with assistance from Bruce MacFarlane. Joey Waronker (Beck, Atoms for Peace) played drums and percussion on all songs, while Cranny played various instruments on the album. Blasko recalled: [...] "I stayed in a backpackers hostel right near Hollywood Boulevard and worked on the album six days a week for two months ...

Such an idea was incompatible with the knowledge that he had of Thady's disposition, and he concluded that there must have been some quarrel between the two men, in which Ussher had fallen the victim.

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Parsons {{received}} a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was {{a founding member of}} Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, [...] "Jim is a very specific personality. He's thoroughly original, which is one reason he's been so successful. But we worried, 'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we're doing?' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out." [...] Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: [...] "school was so safe!.....you frequently would <b>surprise</b> yourself <b>by</b> <b>what</b> you were capable of, and you were not <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> some things."

50|$|As such, an attacking {{pilot who}} {{finds himself in}} a flat {{scissors}} has transitioned from an offensive to a neutral engagement, and has lost his offensive advantage, as it represents a failure to press an initial attack into a kill, and the scissors {{can be difficult to}} disengage from without being exposed to the weapons of the bandit at close range. The bandit pilot is often <b>surprised</b> initially <b>by</b> <b>what</b> was likely an unobserved attack from the rear, and while he has survived a highly defensive situation that has become a somewhat neutral encounter after the overshoot, the bandit pilot must still react quickly. After the co-planar overshoot, if the bandit chooses to remain engaged with a nose-to-nose turn (that is, a turn toward the attacker {{in the general direction of}} the attacker's direction of flight) to either gain the advantage, or maintain the neutral situation, the flat scissors is a common result.|$|R

Three years of repose had not yet enabled her to hear her marriage name uttered, or to be present when past times of deathly suffering and terror were referred to, without betraying the shock in her face and manner.

In particular, we review established ideas about the nature and purpose of sleep in terms of protoconsciousness and free energy minimization. By combining these theoretical perspectives, we discover answers to some fundamental questions about sleep: for example, why is homeothermy suspended during sleep? Why is sleep necessary? Why are we not <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> our dreams? <b>What</b> is the role of synaptic regression in sleep? The imperatives for sleep that emerge also allow us to speculate about the functional role of PGO waves and make some empirical predictions that can, in principle, be tested using recent advances in the modeling of electrophysiological data...|$|R
