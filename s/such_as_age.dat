5|$|Understanding {{traits of}} {{individual}} organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several areas of ecology of evolution {{that focus on}} such traits are life history theory, ecophysiology, metabolic theory of ecology, and Ethology. Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>age</b> to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits {{may be related to}} structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>age,</b> gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

25|$|Cultural factors, such as {{discrimination}} {{of various}} kinds, can negatively affect productivity <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>age</b> discrimination, stereotyping, discrimination against people with physical disability, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and caste discrimination.

In addition, the fact that {{women are more likely to}} be caregivers, regardless of income level, to either the generations before or after them, exacerbates the burdens of their poverty.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} the abundances of lithium and {{beryllium}} in open cluster stars can give important clues about the evolution of stars and their interior structures. While hydrogen nuclei cannot fuse to form helium until the temperature reaches about 10 millionK, lithium and beryllium are destroyed at temperatures of 2.5 millionK and 3.5 millionK respectively. This means that their abundances depend strongly on how much mixing occurs in stellar interiors. By studying their abundances in open cluster stars, variables <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>age</b> and chemical composition are fixed.|$|E

25|$|Adolescent {{sexuality}} is {{a stage of}} human development in which adolescents experience and explore sexual feelings. Interest in sexuality intensifies during the onset of puberty, and {{sexuality is}} often a vital aspect of teenagers' lives. In humans, sexual interest may be expressed {{in a number of}} ways, such as flirting, kissing, masturbation, or having sex with a partner. Sexual interest among adolescents, as among adults, can vary greatly, and is influenced by cultural norms and mores, sex education provided, sexual orientation, and social controls <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>age</b> of consent laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{segregation}} of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears {{for the same}} resources. For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both. In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>age</b> of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.|$|E
