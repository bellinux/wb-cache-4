5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in <b>status</b> is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town <b>status</b> if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town <b>status,</b> or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town <b>status</b> is in the public interest. Melville retains its city <b>status</b> despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Ascribed <b>statuses</b> are {{determined}} by the dominant groups in society and as a result, minorities are often assigned lower <b>statuses.</b> Minority groups are forced to attempt to reconcile the conflicts that arise from the social expectations that are linked with their assigned <b>statuses</b> in society and their perceived view of themselves. In the face of the knowledge that individuals occupy more than one ascribed role at a time, it becomes evident that there may be some <b>statuses</b> in society’s multi-dimensional structure that do not comfortably coexist.|$|R
40|$|Identity is a {{component}} of personality that can help people to use proper coping strategies through crisis circumstances. The purpose of {{present study was to}} predict anxiety and depression prevalence according to identity <b>statuses</b> among public library’s employees of Golestan Province. This descriptive and correlational study was performed in 96 public library’s employees in Golestan Province during 2014. Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status(OMEIS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale(DASS) were used as measurement instruments. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software, Multivariate Regression by stepwise method and Pierson correlation. Study on identity <b>statuses</b> and anxiety showed elevated anxiety scores for those in the foreclosure and diffusion identity <b>statuses</b> and elevated depression scores among those in the moratorium and diffusion Identity <b>statuses.</b> Findings indicate that prevalence of depression are predictable according to moratorium and diffusion identity <b>statuses</b> and anxiety prevalence are predictable according to foreclosure and diffusion identity <b>statuses...</b>|$|R

5|$|A town can {{be created}} from a village or resort village by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 52 of The Municipalities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 500 or more. Upon reaching a population of 5,000, a town's council may request the minister to change its <b>status</b> to a city in accordance with section 39 of The Cities Act. Should a town's population decline to less than 500, its council may request its <b>status</b> be reverted to village or resort village <b>status.</b>|$|E

30|$|We have {{presented}} {{a framework for}} through-wall human being detection under multiple <b>statuses</b> with P 410 UWB radar based on residual subspace projection theory. The work addressed the compressed sensing theory for dealing with incomplete UWB radar echoes. The experiments were tested under seven <b>statuses</b> for brick wall in complete data and compressed data. The results exploited {{the fact that the}} proposed algorithm could detect the human being through brick wall, but classification method should be studied for class the <b>statuses</b> further.|$|R

5|$|By September3, Tropical Depression Kristy {{was without}} {{persistent}} deep convection for about 18hours. However, thunderstorms increased around the center later that day, developing a shallow eye-like feature. The convection persisted {{along the western}} periphery of the circulation, and it is estimated Kristy re-attained tropical storm <b>status</b> about 24hours after it was first downgraded to depression <b>status.</b> Around the same time, the cyclone began a steady motion to the southwest. Its re-intensification was short-lived, as continued wind shear weakened the convection and left the center devoid of any thunderstorms. On September4, Kristy weakened to tropical depression <b>status,</b> and though quick dissipation was predicted, officials noted that intermittent convection flares could develop. One such convection flare occurred on September5, which persisted around the center and warranted Kristy being upgraded to tropical storm <b>status.</b> By that time, wind shear had decreased somewhat and the storm had turned westward, and with a track through warm water temperatures, Kristy was forecast to maintain tropical storm <b>status</b> for five days.|$|E

The treaty left the issue of Croatia's <b>status</b> to Hungary, and the <b>status</b> was resolved by the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, when kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united. The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while Rijeka retained the <b>status</b> of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779.|$|E
5|$|City <b>status</b> in Ireland {{is decided}} by {{legislative}} or royal charter. Dublin, with over 1 million {{residents in the}} Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City <b>status</b> does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is {{the seat of the}} Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city <b>status</b> by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that <b>status</b> in local government reforms of 1840).

5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua). Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner's tongkonan. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain their <b>status.</b> Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and <b>status</b> inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individuals <b>status.</b> Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E
