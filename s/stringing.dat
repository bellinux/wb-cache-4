5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by <b>stringing</b> together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like {{the object of a}} transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|The player may {{interact}} with and receive quests from the prison's residents, and earns information, tools and other rewards by completing quests. Violent conflict often occurs between the player, inmates and prison guards. The player attacks with Riddick's bare hands, or with improvised weapons such as shivs and clubs. Combos {{are created by}} <b>stringing</b> together punches. A DNA-scanning security system initially prevents Riddick from using firearms, but a limited arsenal later becomes available.|$|E

Ron approaches April and tells her that she should either forgive Andy or cut him loose, believing that she is only <b>stringing</b> Andy along and going to Indianapolis to spite him. When Andy returns, April finally forgives him and kisses him.|$|E

He is generally a soft-spoken boy who initially takes an interest in Shuichi, whom he believes to be a girl, when they first meet. When he learns that Shuichi is assigned male, Seya becomes angry at Maho for hiding this and <b>stringing</b> him along, but he soon reconciles with her and eventually starts dating her. Seya remains polite with Shuichi, though due to their initial meeting, there is always some awkwardness between the two.|$|E

5|$|Of {{all these}} fragmentary pre-Hellenistic sources, {{the most is}} known of Sophocles Troilos. Even so, only 54 words have been {{identified}} as coming from the play. Fragment 619 refers to Troilus as an andropais, a man-boy. Fragment 621 indicates that Troilus was going to a spring with a companion to fetch water or to water his horses. A scholion to the Iliad states that Sophocles has Troilus ambushed by Achilles while exercising his horses in the Thymbra. Fragment 623 indicates that Achilles mutilated Troilus' corpse by a method known as maschalismos. This involved preventing the ghost of a murder victim from returning to haunt their killer by cutting off the corpse's extremities and <b>stringing</b> them under its armpits. Sophocles is thought to have also referred to the maschalismos of Troilus in a fragment taken to be from an earlier play Polyxene.|$|E

5|$|Sercey's {{flagship}} {{during these}} operations was the 40-gun frigate Forte. Forte, commanded by the elderly Captain Hubert Le Loup de Beaulieu, {{had been built}} in 1794 based on the hull and frame of a ship of the line: the frigate weighed 1,400 tons bm, the largest purpose-built frigate at sea. The main battery of Forte consisted of 28 24-pounder long guns, only the second frigate ever built (after Pomone) which could manage such a heavy armament. This was augmented by fourteen 8-pounder long guns on the upper deck and eight 36-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, totaling 52 heavy cannon complemented by eight 1-pounder swivel guns. Uniquely, {{the sides of the}} ship were lined with cork matting to prevent splinters while the more common precaution had been taken of <b>stringing</b> netting over the deck to protect the crew from falling debris. The ship was however weakened by an ill-disciplined crew, and Sercey had expressed doubts about the ability of the aged Beaulieu.|$|E
