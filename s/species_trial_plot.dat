40|$|Agri-environment schemes (AES) are {{increasingly}} being employed to mitigate biodiversity loss in agricultural environments. The European Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur is an obligate granivorous bird in rapid decline within both the UK (− 96 % since 1970) and across continental Europe (− 77 % since 1980), despite widespread uptake of AES. Here, we assess the efficacy of a potentially new, sown agri-environment option designed to provide abundant, accessible seed for S. turtur during the breeding season. During summer 2011 we compared vegetation structure and seed provision on <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> to control habitat types (existing agri-environment options thought to potentially provide S. turtur foraging habitat) to assess whether <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> performed better for foraging S. turtur than control habitats. In September 2011 all <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> were topped (cut) and half of a subset of <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> were then scarified (60 % of soil surface disturbed). Vegetation structure on topped, and topped and scarified <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> was measured during summer 2012 to determine which management regime was most effective in maintaining suitable sward structure and seed provision into the second year. No control habitat type produced as much seed important in S. turtur diet as <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> at any point during year one. <b>Trial</b> <b>plots</b> provided accessible vegetation structure {{early in the season}} with no difference in vegetation metrics between <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> and previously published data on S. turtur foraging locations. However, to allow later access, management is required during mid-June to open up the sward through localized topping or scarification. Vegetation structure during year two was generally too dense to attract foraging S. turtur. However, scarifying <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> during the September following sowing encouraged self-seeding of Fumaria officinalis (a plant species historically forming a significant proportion of S. turtur diet during the breeding season) into the second year, with this species present in 16 % of scarified <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> compared to only 4 % of topped <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> during year two. Thus, autumn scarification, possibly followed by topping or scarification of part of the <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> in June, is necessary for <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> to provide more seed and access for S. turtur than existing agri-environment options during year two. We recommend modifications to our original seed mix in order to reduce vegetation density and improve vegetation structure. The study provides an example of the need to strike the right balance between food abundance and accessibility, through vegetation structure, when designing agri-environment scheme management options that provide food for birds...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing passive floodwater for spate {{irrigation}} in arid {{areas is}} an opportunity to use marginal water for production of crops. These techniques have only partially been studied in an extensive way. This paper describes a floodwater harvesting and spreading system for spate irrigation and field experiments for cultivation of barley. The field experiments were carried out during a three-year period. The area is noteworthy for its erratic and scarce rainfall. Due to the scarce and late rainfall, only in the second year experiment barley yield was achieved. On December 5, 2009, barley was planted in one <b>trial</b> <b>plot</b> and subsequently received spate irrigation on December 8. On December 16, 2009, barley was planted in a second <b>trial</b> <b>plot</b> and in a control plot outside the system. During the growth period, the second <b>trial</b> <b>plot</b> and the control plot only received moisture from rainfall. The total weight of barley seed and straw in the <b>trial</b> <b>plots</b> was about 1616 and 2052 kg ha- 1, respectively. The total weight of barley seed and straw in the control plot, however, was only about 821 kg ha- 1.

Two approaches {{were used to}} assess hardiness: the electrolyte-leakage method based on artificial freezing, and meas-urements of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. The frost injury index at- 20 °C differed between prove-nances, with a significant provenance-by-plot interaction.

30|$|The {{differences}} in initial height among species {{is probably the}} biggest factor in interspecies variation in the parameters measured for {{the early years of}} growth, though the physiological age of all species was roughly similar (Table  1). Species like alder, cherry, and oak were considerably larger at time of planting than radiata and Douglas-fir (Fig.  2), and this continued to show for the first year or two of growth in the <b>trial</b> <b>plot.</b> Rather than having planting materials of the same size and grade, our trial used “nursery-raised” planting grades as would normally be used by the forestry or “land management” sectors. This may have been a shortcoming in trial design. In hindsight, it would have been preferable for seedlings to have been of the same size/grade, though the growth in early years probably reflects the actual performance and practice of nursery-raised and supplied stock. However, in another trial but using native species, where size at planting and nursery treatment were highly variable, in the first 3 – 5 years no difference was found in survival or growth between plants raised in open-ground compared with those grown in larger containers for the shrub hardwood and monocot <b>species</b> <b>trialled</b> (Cole et al. 2014).|$|R

Dry, normal and wet fallow moisture treatments had no effect on nitrate-nitrogen accumulation in the 0 - 30 cm soil depth.

The location of the crop residue as a result of tillage treatment affected the rate of the nitrate-nitrogen accumulation during the various sampling intervals.

The PBI's shares in barley and wheat seed sales are explained, showing that the success with barley was largely a matter of serendipity, whereas the wheat programme followed a more normal pattern. For wheat, the causal chain, or recursive, model decomposes the well-documented link between research expenditures and increases in agricultural productivity into three stages. These are the effects of R&D expenditures on basic research output, measured by publications, the effect of publications and applied R&D expenditures on <b>trial</b> <b>plot</b> yields, and the diffusion of the <b>trial</b> <b>plot</b> technologies, which raises yields on farms. Applying the model to the PBI's wheat varieties allows estimation of the lag structures. In contrast to the results for aggregate agricultural research, for a single plant breeding programme alone there is a considerable lead time before there is any response, followed by a lag distribution {{only a few years}} long. The returns to the R&D investments are calculated from the causal chain model, from single equation estimates and by evaluating the yield advantage of the PBI varieties. All three approaches give consistent results, which show that the returns to barley and wheat alone were sufficient to support the entire PBI budget and still give rates of return to applied research of between 14 and 25 %. The return to the basic science expenditures of the John Innes Institute has a lower bound of 17 %, but must have been even higher than for the PBI if the other Institutes were taken into account.
