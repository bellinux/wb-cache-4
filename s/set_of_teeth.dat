5|$|In {{the primary}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{there are two}} types of incisors – centrals and laterals, and two types of molars – first and second. All primary teeth are {{normally}} later replaced with their permanent counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> grow through soon after birth.|$|E
50|$|A Zeiss key (also {{known as}} a Cruciform key) is {{a cross between a}} house key and a tubular key. It has three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> at 90 degrees to each other with a {{flattened}} fourth side. Though this type of key is easy to duplicate, the extra <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> deter lockpicking attempts.|$|R
50|$|Humans {{normally}} {{will produce}} two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> called primary dentition, or deciduous teeth, and secondary dentition, or permanent teeth.|$|R
50|$|A polyphyodont is {{any animal}} whose teeth are {{continually}} replaced. In contrast, diphyodonts {{are characterized by}} having only two successive <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded {{the question of}} whether or not, and to what degree, Heterodontosaurus showed the continuous tooth replacement that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls are worn uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly erupted teeth are absent. Further evidence was derived from the wear facets of the teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear facets were merged into one another, forming a continuous surface along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as Fabrosaurus. Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth are worn uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick abrasion of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that Heterodontosaurus must have replaced its entire <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of aestivation, when the animal did not fed. Aestivation also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce.|$|E

In one embodiment, a method of fabricating a strain wave gear includes: shaping a BMG-based material using a mold in conjunction with one of a thermoplastic forming technique and a casting technique; where the BMG-based material is shaped into one of: a wave generator plug, an inner race, an outer race, a rolling element, a flexspline, a flexspline without a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> gear <b>teeth,</b> a circular spline, a circular spline without a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> gear <b>teeth,</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> gear <b>teeth</b> to be incorporated within a flexspline, and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> gear <b>teeth</b> to be incorporated within a circular spline...|$|R
25|$|Some animals develop {{only one}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> (monophyodont) while others develop many sets (polyphyodont). Sharks, for example, grow a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> {{every two weeks}} to replace worn teeth. Rodent incisors grow and wear away {{continually}} through gnawing, which helps maintain relatively constant length. The industry of the beaver {{is due in part}} to this qualification. Many rodents such as voles and guinea pigs, but not mice, as well as leporidae like rabbits, have continuously growing molars in addition to incisors.|$|E

25|$|In many mammals {{the infants}} have a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> that fall out and are {{replaced}} by adult teeth. These are called deciduous teeth, primary teeth, baby teeth or milk teeth. Animals that have two sets of teeth, one followed by the other, {{are said to be}} diphyodont. Normally the dental formula for milk teeth is the same as for adult teeth except that the molars are missing.|$|E
50|$|Horse teeth {{refers to}} the {{dentition}} of equine species, including horses and donkeys. Equines are both heterodontous and diphyodontous, {{which means that they}} have teeth in more than one shape (there are up to five shapes <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> in a horse's mouth), and have two successive <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> the deciduous ("baby teeth") and permanent sets.|$|R
50|$|Entelodonts had full <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{including}} large canines, heavy incisors, {{and relatively}} simple, yet powerful, molars. These features suggest an omnivorous diet, {{similar to that}} of modern pigs. Like many other artiodactyls, they had cloven hooves, with two toes touching the ground, and the remaining two being vestigial.|$|R
50|$|Kif are bare-skinned, wrinkled, ash-grey, long-snouted rat-like bipedal hunters. They are {{the tallest}} {{species in the}} Compact, slender, fast and deadly. They are {{strictly}} predators, requiring live prey; they have two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> (outer for biting and inner for pulping—their throats are unfit for swallowing solid food) and retractable claws.|$|R
25|$|Animals whose {{teeth are}} all of the same type, such as most non-mammalian vertebrates, {{are said to have}} homodont {{dentition}}, whereas those whose teeth differ morphologically are said to have heterodont dentition. The dentition of animals with two successions of teeth (deciduous, permanent) is referred to as diphyodont, while the dentition of animals with only one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> throughout life is monophyodont. The dentition of animals in which the teeth are continuously discarded and replaced throughout life is termed polyphyodont.|$|E
25|$|Another early {{case was}} Doyle v. State, which {{occurred}} in Texas in 1954. The bite mark {{in this case}} was on a piece of cheese found at the crime scene of a burglary. The defendant was later asked to bite another piece of cheese for comparison. A firearms examiner and a dentist evaluated the bite marks independently and both concluded that the marks were made by the same <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b> The conviction in this case set the stage for bite marks found on objects and skin to be used as evidence in future cases.|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to {{be lost in the}} mouth. This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as malocclusion. Orthodontics may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Necrosuchus {{had a long}} jaw, with slender teeth. The {{first two}} <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> was large, the third is smaller, the fourth very large, the fifth through 10th small, the 11th through 13th {{increasing}} in size, with the 13th being nearly {{as large as the}} fourth, the remaining 14th through 18th teeth decrease in size.|$|R
50|$|The {{collection}} of watches is {{firmly in the}} Daniels style, as developed over a life-time’s work devoted to the further development of the mechanical time-keeper and the handmade watch. It is also the first Daniels production wristwatch to have been designed and made in its entirety on the Isle of Man. Launched by Daniels and Smith at Salon QP in 2010, it includes a development, conceived by Roger, to the original Co-axial design. Essentially this is through combining {{the upper and lower}} wheels into one, by adding raised teeth onto the lower wheel. This means that the co-axial escape wheel can now be made in one single operation, guaranteeing the concentricity <b>of</b> both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> with their pivot point. In addition, it also fixes the angular displacement between the two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> at the point of manufacture which removes potential set up errors.|$|R

500|$|While early grills {{could not}} be removed easily and {{involved}} reshaping the tooth itself to fit the grill, grills are today made from custom dental molds. [...] For more expensive grills, a dentist takes a mold of the wearer's front teeth with a quick set alginate. [...] A tooth mold is obtained by filling the alginate negative with buff stone, then the buff stone is used to fit the grill to the unique <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b> [...] However, for inexpensive novelty grills, a jeweler may make an impression by having the wearer bite into dental putty or wax softened in water, or the wearer may do this himself. [...] Such grills may be less comfortable or dependable than grills that are professionally fitted, and in several instances jewelers manufacturing grills in this manner {{have been charged with}} practicing dentistry without a license.|$|E
2500|$|Barracuda {{have long}} slender bodies {{typically}} about [...] long. They have a wicked <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> and are ferocious predators.
