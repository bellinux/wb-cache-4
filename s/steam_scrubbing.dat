40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems affecting geothermal fields is the abatement of hydrogen chloride contained in the vapor phase. If the chloride concentration exceeds a few ppmw, <b>steam</b> <b>scrubbing</b> must be provided in order to prevent corrosion of the gathering system and turbine failure. In some fields at Larderello, one {{of the most}} important geothermal areas in Italy, <b>steam</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is performed by injecting a caustic solution directly into the steam pipeline. In particular, the abatement system depends on absorption with chemical reaction of hydrogen chloride by a sodium hydroxide solution. This paper describes some of the Larderello power plant abatement systems and presents analyses of the different solutions adopted for this purpose. Finally, some simplified models for computing abatement efficiency in sprays, pipelines, static mixers, cyclones and vane type demisters—the equipment generally used in these plants—are proposed. The proposed models are able to predict the data measured in these power plants with good accuracy, and so they can be regarded as useful tools for designing new abatement systems or optimizing the existing ones...|$|E

When properly operated, these systems can yield steam purities equal to or greater than those encountered in areas of The Geysers where chloride corrosion is not a problem. Developments in corrosion monitoring techniques, steam sampling and analytical methodologies for trace impurities, and computer modeling of the fluid chemistry has been instrumental in the success of this technology...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} work and economic analyses {{required for a}} preliminary evaluation of EIC's Copper Sulfate Process {{for a range of}} geothermal steam conditions have been completed. A series of six scrubbing runs was carried out over a range of <b>steam</b> conditions and <b>scrub</b> solution compositions expected to represent the extremes likely to be encountered in practice and high degrees of H{sub 2 }S removal were obtained in all cases. Solids produced in these runs were subjected to liquid-solid separation and regeneration tests to determine the influence of scrubbing conditions on the kinetics of subsequent steps, and capital and operating cost estimates were developed for the extremes of conditions evaluated. Test results show, as expected, that the kinetics and stoichiometry of the scrubbing reactions are complex: the rates and extent of the primary and secondary reactions are functions of scrubber operating temperature (pressure), scrub solution pH and copper content, and solids residence time. Relative to The Geysers' average conditions, operation at higher pressures leads to increased H{sub 2 }S and decreased NH{sub 3 } removal efficiencies. At lower pressures, higher pH's and/or copper contents or longer vapor-liquid contact times are required to obtain comparable H{sub 2 }S removal efficiencies, while NH{sub 3 } removal efficiencies are improved at comparable pH's. The solids obtained from each scrubbing run were produced under a range of conditions since scrub solution compositions were varied, as was solids residence time throughout. Within the range of variables tested, the trend is toward improved liquid-solid separation behavior for solids produced at higher pressures. Even though the range of compression times varied by a factor of two, the solids produced at the lowest pressures still settled rapidly enough and with sufficient overflow clarity to indicate that simple decantation would be the optimum approach for this step. The results of regeneration tests on these solids were much more variable, however, showing a definite correlation between scrubbing conditions and regeneration kinetics: solids produced at lower pressures were more readily regenerated than those produced at higher pressures. While complete regeneration was obtained in all cases, the times required varied by a factor of five at equal reaction temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. We believe that both liquid-solid separation and regeneration kinetics are determined {{by the nature of the}} solids formed in the scrubber, particularly the specific surface or average particle size, as well as their chemical composition...|$|R
40|$|In 1975, {{negotiations}} were initiated with two major resource developers toward initiating power plant projects at {{three of the}} Imperial Valley resource areas, Brawley, Salton Sea and Heber. The projects at Brawley and Salton Sea are substantially different from that at Heber in objective, size and design. The reasons for these differences {{are related to the}} different nature of the geothermal brines and to different operating philosophies of the resource developers involved. The projects at Brawley and Salton Sea include the construction and operation by Edison of 10 MW (gross) units. The contracts with the field developer for these resources are such that Edison will purchase steam. It is, therefore, the developer's responsibility to drill and complete the geothermal production and injection wells, and to construct and operate the steam separators and flash vessels, brine processing equipment, injection pumps, and <b>steam</b> <b>scrubbing</b> equipment. These units are 10 MW rather than 50 to 100 MW due to the technical risks associated with producing, handling and injecting the very high salinity brines at these locations. In addition, the reliability of turbine operation with relatively impure steam is a major concern. The Heber plant, on the other hand, will utilize a much cleaner resource. The technical risk is, therefore, judged to be substantially lower. The plant at Heber will be a commercial 45 MW unit. Edison will buy brine, and will own and operate all of the brine handling equipment except for the wells and collection manifolds...|$|E
