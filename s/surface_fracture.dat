40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} the surface of metals is strongly affected by <b>surface</b> <b>fracture</b> occurring {{in the process of}} mechanical shearing, especially in shaper-type cutting performed for the application of ultra-fine optical manufacturing and several types of nanotechnology. This discussion aims to elucidate the tribological behavior of pure Cu. In ultra-precise cutting, the physics of crystallographic interfaces is extremely important for controlling <b>surface</b> <b>fracture</b> behavior. In this study, <b>surface</b> <b>fracture</b> behavior was evaluated using single crystal copper cut in two different directions (along the (100) and (111) planes). For V-shaped groove cutting, the flat copper surface was cut with a diamond-tip cutting tool (with a V angle of 90 °, a rake angle of 0 °, and an escape angle of 7 °) at a machining speed of 4 - 4000 mm/min and a cutting depth of 0. 2 - 10 m. The machined surface was observed with a laser scanning microscope and compared with two groove shapes, in which the cutting grooves in the two cutting directions were found to be different. This result was considered to depend on whether the cutting tool moved along the slip planes { 111 }, which are oriented in the direction. In the case of shallow cutting (under 1 m), the springback behavior became apparent for cutting in the slip plane direction, where the mechanism of this behavior would be associated with the interface between slip-plane fractures created by the cutting tool...|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that small additions of SiC to alumina can significantly improve both the surface finish for a given grinding treatment, and the resistance to severe wear. This paper describes experiments designed to obtain {{a clearer understanding of}} the mechanisms involved by correlating quantitative measurements of <b>surface</b> <b>fracture</b> during a standard abrasive wear test with the wear rate for a range of microstructures. The <b>surface</b> <b>fracture</b> parameters measured were (i) the proportion of the surface in which pieces of material had been removed by brittle fracture, and (ii) the size (equivalent circular diameter and depth) of the individual pullouts. Microstructures with systematic variations in grain size, SiC volume fraction, SiC particle size, SiC position (inter- or intra-granular) and sintering aids were tested. The results indicate that the reduction in wear rate on adding SiC or. reducing the grain size is caused by a reduction in the area fraction of surface pullout by brittle fracture. For low SiC contents (similar to 2 vol%), this reduction in surface pullout is a consequence of the reduction in size of the individual pullouts. For higher SiC contents (10 vol%), there is evidence that the nucleation of surface cracking is also inhibited. The underlying micromechanisms responsible for these effects are discussed...|$|E
