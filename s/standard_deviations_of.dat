25|$|In {{practical}} usage, {{in contrast}} to the 68–95–99.7 rule, which applies to normal distributions, Chebyshev's inequality is weaker, stating that a minimum of just 75% of values must lie within two <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> the mean and 89% within three standard deviations.|$|E
25|$|An {{observation}} is rarely {{more than a}} few standard deviations away from the mean. Chebyshev's inequality ensures that, for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined, the amount of data within a number of <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> the mean is {{at least as much as}} given in the following table.|$|E

25|$|For {{estimating}} {{the standard deviation}} of a normal distribution, the scaled interdecile range gives a reasonably efficient estimator, though instead taking the 7% trimmed range (the difference between the 7th and 93rd percentiles) and dividing by 3 (corresponding to 86% of the data of a normal distribution falling within 1.5 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> the mean) yields an estimate of about 65% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{linearity}} of the zROC curve {{depends on}} the <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> the target and lure strength distributions. If the standard deviations are equal, the slope will be 1.0. If the standard deviation of the target strength distribution {{is larger than the}} standard deviation of the lure strength distribution, then the slope will be smaller than 1.0. In most studies, it has been found that the zROC curve slopes constantly fall below 1, usually between 0.5 and 0.9. Many experiments yielded a zROC slope of 0.8. A slope of 0.8 implies that the variability of the target strength distribution is 25% larger than the variability of the lure strength distribution.|$|E
25|$|Divergence Angle: The {{representative}} {{range of}} leeway angles for {{a category of}} leeway objects. It can be calculated by obtaining the net leeway angle over time for a specific leeway object’s drift trajectory, and then averaging again {{for a series of}} leeway drift trajectories of a number of leeway objects in a leeway category, to determine the mean leeway angle and standard deviation of the leeway angle for the category. Divergence angle is then calculated as twice the standard deviation of the leeway angle, or mean plus one standard deviation of the leeway angle, or mean plus two <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> the leeway angle depending on the particular study.|$|E

25|$|In {{probability}} theory, Chebyshev's inequality (also spelled as Tchebysheff's inequality, , {{also called}} Bienaymé-Chebyshev inequality) guarantees that, {{for a wide}} class of probability distributions, {{no more than a}} certain fraction of values can be more than a certain distance from the mean. Specifically, no more than 1/k2 of the distribution's values can be more than k standard deviations away from the mean (or equivalently, at least 1−1/k2 of the distribution's values are within k <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> the mean). The rule is often called Chebyshev's theorem, about the range of standard deviations around the mean, in statistics. The inequality has great utility because it can be applied to any probability distribution in which the mean and variance are defined. For example, {{it can be used to}} prove the weak law of large numbers.|$|E
