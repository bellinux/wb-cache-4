40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} has {{for many}} years been pointed out as a key action for reduction of greenhouse gases. “One of the initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy is the flagship resource-efficient Europe adopted by the Commission on 26 January 2011. This identifies energy efficiency as a major element in ensuring the sustainability {{of the use of}} energy resources” according to The European Parliament and The Council. One of the reasons for a new directive is that the Union is unlikely to achieve its energy efficiency target of 20 % primary energy savings by 2020, and concomitant reduction of greenhouse gases, based on the current policy mix. All Member States shall set up measures in order to use energy more efficiently at all stages of the energy chain including total renovation of the national building stock in the residential and tertiary sector, in both public and private buildings, and nor the industry neither the existing built heritage are exempt. The Swedish mandatory provisions already treat new constructions and existing buildings as equivalent in terms of energy demands when applying for building permit e. g. in alteration projects. The energy requirements may be waived by 20 % if there are special cultural and historic values but the demands are set so high that it is likely that very few buildings can manage to meet them, even if total renovation and refurbishment are carried out. There is also a Swedish law, and a regulation, and mandatory provisions on energy declarations where buildings with cultural and historic values are not exempt. Cost efficient energy measures should be suggested to the real estate owner but it is optional to follow them. A national energy rating is intended to be introduced in connection to the <b>summary</b> of the <b>declaration.</b> Inventories made in the County of Halland, Sweden, in the 1990 s had about 3000 buildings and included objects representing the social, technological and industrial development of society and all social classes.

The inventory is available for everybody online. In light of the new inventories on built heritge and the new legislation on energy efficiency it is clear that there will be difficulties with the safeguarding and in managing both preservation and energy efficiency in our built heritage.

40|$|This is an {{empirical}} investigation. At {{the beginning of}} 2014, for the first time, the European Union co-chaired meetings with Myanmar, which it hosted in Brussels within the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) of which Myanmar has been part since 2004. ARF is the ‘only multilateral political and security dialogue forum in the AsiaPacific where the EU has its own seat’ (EEAS). For this reason and because the European Union {{is not a major}} actor in the region in terms of security affairs (Stumbaun 2014, 111), the EU holds a specific interest in ARF. At the meetings in Brussels, it was planned to discuss ‘various aspects of security cooperation in Asia’, including ‘humanitarian assistance and disaster relief’ (EIAS 2014). These, and other events, suggested that a Myanmar-EU security connection exists and motivated the interest in tracing the EU’s efforts, in the ARF arena, to encouraging Myanmar to tie in with the security link. This paper, therefore, focuses on two research questions: how has the European Union interacted with Myanmar via ASEAN, at the Forum, trying (directly or indirectly) to induce Myanmar’s junta towards connecting with cooperation in the area of security, as opposed to its preferred ‘non-interference policy’? Since the dialogue and many of the training activities in the ARF framework concerned crisis management and disaster relief capacity building, Cyclone Nargis, which hit Myanmar in 2008, is taken as a test case to explore whether Myanmar and ASEAN’s reactions to the devastation caused certain processes to emerge which can be linked to the EU. The second question is: as the EU sought to convince Myanmar to compromise and accept cooperation, has Myanmar hit by Cyclone Nargis caused some consequences on the EU and its security policy, and, if so, how? Interpretations borrowed from March and Olsen (1995, 1998, 2004) and Checkel (1999, 2005) will contribute towards answering the two key questions. The EU’s quest to encourage security cooperation is investigated in light of the ARF meetings that it co-chaired with ASEAN during 2004 - 2008. The first date is justified by Myanmar being admitted to ARF and the second by Cyclone Nargis afflicting Myanmar. Lacking access to the informal minutes of these meetings, interviews on motivation will serve to compensate for the limited sources which are the ARF co-chairs’ <b>summary</b> reports. Official <b>declarations</b> by the Commission, the Council and the EU together with ASEAN will indicate the EU’s ‘intentional policies’ at the Forum level. The investigation includes no specific focus on the Forum itself in terms of assessing its operation, on the domestic level of analysis, on the decision-making processes, nor on the participants in the ASEAN Regional Forum who were different from the ASEAN group, Myanmar and the EU. It offers no hint at other frameworks of security consultation in Asia in which the EU might be involved, and pays no attention either to whether Myanmar was somehow connected with cooperation in the area of security, or to the EU’s efforts to encourage Myanmar to compromise, both up to the current position...|$|R
40|$|B 4 galnt 2 is a blood group-related glycosyltransferase {{expressed}} in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of most mammals. However, cis-regulatory variation at B 4 galnt 2 in house mice leads to different tissue-specific expression patterns affecting intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium according to the alleles present in the direct upstream region (”C 57 BL 6 /J”’ or ”‘RIIIS/J” allele, respectively). Blood vessel expression of B 4 galnt 2 leads to a phenotype in mice very similar to a common human bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease, but the consequences of altered expression in the intestine are unknown. This dissertation combines poulation genetics with metagenomics {{with respect to the}} B 4 galnt 2 gene in natural populations of mice and enlightens the role of biogeography in shaping intestinal micriobial communities in general. The population genetic study of the B 4 galnt 2 gene in all three subspecies of M. musculus (i. e. M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus) and the sister species M. spretus revealed the long-term maintenance of different allele classes present in the direct upstream region of B 4 galnt 2. Varying expression patterns could be identified to be present for > 2. 8 MY, since the divergence of M. famulus. The finding, that gut expression was conserved in all mice exhibiting the C 57 BL 6 /J allele lead to the suggestion the the gut is a likely target of selection. It is known, that glycosylation profiles in the GI tract can influence both symbiotic/commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Together with the long-term maintenance of alleles conferring differences in B 4 galnt 2 expression suggests that host-pathogen interactions in the gut are likely involved. As not much was known about the biogeographic influences on the intestinal microbiota we described and thus shed light on the effect of different factors (i. e. geography, host population structure, maternal transmission) on them. We performed a survey of eight house mouse populations throughout western Europe, by applying high throughput pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene, we obtained the microbiota composition of those mice, microsatellites were used for estimating hosts population structure and sequencing of the mitochondrial D-loop region for the inference of maternal inheritance. Geography was found to be the most dominant factor shaping the bacterial composition, followed by host population structure and the interaction of both. Additionally we could identify several bacterial ”species” which showed significant correlation to the underlying population structure of their host, maternal lineages and geography. We also performed a survey of B 4 galnt 2 allele frequencies of the eight sampled populations in France and Germany. We detected a clear pattern of allele frequency distribution with a clear decline of the RIIIS/J allele frequency in central France, where we would thus locate the selective pressure(s). To shed light on the population dynamics concerning B 4 galnt 2 allele frequencies we analysed the frequency distribution pattern according to population substructure (as estimated by microsatellites and mtDNA). To follow up on the question of possible phenotypic consequences of B 4 galnt 2 expression, likely on the intestinal microbiota, we analysed the gut microbiota composition according to B 4 galnt 2 genotype by keeping in mind the newly gained insights of Chapter 2. This survey allowed us to infer that local adaptation is the most likely explanation for these dramatic differences in allele frequencies, rather than population substructure (e. g. due to different colonization waves). We could also confirm the influence of B 4 galnt 2 expression on the microbiota composition in wild-caught mice as already described for lab mice. A direct pathogen-genotype association could not be detected, which might be due to our sampling size. By identifying the long-term maintenance of different B 4 galnt 2 expression patterns and elucidating the role of biogeography on the intestinal microbiota we were able to further characterize the evolutionary forces acting at B 4 galnt 2. We shed light on the complex dynamics acting at the B 4 galnt 2 gene, but, until the beneficial consequence(s) of exhibiting the RIIIS/J allele is known, the story of B 4 galnt 2 will remain a mystery and has to be further explored.

40|$|One of {{the main}} themes in {{evolutionary}} biology is the characterization of the molecular basis of adaptation. A prerequisite for adaptation {{is the presence of}} heritable variation in the form of functionally distinct alleles which have differential effects on the lifetime reproductive success of an organism. That is why a lot of effort has been made in recent years to identify genes that are under positive selection and thus involved in adaptive processes in natural populations of different species. Through comprehensive genetic screens a large number of such candidate genes have been identified. However, knowledge about the allelic variation, its molecular function and phenotypic effects remains still rare. In this study, I took advantage of data about candidate genes for selective sweeps from previous hitchhiking mapping studies in four European wild mouse (Mus musculus L.) populations and of the extensive knowledge about mice through years of lab mouse research. Two candidate genes, namely Xpr 1 and Dmrt 1, with a generally well characterized function were analyzed to gain information about potential functional alleles, their variation and extent of the selective sweep across different populations and possible functional effects of the different alleles. Xpr 1 is a cell-surface receptor which is especially known for its function in infection of cells by polytropic and xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (X/P-MLVs), which can cause leukemia and lymphomas in mice. The transcription factor Dmrt 1 is a highly conserved member of the sex determination cascade in vertebrates and required for normal gonadal differentiation in mice. For both genes, I focused on coding sequence variation as potential target of positive selection in 11 wild mouse populations and several outgroups. Analyzed M. m. domesticus populations came from France, Germany and Iran, while the M. m. musulus populations came from Czech Republic and Kazakhstan. Additionally, microsatellites in a region of 200 kb around both loci were analyzed to survey the extent of the originally identified selective sweeps across populations. For the analysis of potential functional effects of the identified alleles, information about the general function of the genes was used. The two genes showed coding sequence variation among the populations. For Xpr 1, 14 different alleles were identified which occurred as haplotypes. Two of these alleles were associated to a signature of positive selection and an introgression of one of these haplotypes from Iran to Southern France was observed. Furthermore, evidence for balancing selection on two haplotypes in three other populations was found. Analysis of potential functional effects of the receptor alleles focused in associations between these alleles and variation in transcribed P-MLVs in captive mice. However, no association could be found and no infectious virions were detected. Together with finding from previous studies, the here obtained results suggest that Xpr 1 variation in wild mouse populations is shaped by ongoing adaptive evolution, but that to current knowledge other factors than disease induction by XPR 1 -dependent MLVs might drive this process. For Dmrt 1, one amino acid exchange between Asparagine (N) and Serine (S) was observed, while data from other studies suggested that no differential expression or alternative splicing occurred. N seemed to be the derived allele and generated a potential N-linked glycosylation site. It was also found to be potentially under positive selection in five populations from France. The functional analysis focused on potential differences in target gene regulation due to the different Dmrt 1 alleles. In a comparative microarray-based analysis across early postnatal stages I found that differential transcription of Dmrt 1 target genes was increased between the different alleles when Dmrt 1 was present. This result together with the population genetic data suggests that there is possibly a functional difference between the N and S allele that could be the target of positive selection, though more analyses will be necessary to gain insights into the potential beneficial nature of the N allele.
