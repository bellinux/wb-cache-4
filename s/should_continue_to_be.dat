However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English {{because that was the}} language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Kenneth Clarke, {{then the}} Secretary of State for Transport, stated that, since {{the route of}} the M3 was then fixed as far as Bar End, to the north of St. Catherine's Hill, that its route from there to Compton would undergo a fresh study, {{specifically}} stating that the Winchester Bypass <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> operational during construction of any new road, and that environmental matters were a key concern. By February 1983, consulting engineers Mott Hay and Anderson had submitted a recommendation to complete the M3 through Twyford Down. Following the completion of the motorway to Bar End in the summer of 1985, the junction at Hockley was the only set of traffic lights between London and Southampton.|$|E

5|$|HMAS Waller, {{the third}} of the RAN's Collins-class {{submarines}} to enter service, was commissioned on 10July 1999. The attendees included John Waller, Michael Waller's wife, and surviving crewmen of HMAS Perth. On 13March 2010, a memorial to Waller was unveiled in his home town of Benalla. In April 2011, {{he was one of}} thirteen servicemen—eleven sailors and two soldiers, including Teddy Sheean, Robert Rankin, and John Simpson Kirkpatrick—named by the Australian government for consideration as possible recipients of the Victoria Cross for extreme valour in combat, under a review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN member had ever been awarded the decoration. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, but that the name Waller (among others) <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for RAN ships after the current bearer was decommissioned.|$|E

25|$|The local media, {{especially}} the daily tabloid The New Paper, began to sensationalise homosexual activities with attention-grabbing headlines like 'Pool Perverts on the Loose' and 'Gays surface again at East Coast beach'. In 1992, the Censorship Review Committee recommended that 'materials encouraging homosexuality <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disallowed.'

A 2016 review of the literature said that the potential harms caused by BPA were a topic of scientific debate and that further investigation was a priority because of the association between BPA exposure and adverse human health effects including reproductive and developmental effects and metabolic disease.|$|E

25|$|The airline {{suffered}} from a general mistrust both from the German and Allied authorities. The Germans generally did not trust any shipowners, since these had their fleet organized in Nortraship and used in Allied convoys. The Norwegian authorities in exile were also distrustful of DNL, because the airline had taken initiative to operate a route, essentially helping the German forces. There was also an uncertainty {{as to whether the}} national airline of Norway <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> private, or if a state-owned airline should be established. To look at the issue, the Norwegian authorities-in-exile established the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board to look at all matters regarding civil aviation. It was this board which was permitted to negotiate traffic rights with other countries, make purchase rights of aircraft and participated in the foundation of the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Swedish intercontinental airline, Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik managed to purchase ten Douglas DC-4 {{at the end of the}} war; they had initially planned on selling some to DDL and DNL, but were not permitted to negotiate any agreements with DNL.|$|E

25|$|The Internal Security Act, {{among other}} things, authorizes the Minister for Home Affairs {{to make an}} order {{directing}} that a person be detained {{for up to two}} years at a time if the President is satisfied that the detention is necessary to prevent the person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or the maintenance of public order or essential services. A detained person is entitled to make representations to an advisory board made up of a chairman appointed by the President who is or has been, or is qualified to be, a Supreme Court Judge, and two other members appointed by the President after consulting with the Chief Justice. An advisory board must consider the representations and make recommendations to the President within three months from the date of detention. If an advisory board recommends that a detainee be released, and the government authority on whose advice or order the person was detained disagrees with the board's recommendation, the President has a personal discretion as to whether the person <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detained.

Kenney gave him responsibility for all Allied air operations south of the Philippines, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) units which were based in the Solomon Islands to support the Bougainville Campaign were assigned to RAAF Command. Bostock wrote to Kenney, [...] "I am particularly anxious that the 1st Tactical Air Force <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> employed as a forward offensive formation {{rather than in a}} garrison role". In April, Kenney's Allied Air Headquarters issued an order that Bostock would be named Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAAF Command, because he had several Air Officers Commanding (AOCs) reporting to him.

500|$|B.telmatiaea is {{a fairly}} secure species, as most populations are of more than 100 plants, and 26% of known plants are in {{conservation}} reserves. Its proximity to Perth suggests that land clearing for urban development could pose a threat, and in 1988 The Banksia Atlas recommended that [...] "the species <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> monitored since land clearing could change the situation greatly, particularly amongst its northern populations." [...] It is also known to be susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; {{in fact it is}} so reliably susceptible that it used as an indicator species for the presence of the disease. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction; but under less severe change scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E

Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters {{are going to get}} fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because this is obviously going to be a character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you."
