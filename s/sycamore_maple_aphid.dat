40|$|Competition for {{nitrogen}} (N), {{particularly in}} resource-limited habitats, might {{be avoided by}} different N acquisition strategies of plants. In our study, we investigated whether slow-growing European beech and fast-growing <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> seedlings avoid competition for growth-limiting N by different N uptake patterns and the potential alteration by soil N availability in a microcosm experiment. We quantified growth and biomass indices, 15 N uptake capacity and N pools in the fine roots. Overall, growth indices, N acquisition and N pools in the fine roots were influenced by species-specific competition depending on soil N availability. With interspecific competition, growth of <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> reduced regardless of soil N supply, whereas beech only showed reduced growth when N was limited. Both species responded to interspecific competition by alteration of N pools in the fine roots; however, <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> showed a stronger response compared to beech for almost all N pools in roots, except for structural N at low soil N availability. Beech generally preferred organic N acquisition while <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> took up more inorganic N. Furthermore, with interspecific competition, beech had an enhanced organic N uptake capacity, while in <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> inorganic N uptake capacity was impaired {{by the presence of}} beech. Although <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> could tolerate the suboptimal conditions at the cost of reduced growth, our study indicates its reduced competitive ability for N compared to beech...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (McAbs) generated against rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) purified from suspension-cultured <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells {{fall into}} three recognition groups. Four McAbs (group I) recognize an epitope {{that appears to}} be immunodominant and is present on RG-I from maize and <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple,</b> pectin and polygalacturonic acid from citrus, gum tragacanth, and membrane glycoproteins from suspension-cultured cells of maize, tobacco, parsley, bean, and <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple.</b> A second set of McAbs (group II) recognizes an epitope present in <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> RG-I but does not bind to any of the other polysaccharides or glycoproteins recognized by group I. Lastly, one McAb, CCRC-M 1 (group III), binds to RG-I and more strongly to xyloglucan (XG) from <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> but not to maize RG-I, citrus polygalacturonic acid, or to the plant membrane glycoproteins recognized by group I. The epitope to which CCRC-M 1 binds has been examined in detail. Ligand competition assays using a series of oligosaccharides derived from or related to <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> XG demonstrated that a terminal alpha-(1 [...] > 2) -linked fucosyl residue constitutes {{an essential part of the}} epitope recognized by CCRC-M 1. Oligosaccharides containing this structural motif compete with intact <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> XG for binding to the antibody, whereas structurally related oligosaccharides, which do not contain terminal fucosyl residues or in which the terminal fucosyl residue is linked alpha-(1 [...] > 3) to the adjacent glycosyl residue, do not compete for the antibody binding site. The ligand binding assays also indicate that CCRC-M 1 binds to a conformationally dependent structure of the polysaccharide. Other results of this study establish that some of the carbohydrate epitopes of the plant extracellular matrix are shared among different macromolecules...|$|R

40|$|The {{wavy grain}} of wood {{expressed}} in fiddleback figure usually enhances its commercial value. The goal {{of this study was}} to analyse fiddleback figure and other log characteristics in <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and their contribution to the price of the timber. We studied <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> logs at the annual auction of the highest quality wood assortments in Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia. Measurements were performed on the logs and wavy grain was analysed in 2013. In addition, data were used on logs auctioned between 2007 and 2012. Using the data collected at the auction in 2013 and a binary logistic regression model, the original sample was expanded considerably. The percentage of fi ddleback maple was 7. 4 % at the auction in 2013. Larger volume of maple logs was on average linked to higher price; however, the presence of fiddleback figure in a log per se did not guarantee above average price. Prices of more than half of the fiddleback figured maple logs at the auction in 2013 were below average. On the other hand, large fiddleback logs achieved the highest prices. Trees with fiddleback figure proved to be evenly distributed throughout the entire population of <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> in Slovenia. The geographic origin of <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> did not influence the occurrence of fiddleback figure. The presented results appear to be representative of the occurrence of fiddleback figure in Acer pseudoplatanus throughout its entire distribution range...|$|R

The study was carried out in 130 -year-old mixed stand located within natural range of studied tree species. The density of roots (g/ 100 cm 3 of soil) and biomass of fine roots (g/m 2) in topsoil layers (0 - 5 cm, 5 - 15 cm) were determined in the tree biogroups of the same species. The mean total root density ranged from 0. 248 to 0. 417 g/ 100 cm 3 in the 0 - 5 cm soil layer, and it decreased in the deeper soil layer (5 - 15 cm). There were found no statistically significant differences of total root densities between tree biogroups in topsoil layers. Diversity of fine root biomass was comparable in the tree biogroups (H’ = 1. 5), but common beech showed more intensive growth of fine roots in the topsoil 0 - 15 cm when compared to sessile oak and <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple.</b> The results of the study point out the stability of the multi-species structure of the mixed stand studied, and consequently - the ability of beech, sessile oak and <b>sycamore</b> <b>maple</b> trees to coexist in the mixed stands - in the area of natural range of these species...|$|R
