The method of obtaining ozone concentrations from ground-based observations of eclipsing satellites is described, the theory of this method is outlined, and the data reduction procedure is summarized. It is shown that the <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipse</b> technique successfully measures the vertical distribution of ozone from 15 to 40 km with precisions ranging from + or - 12 % between 20 and 35 km and + or - 25 % at both 15 and 40 km.

25|$|The {{timing of}} the Jovian <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipses</b> was also used to {{calculate}} an observer's longitude upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as Greenwich), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse.

Many of the data had been presumed to be lost {{for more than a century}} and since they are very valuable for discussion of long-term effects on the satellites, they are presented here for present as well as future generations of astronomers.

50|$|The related {{phenomenon}} of <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipses</b> {{in the shadow}} of Jupiter has been observed since the time of Giovanni Cassini and Ole Rømer in the mid Seventeenth Century. It was soon noticed that predicted times differed from observed times in a regular way, varying from up to ten minutes early to up to ten minutes late. Rømer used these errors to make the first accurate determination of the speed of light, correctly realizing that the variations were caused by the varying distance between Earth and Jupiter as the two planets moved in their orbits around the Sun.|$|R
30|$|All {{satellites}} fail {{to maintain}} their nominal orientation when their orbits pass close to the Earth-Sun axis. These are the eclipsing orbits with turns at both orbit noon and orbit midnight. During a <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipse,</b> Block II GPS satellites behaved unpredictably because of hardware sensitivity, spinning beyond the nominal amount upon entering the sun’s shadow. The Block IIR and Block IIF generations of satellites were designed to be able {{to maintain their}} nominal attitude even during orbit noon and orbit midnight (Bar-Sever 1996; Dilssner et al. 2011). For Block IIR, the yaw maneuver is constrained by a maximum yaw rate of 0.2  deg./s (Kouba 2009) and Block IIF is constrained by a maximum yaw rate of 0.11  deg./s (Dilssner 2010). The attitude model of the GPS satellites affects the computation of measurement geometry through variations of the transmitter phase center location and carrier-phase measurement wind-up. It also affects the modelling of the solar radiation pressure force acting on the GPS satellites due to the changes in illumination geometry (Kuang et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present {{research}} concerns {{on the study}} of laser-powered solar panels used for space applications. A mathematical model representing the laser effects on semiconductors has been developed. The temperature behavior and heat flow on the surface and through a slab has been studied after exposed to nano-second pulsed laser. The model is applied on two different types of common active semiconductor materials that used for photovoltaic cells fabrication as silicon (Si), and gallium arsenide (GaAs). These materials are used for receivers’ manufacture for laser beamed power in space. Various values of time are estimated to clarify the heat flow through the material sample and generated under the effects of pulsed laser irradiation. These effects are theoretically studied {{in order to determine the}} performance limits of the solar cells when they are powered by laser radiation during the <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipse.</b> Moreover, the obtained results are carried out to optimize conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells and may be helpful to give more explanation for layout of the light-electricity space systems...|$|E
40|$|We report here static {{electric}} field measurements in the equatorial plane from the 100 -m double floating probe experiment {{carried on the}} SCATHA (P- 78 - 2) <b>satellite.</b> <b>Eclipse</b> measurements on auroral L shells are studied {{to better understand the}} change in magnetospheric convection at the plasmapause. The use of eclipse data allows the {{electric field}}s to be measured directly without contamination from the spacecraft photoelectron sheath; and it allows the thermal ion population in the outer plasmasphere to be observed, identifying the satellite location with respect to the plasmapause. (Such measurements are limited to near local midnight.) We find that in the corotating frame there is generally an electric field component in the antisolar direction during periods of low magnetic activity which begins {{at the edge of the}} plasmasphere and builds in amplitude as the satellite enters the plasma sheet. The amplitude of this electric field varies from 0. 05 mV/m to 0. 2 mV/m with increasing magnetic activity; the electric field switches to radially inward during periods of high activity with magnitudes up to 2 mV/m. The amplitude of the observed electric field increases with the amount of contribution from east-west currents in the earth's plasma sheet—magnetotail current system. Since the electric fields observed on these eclipse passes are radially outward in the midnight meridian during periods of low activity and since they are observed on a near-synchronous satellite which generally corotates with the earth, they are not included in most modeling studies of the formation of the plasmasphere...|$|E

25|$|From these {{estimates}} of the orbital periods of Io and the other Galilean moons, astronomers hoped to generate ephemeris tables predicting the positions of each moon with respect to Jupiter, as well as when each moon would transit the face of Jupiter or be eclipsed by it. One benefit of such predictions, particularly those of <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipses</b> by Jupiter since they were subject to less observer error, would be determining an observer's longitude on Earth {{with respect to the}} prime meridian. By observing an eclipse of a Jovian satellite, an observer could determine the current time at the prime meridian by looking up the eclipse in an ephemeris table. Io was particularly useful for this purpose since its shorter orbital period and closer distance to Jupiter made eclipses more frequent and less affected by Jupiter's axial tilt. Knowing the time at the prime meridian and the local time, the observer's longitude could then be calculated. Galileo attempted to produce a table predicting the positions of the Jovian <b>satellites</b> and <b>eclipse</b> timings after he negotiated first with Spain and then with The Netherlands to create a system for measuring longitude at sea using eclipse timings. However, he was never able to generate accurate predictions far enough ahead in time to be useful so he never published his tables. This left the tables published by Simon Marius in Mundus Iovialis and Giovanni Battista Hodierna in 1654 as the most accurate ephemeris tables available, even though they too were unable to predict the moons' positions with sufficient accuracy.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines {{several new}} {{observations of the}} Io sodium cloud to create a consistent picture of the extended Io atmosphere and its interaction with the Jovian plasma torus. I used the LPL echelle spectrograph to obtain three types of high-resolution spectra of the extended sodium cloud at the sodium D-lines (5890, 5896 Å). The first class of observations made use of the mutual <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipses</b> of 1985 to probe the density profile of {{the atmosphere in the}} range 1. 4 to 10 Io radii, a previously unstudied region. The second type of observation examined the sodium emission in Io's immediate vicinity, allowing an accurate measurement of the velocity structure around Io. The final method employed a high-sensitivity detector to study faint jets of high-speed sodium farther out in the extended cloud. The synthesis of these three data sets results in {{a better understanding of how}} sodium is distributed about Io as a function of position and velocity. Io's extended atmosphere is composed of many kinematically distinct components. The distribution in space is linked to their characteristic velocities, with low-energy sodium confined near Io and faster atoms (10 to 100 km sec⁻¹) prevalent beyond ∼ 25 Io radii. The sodium density profile is steep near Io and shallower outside 5. 6 Io radii, the effective limit of Io's gravity. The data indicate that the atmosphere is collisionally thick near the surface, but becomes thin by an altitude of ∼ 700 km. The upper limit of the exobase location is derived from reliable sodium density measurements made during the <b>satellite</b> <b>eclipses.</b> The lower limit is indirectly inferred from the velocity distribution of sodium near Io and the nature of high-speed jets far from Io. The high-speed sodium jets reveal a new type of close interaction between the corotating plasma and Io's atmosphere. The morphology and brightness of the jets require a two-reaction process, in which atmospheric sodium is ionized, accelerated to high speeds, and then charge-exchanges with other sodium atoms. These processes must occur near the atmospheric exobase, indicating that Io's atmosphere is not completely protected from the plasma flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of BeiDou <b>satellite</b> orbits during <b>eclipse</b> periods {{is an important}} part of the performance analysis of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). Accuracy evaluation of satellite orbits in ephemeris of BDS during eclipse periods can provide support for the service performance assessment. It also helps to find possible deficiencies in the orbit modeling during eclipse periods, which may further contribute to the improvements of functional models for precise orbit determination. The effects of eclipse periods on the orbits of the three types of satellites of BDS are analyzed with the satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations ranging from January 2014 to July 2015. At the same time, the orbit radial accuracy of BDS broadcast and precise ephemeris are validated. The results show that, obvious orbit accuracy decrease can be observed in both broadcast and precise ephemeris for IGSO/MEO <b>satellites</b> during <b>eclipse</b> periods (especially the yaw-maneuver periods). And orbit radial errors of IGSO/MEO satellites in broadcast ephemeris reach 1. 5 ~ 2. 0 m, and exceed 10. 0 cm for that in precise ephemeris. Performance decrease of the GEO <b>satellite</b> orbit during <b>eclipse</b> arcs can hardly be revealed by the orbit radial residual series. During non-eclipse periods, radial accuracy of IGSO/MEO and GEO satellite orbits in broadcast ephemeris are better than 0. 5 m and 0. 9 m respectively.

40|$|The {{four major}} (“Galilean”) {{satellites}} of Jupiter form a miniature Solar System, whose “years ” are measured in days. Astronomers have monitored {{the motions of}} these worlds from Galileo’s time to the present to improve their orbital models and to {{study the effects of}} tides on the movements of Io and Europa. (In order outward from Jupiter, the Galileans are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.) The most accurate ways to measure the positions of these moons are by photographic astrometry with large tele-scopes and by CCD photometry of the eclipses of these bodies by the shadow of Jupiter. The A. L. P. O. program, however, preserves continuity with almost four centuries of visual timings of these eclipses, investigating the sources of error in making visual timings.
