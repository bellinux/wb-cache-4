The model consists of two parts – a grain boundary microchemistry model for calculating the chromium and molybdenum depletion profiles {{in the vicinity of}} grain boundaries and an electrochemical model that relates the repassivation potential to the microchemistry and environmental conditions including temperature and solution chemistry. The grain boundary microchemistry model incorporates a thermodynamic para-equilibrium treatment of the formation of carbides and a kinetic treatment of the diffusion of Cr and Mo. With this model, experimental Cr and Mo depletion profiles can be reproduced for sensitized alloys 600, 825, and 316 L. The repassivation potential model accounts for the effects of solution chemistry and temperature by considering competitive dissolution, adsorption and oxide formation processes at the interface between the metal and the occluded <b>site</b> <b>solution.</b> Using a previously established relationship between the repassivation potential and alloy composition, a procedure has been established to calculate the observable repassivation potential by integrating its local values that reflect the alloy microchemistry in the depletion zone.

40|$|Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of cell growth, {{proliferation and}} metabolism. It possesses an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that interacts with equal affinity with the second messengers PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 and PtdIns(3, 4) P 2, generated through insulin and growth factor-mediated activation of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K). The binding of PKB to PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 /PtdIns(3, 4) P 2 recruits PKB from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and is also thought to induce a conformational change that converts PKB into a substrate that can be activated by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK 1). In this study we describe two high-resolution crystal structures of the PH domain of PKBalpha in a noncomplexed form and compare this to a new atomic resolution (0. 98 A, where 1 A= 0. 1 nm) structure of the PH domain of PKBalpha complexed to Ins(1, 3, 4, 5) P 4, the head group of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3. Remarkably, in contrast to all other PH domains crystallized so far, our data suggest that binding of Ins(1, 3, 4, 5) P 4 to the PH domain of PKB, induces a large conformational change. This is characterized by marked changes in certain residues making up the phosphoinositide-binding site, formation of a short a-helix in variable loop 2, and a movement of variable loop 3 away from the lipid-binding <b>site.</b> <b>Solution</b> studies with CD also provided evidence of conformational changes taking place upon binding of Ins(1, 3, 4, 5) P 4 to the PH domain of PKB.

40|$|Transient {{phosphorylation}} of the cytoplasmic residues of integral membrane proteins is {{a common}} mechanism for the transmission of extracellular signals to intracellular components. The EphA 2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (EphA 2) regulates normal cell growth through maintenance of cell-cell contact mediated signaling. However, EphA 2 is found under-phosphorylated in transformed cell culture, which is correlated with the disruption of normal cell-cell contacts. EphA 2 is the cellular substrate for the Human Cytoplasmic Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (HCPTP), which is found overexpressed in these transformed cell lines. General inhibition of phosphatases in cellular studies has restored EphA 2 phosphorylation state and the cells to a non-transformed phenotype. Thus the selective inhibition of HCPTP presents a novel therapeutic route {{for the treatment of}} metastatic transformation. Initial attempts at inhibitor design have focused on both rationally designed inhibitors, which are based upon a cocrystal structure of a homologous low molecular weight phosphatase from yeast, and in silico screening of small molecule libraries. Low micromolar inhibitors, which are among the most effective small molecule inhibitors reported to date, have been identified and kinetically characterized. Crystallographic experiments were undertaken to provide a detailed atomic description of the binding of small molecules to HCPTP. Cocrystal complexes between HCPTP and small molecules have identified a secondary binding site distant from the active site, which presents the possibility of identifying interactions at either <b>site.</b> <b>Solution</b> state NMR experiments have been used to confirm the presence of this secondary site and attempt to characterize the interactions of the previously identified strong inhibitors with HCPTP. The kinetic results, cocrystallographic structures, and NMR experiments present more robust, dynamic models for micromolar inhibitors of HCPTP that may led to the next generation of potent, selective inhibitors. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{total number}} of mobile {{subscriptions}} has been announced to reach 6 billion in the market, of which 4 billion are individual users. The {{rest of the people}} on earth are potential subscribers that mainly live in rural areas lacking mobile connectivity today. Many of these users {{do not have access to}} electricity and have 6 U. S. dollar per month (USD/month) of average revenue per person.   Referring to the year 2007, the telecommunication industry had a contribution of 0. 6 percent of direct global carbon dioxide (CO 2) or 0. 4 percent of global carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e). From 2007 to 2009, the number of off-grid radio base stations located in rural areas went up from 350, 000 to 500, 000. Nearly all of these sites use diesel generators and large amounts of fossil fuels during the operational stage. In addition the grid sites with diesel back-up were about 0. 5 million in 2009. The financial and environmental consequences of the life cycle impact of the diesel fuel depleted can be significant. Adaptation of renewable energy has therefore become important for both environmental and economic reasons.   In this master thesis a Life Cycle Assessment of Ericsson’s Managed Rural Coverage (MRC) solution was made. Four main life cycle stages were included: manufacturing, transportation, operation and end-of-life treatment. MRC is an off-grid <b>site</b> <b>solution</b> consisting of electronic communication equipment (radio base station, base station controller, hub, cable) photovoltaic cells, battery, antenna, and constructions part (antenna pole, tower and foundation). This study also includes the satellite connection as well as Ericsson and operator activities in the assessment. The MRC distinguishes itself from the conventional base stations, by its significant decrease of energy consumption in its operational stage as well as the business model around the offering. The assessment in this thesis was carried out in accordance with data retrieved from an Ericsson’s pilot system in Dungunab, Sudan. The ISO 1404 X series of LCA standards was followed and Gabi software w used to evaluate the results.   The carbon footprint was found to be 0. 3 kg CO 2 e/subscriber for the pilot setup. These calculations were based on an assumption that each pilot site serviced 1000 users. The maximum number of subscribers can be about 3200, which would decrease the life cycle CO 2 emissions per user by 2 / 3. According to the sensitivity analysis the maximum CO 2 emissions for a conservative MRC scenario is less than 1 kg CO 2 e/subscriber. Although this figure represents a very conservative scenario, the result is low in comparison with an average GSM network which has an approximate carbon footprint of 15 kg CO 2 e/subscriber. It is important to note that the MRC is not intended to replace all conventional macro RBS sites due to limitations in performance and capabilities, but is rather a complement to conventional macro radio base station sites for applicable scenarios.   Thesis registration number: EGI- 2013 - 024 MSC  EKV 941 </p...|$|E
40|$|Presentation, {{peer review}} and public {{discussion}} about the intermediary research output of my Ph. D. TALES FROM THE SUBCONSCIOUS The Hidden Room BLOGGING WITH MYSELF IN WORD[S] … 7 April 2010 : 11. 20 PM GAP ONE: I discovered {{a gap in the}} [my?] lack of direct [embodied] connection with the dimension and the scale of [the site] in the Landscape. Either I did not pay enough attention to it, or I disappeared into the vague cloud of ʻthe unspeakableʼ. Then, I nested myself in this cosy easy unawareness for years. But, little by little, I began to feel uneasy about this: had I done and did I do enough to bridge this gap, this unconforting feeling of: is that all there is in a[n architectural] life? I was pondering for days and weeks and months and years, and gradually, through other people, and especially through [my] cultural mentors, this pondering mutated into conscious reflection, which made me see this gap as something not to simply accept, but as a space that can be bridged. Subsequently, looking back at my own practice, acres of missed Landscape opportunities stretched out vastly behind me. So, the first thing to endeavor was {{to go back to the}} PAST, to clean up unfinished business, starting from that question about the future: what is the projection NOW of the FUTURE architect I want to be in five years. Then I put my favourite pencil on a piece of paper I like, starting to make new sketches and new drawings of a future yet to come close, my right hand moving slowly, sensitively, feeling the measurements of my hand combining in an almost autonomous ritual, through accumulated experience of scale and embodied Landscape both gathered over years of practice and half a liftetime of intense living up till NOW. GAP TWO: But there is another gap to bridge, or are we talking about the same gap here? What are the ways master builders deal with Landscape? What is MY way to deal with Landscape, the small building master I would like to be? Investigating this, what could be my way to deal with the Landscape, the great building master I would like to become in my future practice? And what could this mean for the way to deal with Landscape in future praxis of Making Architecture? 8 April 2010 : 4. 56 PM Designing ʻtales from the Subconscious Oneʼ: GAP THREE: Today I found myself in the middle of nowhere. Feeling alienated from both an embodied connection with the scale and measurements of the Landscape and from the existence of my personal spacial intelligence [Van Schaïk]. So I have to look in both directions, reaching out in the Landscape and measuring both the site and myself, ànd looking inside to trace the eidetic moments in my personal spatial history, going back to my Grandmotherʼs House and a trip to Ostend, on July 14 th 1966. My Grandmother could reveal Tales from the Unconscious through the revelation of spaces up till now hidden safely, while Ostend could bring in the measurement of the pace of walking man, with a conscious step in space over a certain amount of time, introducing embodied measurements of space as a mental awareness in the act of making architecture. 9 April 2010 : 10. 55 AM Pondering hybrid structure: yes or no? I ʻpromisedʼ myself I would make this house completely out of brick. But at some strategic points, I would like to introduce some very visible opposites: thick brick masses only working upon the principle of compression, alternated strategically -both in the spatial and the optical image- with structural elements working on tensile stress. By the principle of contrast these two bearing principles of statics can reinforce one another by the image they provoke, combined with our embodied knowing of opposite forces, and the way we can make them ʻneutraliseʼ each other to obtain a balance in the masses and the sights, resulting in a comforting space-play through readable structural principles. Limiting myself ʻto only brickworkʼ in the design process would lead to a self imposed limitation of spatial potential, so indispensable in what comes hierarchically on top in this house, in which the Tales from the Subconscious prevail. Coming first, they have to be served by the Techné in order to reach Poiesis. So, this option being pondered and being aware of this hierarchy, I can go on. This not only implies a principle for this design, but it could also become a design-principle for future designs. What am I going to do next? Well: itʼs 11. 55 AM now, this consideration has taken some time, and it also kept me awake until 4. 35 AM last night. I might have a sandwich, or I might make some sketches of a steel beam bearing both the brick vault and the light shaft of the living room, and by choosing the steal beam instead of a series of heavy brick arches, I even can disclose the living room and provide it with a longitudinal light shaft, emphasizing the longitudinal spatial characteristic of this space, and by doing so, opening up doors to discover the up till now hidden room, metaphorically, as new space conquered upon the unknown, pre-presuming its existence through my own mental spatial history that feeds my designer intuition. To conclude: this design situation makes me think of Alvaro Sizaʼs Centro Gallego de Arte Contemporaneo in Santiago de Compostela (and in a more direct way, of the simple solution Aldo Rossi aplied to span the window bays in his Berlin appartments), where he introduces an obvious steel beam that bears a huge mass of stone volume. I want to extend this concept into a permanent building <b>site</b> <b>solution,</b> a shoring timber and buttress solution, transscribed in steel as to say out loud: I had to do this, to save the situation from falling down, putting a beam under it, putting a buttress under the beam, and I had no time to waste, so all of it remains in the sight, visibly readable for the users of the building and passers-by in public space, giving access to the lecture of the structure, and by reading the work of gravitation transscribed in the real matter of steel bearing the masses of spanning and vaulting brickwork, being at ease with your own existence while standing with both of your feet in a clay world that will absorb your body one day. Itʼs like reading the structure of a Gothic cathedral during a boring religious ceremony, conducting your own rituals to kill time in a useful way until the priest gives permission to go out in open space. Thank God, the Sun is shining today, so I can feel the light shaft better in my design process. 10 April 2010 : 17. 45 Designing Tales from the Subconscious 1 reveals spaces quite unexpected. This really appears to be the hidden room, a GAP I wanted to bridge since a very long time. On the one hand, I manage to create the ʻhidden roomsʼ by design, by concept, in many ways I could explain by pointing at the drawings. One the other hand, some unexpected opportunities pop up while I investigate the bearing strucutre of the whole. As the cross section reveals, through designing, the necessity to construct buttresses of brick masses becomes obvious [see: cross section, the orthografia layer in the Vectorworks document]. Caused by the volumetric configuration -as the design is growing- these buttress masses themselves form specific intersticed spaces, possibly accessible for walking or storing things. The latter possibility could be applied to form the endless wardrobe, or a hidden cavity to hide during unexpected wartime. I have designed a water well, captured in a water pit, which will be the subject of a separate building mass that will be hooked onto the composition as a whole. The presence of the water pit as a vertical spatiality contrasts with the horizontal stretching of the design in the horizontal ridges in the Landscape. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Summary Small {{business}} {{operating in}} villages usually face {{the problem of}} lack of customers, especially if they offer luxury products. The budget of such companies is often limited and therefore they cannot afford an expensive advertising. The company website {{is one of the}} few solutions that can get customers from outside the rural areas and thus create new business opportunities and increase revenues of such companies. The main goal of the thesis is to attract customers to a company website and thus help small businesses seeking customers in their difficult situation. The theoretical part starts with the basics. It describes what systems are suitable for different kind of web pages and the main part is focused on factors that influence an overall website performance. The second part shows how to achieve the stated goal on an example of a small joinery company Atyp truhlářství Lang. The company is present on the Internet since April, 2009. The work with a real website allows to compare results before and after the changes implementation. The practical part starts with an analysis of the original website. It determines strengths and weaknesses of the web and it provides suggestions for improvement. After this, the academic work deals with the implementation of suitable factors. The final chapter evaluates the original and new version of the site and represents how the made changes are reflected in the site traffic. Keywords Website design, SEO, on-page factors, off-page factors, CMS, Content Management Systems, increase site traffic Objectives and Methodology The main objective of diploma thesis is to increase the website traffic, its attractiveness for customers and thus help small companies located in rural areas to get new clients. The first part helps to achieve the stated goal by dealing with aspects influencing the overall web page performance and also provide basic knowledge related to the website design. Consequently, the sub-objective of this part is an identification of factors that significantly affect the site traffic. The second part aims to apply the gained knowledge on an example web page of small company Atyp truhlářství which faces a problem of a lack of customers. It starts with the analysis of the original website that shows its strangeness and weaknesses. This will provide an information about possible improvements. The part of authors own work aims to implement suitable factors from the theoretical part into the website design. The objective of the final part is to compare the changes made with the original design and determine if the new <b>site</b> <b>solution</b> has really improved the number of visits and its attractiveness for customer. 2 The essential information for the masters thesis elaboration were obtained from an analysis of printed sources as professional books, journals, annual reports and online resources as well. Statistical data reflecting the original website traffic were extracted from MySQL database. The new data about number of visitors were already get in friendlier form of Google Analytics outputs. In addition to that, author also discussed his academic work with website experts and used his own knowledge acquired during the university studies of information technology. Results and Conclusion The website overall performance is greatly influenced by the system on which it operates. For this reason, the literature review provides an overview about Content Management Systems and Static Site Generators. There are explained differences between these two approaches to a website design and are given recommendations about what kind of pages are suitable for each approach. The main part identifies 30 on-page and off-page factors that have a positive or negative impact on the final website traffic. The practical part consists an analysis of the examined site. It discovered the following weaknesses. The positioning is very bad in Search Engine Result Page and it is almost impossible to find the web without an exact knowledge of the company name or its location. Content can be considered as extremely poor with overall 279 words only. There were also two technical issues. The first caused a traffic data loss for the last five years due to exceeding 50 MB of MySQL memory limit. The second was related to plugins deployment that used up the whole PHP memory limit. It resulted in WordPress strong unstability. The website speed test was disastrous. The small page size of 762, 52 kB was loaded for 4, 38 seconds. An acceptable result would be less than 2 seconds. Concerning security, the site did not use secured protocol and the next risk could pose deployed plugins that are frequent targets of hacker attacks. The used template was not mobile-friendly and therefore it was difficult to browse the pages on mobile device. In addition to that the graphical appearance had a low attracting power, it was not able to adequately impress the customers. The site was visited by an average of 25 people a day in 2011. Furthermore, only 63 % of visitors come from the Czech Republic. Unfortunately, more actual data could not be obtained because of the data loss. After considering of all mentioned issues above was proposed a complete website recovery with an implementation of suitable factors from literature review. The examined website is extremely static without a dynamic content and the frequency of updates is relatively low. The web pages are managed by a technical contributor and it is the reason why graphical user interface of CMS is not required. After evaluation of all previous technical, speed and security issues was selected a static site generator for the website design. 3 The important chapter is represented by implementation of suitable factors that should as a complex lead to an increase of a site traffic. First important factor is a content. The original word count of 279 words was improved to 1809 words which is 7 times more than in the past. Before writing the articles, an analysis of relevant terms were made. Those terms are included across the web content. The new articles are meaningful and they provide product details and customer reviews. Moreover, the content is structured, there are 9 unordered lists included and main titles are differentiated by importance. Each page has internal links to other subpages. The text clarity and an inclusion of relevant terms are equal to a better rank of a page. The number of images has decreased from 112 original images to selected 42 images on the new website. This is because of a very bad image quality of most old pictures. The high quality images can cause customer interest for the product, higher time on site and lower bounce rate. Meta descriptions were implemented individually for each web page with regard to the page content. The new website was accepted by a certification authority (CA) and the unsecured Hypertext Transfer Protocol was replaced by Secured Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS). It means the site is trustable and secure for browsing. There are no plugins used and therefore an attack risk is much lower. The template was tested on 17 screen resolutions. All tests were successful and the site is fully responsive. Almost 33 % of customers use some mobile device to browse a web. The current web eliminates the loss of visitors coming from mobile devices. Furthermore, Google officially announced that secured and responsive websites get priority. The site speed test had two rounds. The first test can be considered as very good. The page load time was 842 ms and overall page size was 1. 1. MB. Nevertheless, after the compression of large files the site became even faster. The page size decreased by 30 % to 771, 6 kB and the final load time speed up by 31 % to 580 ms. Currently, the website is faster than 96 % of all tested domains which is a perfect score. The adjusted site speed is 7, 5 times faster than the original speed. No flash, advertisement or other disruptive elements are available on the web. The web page is newly available on Google+, Pinterest and Twitter. These factors are able to boost direct page traffic. The design is clean and simple just to avoid leaving customers confused. The readability is also very good. Combination of black/blue text on the white background or white text on the black/blue background doesnt cause any readability issues. Social buttons and a quick company contact is present on each page in header and footer section. Another change was made in traffic measurement. The website started to use Google Analytics for tracking visitors. The actual traffic data are more accurate and the possibility of data loss is reduced. The main goal of diploma thesis was to improve the website traffic. The web page was measured from 01. 12. 2015 to 29. 02. 2016. The average site traffic was 23, 0 visits a day in December 2015. This number reflects the original site traffic which was around 25 visits a day with a decrease of 8 %. The biggest change in traffic development was found between 08. 01. 2016 to 13. 01. 2016 when the average site traffic was 77, 2 visits a day. Those changes are explained by an influence of social media. Author has written a post about Atyp truhlářství on Facebook on 8 th January 2016. The post was shared by 8 people and it attracted many people to visit the website. 4 From January 14 th to the end of the month, the average daily traffic was 32, 3 visits. The last month was noted slightly higher traffic of 32, 6 visits a day. The comparison of data from December 2015 and from February 2016 shows a visible increase in number of visits in February 2016 where the traffic was higher by 41, 7 %. There is a positive increasing trend in a number of visits since the beginning of December 2015. Moreover, majority of visitors 81, 3 % come from the Czech Republic and it is a better result than by the original web pages with 62 % only. The recovery of a small joinery website atyptruhlarstvi. cz was successful. It improved the website traffic and many other aspects as content, speed, security, responsiveness, social media etc. The web design itself and implemented factors can be considered as crucial elements that influence the final number of visits. For this reason, the made changes on a web page can really help small business in rural areas to get new customers. There were also identified factors that affect an overall website performance with an emphasis on a positive site traffic development. An overview about different website design approaches is provided as well. References SEARCHMETRICS. Search Ranking Factors and Rank Correlations: Understand how the deck is stacked [online].

An important aspect in obtaining insight into hydrogen induced embrittlement on the atomistic level is to understand the diffusion of hydrogen in these materials. In our study we employ kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to investigate hydrogen diffusion in bcc iron within different microstructures. All input data to the kMC model, such as available <b>sites,</b> <b>solution</b> energies, and diffusion barriers are obtained from first-principles calculations. We find that hydrogen mainly diffuses within the interface region with an overall diffusivity that is lower than in pure bcc-Fe bulk. The concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient is strongly non-linear and the diffusion coefficient may even decrease with increasing hydrogen concentration. To describe the macroscopic diffusion coefficient we derive an analytic expression as a function of hydrogen concentration and temperature which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results for idealised microstructures...|$|R
