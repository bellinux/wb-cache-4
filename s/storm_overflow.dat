40|$|Several EU Directives {{have been}} adopted which have an {{influence}} on the control of urban pollution in particular the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment and the Integrated Pollution Control and Prevention Directive. In addition, the recently adopted Water Framework Directive (WFD) will have an additional impact on the control of urban pollution in particular related to storm overflows. The present paper provides a brief discussion of the EU legislation relevant to the control of urban pollution with special emphasis on the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) and its implementation in the Member States. The recently adopted WFD requires the achievement of good ecological and chemical status in all waters. The implementation of the UWWTD by the Member States, which should be achieved by 2005, will make a significant contribution towards achieving good ecological and chemical status. However, besides the discharge of sewage effluents, storm overflows can {{have a significant impact}} on the quality of surface waters and they will therefore require adequate control in order to achieve the final goal of good ecological and chemical status. The paper, therefore, also provides a brief analysis of the permitting requirements in the different countries and of the criteria currently applied by the EU Member States for the design of combined sewer overflow systems. Not all countries currently require a permit for storm overflows and the design criteria for combined sewer overflows are generally based on the spill frequency or treatment capacity in terms of dry weather flow, which do not take into account the effect on the receiving water. However, in the UK a method has been developed to assess the impact of combined sewer overflows on the quality of the receiving water, which is being applied to ensure the design of the <b>storm</b> <b>overflow</b> is adequate for the protection of the receiving water. Member States will need to adapt their methodologies used for the design of <b>storm</b> <b>overflow</b> to ensure the requirements of the WFD, the achievement of good ecological and chemical water quality, is being met. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{cost for}} nonpoint source in urban area tends to {{increase}} as it's distanced farther from the pollution source. Thus it's more effective {{to dispose of the}} pollution at the pollution source. It becomes more difficult when nonpoint source is flowed into the surface water by stormwater. In case of combined sewer, increasing stormwater on impermeable surface causes the Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) containing the high level of pollutants which runs into the water system through the <b>storm</b> <b>overflow</b> diverging tank without treatment process. A huge amount of CSOs is generated instantly and as it carries the pollutants on impermeable surface as well as the deposits in sewage pipe, it's necessary to develop the technology for treatment of CSOs. This study was intended to develop the solid fabric filter which will be suitable for treatment of CSOs and the characteristic and performance of solid fabric filter were evaluated...|$|E

Although some sites suffered from varying degrees of sludge accumulation, surface blinding and/or weed growth, all effluent concentrations remained far below the consent levels. Thorough operational maintenance on a reed bed is proven to be important for the asset life.

40|$|Field {{surveys were}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects}} of sewage contamination from <b>storm</b> <b>overflow</b> effluent on faecal coliform and Escherichia coli concentrations in the flesh of wild mussels (Mytilus edulis). Bags containing 30 mussels each were fixed at known inter-tidal locations and retrieved at intervals following discharge from a nearby combined sewer overflow (CSO). Concentrations of faecal coliform bacteria and E. coli were measured in the shellfish flesh and in samples of overlying water prior to collection of the mussel samples. Faecal coliform and E. coli concentrations in shellfish increased rapidly after CSO discharge. E. coli concentrations exceeded the European shellfish hygiene class C limit of 46, 000 100 g? 1, and decayed during subsequent CSO discharge-free periods. The concentration and depuration response was independent of the magnitude of CSO spill volume. First-order exponential decay functions were fitted to the data. Decay rates were lower than those found in corresponding microcosm experiments. This relates to the repeated pattern of inundation and exposure associated with the tidal cycles in the estuary. Relationships between E. coli and faecal coliform concentrations in the shellfish and overlying water samples were relatively weak (r< 0. 60), a pattern often seen with data from uncontrolled environmental experiments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel multi-objective evolutionary optimization approach for the active control of intermittent unsatisfactory discharges from combined sewer systems. The procedure proposed considers the unsteady flows {{and water quality}} in the sewers together with the wastewater treatment costs. The distinction between the portion of wastewater that receives full secondary treatment and the overall capacity of the wastewater treatment works (including <b>storm</b> <b>overflow</b> tanks) is addressed. Temporal and spatial variations in the concentrations of the primary contaminants are incorporated also. The formulation is different from previous approaches in the literature in {{that in addition to}} the wastewater treatment cost we consider at once the relative polluting effects of the various primary contaminants in wastewater. This is achieved by incorporating a measure of the overall pollution called the effluent quality index. The differences between two diametrically opposed control objectives are illustrated, i. e. the minimization of the pollution of the receiving water or, alternatively, the minimization of the wastewater treatment cost. Results are included for a realistic interceptor sewer system that show that the combination of a multi-objective genetic algorithm and a stormwater management model is effective. The genetic algorithm achieved consistently the frontier optimal control settings that, in turn, revealed the trade-offs between the wastewater treatment cost and pollution of the receiving water...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model {{is used to}} assess the bathing water quality of Bray and Killiney bathing sites in Ireland following changes to the sewage management system. The model, firstly calibrated to hydrodynamic and water quality data from the period prior to the upgrade of the Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW), was then used to simulate Escherichia coli (E. coli) distributions for discharge scenarios of the periods prior to and following the upgrade of the WwTW under dry and wet weather conditions. E. coli distributions under dry weather conditions demonstrate that the upgrade in the WwTW has remarkably improved the bathing water quality to a Blue Flag status. The new discharge strategy is expected to drastically reduce the rainfall-related incidents in which environmental limits of the Bathing Water Directive are breached. However, exceedances to these limits may still occur under wet weather conditions at Bray bathing site due to <b>storm</b> <b>overflows</b> that may still be discharged through two sea outfalls offshore of Bray bathing site...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the use of}} biomarkers to assess sub-lethal effects of pollutants alongside a standard toxicity test and sediment analysis within a harbour environment predominantly affected by TBT and PAHs, in Aberdeen, NE Scotland. Analysis of sediment sampled twice yearly showed few clear trends for metals, TBT or PAHs over a 8 year period from 1997 - 2005. At one sample site, (29) PAHs were seen to increase during the study period. This could potentially {{be linked to the}} Denburn <b>storm</b> <b>overflow,</b> which can release untreated waste water during periods of prolonged heavy rain. Levels of contamination were highest at sample sites located within the inner harbour, sites where sediment would accumulate and tidal flushing would be less effective at redistributing contaminants. The Corophium bioassay was used to assess temporal and spatial variation in the toxicity of harbour sediment. Significant differences were seen between sample sites located in the inner harbour areas and control sediment. In most cases, mortality did not correlate to any one individual contaminant, however when mortality was relatively low, correlations were seen with heavy metals such as Pb, Cd and Cr. A seasonal fluctuation in toxicity was evident at sample site 29, which could relate to seasonal fluctuations in water quality due to the Denburn overflow, since metals such as zinc also followed a seasonal fluctuation. By 2005, no sample sites showed a significant increase in mortality when compared to controls. At 7 sample sites, a significant improvement in Corophium survival was seen during the study period, which strongly suggests that bioavailable levels of contaminants are decreasing. Intersex in L. littorea was assessed on an annual basis to monitor the effects of TBT within the harbour. Again, a significant difference was found between the inner harbour and a control site, whilst intersex levels in the outer harbour area were comparable to the control site. At the inner harbour site, levels of intersex were sufficient to reduce reproductive capability individual periwinkles, but would not affect reproduction rates at the population level. Intersex ISI values suggest that water within Aberdeen harbour does not yet meet the UK EOS of 2 ngl - 1. Again, a decrease in the degree of intersex was seen during the study period, this was not statistically significant, yet may indicate that the level of bioavailability pollutants is decreasing.

40|$|Le {{comportement}} hydraulique des déversoirs d’orage latéraux est le plus souvent marqué par une évolution discontinue de la ligne d’eau caractérisée par le ressaut hydraulique (Torrentiel/fluvial) et, dans certains cas, par une évolution rapidement variée causée par un écoulement également transcritique mais dans le sens fluvial/Torrentiel. Concernant les modèles actuels, ils ne permettent pas de simuler le comportement en transitoire de ce type d’ouvrage. Compte tenu de cela, nous avons modélisé l’ouvrage par les équations de Barré de Saint Venant écrite sous forme conservative en régime transitoire et couplée au modèle de déversoir de Hager. Le caractère conservatif de ces équations {{permet de}} transcrire dans un seul système d’équations les écoulements graduellement et rapidement variés. Afin de résoudre ces équations, nous avons utilisé le schéma numérique UPWIND à « capture de choc » du second ordre du type TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) utilisant le solveur de Roe. Dans l’objectif de valider notre démarche, nous avons créé un pilote de déversoir d’orage sur le site d’Obernai (laboratoire d'hydraulique du lycée agricole). Nous avons fait varier : le diamètre de la conduite aval par rapport au diamètre de la conduite amont, la longueur du déversoir, les pentes des conduites amont et aval ainsi que la hauteur de crête. La comparaison des débits déversés entre les modèles physique et numérique a montré que l’erreur observée rapportée au débit amont n’excédait jamais 13 % avec une majorité des cas entre ± 5 %. In recent years, French and European legislation has introduced regulations about wastewater discharge into natural environments and particularly about combined sewer overflows. As a consequence, {{it has become}} essential to control the hydraulic behaviour of these structures and to estimate the pollution loads released at this level. The side weir is the regulation structure that permits the hydraulic regulation of the waste water carried by the sewer system. When the upstream flow intensity exceeds a value referred to as reference flow, the side weir directly rejects part of the waste water to the natural environment. The hydraulic behaviour of the sewer side weir was shown to involve a discontinuous evolution of the water depth, characterized by a hydraulic jump (transition from supercritical to subcritical flow) and also by a rapidly varying transcritical evolution (subcritical to supercritical). Initially, the side weir flow was determined {{with the use of}} empirical relations. Using formulae of Engels, Coleman and Smith, Balmaceda and Gonzales or Dominguez, it was possible to calculate the outflow according to the water level at the upstream and/or the downstream region of the weir. These relations were applicable only for certain flow regimes and in certain cases in which the geometry of the side weir was specified. Subsequently, a more physical approach, initiated by Ackers, was based on the assumption of constant energy along the side weir. This approach made it possible to focus not only on an assessment of the side channel flow, but also on the water profile at the crest. Unfortunately, as the study of El Kashab shows, this method falls short in certain cases because the equations are inappropriate. For example, in the case of hydraulics the constant energy approach was not applicable. Finally, the method that is currently used is based on a momentum equation, which makes it possible to establish equations for shallow water. This approach seemed the most appropriate {{in the case of the}} side weir. The numerical solution of these equations was always based on an algorithm that describes all the possible cases according to the flow regime and the hydraulic conditions in the side weir. One must know the flow regime a priori. These models don’t properly simulate the transitory behaviour of these kinds of works. In this article we propose hydraulic modelling of a sewer side weir that integrates the geometrical characteristics of the flow (height and length of the crest, variation of width along the crest), and avoids the need for a priori knowledge of flow conditions in the side weir. The model also takes into account hydraulic discontinuities (hydraulic jump, transitions from free surface to pressurised flow) and the transitory character of the flow. The numerical results were compared with measured values obtained from a test bench. For the 1 D approach, the solution was found using the 1 D shallow water equations written in a conservative form for a transitory situation. The conservative characters of the equations permit us to consider gradually and rapidly varied flows in a single system of equations. In order to account for the lateral overflow, we used the Hager relation, which involves the intensity and direction of the lateral velocity vector and also the influence of width variation of the side weir. The shallow water equations system couldn’t be analytically solved. As a consequence, numerous numerical methods have been developed such as characteristic methods or finite difference methods. Unfortunately, these methods are inadequate when discontinuities such as hydraulic jumps or flow regime transitions (froude number close to 1) appear. To solve these problems, numerical (shock capturing) schemes were developed, based on a finite volume formulation. Godunov was the initiator of this type of finite volume numerical scheme. Eleuterio improved the precision and the ability of these numerical schemes to converge. The result was a combination of total variation diminishing (TVD) interpolation with an appropriate Riemann solver. We used a second order TVD Upwind shock capturing numerical method associated with the Roe Riemann solver. In order to validate the numerical model, we have built a sewer side weir physical test bench at the Obernai site. The variable parameters were the downstream pipe diameter in comparison with the upstream pipe diameter, the side weir length, slopes of the upstream and downstream pipes and the height of the crest. The tested cases permitted us to sweep a slope ranging from 0. 5 ‰ to 1 % for the upstream and downstream pipes. Globally, 114 configurations have been tested with the 1 D numerical model. The operating curve represents a criterion for characterising the operating of the <b>storm</b> <b>overflow.</b> As long as the upstream flow does not reach the reference value, there is no overflow. As soon as the upstream flow exceeds the value, the downstream flow remains close to the reference value. Because comparisons were made in relation with the upstream flow, the criterion used for judging the modelling performance was the absolute error value in relation to the upstream flow. It is important to note that the results need to be weighted as experimental measurements have a margin of error of approximately 5 %. Comparisons between numerical and experimental results permit the following conclusions: 1. The distribution of the number of errors was very close to the normal Gaussian distribution curve, with a slight shift towards the positive side. This indicates that the errors were random and therefore very close to experimental values. 2. In general, the maximum errors varied from - 10 to 13 %, with the majority of cases occurring between – 5 and + 5 %. This shows that the performance of the tool was very useful in cases that are as complex as side weirs. However, the model has a slight tendency to overestimate the overflow rate as compared to experimental measurements...|$|E
